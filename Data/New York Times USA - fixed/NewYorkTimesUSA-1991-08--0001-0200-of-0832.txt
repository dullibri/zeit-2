BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BLOOMINGTON, Minn., July 31

 BODY:
The Control Data Corporation said today that its earnings fell 47 percent in the second quarter because of the weak economy and lower demand for computer products. The computer services company earned $5.9 million, or 14 cents a share, in the three months that ended on June 30, compared with $11.2 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Its revenues fell 8.5 percent, to $371.3 million from $405.6 million. Results a year ago included revenues and losses from several operations that have since been sold or discontinued, as well as a pretax gain of $4.3 million.

Media General Forecast

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: RICHMOND, July 31

 BODY:
Media General Inc. said today that it would probably post a third-quarter loss because of the poor performance of an affiliate. The company attributed the projected decline to losses sustained in the second quarter by the Garden State Newspapers Company, which owns 14 daily newspapers and several weeklies. Media General owns 40 percent of Garden State Newspapers. The affiliate's operations in northern New Jersey in particular have felt the brunt of the recession, Media General said. In the third quarter of last year, Media General earned $7.3 million, or 28 cents a share, on revenues of $152 million. Its third quarter ends on Sept. 30.

Slowing Is Reported In Pace of Job Loss

DATELINE: MANHATTAN

 BODY:
Although the New York City region lost 90,000 jobs in the first half of this year, the pace of that job loss is slowing, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the last half of 1990, job losses in the 23 counties in New York and northeastern New Jersey amounted to 116,000.
"We're beginning to see the first glimmer of light," Mr. Ehrenhalt said yesterday. He cautioned that it was "no more than a flickering candle in a long, dark tunnel," but he called it significant because it was the first such sign in two years and came as the pace of job losses at the national level was continuing to mount. 
 The industries in which job losses showed signs of abating were trade, manufacturing, finance, insurance and real estate. But in the services sector, which has been one of the only areas of employment growth over the last two years, the growth came to a virtual halt.
Government jobs were down by 20,000, the largest decline in 15 years. Mr. Ehrenhalt said those job losses were concentrated in the Federal and state work forces and did not reflect the recent layoffs of city workers.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Broad Decline On Concern Over Recovery

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell broadly in light trading yesterday after two economic reports failed to ease worries about the durability of the United States recovery.
The dollar, after falling in overseas trading, continued to slide when the Government's main economic barometer, the index of leading indicators, showed a less-than-expected rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in June. It was the fifth straight increase for the index, but only 5 of the 11 forward-looking elements advanced. 
 An accompanying report said American factory orders fell 1.4 percent, breaking a two-month advance.
The numbers were disappointing to dollar traders because reports of economic weakess tend to hurt the currency by raising the possibility that lower interest rates will be needed to stimulate growth. Lower United States interest rates make dollar-denominated investments worth less.
"People were looking for further indications that the U.S. economy had bottomed out and was back on the upswing, and today's numbers didn't give an indication either way," said Bob Morrissey, senior trader for the Bank of Boston.
 
Jobless Data Awaited
 The numbers raised fears that a report on July employment, to be released on Friday, might be equally disappointing and bolster concerns that the recovery might be stalling.
In New York, the dollar fell to 137.36 yen from 137.90 yen on Tuesday. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 137.83 yen, unchanged from Tuesday. Later, in London, the dollar finished at 137.40 yen.
The dollar also fell against the British pound. Sterling settled at $1.6860 in New York, compared with $1.6770 on Thursday. In London, the pound rose to $1.6845, from $1.6810 late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, were: 1.7440 German marks, down from 1.7535; 1.5233 Swiss francs, down from 1.5308; 5.9310 French francs, down from 5.9640; 1,302.00 Italian lire, down from 1,310.00, and 1.15125 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15225.

HEADLINE: Indicators Up 0.5% for Fifth Straight Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
The Government's main economic barometer, released today, continues to point toward recovery, but analysts said an accompanying report on slumping factory orders illustrated the sluggish, choppy nature of the turnaround.
The Commerce Department said its index of leading indicators rose five-tenths of a percent in June, its fifth straight increase, despite drops in several components, including factory orders for consumer goods. In a separate report the department said orders to factories fell 1.4 percent, breaking a two-month advance. 
 The string of gains in the leading indicators "pretty much confirms that the recovery began in the second quarter," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
 
5 of 11 Indicators Post Gains
 Still, only 5 of the 11 forward-looking indicators posted gains. One was virtually unchanged.
"The increases are less than we've been accustomed to in a recovery, but we've been saying it will be a weaker recovery than average," said Robert G. Dederick, economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
The Bush Administration and many private analysts project that the economy will grow about 2.5 percent to 3 percent for the rest of the year, compared with a 6 percent average growth rate in the other eight recoveries since World War II.
But some analysts express concern the economy could even dip back into recession after a period of growth.
Mr. Sung, for instance, said: "The probability of a double-dip recession is not exactly negligible. If anything, it is increasing."
Richard Rahn, an economist with the United States Chamber of Commerce, also contended the revival could be short-lived.
"At best, the numbers support a rate of economic growth of only about 1 percent -- hardly fitting anyone's notion of a significant recovery," he said.
Since the end of World War II, five of the eight recessions have experienced the double dip, in which the economy expanded for a quarter before resuming its contraction.
Still, Mr. Dederick, speaking of the drop in factory orders, said, "Such decreases are not uncommon in the opening stages of a recovery."
Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York, said that whenever the leading indicators performed similarly coming out of previous recessions, "it's been pretty much clear sailing."
 
6 to 9 Months Ahead
 The leading indicators are intended to forecast economic activity six to nine months ahead. The biggest contributor to the index growth in June was a longer average workweek.
Other positive factors were an index measuring consumer confidence, a drop in initial weekly unemployment claims, an increase in building permits and longer delivery times, indicating a pickup in orders.
Another indicator, stock prices, increased slightly, but its contribution rounded to zero, the department said.
Indicators with negative readings were a decline in factory orders for consumer goods, fewer unfilled factory orders, a drop in the money supply, a decrease in prices for raw materials indicating lagging demand and a drop in orders for new plants and equipment.
The various changes left the index at 143.6 percent of its 1982 base of 100. Although the index has fallen 1.8 percent from June 1990, it has risen 3 percent in the last six months.

HEADLINE: STATE DEPT. BACKS PERU AID PACKAGE

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
After months of internal debate, the Administration has determined that Peru has improved its lackluster performance on human rights enough to release $94 million in aid, largely intended to combat the cultivation of narcotic coca plants, State Department officials said today.
The move immediately drew strong condemnation in Congress and among human rights groups who asserted that the Peruvian Army had the worst record of summary executions, disappearances and torture of any military in Latin America. 
 Senator Patrick J. Leahy, chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, immediately announced his intention to block the Administration's move.
Administration officials did not dispute that the Peruvian Army continued to violate human rights, but they noted that Lima deserved special consideration given that it is under siege from drug lords, a cholera epidemic and the most violent guerrilla movement in the hemisphere. They also said that as long as Peru is the source of 60 percent of the cocaine imported into the United States, Washington must try to develop growing cooperation with the Government in eradicating coca plants.
 
Human Rights Factor
 "This was a difficult decision for everybody," said a State Department official who monitors Peru. "We're very concerned about continuing problems there and we've made it clear to the Peruvians that we expect further progress in human rights and counternarcotics."
Under the International Narcotics Control Act, the Administration cannot provide anti-drug funding to the four Andean governments until it issues a determination to Congress that they have gained effective control over their police and armed forces to improve their human rights conduct.
The Administration determined in January that Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador fulfilled the criteria, but it delayed its decision on Peru until late Tuesday because of persistent reports that the army was repressing peasants while protecting coca planters.
In the formal determination, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger wrote that Peru deserved military and economic aid because it had provided wider access to international human rights monitors, purged the security forces of many implicated in abuses, and "virtually eliminated" paramilitary activity.
 
$34 Million in Military Aid
 Juan Mendez, executive director of the human rights group Americas Watch, disputed the decision, asserting that the army and police still "commit egregious human rights violations on a systematic basis."
Peru stands to gain $34 million in military aid, much of which would go for helicopters and helicopter training that police and army units could use to eradicate coca plants that grow through much of the Andes.
The $60 million in economic aid would be earmarked for balance of payments relief and projects intended to give farmers who grow coca plants alternative sources of income. Congressional foreign policy and appropriations committees have 15 days to object to the Administration determination in order to block the disbursement.
Saying the decision "flies in the face of every international human rights group," Senator Leahy said he would put a hold on the disbursement. One of his aides that under Senate procedures, he could negotiate a compromise under which some of the money would be withheld. The Senator is to meet with Administration officials on Thursday.
The Administration made its determination after a three-day trip to Peru three weeks ago by Richard Shifter, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, in which he consulted with Persident Alberto Fujimori and senior military officers. Mr. Shifter won promises from the officials that they would reform the military and civilian judicial systems and extend human rights training within the police and armed forces.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MOSCOW;
Bush-Gorbachev Comments: Specific Spheres of Cooperation

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 31

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the news conference held today by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, as translated by his interpreter, and President Bush:
 
OPENING STATEMENTS
 GORBACHEV: We see the official visit of the President of the United States to the Soviet Union as a big event in our relations, as a really global event.
And I want to say that these days we have done a great deal of work which I think will create difficulties for me and the President in order to present it in condensed form. 
 Nevertheless, this visit, to some extent, sums up the last stage of our cooperation at a very fundamental, dramatic, time of developing of events in the world when both the President of the United States of America and the Soviet Union were placed in very difficult circumstances, unusual ones which demanded from them great feeling of responsibility in taking very important decisions, which have had consequences and will have consequences in the further development of our cooperation in events in the world. . . .
The President showed great interest in the events taking place in our country, our domestic processes. I tried to satisfy his interest and did this on my part with a great deal of satisfaction since in his interest I felt a desire to understand even more of what is going on in our country and moreover I felt also a feeling of solidarity in this.
We had an interesting, substantive discussion, and perhaps for the first time, it covered the following in our bilateral cooperation. For the first time over the past period we probably accented rather strongly what our economic relationships should be like, how we have to work together in this important sphere so that relationships in this area would be appropriate to the international dialogue which we have reached in other areas.
And here we have noted on the basis of neutral understanding, if not, President Bush will say so, that there must be movements in accommodation as well. Obviously one can do a lot in the area of reform so that we can include ourselves in international economic ties, to play by the rules of the game -- like this expression, I haven't invented any other one for the time being. That's why I use the term I'm familiar with.
 
Soviet Revisions
 We have to do a great deal, and we have made our choice to continue reforms, democratic changes, and especially now to move decisively forward to the market relationship, the relationship of property.
It is clear that our success in these internal affairs is tied to a great extent to the process of reform in the federation, and I hope that I have satisfied the interests of the President about the state of this as of today. We both understand that this is very important for the success of our work. And thus, we must change, we must understand and well understand here in the Soviet Union that the basic responsibility for the fate of this country, for reforms, for the making of decisions which are very important, is our prerogative, our responsibility.
And obviously, we are very interested in a more fruitful cooperation with the countries of the West and in the light of continuing the discussion which we had in London, within the framework of my meeting at the G-7, we spoke also about this subject, as well, and I tried to develop the thesis which I expressed in London, that we hoped to see accommodating movement of the Western countries because they, too, in their approaches in a spirit of economic cooperation must accommodate us. . . .
For the first time we talked substantially about specific spheres of cooperation in implementing certain projects on the basis of bilateral cooperation.
To speak about this briefly, we spoke about cooperating in the field of energy, especially in the area of conversion. We have great possibilities here. And specifically in a sphere in which we are very interested, that is, the agricultural sphere, especially food distribution.
In this regard, I transmitted certain materials to the President as in an aide-memoire. The same was done by the Foreign Minister. Comrade Bessmertnykh gave this to the Secretary of State, Mr. Baker, an aide-memoire about those projects in which we could cooperate fruitfully. This is a very interesting and substantive project. We would want to act in such a way that in implementing these projects, in all of them, to give a possibility to each other to earn money. Otherwise, the process won't go forward unless there is benefit of it.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Then the President and I thought about the following. And what do we do next? We've signed the treaty and what next? We've congratulated each other and our peoples and the world with the fact that such great progress has been accomplished. And as a result of almost a decade of work, and what next?
 
Disarmament Issues
 And we did not want simply to be pragmatists here. We wanted to look at the problem of security, stability from the point of view of the present-day realities, or should we simply continue the negotiations which are already taking place, and there are many problems which still need to be discussed? Or should we also look at the world from a somewhat different position, from today's heights, with the new reality which exists? . . .
Nevertheless, we also examined very many specific issues of disarmament without -- we did not leave unattended problems of the Middle East. And I must say, and if the President considers it appropriate he could name certain things, and if you have questions, we could discuss this. We have worked out a joint document on this. I have in mind our position, our common position with regard to the Middle East.
I think that this is a very important result of our joint work and I think that the fact that this position will be publicly announced will have serious influence on this process, and we consider that it is in a decisive stage and we should not, and here I want to use what our ministers use, to have a window of opportunity, in order to really achieve progress in this very sensitive area of international politics.
The President and I talked about the situation in Europe in the context of implementing the agreement, the Helsinki agreements, the Paris charter, and especially with regard to the processes taking place in that region, and specifically noted the situation in Yugoslavia, and expressed our position, our understanding, approach to the resolution of this issue, a very serious one, which worries many of us -- also in a joint statement we expressed this.
I must say that we also moved forward and discussed other things. We tried to also look at many global processes.

 	 	 		. . .	 	And thus I want to ask the pardon of the President and the press. I am the host, and I have maybe misused it, but perhaps I could listen to your comments as well -- I'm speaking so much.
I understood that you were almost in agreement.
BUSH: What I heard I liked.
GORBACHEV: Thank you for being honest.
BUSH: Once again -- this might be an appropriate time for Barbara and me to thank the President and Mrs. Gorbachev for this fantastic hospitality. And yes, I couldn't agree more about the productive nature of the talks, the enhancement of mutual understanding. This is not diplomatic language, in my view, this is fact.
You know my views on the Start agreement. Indeed, it's the culmination of a long and historic negotiation, and I happen to believe that the winners on this are the young people, not just in the Soviet Union, not just in the United States but all around the world.
And we are taking major steps in transforming our economic relations. President Gorbachev touched on some of this, but we're going to send up the trade agreement to the U.S. Congress. We're going to grant most-favored-nation status, now that the technicalities have been worked out. We have fulfilled thus our Malta goal, Mr. President, of normalizing our economic relationship.
We agreed here to tackle the next challenge. President Gorbachev talked about that -- furthering economic reform in the U.S.S.R., and seeking to integrate the Soviet economy into the international system.
 
Points of Cooperation
 We're going forward with space cooperation, cooperation in the environment, and we have several joint projects in mind there. Building on our historic cooperation during the gulf crisis, discussed, the President and I discussed our partnership in resolving longstanding regional programs. As mentioned, they're putting out statements on Yugoslavia, Central America. And indeed, I want to comment now just briefly on the Middle East before taking your questions.
We did reaffirm our mutual commitment to promote peace and genuine reconciliation between the Arab states, Israel and the Palestinians. And we believe there is a historic opportunity right now to launch a process that can lead to a just and enduring peace and to a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East.
We share the strong conviction that this historic opportunity must not be lost. And while recognizing that peace cannot be imposed, it can only result from direct negotiations between the parties, the United States and the Soviet Union pledged to do their utmost to promote and sustain the peacemaking process.
And to that end, the United States and the Soviet Union, acting as co-sponsors, are going to work to convene an October press conference designed to launch bilateral and multilateral negotiations. Invitations to the conference will be issued at least 10 days prior to the date the conference is to convene. And in the interim, Secretary Baker and Foreign Minister Bessmertnykh will continue to work with the parties to prepare for this conference. And I am today asking Secretary of State Jim Baker to return to the Middle East to obtain Israel's answer to our proposal for peace.
And again, my thanks to you, and I'll be prepared to take questions, along with you, sir.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. One question to Comrade Gorbachev. You said that you talked with Mr. Bush about Yugoslavia. What is the essence of that conversation about Yugoslavia? . . .
A. The essence of the conversation. I will then make use of the fact that I will relate the content of the U.S.-Soviet statement on Yugoslavia. This is the result of our conversation on this subject.
We, both countries, with deep concern, have noted the dramatic development of events in Yugoslavia. This is a translation from the Russian. And we have been against the use of force and call upon all sides to abide by the agreements on cease-fire.
We, the Soviet Union and the U.S., proceed from the premise that the resolution of issues must be found by the peoples of Yugoslavia themselves on the basis of democratic principles, through peaceful negotiations and constructive approaches.
We emphasized the necessity of having all sides respect the basic principles indicated in the Helsinki Act and the Paris Charter. The U.S. and the U.S.S.R. support the efforts undertaken by the C.S.C.E. countries, specifically the European Community, steps to resolve the problem. This is the essence of the statement.
BUSH: And I would only add, sir, that inasmuch as that was a joint statement, that expresses our continued position as well.
 
Israeli Stance on Talks
 Q. President Bush, could I ask you -- the fact that you're going ahead with this peace conference, does that mean that you have Israel's acceptance of the outlines of your conditions for a peace conference, or is there still a hang-up, or have you got a commitment from Mr. Shamir?
BUSH: Well, I would wait and let Secretary Baker answer that question after this next meeting. If I had to express a degree of optimism or pessimism, I'd say I'm a little more optimistic today. But the visit for Jim Baker now is, for what we said here, to obtain Israel's answer to our proposal for peace. And if I had the answer in my pocket, or he did, I expect that we would say so.
 
A Future Meeting
 Q. (through interpreter) I have a question to both Presidents. You discussed many questions of international issues, bilateral issues. You signed a unique agreement today. What did you leave for the next meeting, and can we say when you're planning to have it?
GORBACHEV: You know, I think that what we discussed today and what we have set in motion, both with regard to a political dialogue and a continuation of the disarmament process and new subjects in the area of economic cooperation and trade, interaction in the resolution of important issues, including regional conflicts, which unfortunately still take place, and especially since we have begun a significant discussion about the concept of future strategic stability, that means that we have many issues to discuss for many meetings ahead. So I think that our contacts will continue. But I would express myself in favor of the following.
Perhaps not always can we go, and this makes the positions of the Presidents very specific, that it's harder for them than for the Ministers of Foreign Affairs to unravel and discuss issues of foreign affairs. But nevertheless the President and I have developed a method of conversation. We exchange opinions by telephone. As soon as we have a need, concerns, or simply to exchange something -- opinions about something important -- we do this by telephone, and this takes place on a regular basis.
And, secondly, we regularly exchange letters. And this exchange of opinions has not ceased even in recent days when we have already reached agreement with the President, we were expecting him here. . . .
BUSH: I would only add to that that though no date is set, it is my view -- and I haven't always held this view -- that a meeting without an agenda is a good idea from time to time between the Soviet President and the President of the United States.
And with this -- President Gorbachev talked about arms control and regional problems and other problems -- but as this dynamic economy begins to move, the chance for a dynamic economy here, there's going to be much more to talk about on the economic side than we've ever had before -- cooperation, partnerships, joint ventures, the whole approach to economics that he has endorsed that is going to benefit I believe the Soviet Union and I think has enormous potential for the United States.
So it is my view that we have got plenty to talk about, and I for one would be prepared, as I've stated before, to have a meeting where there is not a crisis out there to be managed. Rather we can be sure that we're not two ships passing in the night -- the analogy I used I believe in Malta, appropriately -- and I look forward to future meetings.
Because you get a lot done where you can't put out -- sign a 3-point program or a 20-point protocol -- but a lot is done just by the kinds of conversations we had today.
 
Lithuania Strife
 Q. President Gorbachev, there was an ugly border incident in Lithuania last night in which a number of Lithuanian border guards were killed. I wonder if we could have your reaction and any explanation you might have of it. Also, President Bush, any reaction from you in light particularly of your call yesterday afternoon for freedom for the Baltic states?
GORBACHEV: You know, we received this information when we were talking outside the city, and the first information was such that the incident was between -- on the border between Lithuania and Byelorussia, and when one of the citizens of Byelorussia went in the direction of Lithuania, and at the customs point where he was approaching, he saw two wounded people, and four died.
He quickly related this information and now the state security agency of Lithuania and Byelorussia, the chairman of the State Committee on Security, offered also to help in the cooperation. So now we are investigating this.
I must say that in addition to regret, it is -- we must simply sympathize with this, sympathize with the families of the people that died. And I must also say that we are doing everything in order not only to take actions, but also to avoid such excesses, such conflicts, on the basis of resolution of basic issues.
And we have taken such basic decisions, mutual decisions with regard to issues concerning Armenia and Azerbaijan, there's a dialogue. And the faster and more productive the dialogue is, the more incidents, efforts there are to break it down.
Not everyone likes this process that it develop in such a direction. And it's hard for us to say what happened. We heard versions, the President and I, but these are versions, this is not important at any rate. I will be monitoring this and we will tell you what it was that happened in reality.
Q. I just wanted to get your reaction, sir, to the incident in light of your call yesterday afternoon for freedom for the Baltic states?
BUSH: Well, I don't think there's a connection, but I do regret the violence. I think -- I listened to what President Gorbachev said about discussion. We clearly favor negotiation. He knows that, that would lead to a reduction of cross-border violence on both sides. And obviously I'd like to join in expressing my regret to those families whose loved ones are lost.
But the President immediately got on this and said they're conducting an investigation. I think there's hope that the investigation will be cooperative between the Lithuanian side and the Byelorussia side. And so we can't prejudge the incident, but I had an opportunity to express my views to President Gorbachev on the whole question of the Baltic states.
I don't think it's fair to link a border incident before you know what happened, to that question, however.
 
Soviet Economic Integration
 Q. (through interpreter) How far did you go after London in moving ahead in the integration of the U.S.S.R. into the international community? Was there progress reached in this area? To both Presidents. Perhaps you can begin.
BUSH: Well, let me say that's a serious objective to start with.
Secondly, I believe that active participation in these international financial institutions, in the status that was deemed best by the G-7 is the most important thing that the Soviets can do right now.
I have freed up, as you heard today, certain trade benefits or normalizing of trade procedures that in my view will help. And we've done that since the meeting in London.
But the answer is full benefit of these international institutions require full knowledge and steps towards the privatization and towards convertibility. All the things that I believe the Soviet Union wants. . . .
GORBACHEV: I understand that I'm supposed to comment on this as well since the question was to both Presidents. I will be brief, since I have already expressed my opinion about this. London was the beginning of a very important process. This was the meaning of the London meeting and no one must judge about this in that light.
It's very important that after London there was a desire on both parts to work out a mechanism which would permit the shifting of this cooperation given the political will of the leadership of the Western countries.
In the Soviet Union we think that we should have special structures which would keep tabs on the cooperation between the Soviet Union and the G-7 countries, and first of all, in the area of investment. So the process would be easier in the taking of decisions of mutual interest.
And it's good that the mechanism has started to be implemented, which we discussed in London and the Minister of Finances of England is already here. We first talked about the fact that there would be visits of the Minister of Finance, Secretary of the Treasury of the U.S. and the representative of the F.R.G. So in other words, there would be the mechanism of implementing specific areas of cooperation, and this is very important, that there be a mechanism for real interaction.
And finally, the President mentioned that on the part of the U.S. an important decision will be taken to make trade between our countries easier. I would say that I mentioned this in passing, but we often discuss this with the President, asked and we agreed to study the question of Cocom restrictions today because many billion-dollar projects which are ready to go and even signed are not being implemented because of the fact that they have elements that come under Cocom restrictions. . . .
 
Nuclear Deterrence
 Q. I would ask both of you to think back to the 1986 Reykjavik summit when Ronald Reagan horrified quite a few American nuclear experts and almost all of the European leaders by giving serious consideration to your proposal, President Gorbachev, for a ban on all nuclear weapons. . . . Why now are the two of you not saying we will now work towards a total nuclear ban? Do you still believe in the efficacy of nuclear deterrence keeping the peace? Particularly, sir, I ask you, President Bush, given the fact that some of these breakaway republics, they have nuclear weapons in there and who knows what would happen if they declare independence.
BUSH: In fact, I wouldn't suggest that a breakaway republic is going to use a nuclear weapon against the United States but I would suggest that we have every reason in the world to be concerned about renegades, not in these areas perhaps -- I hope not -- getting hold of nuclear weapons. And that's one of the reasons I strongly support our G-Pals program that is being debated in the Senate right now.
But in my view, other countries do possess nuclear weapons. It's not just the Soviet Union and the United States. And I do believe that we are on the right path, by the path that President Gorbachev has outlined today, on following on on existing agreements.
So rather than try to have a ethereal or a utopian answer, let's follow through practically as he suggested, and then as far as the U.S. is concerned, I'd like us to go forward with a system that puts nobody at threat, nobody at risk. The only thing at risk is an errant nuclear missile aiming at a country.
And that's why I support the defensive approach. And that's why I think one of the lessons out of the Iraq war, and maybe President Gorbachev reads this differently, is that defenses work. And though we're talking about a different concept now, an expanded concept, a more high-tech concept, I think a lot of lives were saved by defense.
So that's my reply.
GORBACHEV: I will say a few words.
I think that the argument which you want to ascribe to me that in my policy I look upon nuclear weapons as a element of deterrence is not true. I have not said this.
Yes, we got involved in the arms race in a very serious way. Thank God, as we say in Russian that we stopped this and turned it back, and this is a great accomplishment since we understood where we were headed.
But it's hard to resolve all these issues which have piled up, all these weapons that have piled up.
And I think that there is still a lot that we have to do.

Tax-Exempt Yields Rise as Taxables Dip

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds were mixed for the week ended yesterday, with tax-exempt funds moving higher and the taxable ones declining.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist at IBC/Donoghue, which regularly monitors funds, said that the yields on tax-free funds rose considerably, because of the increased supply of municipals offered recently. He mentioned the large offerings yesterday by New York State and New York City. 
 The rise in yields follows a period "when they were driven down by lack of supply," said Mr. Frank, who attributed that increase to seasonal factors like the end of fiscal years on June 30 and budget delays by some state legislatures.
"Now, supply is catching up," he said.
 
Outlook for Rate Shift
 As for the outlook, he commented: "The latest economic and money supply numbers have at least raised the possibility that the Federal Reserve could conceivably take another bite at the lower-interest-rate apple. We think the odds are low but it cannot be ruled out."
Assets of the tax-exempt funds, which totaled $88.5 billion a week ago, now total $87.6 billion, which he called "quite a sizable drop." He continued, "I suspect that as yields go up, more people will go back into the market, perhaps into longer-term municipals." The average maturity of securities in the tax-free portfolios remained at 58 days, he said.
The seven-day simple yield for the tax-exempts was 3.98 percent, and the seven-day compound yield was 4.06 percent, compared with 3.71 percent and 3.77 percent, respectively, a week earlier. In the case of the 30-day compound rate, the latest simple yield was 3.68 percent, and the compound yield 3.75 percent.
 
Fund's 14th Week at Top
 For the 14th week in row the highest-yielding tax-exempt fund was the Strong Municipal Money Market fund, distributed by Strong/Cornelison Capital Management Inc. of Milwaukee, reporting a yield of 4.99 percent, somewhat better than the 4.84 percent of a week before.
The highest-yielding New York fund continued to be Salomon Brothers' New York Municipal Money Market fund, which reported a 4.50 percent yield on a seven-day compounded basis.
For New Jersey, Calvert Tax Free Reserve, N.J., was the leader, turning in a yield of 5.09 percent, while in Connecticut the highest-yielding fund was Dreyfus Municipal Money Market Portfolio, with 4.26 percent.
 
Taxable Fund Assets Off
 Assets of the taxable funds were down $2.7 billion, to $448.7 billion, with the public accounting for most of the decline once again. The institutional ownership was down only $596 million, to 110.7 billion.
The simple seven-day yield reported by Donoghue's was down a basis point, to 5.45 percent, while the compound yield was off 2 basis points, to 5.59 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In the case of 30-day simple yields, the decline was a basis point, to 5.46 percent, while the 30-day compound yield dropped to 5.61 percent from 5.62 percent.
The average maturity of portfolio holdings was unchanged at 53 days for the taxables.
Among the taxable funds, the top-yielding one for the second week in a row was Riverside Capital Money Market fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 6.42 percent, slightly higher than last week's 6.38 percent. The fund's distributor is the Winsbury Company, Columbus, Ohio.

HEADLINE: Stocks Manage a Small Gain; Dow Up 8.50

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The stock market posted a small gain yesterday, as worries about the pace of an economic recovery returned to the market after a strong rise in the previous session.
Analysts said that the market, which was down most of the morning, after an initial gain in the opening hour, was affected by a Commerce Department report that the index of leading indicators rose only five-tenths of a percent in June, a smaller gain than had generally been expected. 
 Analysts said that the bankruptcy filing of the Columbia Gas System, a major supplier of natural gas in the Northeast, contributed to the lackluster market. The company's problems center on long-term contracts to buy gas at prices that far exceed current market levels. But stocks began surging after 2:30 P.M., when the Treasury Department announced the size of its quarterly refunding.
"Even though the size of the $38 billion refunding was not unexpected, it was a record," said William M. LeFevre, a market analyst with Tucker Anthony. "It affected the bond market, and that, in turn, affected the stock market."
 
Advances Beat Declines
 Advancing issues outpaced declines by about three to two on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 8.50 points, nearly three-tenths of a percent, to 3,024.82. The Dow Jones utility stocks were down 2.27 points yesterday, with the Columbia Gas bankruptcy responsible for about two-thirds of that decline.
The Nasdaq composite index was up 3.77 points, to 502.04, an increase of three-quarters of one percent. The American Stock Exchange's composite index was up 1.28 points, to 368.28, an increase of less than four-tenths of a percent. The New York Stock Exchange's index was up 0.70 point, to 212.34. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.12 points, to 387.81.
 
Columbia Gas Leads Losers
 The most-active issue on the Big Board was Columbia Gas, which dropped 3 yesterday, to 14, the biggest decline on the exchange. The second-most-active issue was Pepsico Inc., which was up 3/8, to 31 7/8.
The top gainer on the Big Board was the Student Loan Marketing Association, which was up 3 3/8, to 65 5/8. The stock moved on positive comments by Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. The second-largest gainer on the Big Board was Imcera Group, a producer of health-care products for people and animals. The stock, which rose 3, to 111 5/8, has been up since it signed a marketing and manufacturing agreement with American Cyanamid.
The second-biggest declining stock was Capital Cities/ABC, which was down 2 1/2, to 455. The broadcasting and publishing concern's stock is still reeling from last week's announcement of lower earnings.
In over-the-counter trading, Bioplasty Inc. fell 6 1/2, to 10. The decline came after the Food and Drug Administration said that it had taken about 500 breast implants from one of the company's factories, saying that Bioplasty had not been approved for marketing and that the company had issued unsubstantiated medical claims about the implants.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Fall by 1.4% In Sign of Erratic Recovery

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
Orders for manufactured goods fell 1.4 percent in June after a two-month advance, the Government said today in a report that was seen as confirmation of a below-par, erratic economic recovery.
"The tenuous nature of the revival clearly can be seen in orders for manufacturers' goods," said Richard Rahn, an economist with the United States Chamber of Commerce. "This indicates that production and employment gains may be uneven and weak for the remainder of 1991." 
 Still, other analysts, while agreeing with that assessment, pointed to a section of the report that showed that inventories had fallen four-tenths of a percent, the sixth drop in the last seven months.
"That means you're going to get momentum coming out of the recession," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. Manufacturers, he said, would increase production as businesses restock to meet consumer demand.
The Commerce Department report showed that orders for both durable and nondurable goods fell to a seasonally adjusted $233.3 billion from $236.5 billion in May.
The advance in May was revised to 2.3 percent, which was weaker than the 2.9 percent first estimated. Orders grew 2.1 percent in April, the first advance in five months.
Orders for both durable and nondurable goods dropped 1.4 percent in June.
The decline in durables -- relatively expensive items expected to last more than three years -- was revised from the 1.6 percent estimate first reported last week. They had risen 2 percent in May.
Orders for non-military capital goods excluding aircraft -- a barometer of industry plans to expand and modernize -- fell 4.5 percent, erasing a 2.9 percent gain in May.
 
Military Orders Plunge
 Military orders, an often-volatile category, plunged 15.6 percent after surging 22.3 percent a month earlier. Excluding this category, orders were off eight-tenths of a percent in June.
Among the durable goods, orders for transportation equipment, led by aircraft, rose 3.8 percent after gaining 4.8 percent the previous month. Excluding the transportation sector, orders were down 2.1 percent.
Primary metals also rose, up 3.8 percent after falling 1.1 percent in May.
But orders for electronic and other electrical equipment were off 9.8 percent after falling 2.4 percent in May. Orders for industrial machinery and equipment were down 4.2 percent, wiping out a 3.5 percent advance a month earlier.
All major industries except apparel, petroleum and coal products, and rubber and plastics contributed to the decline in nondurable goods. Nondurables had posted a 2.6 percent gain in May.

HEADLINE: Lending a Hand to the Small Latin Entrepreneur

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia

 BODY:
Flecked with bronze dust from burnishing guitar parts, Luis Ibanez switched off a buffing machine in his backyard metal shop here and praised the magic wrought by small-business loans that were once nearly impossible to get.
Using past loans, he hired his son-in-law, Jeremia Eremias Perez, as an assistant and started exporting banjo and guitar parts to Venezuela. With new credit he has applied for, he is planning to buy more machinery and to hire two more workers. 
 Mr. Ibanez and the scores of self-employed shoemakers, carpenters, seamstresses, food market vendors, mechanics and others make up what economists call the informal sector of Latin American industry.
Their role in stabilizing and reviving the region is quickly growing. Because of rapid urbanization in recent decades, 75 percent of Latin America's population now lives in cities. In a continent with virtually no welfare or unemployment benefits, small businesses soak up an average of 50 percent of the work force.
 
Bypassing the Loan Sharks
 Traditionally, though, bankers have passed over people like Mr. Ibanez, as well as the Ciudad Bolivar area where he lives, a sprawling shantytown of 1.3 million people, largely immigrants from the countryside.
The banks saw no profit in making small loans, typically $200 to $400, for short terms to poor, often illiterate people who had no collateral and no influential sponsors. That left Latin America's small entrepreneurs like Mr. Ibanez with the costly alternative of borrowing from loan sharks at rates three to four times those charged by banks.
But now, a United States-based aid group, Accion International, is using a formula across urban Latin America to weld hundreds of small-business credits into consolidated loan portfolios. These portfolios are winning financing from Latin America's commercial banks at market rates.
"We were talking about real interest rates -- no subsidies," said Carlos Castello Holguin, Accion's Colombia director. The organization's name is the Spanish word for action. The group's philosophy is that development will occur when Latin Americans' business acumen is matched with credit and business training.
That belief is gaining rapid acceptance as more and more economists recognize the economic importance of Latin America's grass-roots business people.
Encouraged by its success with the banks and in the barrios, Accion has set ambitious goals for mass marketing small-business loans in Latin America in this decade. By 1995, the organization, based in Cambridge, Mass., plans to administer loans to 800,000 businesses, nearly all of which have fewer than 10 employees.
Last year, Accion provided loans to 68,000 small businesses, generating 40,000 new jobs.
Of 13 countries participating in the Americas, Colombia has the largest program, with 25,000 small businesses receiving loans through the program.
Setting its sights on making the program a significant force for improving income distribution in this nation of 30 million, Accion hopes by the end of the decade to be administering loans to 250,000 Colombian "micro-entrepreneurs."
And, in contrast to their Governments, Latin America's poor have built a strong track record of repaying their loans on time. While many Latin American governments have defaulted or rescheduled payments on large portions of the region's $400 billion foreign debt, the repayment rate through Accion International Programs is 98 percent.
"We have to show the bankers that development is good for business," said Mr. Castello, who has a master's degree in economics from Georgetown University.
In Colombia, 17 private foundations administer loans in the nation's 12 largest cities. During a four-year start-up period, the foundations are making small-business loans by drawing on subsidized loans from Accion or from local supporters. Already three Colombian foundations are self-sufficient, relying entirely on commercial banks for credit.
In the United States, Accion has tapped a new movement among churches, unions and individuals interested in what they call socially responsible investment. Investors in Accion's Bridge Fund get lower rates of return, but have the satisfaction of knowing that their dollars are being used to help small businesses.
In Latin America, the loans tap entrepreneurial instincts among the poorest of the poor. A recent survey of Colombian loan recipients found that 77 percent earn less than $40 a week. Two-thirds have five years or less of education, and two-thirds are peasants from Colombia's rural interior. Recipients support an average of three family members.
Gustavo Aldana is typical. In 1984, Mr. Aldana, a street vendor from Tolima, came to Bogota to collect a bad debt. He never collected the debt, never went home, and to make ends meet started making candy.
Working alone in 1988, he took out his first $50 loan through a program administered by Actuar, one of Accion's Bogota affiliates.
Today, he is handling $3,000 loans and employs six neighbors mixing, cooking and cutting $200 worth of candy a day.
At Actuar's headquarters, in Bogota's western industrial zone, Oscar Jiraldo Valencia, the agency's executive director, explained the formula for channeling credit into small businesses in Latin America.
"The Solidarity Groups are based on friendship, knowledge and trust," he said fervently, sounding like an evangelical preacher. He was referring to the core of the loan program: solidarity groups consisting of four to six self-employed people who know and trust each other well. Trust is essential because each member co-signs on each loan. If one member does not repay a loan, the other members are obliged to repay it.
A nearby wall chart showed that Actuar's goal is to increase its recipients tenfold in four years, reaching 20,000 by the end of next year. The loans start small -- invariably far less than requested -- so that participants can build a credit record.
In Ciudad Bolivar, Rosa Parra, a 42-year-old seamstress, paused from sewing a curtain to say she regretted choosing two men for her solidarity group.
"The bad ones were the men," she said, recalling that one was unable to pay his loan and that another was killed.
Today, her group consists of four women. Nationally, women account for 55 percent of the loan recipients.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Submarine Contract Is Voided

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
A Federal judge yesterday voided the Pentagon's award of a submarine-building contract to the General Dynamics Corporation's Electric Boat division and ordered the Navy to hold a new competition on terms more favorable to a competitor, Tenneco Inc.'s Newport News shipyard.
The ruling, by Judge Robert Doumar of the United States District Court in Norfolk, Va., gives Newport News another shot at winning the contract to build the second SSN-22 Seawolf attack submarine. 
 Electric Boat, which won the competition to build the first Seawolf several years ago, won the contract for the second submarine in May with a $615 million bid, compared with the Newport News bid of $688 million.
 
Factors Other Than Price
 Newport News filed suit soon after the contract award in May, contending that the Navy had failed to consider factors other than price in selecting Electric Boat. Newport News argued in particular that the Navy, in its request for bids, said the Pentagon would look favorably on a bidder other than Electric Boat because it would prefer to have two companies building its Seawolf fleet.
In his ruling yesterday, Judge Doumar agreed with the Newport News argument. "It is clear that Congress did not intend a pure price competition" in authorizing money for the second Seawolf, he wrote.
The Navy said that it would probably appeal the ruling. "We believe that the initial award was proper and that ultimately it will be upheld," a Navy statement said.
 
Political Maneuvering
 The battle over the Seawolf contract has involved considerable political maneuvering by elected officials from Virgina, the home of Newport News, and Connecticut, the home of Electric Boat, which is based in Groton. And it illustrates one of the most difficult problems facing Congress, the Pentagon and the military-contracting industry as the nation cuts its weapons purchases: how to spread contracts around to maintain a healthy industry and encourage competition without unduly favoring companies or paying higher prices than necessary.
Electric Boat and Newport News are the nation's only submarine builders.
In his opinion, Judge Doumar said: "A competitive acquisition strategy for the entire program, if adopted, would require establishing Newport News as a second source so that there could be competition over the life of the program. However, it is and was a foregone conclusion that Newport News could not win a competition on price alone."
Electric Boat, which relies almost solely on submarine work, had warned that it might have to begin closing down over the next few years if it did not win the Seawolf contract. Newport News, which also builds other types of ships, said that it was in no danger of going out of business, but that it would not remain a viable competitor in submarine building without the second Seawolf contract.
The Navy had originally planned to buy three or four Seawolfs a year, and to split the purchases between Newport News and Electric Boat. But the program's size has been cut sharply, so that the Navy will buy no more than one Seawolf a year, a level that many analysts think is too low to justify maintaining two producers.
 
Issue of National Security
 Beyond the economic implications of forcing one company or the other from the business, there is a potential issue of national security, Pentagon officials and industry executives said. In wartime, they said, the country could find itself short of submarine-building capacity if there is only one producer.
Concerns about the nation's industrial base have also spread to other types of weapons programs, including tank-building, where General Dynamics is the only remaining manufacturer.
Jack A. Garrow, a spokesman for Newport News, said the Tenneco division was pleased with the ruling. "We trust and expect that the new solicitation will be conducted on a level playing field, which recognizes the industrial base factor," he said.
In Groton, Electric Boat issued a statement suggesting that it would probably appeal the ruling.
"We believe that our bid, which was awarded only after a thorough and exhaustive review by the Navy, offered the best value in terms of cost and value to the American taxpayer, as well as maintenance of a critical industrial base," Electric Boat said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Networks Are Putting the Pressure on Pressure Groups

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
FOR the first time, the three leading television networks are taking a stand against pressure groups that demand that advertisers withdraw commercials from controversial programming.
In a letter scheduled to begin going out on Monday, the Network Television Association, a trade group, urges marketers and their advertising agencies "not to be intimidated" by such groups, which it calls representative of "vocal minorities with agendas inconsistent with the views of most Americans." 
 "Freedom of expression is an inalienable right of all Americans," the letter states, "vigorously supported by ABC, CBS and NBC" -- the network members of the association that was formed in April 1990. The letter, an advance copy of which was made available by the association, goes on to refer to boycotts of advertisers whose commercials run during programs cited by these groups as "attempts to manipulate our free society and democratic process."
The three-page letter, signed by Peter Chrisanthopoulos, president and chief executive of the association, will be sent to more than 7,000 executives at 600 consumer-product companies and 100 ad agencies across the country. It is the latest development in a vexing issuethat periodically roils the television industry.
Since the late 70's, organized groups claiming to represent Christian, pro-family or anti-violence points of view have been taking one-two punches at programming they deem objectionable: They write and call the networks, then identify sponsors, and also complain to them. This summer, agencies have been receiving postcards from supporters of the conservative American Family Association, warning them that consumers will boycott products advertised during programs they disdain. The letter does not identify by name any of the groups it criticizes.
Recent well-publicized incidents in which advertisers pulled out of series episodes with story lines perceived to be touchy include a 1989 telecast of the drama "Thirtysomething" showing two gay men in bed, a scene that cost ABC a reported $1.5 million in advertising revenue, and an episode this year in the NBC drama "L. A. Law" showing two women kissing briefly.
In the 1991-92 season, programs that could potentially provoke additional incidents include an episode of the NBC sitcom "Dear John," in which a character tells of his wife leaving him for another woman, and further episodes about one of the women on "L. A. Law."
"The bottom line is that network television programming is advertiser- and viewer-friendly," Mr. Chrisanthopoulos said in a telephone interview from his offices in Manhattan, "and has been for a long time." The programming the networks show "reflects our society and culture," he added. "It does not push the envelope over the edge."
Disagreeing with that view is Vicki Riley, president of Concerned Viewers for Quality Television, a group based in Wilmington, Del., that is co-sponsoring a "Turn Off TV Day" on Oct. 29 along with organizations like the American Family Association, Morality in Media and the National Christian Association.
In two weeks of monitoring television this spring, Ms. Riley said she watched or heard "nudity between gay, lesbian and heterosexual couples, talk of anal and oral sex, profanity and a complete mockery, it seems, of traditional family values." Her turn-off day, which seeks participation from advertisers as well as viewers, is "a way to get the American public to speak out to the networks," she said.
The opinions expressed in the network association's letter are "something the majority of advertisers believe in," said Bob Zach, senior vice president and media director of Chiat/Day/Mojo, New York. "Unfortunately, when a letter from a pressure group winds up on a chairman's desk, it is easy for the advertising guys to feel the heat.
"In an industry that is risk-averse," he added, "the easiest fall-back position is to avoid any decision that would seem inappropriate." As a result, Mr. Zach does not think the letter will "change anything in the way companies, especially public companies," respond to pressure.
There is no special reason for sending the letter now, Mr. Chrisanthopoulos said, neither in terms of timing -- the approach of the fall season and its related sale of commercial time -- nor of economics.

HEADLINE: Pakistani Official Rules Out Extradition in B.C.C.I. Case

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: KARACHI, Pakistan, July 31

 BODY:
The ailing founder of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International will not be extradited to the United States or elsewhere to face fraud and embezzlement charges, a Government official said today.
The official, Jam Sadiq Ali, the Sindh Provincial Chief Minister, was the first Pakistani official to make a statement about the issue since B.C.C.I.'s operations in several countries were seized and the bank and its Pakistani founder, Aga Hassan Abedi, were indicted on Monday by a New York grand jury. 
 The Interior Ministry, which rules on extradition requests, declined to comment. Pakistan has an extradition treaty with the United States, but so far Washington has not requested Mr. Abedi's extradition, a ministry official said.
 
West and Israel Accused
 Mr. Ali's comments reflected the widely held Pakistani belief that the Arab-owned bank was brought down because of its meteoric success. B.C.C.I. opened in 1972 and rapidly expanded to 69 countries, mostly in the developing world. Mr. Ali accused the West and Israel of engineering B.C.C.I.'s closure.
"Mr. Abedi's only crime was that he stood up and fought the disciples of the evils in the developed world," Mr. Ali said. "B.C.C.I. was a third world bank, and it took to the challenge of breaking a hegemonistic control of the Jewish lobby on the world's financial institutions."
Mr. Abedi lives in Karachi, the nation's financial hub and the provincial capital of Sindh. Mr. Ali is the highest elected official in the southern Sindh province and once received financial backing from the bank.
On Monday, a New York grand jury indicted B.C.C.I., four affiliates, Mr. Abedi and a former deputy, Swaleh Naqvi, on charges of fraud, falsifying records and stealing more than $30 million. The bank's worldwide operations were seized on July 5.
Mr. Ali said Mr. Abedi only sought to help the Islamic world acquire scientific and technological independence. "This, I suppose, was too much for the Zionists to stomach," he said.
Mr. Abedi would be willing to stand trial in any court in Pakistan, Mr. Ali said, but would not be extradited to the United States or any other country.
Mr. Ali has acknowledged getting support from B.C.C.I. while living in exile in London during martial law in Pakistan from 1977 to 1988.
"I am deeply grieved by the malicious, racist and baseless campaign against Mr. Abedi," he said. "I can say from my personal knowledge, without fear of contradiction, that he is a great benefactor of the wretched of the earth and ailing humanity in the present century."
Mr. Abedi was forced to give up control of B.C.C.I. after suffering two heart attacks in early 1988 that led to brain damage and his use of a wheelchair. He retired from B.C.C.I. in September 1989 after having a heart transplant.

HEADLINE: Gunmen Kill 6 Lithuania Border Guards

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: VILNIUS, Lithuania, July 31

 BODY:
Six Lithuanian border guards were killed today and two were critically wounded in a machine-gun attack on a customs post near the breakaway republic's border with Soviet Byelorussia, officials here said.
The Lithuanian authorities said the identity of the attackers was not known. The customs stations, symbols of Lithuania's claim to independence from the Soviet Union, have been frequent targets of violent raids by Soviet troops and "black beret" police units loyal to Moscow. 
 Soviet security officials here and in Moscow denied any responsibility for today's attack and said they hoped it would not disrupt the cordial atmosphere of President Bush's Moscow summit meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Mr. Gorbachev, speaking at a joint news conference with Mr. Bush at the end of the their two-day meeting, said an investigation of the incident was under way, and he extended his sympathies to the families of the victims.
 
Bush's Nod to the Baltics
 Mr. Bush, who on Tuesday publicly urged Mr. Gorbachev to "find a way to extend freedom to the Baltic people," said the violence was regrettable. He expressed hopes that negotiations would bring an end to the long-running border clashes.
Also early this morning, a powerful explosion blew out most of the windows at the headquarters of a division of Soviet Interior Ministry troops in central Vilnius. Col. Aleksandr V. Malinin, a spokesman at the site, said there had been no injuries from the explosive device, detonated at the building's doorstep by unknown assailants.
There have been similar mysterious explosions at military and Communist Party buildings in Lithuania and Latvia in recent months, all without injuries. Hard-liners attribute the attacks to nationalist "terrorists," while Baltic officials say they suspect the K.G.B. or the military has set off the explosions deliberately to create a pretext for their campaign against Baltic separatists.
The border killings were the most serious eruption in the Baltic republics since Jan. 13, when a tank column of Soviet Army paratroopers and K.G.B. special troops stormed television installations here, leaving 13 civilian dead and scores wounded.
That raid, witnessed by a large contingent of foreign reporters, dealt a powerful blow to Mr. Gorbachev's reputation as a reformer. Soviet journalists and legislators have produced evidence that Mr. Gorbachev approved the attack and authorized an official cover-up.
Vytautas Landsbergis, the Lithuanian President, told reporters here that the two most likely suspects in today's violence were Soviet forces bent on intimidating the pro-independence leadership and organized criminals whose smuggling operations have been interrupted by the customs controls.
But he said Mr. Gorbachev was ultimately responsible for the recurring mayhem in the Baltics, and he criticized the United States for not pressing the Kremlin more forcefully to recognize Lithuania's independence.
"Every time the United States shows a more favorable disposition toward the Soviet Union, the Baltic states, and especially Lithuania, are struck again by Soviet armed forces," he said.
"In fact, the United States is giving in by not forcefully demanding that the Soviet Union punish those guilty for the killings in Lithuania and Latvia in January, to return the buildings seized by Soviet forces and to pull the OMON terrorists out of the Baltic states," he added, referring to the "black beret" police units.
Those killed today at Medininkai, about 25 miles southeast of Vilnius, included two customs officers, two highway patrolmen and two members of an elite Lithuanian police unit organized to provide extra security for Lithuanian government installations. A third customs officer with bullet wounds to the head was reported near death tonight at a Vilnius hospital. A fourth customs official was said to be in stable condition after surgery, but officials have still been unable to question him about the attack.
Lithuanian investigators said it appeared that the guards had been forced to lie down and then were shot execution-style. Tonight, Lithuanian television showed graphic footage of the bodies lying in the customs shack in pools of blood.
Officials said that four of the eight Lithuanian guards would have been armed, but that their guns were missing and there was no sign of an exchange of fire.
Moscow has repeatedly declared the Lithuanian customs posts illegal. Since May, the outposts along the borders with Byelorussia, Poland and Latvia have been attacked more than a dozen times, customs guards beaten and buildings burned. Witnesses to many of the incidents said the attackers wore military khakis or black berets and drove military and police vehicles.
Some Lithuanian officials and journalists speculated that today's attack may have been a response to the treaty signed on Monday between Lithuania and the President of the Russian republic, Boris N. Yeltsin. The treaty was viewed here as an important step toward recognition of Lithuanian independence. Others suggested that it was timed to embarrass Mr. Gorbachev during Mr. Bush's visit by demonstrating his inability to control tensions in the Baltics.
Last month, as Mr. Gorbachev prepared for a trip to London to seek economic aid from Western nations, black beret troops broke into the Lithuanian telephone building in Vilnius and cut off communications with the outside world for several hours.

HEADLINE: Upper West Side Journal;
A Muslim Leader Visits, And a Hotel Is Reeling

 BODY:
In a city of immigrants, the Senegalese say they have found their niche. They drive cabs, vend goods, work in offices.
What they have not found is a community; their few thousands are scattered throughout New York City. 
 But for one week the Narragansett, a modest and informal 12-floor residential hotel on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, has become an unlikely Mecca.
Cheikh Mourtada Mbacke, an aging, contemplative scion of Senegal's venerated Muslim leader and anti-colonialist, Ahmadou Bamba, has arrived on Broadway. And his people have followed.
The choice of the Narragansett Hotel, a home to many college students during the school year, was not the Cheikh's; his followers in New York picked it for him.
"We were looking for two weeks," said Mouhamadou Lamime Diagne, a trade analyst who picked up the Cheikh at the airport. The Narragansett, a mostly single-room occupancy hotel near 93d Street, "was the one we found so he will be near the community," Mr. Diagne said. Most Senegalese in New York live in Harlem.
Cheikh Mbacke's visit, lately an annual event, has become a spectacle. When he emerges from the hotel each morning, he is surrounded by a security team. They have to contend with some of the Cheikh's followers waiting outside who rush toward him, hoping to touch his clothing. "We keep telling him he should move to Central Park West," said one security officer with walkie-talkie in hand. "It's impossible to protect people here."
The 74-year-old Cheikh then climbs into a limousine and goes off in a motorcade that takes him around the city.
Inside the hotel, hundreds of visitors arrive in the course of a day -- some in bright robes, some in gaudy T-shirts, some in business suits. Many pack the elevator to see the Cheikh, who is on the eighth floor with his retinue of about 15 people, most of them older men. When visitors arrive, he retreats behind a veiled doorway to greet them.
One floor above, a room is set aside for food -- cafeteria-scale pots of rice, fish and chicken, all delivered. In the hallway, shoes accumulate in front of doorways -- as they do at entrances to mosques -- and Muslim chants resonate from a tape player.
Many of those who see the Cheikh arriving and departing are struck by the devotion of his followers. "One thing I can tell you," said Joseph Toon, the man behind the hotel's glass-enclosed reception booth, "is that his people will die for him."
Some of the hotel's long-term residents are bemused by all the commotion. David Magid, who lives a few floors from the Senegalese contingent, pointed to the elevator, already over capacity, as he waited. "This is the fifth one that has passed," he said. "If he's such a big deal, why is he staying here?"
Cheikh Mbacke represents the Muridist tradition of Islam in Senegal, in West Africa. The Murids are one of a host of mystical Islamic sects with wide followings often based around one pious family.
But even to scholars of Islam, the Murids are rather unstudied. One encyclopedia of Islam reduces its discussion of the Murids to one clause of a long sentence, saying their "collective discipline has worked wonders and has been responsible for great developments, notably in ground-nut growing."
To the Murids, their discipline has produced more than agricultural advances. Their tradition, they say, fosters common characteristics like seriousness, devotion to family and a willingness to work hard.
But the Cheikh has little practical counsel to offer his people navigating the shoals of an unknown economy.
"We do not talk about this world," said El-Hadji Gueye, a 38-year-old yellow-cab driver. "We talk about prayer and love."
The Cheikh's visit has become the focal point of a community religious effort: to found a Muridist mosque.
Most Senegalese Muslims in New York City belong to the Malcolm Shabbazz Mosque on 116th Street and Lenox Avenue. The Cheikh's arrival there on Friday was befitting a visiting dignitary: police barricades were set up, and worshipers craned their necks to see him, some rushing forward, trying to touch him.
After the service, the Cheikh held a brief news conference:
How does he like New York?
"He knows that it is a place created by God Almighty," his son, Moustapha, said, translating. "He has come to greet his people."
How are his people doing?
"He sees that his disciples are quite well-behaved as far as the teachings."
At the Narragansett, the stream of visitors never lets up. "Eighth floor," Mr. Toon often answers before he is even asked at the reception booth.
"No celebrities have stayed here before," he said. "They once filmed a Kojak episode here, though."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MOSCOW;
BUSH AND GORBACHEV SIGN PACT TO CURTAIL NUCLEAR ARSENALS; JOIN IN CALL FOR MIDEAST TALKS

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 31

 BODY:
President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union signed a far-reaching treaty today that is designed to scale down their nations' stocks of long-range nuclear weapons, then joined in a bold bid to stage a comparably momentous Middle East peace conference in October.
The two leaders inscribed their names on the 700-page arms reduction treaty at a solemn 30-minute ceremony in St. Vladimir's Hall in the Kremlin. The treaty still needs approval by the legislative branches in both countries, but with the signing, after nine years of negotiation, Mr. Bush said, "We reverse a half-century of steadily growing strategic arsenals." 
 Declaring the arms race over, Mr. Gorbachev commented, "Thank God, as we say in Russian, that we stopped this."
 
6 Lithuanians Killed
 A joint statement issued by the two Presidents said they "will work to convene in October a peace conference designed to launch bilateral and multilateral negotiations." [Excerpts from the Bush-Gorbachev news conference and the text of the joint statement on the Middle East are on pages A10 and A11.]
But the politicial strains that continue to plague the Soviet Union as it tries to define a new place for itself in the world were dramatized for Mr. Bush and his aides by the news that six Lithuanian border guards had been killed in an attack on a customs post in the Baltic republic. [Page A8.]
It was the worst such incident in the Baltic republics since January, and its timing embarrassed Mr. Gorbachev, who quickly announced an investigation. "We are doing everything to avoid such excesses," he leader said, apologizing for the incident and offering sympathy to the victims' families.
 
Mideast Given Prominence
 The signing of the arms treaty, so long awaited, was all but overshadowed by the Presidents' decision to join in calling for the equally long-sought Middle East peace conference, in which Israel has not yet agreed to take part. Clearly, they hoped their announcement would prompt the Israelis and Palestinians to overcome their differences over the composition of a Palestinian delegation at the projected conference.
"This historic opportunity must not be lost," Mr. Bush said.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d is to fly to Jerusalem on Thursday "to obtain Israel's answer," Mr. Bush said. By limiting the language of the statement to saying they would "work" to convene a conference, they avoided an ultimatum to Israel that would have resulted if a firm date had been announced.
Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, the Soviet Foreign Minister, is to follow Mr. Baker's visit a bit later, carrying papers to open full diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Israel. Moscow has said that could be done only when peace talks were agreed to.
Mr. Bush, who announced on Tuesday that he would ask Congress to approve favorable new trade terms for the Soviets, continued to press for economic reform as a condition for large-scale United States assistance.
"You must define your own branch of democratic capitalism," he told an attentive group of fledgling Soviet businessmen in a breakfast speech. "People must be free -- to work, to save, to own their own homes, to take risks, to invest in each other and, in esssence, to control their own lives."
Mr. Gorbachev, for his part, has been pressing the United States to ease restrictions on high-technology exports to the Soviet Union.
The two leaders spent much of the day at a government retreat 20 miles west of Moscow, known as Novo Ogaryevo, discussing political issues that still divide their nations. On the agenda were Cuba, the size of the Kremlin military budget and the Baltic republics' desire to be independent. There was no indication that the talks were anything but cordial, and Soviet television showed the two leaders smiling, tieless and wearing pullover sweaters.
But what made this week "a dramatic time," as Mr. Gorbachev put it, was the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start, and its symbolic termination of the race by the United States and the Soviet Union to amass weaponry with which to blow each other up.
Start will reduce the superpowers' stocks of long-range missiles and bombers by about a third. But that will take them back only to roughly the level where they stood as negotiations began in Geneva in 1982 on this, the last of the major arms-control agreements conceived in the tensions of the 1970's and 1980's.
Nonetheless, it is the first agreement ever that calls for the two nations actually to reduce their holdings of the most deadly weapons, instead of merely reducing the rate at which those holdings have expanded.
At the joint news conference concluding the two-day summit conference here, the fourth in the last two years between the two men, they were asked why they had not agreed to scrap all their nuclear missiles, as Mr. Gorbachev proposed at his meeting with President Reagan at Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1986.
Both said that would not be practical, given the nuclear weapons in other countries' hands, and Mr. Bush said he worried about "renegades."
The agreement was signed with pens made from metal taken from medium-range missiles scrapped under an accord signed four years ago. The other major arms treaty signed in recent years was the 22-nation conventional forces agreement approved last fall, which covers units across Europe.
With East-West tensions eased, the United States is reluctant to begin another round of detailed, count-every-weapon negotiations like the Start talks. Washington and Moscow are to hold talks in the fall to "take stock of where we are," said the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, but he added that it was hard to say whether any initiatives would result.
 
Gorbachev More Hopeful
 But Mr. Gorbachev was more sanguine, commenting at the signing ceremony, "Come on, let us undertake new efforts for our own security and that of the whole world."
The Soviets are believed to want to negotiate limits on naval weapons, which the United States has thus far opposed, and Mr. Bush is trying to impress both the Soviets and Congress with the virtues of a scaled-down version of "Star Wars," Mr. Reagan's proposal for a space-based missile defense system. Moscow argues that it would violate an existing treaty that bans anti-missile weapons.
Even after today's treaty, which was agreed upon only two weeks ago in London, the superpowers will retain tremendous firepower, with huge numbers of weapons trained upon each other's principal cities. According to one estimate, by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in Britain, the treaty will leave 40,000 nuclear warheads capable of prompt usage.
Still, Mr. Gorbachev spoke in soaring terms of the Start treaty, describing it as "a moral achievement" and asserting that it marked the "dismantling of the infrastructure of fear that has ruled the world." He added, "Normal human thinking will now have to replace the kind of military-political thinking that has taken root in the minds of men."
 
No 'Unilateral Advantage'
 Mr. Bush, less triumphal, said it "represents a major step forward for our mutual security and the cause of world peace." He emphasized that "neither side won unilateral advantage over the other."
The Soviet Union will be required to cut its ballistic missile warheads by more than 35 percent, to about 7,000 warheads from about 11,000, and the United States will have to trim its ballistic missile arsenal by about 25 percent, to roughly 9,000 warheads from about 12,000. The Soviets will also have to destroy half of their heavy SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles; the United States has no weapons in that category, and under the treaty is not permitted to build any.
Complicated verification measures, including snap inspections at strategic weapons emplacements, are expected to ease the treaty's approval. Leaders in the United States Senate and the Soviet Parliament have predicted relatively little opposition.
There have been two previous strategic arms treaties between the Soviet Union and the United States. The first was signed by President Nixon and Leonid I. Brezhnev in 1972, limiting the expansion of nuclear arsenals. A follow-up, drafted by Mr. Brezhnev and President Carter, was never approved by the Senate.

Goal
 To reduce strategic offensive arms by approximately 30 percent in three phases over seven years.
 
Central Limits
* 1,600 Strategic Nuclear Delivery Vehicles (deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles and their launchers, and heavy bombers.)
 
* 6,000 "accountable" strategic warheads on these systems:
 
 No more than 4,900 of them on ballistic missiles.
 No more than 1,100 on mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles.
 No more than 1,540 can be on SS-18's, the Soviet Union's 154 heavy intercontinental ballistic missiles.
 (To achieve these limits, the Soviet Union must eliminate half its ballistic missile warheads, half its SS-18 missiles; and decrease the aggregate throw weight of its missiles by 46 percent.)
 
Counting Rules

 Heavy bombers with bombs and short-range missiles will count as carrying one warhed each, regardless of bombs or warheads carried.
 
 U.S. heavy bombers may carry no more than 20 long-range air-launched cruise missiles each. The first 150 count as carrying 10 each.
 
 Soviet heavy bombers may carry no more than 16 air-launched cruise missiles each. The first 180 will count as carrying 8 each.
 
Other Provisions
 
* Sea-launched cruise missiles with ranges above 373 miles will be limited to 880.
 
* Soviet Backfire bombers will be limited to 500.
 
* The treaty will run for 15 years, with the option to extend it for successive 5-year periods.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MOSCOW;
Ukrainians Await Bush With Skepticism

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: KIEV, U.S.S.R., July 31

 BODY:
On the eve of his first venture into the heated world of Soviet politics in the provinces, President Bush was denounced today by the Ukraine's leading independence movement as having been "hypnotized by Gorbachev" at the summit meeting.
The Ukrainian popular movement known as Rukh, the umbrella group for more than a dozen of the republic's opposition parties, offered Mr. Bush an advance sample of the sharp-edged politics that await him in this rich, sprawling republic, which the President will visit on Thursday on his way home from Moscow. 
 Ukrainian politicians cautioned him today to expect the six-hour visit to be no easy, folksy photo opportunity.
Ivan Drach, the Rukh chairman, said Mr. Bush was so supportive and uncritical of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that Mr. Bush would arrive here as the Soviet leader's "messenger," with no real appreciation of the suffering that the Ukrainian republic has seen under the Kremlin because of its yearning for independence.
"We must remember that as President, Bush has consistently snubbed the democratic movement" in the republic, Mr. Drach said at a news conference as officials of the United States consulate here listened in the audience.
 
Bush's Touchy Touchdown
 Forewarned, the President will be touching down in one of the nation's most important and politically fractious republics, one that accounts for a quarter of the nation's food and a third of its industrial production.
Mr. Bush will be visiting a rapidly warming caldron where the President of the Ukrainian Parliament, Leonid M. Kravchuk, has been among the fastest to rush to the head of the nationalist parade and hedge his allegiance to the Kremlin with increasingly militant demands for sovereignty.
As insurgent politics have taken hold in the Ukraine, few Communists have been so thoroughly born again as the popular Mr. Kravchuk, the son of a peasant who rose to initial power as ideology chief of the Ukrainian Communists. Mr. Kravchuk has adapted by dropping the Russian language from his public appearances and speaking only Ukrainian.
More painful for Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Kravchuk's Parliament has blocked the Soviet leader's hopes for early adoption of a treaty of national unity with the sovereignty-hungry republics.
For decades the Ukraine has seethed with the memories of Soviet economic exploitation and wholesale terror. An estimated 10 million people perished in the famine that resulted from Stalin's policies 60 years ago.
Nowadays, with politics opened up by the reforms of Mr. Gorbachev, the Ukraine seethes with outspoken ethnic groups and dozens of political parties that broadcast every variety of independence and sovereignty demands.
A year after the republic's Parliament declared its sovereignty over the laws of the national Government, the Ukraine is taking the first steps toward forming the officer corps of its own army. Officials are trying to produce the first Ukrainian currency.
Mr. Bush will find few stops free of controversy on his itinerary through this city, the third-largest in the nation, with 2.5 million people.
Some Ukrainian Jews complain that the nearby memorial at Babi Yar, the Nazi killing ground that Mr. Bush will visit during his tour, offers scant recognition that tens of thousands who died there were Jews.
The Parliament where he will speak still has a Communist majority, but it is one that recently scrambled to stay abreast of the sovereignty fever, rejecting the party's call to vote for the speedy debate sought by Mr. Gorbachev for the proposed union treaty.
Instead, the Parliament, mindful of the public's growing militancy, has refused to even consider the measure until September.
 
Miners Court Intellectuals
 With 52 million residents, the Ukraine is the nation's second-most-populous republic. Long divided politically between the Russianized and conservative eastern provinces and the Western bastions of independence, the Ukraine is busy with change: the disgruntled, underpaid coal miners of the east have began making alliances with the independent-minded intellectuals of the west.
Even Communist hard-liners are talking of independence, if only to avoid being swept up in the reshaped national union that they fear President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian federated republic will come to dominate with his increasing anti-Communist policies.
"The biggest mistake President Bush can make is if he does not pay full attention to democratic movements in republics, and supports only Gorbachev," said Aleksandr Burakovsky, chairman of Rukh's council of nationalities. Such sentiment, heard frequently, points to Mr. Bush's political problem in needing to pay credible heed to nationalist movements yet avoid seeming to be a severe critic of Mr. Gorbachev.
President Bush had best avoid any sign of stopping here as if it were a colorful outpost of Mr. Gorbachev's Soviet realm, said John P. Hewko, an American lawyer working as a consultant on the problems of reforming the center-dependent Ukrainian government into something more sovereign.
"The most important thing about the visit is that it will put the Ukraine on the map," Mr. Hewko said. "The whole world will finally be paying attention."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Trading Has a Way of Proving the Last Shall Be First and Vice Versa

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Earlier this month, Brook Jacoby started only one game and played briefly in three others in an 11-game stretch. After that, he related: "I was asked would I like to sit on the bench or would I like to be traded. It was a very easy question to answer."
Whereupon Jacoby was liberated from the lower depths of the standing and catapulted into a pennant race. The Cleveland Indians traded him to the Oakland Athletics last Friday, and he instantly gained four places and 18 1/2 games in the standing. 
 A flurry of trades late last night elevated Roger McDowell from last-place Philadelphia to first-place Los Angeles, Jim Clancy from last-place Houston to second-place Atlanta and Ron Darling from fifth-place Montreal to the Athletics. Only 16 days earlier, Darling thought he had bid farewell to the pennant race when the Mets traded him to the Expos.
In earlier trades, Jacoby's former teammate Tom Candiotti escaped last-place Cleveland for first-place Toronto; Montreal traded two of their pitchers, Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd and Tim Burke, into pennant races, Boyd to Texas, Burke to the Mets, and Garry Templeton leaped into the pennant race with the Mets, courtesy of the San Diego Padres.
Midnight last night was the deadline for trades without waivers. If any races remain a few weeks from now, someone may trade, in time for post-season eligibility, for a veteran player who has cleared waivers, the way Oakland did for Harold Baines and Willie McGee last Aug. 29. Contending teams make such trades to bolster themselves for the stretch run, but the benefits can extend beyond game-winning hits and shutouts.
"When we got Baines and McGee last year, I think it wiped everybody else out mentally," said Sandy Alderson, the Oakland general manager. "They were stunned that we were able to get the two of them."
While the team acquiring the player hopes to benefit from his addition, the player himself can benefit, too. Alderson cited Jacoby as an example, noting that in his second game with the Athletics last Sunday he went hitless and hit into two double plays.
"If he does that with Cleveland, they probably would have lost the game and it would've been negative for him," Alderson said. "But we won and it means nothing. That makes it easier for him to go out the next game. When you have people covering your mistakes, it's easier to go out and play."
Jacoby played for the Indians for seven and a half seasons. It was seldom easy to play for a team that never contended.
"I was getting ready for the game," said Jacoby, relating the way he learned of his liberation. "I was in the lineup playing first base. At about 6:30, they called me in the office and said they had made a trade. I said where. They said Oakland. I was real excited."
Jacoby was not long for Cleveland. He can be a free agent after the season. "I was just hoping I wasn't going to be left in Cleveland and finish the season there," he said. "I was hoping something would happen because it was getting kind of frustrating."
Not that he needs any help knowing how to feel now that he is with the Athletics, but Jacoby could always ask one of his new teammates about coming to a drastically different environment.
"It's definitely fun when you go somewhere that you know you have a chance to win," Baines said.
 
No Regrets Over Sanderson
 When a team makes that type of trade, though, someone goes in the other direction. Thus, Tim Teufel (for Templeton) and Glenallen Hill and Mark Whiten (for Candiotti) lament that they tumbled out of pennant races.
Then there are Mitch Webster and Jose Gonzalez. They were traded for each other recently, but they neither leaped into or fell out of a race. They went from one first-place team to another: Webster to the Dodgers and Gonzalez to the Pirates.
Even with the collapse of the Athletics' vaunted pitching staff and Scott Sanderson's success with the Yankees, Alderson said he wouldn't retain the team's 17-game winner of 1990 if he could make the decision over again.
"It's unfortunate that we couldn't have a $2.5 million pitcher holding down the fourth spot," Alderson said, alluding to the team's record $36 million payroll. "It's not economically feasible."
"I don't think he would have had the same year with us," Alderson added. "He wouldn't have had the same bullpen with us. He benefited tremendously with us last year because of our bullpen and with the Yankees this year because of theirs. This isn't a knock on Sanderson, but he's not a nine-inning pitcher. He's a six-inning pitcher."
With Oakland, Sanderson averaged six innings a start, pitched two complete games and had a 3.88 earned run average. After losing his fourth consecutive game last night, he was averaging six innings and had two complete games and a 4.40 e.r.a.
 
Sax Experiment Bought Time
 The Yankees' experiment with Steve Sax at third base earlier this season was not, it turns out, an act of desperation. It was an act of stalling. General Manager Gene Michael said that by moving Sax to third, the Yankees were simply buying time until they thought they could put Pat Kelly, their rookie second baseman, there.
"We didn't know Sax couldn't play third base, but we didn't think the chances were very good of him being successful at third," Michael said. "We said we've got to get the kid playing second base first. We couldn't ask him to come up and play third without having played third. We wanted to get him here playing his natural position, which is second. He did O.K. Quickly we moved him to third."
Michael said that he wanted to send Kelly back to Columbus for 10 days to let him play third and then bring him up again. But, he explained, Graig Nettles, the first-base coach and former third baseman, said that Kelly could play there because "he's an athlete." Brian Sabean, the player development chief, said the same thing, Michael said.
"We put him at third and he took off," the general manager said. "He is an athlete."

HEADLINE: CRITICISM LEVELED AT MEDICARE PLAN

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
An independent Federal advisory committee said today that a new Medicare fee schedule would substantially cut payments to doctors and could make it harder for elderly people to gain access to health care.
In a report to Congress, the 13-member panel, the Physician Payment Review Commission, sharply criticized details of the nationwide fee schedule that the Bush Administration plans to put into effect in January of next year. 
 The panel said the fee schedule would reduce the level of Medicare fees 16 percent in the next five years, compared with what they would have been under the current payment system. The commission, created by Congress in 1986, is composed of economists and experts on health policy.
The fee schedule designed by the Administration "could pose serious risks to beneficiaries' access to care," the report says. "Medicare fee levels would be substantially lower than fees paid by private insurers, and would be lower than Medicaid rates in many states."
Medicare finances health care for 34 million elderly and disabled people. Medicaid covers 27 million low-income people.
 
Sweeping and Significant
 The new nationwide fee schedule has been described as one of the most sweeping and significant changes in Medicare since the program was created in 1965. The Department of Health and Human Services set forth its plans for the fee schedule in proposed rules that were printed in the Federal Register on June 5. A final version of the rules will be adopted in the next few months.
Gail R. Wilensky, who supervises Medicare and Medicaid as head of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, had no immediate comment on the substance of the commission's report. But in response to the report she issued a statement saying, "As we prepare our final regulation, we will carefully consider the commission's comments along with other responses we have received thus far on our proposal."
Federal officials say the fee schedule would save the Government a total of at least $6.9 billion as it is put into effect from 1992 to 1996. Dr. Wilensky told Congress last month that "it was not our intention" to reduce Medicare spending in this way. But she said that "the proposed rule is based on the correct interpretation" of a 1989 law intended to overhaul Medicare's complex system of paying doctors.
The chairman of the commission, Dr. Philip R. Lee, said in an interview, "My overriding concern is that decisions made by the Administration threaten the integrity of the physician payment reform approved by Congress in 1989." But "there is ample time between now and January to resolve the problems if the Administration chooses to do so," said Dr. Lee, who is director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California in San Francisco.
The commission's report, in effect, endorses complaints of the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians and other groups of doctors. Many of those groups, including the A.M.A., supported the concept of the fee schedule, assuming it would make payments more fair, but they contend it has been misused by the Administration as a device for saving money. In establishing the fee schedule, the goal of Congress was not so much to reduce total spending as to redistribute the money, providing more for family doctors and general practitioners and less for some specialists, including surgeons.
 
'Physicians Being Penalyzed'
 In computing the new payment amounts, Federal officials assumed that doctors losing money under the fee schedule would increase the volume of their services to recover half the income they would lose. The advisory panel criticized the Administration for making that assumption. Doctors say there is no basis for the assumption, which was responsible for nearly two-thirds of the 16 percent cut.
"In a sense," the report says, "physicians are being penalized before they have had a chance to show how they will behave."
The commission said the Medicare rules drafted by the Administration would cause "steep and permanent fee reductions" for doctors treating Medicare patients.
"It is not credible that Congress intended substantial budget savings" when the law stipulates that spending under the fee schedule should be the same as it would have been under the old payment system, the commission said. Medicare is expected to cost $104 billion this year, of which $32 billion is for doctors' services.
The core of the new fee schedule is a computation system under which the Government, for the first time, assigns numerical values to all services performed by doctors. These values, ranging from 1 for a typical office visit to 119 for a liver transplant, take account of the complexity of the work, the amount of time required for the service, malpractice insurance costs and the doctor's office expenses.
The Government said in June it would use a monetary conversion factor of $26.87 to arrive at the price for a given service, multiplying the conversion factor by the numerical value assigned to the service.
The fee schedule will be put into effect over five years. It governs about one-third of Medicare payments to doctors in 1992.

HEADLINE: Workers on Strike Deserve Job Protection

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Strike at Your Own Risk" by Prof. David Westfall of Harvard (Op-Ed, July 16), opposing the workplace fairness bill that has been passed by the House of Representatives (news article, July 18), is loaded with misconceptions and false conclusions. The permanent replacement of strikers, although declared legal by a 1938 court decision, is anything but a "long-established practice." Indeed, it was almost unheard of before the Reagan Administration used it to crush the air traffic controllers' union in 1981. 
 Mr. Westfall states that because of the threat of permanent replacement, "unions are less likely to make unreasonable demands at the bargaining table." Doesn't he know that more than four-fifths of recent strikes were responses to the insistence by employers on cutbacks in employee health benefits or making employees pay for their own medical insurance? Whose unreasonableness caused those labor disputes?
Mr. Westfall and the Bush Administration make much of preserving worker "freedom of choice" to become scabs. But largely due to the Administration's economic policies, more than eight million Americans are out of work, have run out of unemployment benefits and have only the "freedom" to choose between starvation, welfare or taking a job on any terms an employer might offer. Sadly, many are glad for temporary work, so struck companies can keep running, even without offering scabs permanent jobs.
The article slanders the American labor movement by implying that workers don't "participate in the decision to call a strike." Unions rarely, if ever, take this difficult and painful course before the affected workers have voted to reject a last and final management offer.

HEADLINE: U.S. Has to Back Human Rights in Peru

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 14 Week in Review article "10 Die a Day, or Disappear, and Peru Goes Numb" evokes the tragedy of innocents caught in the crossfire between two brutal adversaries -- the Shining Path guerrillas and Peruvian security forces. You quote the father of Carlos Rodriguez, a slain medical student, on the bitter reality: "There is no difference between the police and the Shining Path when both are the ones who kill us." 
 But you seem to share the Bush Administration's mistaken view that applying United States human rights laws -- which preclude aid to Peru -- would make matters worse. Our assistance to Peru is conditioned on respect for human rights. You help demonstrate why Peru does not qualify for aid. Yet you suggest that if the United States enforces the law and withholds aid, Peruvians will be further alienated, and Shining Path will be the major beneficiary.
But respect for human rights is a profoundly practical policy concern. We have found in case after case that ignoring the abusive practices of our allies around the world undercuts our long-term goals. If the people of Peru have trouble distinguishing between Shining Path and the Peruvian military, we will not win over the populace by appearing to endorse the brutal tactics of one side. Indeed, we may unintentionally give momentum to the guerrilla cause.
The Bush Administration maintains that only through "engagement" with Peru's armed forces can the United States gain leverage to moderate their behavior. Last Tuesday, the Administration submitted a transparently fraudulent human rights report that claims Peru's military and police forces are not engaged in a consistent pattern of human right abuses. This shameful whitewash will clear the way for more than $30 million in military aid.
If the President fails to enforce our laws -- that is, if United States aid flows to Peru regardless of abuses -- then we lose our credibility, and any hope of leverage at the outset.
The best way to achieve our goals in Peru is to remain true to our own highest principles and to enforce our human rights laws.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Shipping Executive Gets A.T.&T. Post

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The American Telephone & Telegraph Company named as its new chief financial officer Alex J. Mandl, head of one of the world's largest shipping companies who also has an extensive background in applying telecommunications technology to business.
Mr. Mandl, 47 years old, has been chairman and chief executive of Sea-Land Services Inc., based in Edison, N.J. Mr. Mandl was hired through an executive search service and has no previous experience with A.T.& T. 
 In an interview, Mr. Mandl said that he would like to concentrate on "bringing some financial perspective to A.T.& T. and growing the business over all," but he declined to be more specific. "I have a few ideas, but that's really something Bob Allen and I will work out over time," he said, referring to A.T.& T.'s chairman.
Effective today, Mr. Mandl replaces Morris Tanenbaum who retired earlier this year at age 62.
CSX, the parent company of Sea-Land, replaced Mr. Mandl with John Clancey, who has been at Sea-Land for 21 years and was most recently executive vice president. CSX had revenue last year of $8.2 billion; A.T.& T.'s revenues were $37.3 billion.
Sea-Land is the largest American-flagged operator of container ships, which carry cargo by transporting it in single huge containers rather than numerous parcels.
CSX also operates the nation's third-largest rail system and is the nation's largest barge operator. Mr. Mandl had also held senior financial and planning posts with CSX.
At Sea-Land, Mr. Mandl spent more than $300 million on telecommunications and information systems. Sea-Land must coordinate and schedule ships, trucks, and freight trains through 80 terminals around much of the world.
"We can take a container from a warehouse in Hong Kong, carry it across the Pacific by ship, drop it at Long Beach, Calif., put it on a train to Chicago, then take it by truck and put it back in a warehouse," he said.
An economics graduate of Williamette University in Salem, Ore., Mr. Mandl got his master's degree in business administration from the University of California at Berkeley in 1969.
Mr. Mandl's wife, Sue Bailey-Mandl, is a psychiatrist practicing in Washington. They have three grown children.
Born in Austria, Mr. Mandl came to the United States at age 15 when his father, a professor of German literature, came to teach in the United States.

HEADLINE: Imelda Marcos Assails Manila's Terms for Return

BYLINE: By CRAIG WOLFF, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
Calling it "unbelievable and cruel," Imelda Marcos, the widow of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines, said yesterday that she would decline an offer by the Manila Government to return from exile unless she can bring her husband's remains back with her.
 The Government of President Corazon C. Aquino lifted its five-year-ban on her return Tuesday. But in doing so, it also announced that it would not permit the return of the remains of Mr. Marcos and that it would charge Mrs. Marcos in 25 criminal cases. 
Still, Mrs. Marcos left some doubt about her intentions, saying that "if my presence is imperative to go home without my husband to face trial, I will do so."
 "It will be up to the lawyers."
 Her lawyer, James Linn, said he would advise her not to return.
 "To tell you the truth, I don't think she should go back," Mr. Linn said. "She would not get a fair trial. But she's wanted this for a long time."
 Mrs. Marcos expressed her dismay at the offer at a news conference early last night outside a townhouse she rents from the Nigerian Government on East 80th Street in Manhattan.
 It recalled the commotion that surrounded her trial in Federal Court last year, on charges that she helped her husband steal more than $200 million from the Philippine treasury. Mrs. Marcos was aquitted.
 As her lawyers did at the trial, Mrs. Marcos yesterday depicted herself as "just the widow," and said she had no political ambitions.
 Prsident Marcos died while in exile in Hawaii in 1989,
 Earlier yesterday, the Aquino Government in Manila said Mrs. Marcos, who is 62 years old, would be eligible only for one-way travel documents to the Philippines and would probably be placed on a list of political figures barred from leaving the country.
 Mrs. Aquino's executive secretary, Franklin Drilon, said the Government had prepared more than 25 charges of criminal tax fraud against members of the Marcos family, including 11 cases against Mrs. Marcos. [Formal charges were filed by the country's Solicitor General, Francisco Chavez, Reuters reported from Manila.]
 The Government accused Mr. Marcos of stealing more than $10 billion through extortion and kickbacks during his 20 years as President, and keeping much of the fortune in foreign bank accounts.
 The announcement by the Aquino Government comes at a time of distress for the Philippines. Unemployment has passed 15 percent, inflation is near 20 percent, and some Filipinos feel that Mr. Marcos set the country on its economic decline.
 The conditional offer to return, they say, is a sign of the vengefulness that Mrs. Aquino's Government continues to feel toward the Marcoses.
 But many doubt that she could become a political force.
 "It definitely is already the post-Marcos era," said Jim Paredes, a Philippine songwriter now on tour in California. "It's even hard to make anti-Marcos jokes now. People are just tired of it. Imelda is already peripheral."
 Still, the possibility of a return by Mrs. Marcos, and the chance that she would seek the presidency, caused a flurry of concern among some politicians in the Philippines.
 "You cannot discount Mrs. Marcos," said Juan Ponce Enrile, an opposition leader who served as Defense Minister in both the Marcos and Aquino Governments and whose turn against Mr. Marcos early in 1986 was a major factor in his ouster.
 Mr. Enrile was later dismissed from the Cabinet by President Aquino, who suspected him of a role in coup plots against her. He is now a declared candidate for President.
 Mrs. Marcos said last night that a trial in the Philippines would focus on the same documents as the trial in the United States. But she said it would constructive if it could "terminate the Marcos issue."
 "It is the responsibility of every widow to bury her husband," she said.
 Mrs. Marcos has maintained a kind of vigil for the late President, beyond his death. His body has been preserved in a refrigerated, glass-enclosed crypt in Honolulu.

HEADLINE: B.C.C.I.'s Flashy Man in Argentina

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, July 31

 BODY:
After I understood the country, the people and the culture," Ghaith R. Pharaon once said after arriving in Argentina in 1981, "I realized that the future was right here, and I decided to stay."
 For a while, it seemed his perfect homeland. The Saudi-born, Harvard-educated financier arrived with an impressive bankroll backed by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which, American investigors say, used him as one of its leading front men in a host of acquisitions. 
His penchant for flamboyance -- he regularly landed in town on his private Boeing 737 -- played skillfully to an Argentine weakness for gaudy displays of money and fast living and a wistful fascination with political power. In a country whose current President, Carlos Saul Menem, is of Arab background, Mr. Pharaon (pronounced far-OWN) seemed a welcome guest. He was often referred to as the "Arab magnate" or "the modern Pharaoh."
 
B.C.C.I. in the Shadows
 Mr. Pharaon initiated a string of investments, ranging from the opening of B.C.C.I.'s office here to a five-star Hyatt hotel in downtown Buenos Aires to a huge plantation in Salta, a northwest province. His affair with Argentina even led him to apply for citizenship in 1988.
 The Ghaith Pharaon story in Argentina is almost a paradigm of B.C.C.I. in third world countries -- the courting of top officials, the hiring of prominent economists and the weaving of a web of investments, or seeming investments, with B.C.C.I.'s presence always in the shadows.
 But as the sprawling empire of B.C.C.I. collapses amid charges of fraud, money laundering and weapons trafficking, and as regulators, governments and investigators try to sort out who came under its influence, Argentines are turning their backs on Mr. Pharaon.
 Just this week, for example, the Argentine central bank closed B.C.C.I.'s offices here. And a court investigating President Menem's in-laws yesterday ordered the seizure of B.C.C.I.'s records, raising suspicions that the bank and Mr. Pharaon might have been involved in a money laundering scheme involving drug deals.
 Almost every political figure who has come into contact with Mr. Pharaon over the years -- including President Menem and the former head of Argentina's central bank, Javier Gonzalez Fraga -- are distancing themselves from him.
 Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve Board in the United States proposed to bar Mr. Pharaon from owning or being an officer of an American banking institution.
 And his hotel, which is nearly completed, has become the brunt of jokes throughout this city, with newspapers referring to it as the "White Temple," the "Narco Hyatt" and "The Five Stars of Narco-trafficking."
 
'Really Delivered'
 Some offered a modest defense of Mr. Pharaon. They noted that he had not been indicted, that when he had begun investing in Argentina the Government did not know anything about charges of laundering drug money and that his investments represented fresh funds for the capital-starved country.
 "Over the years I have heard many promises by investors that they plan to put money into Argentina," said Alberto Kohan, former chief of staff to President Menem. "And Pharaon is one of the few who after promising really delivered. The funds were not brought in suitcases, and he abided by the laws of Argentina."
 But Mr. Pharaon's history of investment in Argentina might best be described as many promises and many plans but most likely only modest amounts of real cash.
 His two biggest projects, the Hyatt Hotel and the plantation, were financed through debt swaps, in which B.C.C.I. bought Argentine foreign debt at a huge discount and cashed it in with the central bank at a sizable profit. While the face amounts of those investments were $37.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively, it is not known how much they really cost the Saudi financier.
 Lawyers close to some suits involving Mr. Pharaon say his total Argentine investment may not exceed $10 million.
 Efforts to reach Mr. Pharaon through his hotel corporation in Argentina were unsuccessful.
 And Mr. Pharaon has not helped his own case recently.
 In April, before a judge who was questioning him about money laundering, Mr. Pharaon blurted out that while indeed B.C.C.I. had laundered money, so had other banks. "All, all of them are equally criminal," he said. "But only B.C.C.I. and the Arab banks are identified with laundering drug money. All are guilty and delinquent."
 Then, in an interview in a newspaper in Chile, where he has also been building a hotel -- but with few delays -- he dropped a not-so-gracious remark about doing business in Argentina.
 "It is clear that in Chile, as opposed to other countries, there isn't corruption," he told El Mercurio in April. "Outside, unfortunately, you cannot do business without political favors."
 
Citizenship Application
 But perhaps his biggest mistake in Argentina might have been his citizenship application. In June 1988, he filed the document and made it very clear he was still intimately involved in B.C.C.I.'s affairs and that he was a big shareholder in the bank.
 Since then, he has tried to distance himself from the bank by saying that he sold his 16 percent stake in the institution in January 1986, more than two years before the time he listed in his citizenship papers.
 Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau has that document and is likely to raise the discrepancy to challenge Mr. Pharaon's credibility, according to a lawyer here who provided Mr. Morgenthau's office with the document.
 Mr. Pharaon's most controversial investment has been the Hyatt hotel in Buenos Aires, which he has said will have suites that cost $2,500 a night. He received permission to build it in late 1988 under the Government of Raul Alfonsin, but not without a battle from some prominent citizens.
 The site of the hotel had been park of sycamore trees that were at least 100 years old just next to the city's famous wide central strip, La Avenida 9 de Julio. The night Mr. Pharaon received permission to build, the trees were cut down.
 The land also included a mansion built in the 19th century by the Alzaga Unzue family, a three-story building considered one of the great monuments to Argentina's days of glory. Although Mr. Pharaon has promised not to demolish the mansion, the hotel will dwarf it.
 The oppositon succeeded for a time, until in the final hour of the city government's 1988 legislative year, a bill was mysteriously swept through chainging the status of the land to commercial. Suddenly, Mr. Pharaon had clearance to build.
 His initial investment in the hotel immediately soared to $12 million from $3.5 million, and many wondered if someone had been paid off.
 In the process, Mr. Pharaon cozied up to as many top officials as he could. Twice he met with President Menem on the project. Mr. Pharoan also employed Mr. Gonzalez Fraga who subsequently became head of the central bank under Mr. Menem. Mr. Gonzalez Fraga has denied that he had been an assistant to Mr. Pharaon or that he was hired by the financier to work on the financing of the hotel.
 The hotel is nearly completed and officials of Mr. Pharaon's Hotel Corporation of Argentina said there was no danger of halting construction.
 
Accusations of Money Laundering
 As for B.C.C.I.'s operations in Argentina, bankers here said it never took deposits and functioned more as a financing arm for Mr. Pharaon's activities.
But the suspicions that Mr. Pharaon was engaged in money laundering continued to dog him. In mid-1989, Rogelio Garcia Lupo, a prominent journalist, published a book on the Paraguayan strongman Alfredo Stroessner and included a chapter on Mr. Pharaon's dealings there. It concluded that Mr. Pharaon was engaged in money laundering.
 That quickly generated a libel suit, which is still pending, and resulted in the declaration last April by Mr. Pharaon that B.C.C.I. and other banks had been engaged in money laundering.
 Where it ends is anyone's guess. Today, Argentina's Attorney General called for an investigation by the central bank into the financing of B.C.C.I. in Argentina. Mr. Pharaon's picture is in the newspapers daily. Several members of Argentina's opposition party in Congress are also investigating, but it will be hard for them to turn the issue into political gain since the Alfonsin Goverment gave the initial go-ahead on the hotel and the chartering of B.C.C.I.'s offices here.
 And Mr. Pharaon's love affair with Argentina has obviously cooled. Last September, he withdrew his application for citizenship, and he is now believed to be vacationing in southern France.

HEADLINE: Education Chief: at Eye of Diversity Storm

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
When he tries to explain what is wrong with New York State's social studies curriculum, Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol often uses the example of Christopher Columbus. Teaching that Columbus "discovered" America, he says, ignores the Indians who were already here.
 But the state syllabus has for many years been blending the story of Columbus with Indian history. Textbooks used by the very Scarsdale schools that Mr. Sobol headed before becoming Commissioner in 1988 spend a chapter on Indian civilizations before turning to Columbus, who gets 13 paragraphs. 
To Mr. Sobol's critics, his haste to criticize the syllabus for something it is not doing any more betrays the essentially political nature of the quest to make the curriculum reflect a broader spectrum of cultures.
 
Commissioner as Lightning Rod
 But to Mr. Sobol and his supporters, the Columbus example is nothing more than a handy way to illustrate a complex scholarly issue that he considers pivotal to the future of education and even society itself.
 The sharply divergent views of Mr. Sobol's use of a small anecdote reveal the degree to which Mr. Sobol has become a lightning rod in the fiercely emotional storm raging around multicultural education. In many ways, his conduct has become almost as large a part of the debate as the curriculum's philosophical and educational merits.
 It was largely because of his enthusiasm that the Board of Regents, the policy-making body for the state's public and private schools, voted 12 to 3 on Thursday night to let Mr. Sobol push ahead with a curriculum revision.
 But to Mr. Sobol's critics, his leadership on the issue in the months before the vote betrayed an exaggerated sensitivity to the feelings of black and Hispanic legislators who had questioned the appointment of a superintendent from overwhelmingly white Scarsdale. The result, they say, threatens to be a distortion of history that overstates ethnicity at the expense of a common European-bred heritage and democratic values.
 "He has misrepresented the curriculum as if the argument is whether we should have multiculturalism," said Kenneth Wade, who resigned in March as head of the Education Department's social studies bureau largely out of frustration with Mr. Sobol's handling of this issue. "New York has been a pioneer in multiculturalism. It's been a case of setting up a straw man and knocking him down."
 
'Really a Great Vision'
 The critics also say that Mr. Sobol has inflamed the ethnic tensions his proposal was aimed at healing. They say he has closed his eyes to remarks hostile to whites and insensitive to Jews that have been made by some advocates of revision.
 Mr. Sobol's admirers, including Dr. Walter Cooper, a regent from Rochester, say that the tensions surrounding his work reflect ethnic tensions in the larger society, although some seem to acknowledge that greater diplomacy might have been helpful. "I think he has a really great vision of where education should go," said Louis Grumet, executive director of the New York State School Boards Association. "I think sometimes he thinks so much about that vision, he doesn't stop to think about ways to implement it that won't disrupt the entire system."
 The 59-year-old Mr. Sobol is a courtly man of slender build whose speech bears strong traces of Boston, where he grew up. He admitted that "short term, yes," his effort "may seem to have had a polarizing effect."
 
Society at a Crossroads
 "But that underneath tension has been there right along," he said. "And what we're doing is bringing it to light so we can deal with it."
 In an interview in his stately mahogany-paneled Albany office, where the peals of a grandfather clock interrupted sentences that occasionally bordered on the apocalyptic, Mr. Sobol said he had undertaken his mission with a sincere belief that American society was at a crossroads. "I think you can make a very convincing case that the future of this country is being written right now in what happens or what fails to happen to young people in the large cities," he said.
 Without a thorough education for these youngsters, he warned, we will "continue to have an underclass consigned to relatively bleak lives on their own and constituting certainly a drag on, if not a threat to, the well-being of the dominant social order." To educate them well, he said, "you have to know what they think, what they feel, where they're coming from, what they aspire to, what they resent."
 
A Revision 4 Years Ago
 Mr. Sobol, the son of a boxcar loader, conceded that he had managed to be successful without learning much about his father's Polish roots. But he said the world has changed. The diversity of America's population is no longer purely European in origin, and ethnic consciousness has replaced assimilation as the American ethic.
 What has bothered officials within Mr. Sobol's department about his position is that the social studies syllabus was revised four years ago with the aim of studying non-Western and nonwhite cultures. They wonder whether he is basing his misgivings on a curriculum remembered from childhood.
 Women and minority figures are laced throughout, to a fault, critics say. An eighth-grade Scarsdale textbook, adapted to the syllabus, gives six paragraphs to the literary movement known as the Harlem Renaissance, sketching portraits of Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. It gives no more space to Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Sinclair Lewis.
 In general, said Dr. Edmund W. Gordon, the Yale professor who was the co-chairman of the second of the two committees that reviewed the syllabus, teachers on his panel concluded that the syllabus was not adequately multicultural because it was repeatedly being flouted in the classroom.
 Mr. Sobol bristles at accusations that his motives are political, suggesting that his biggest liability now is the barrage he has taken from conservative critics. "Show me the political mileage I am gaining," he said.
 
Supports a Common Heritage
 Moreover, he said, the recommendations he last submitted to the Regents strongly affirm the teaching of a common heritage, as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo urged. Mr. Cuomo assailed the second curriculum panel, charging that "the worthy aims of multicultural education are being pushed to such extremes that the casualty is common sense."
 Mr. Sobol said he has not criticized the second panel or the more extreme points voiced because he has preferred to avoid "polarizing rhetoric" in an effort "to enlarge the area of consensus, not only for the sake of this debate but for the sake of this society."
 The debate has been haunted by strong ethnic resentments, some of which were voiced in front of Mr. Sobol.
 
'Owned the Slave Ships'
 In a November 1989 discussion, a regent, Adelaide L. Sanford, a former Queens principal who is black, told a consultant to the first committee, Dr. Diane Ravitch, who is Jewish, "some of your grandparents owned the slave ships that we came on," according to a tape and transcript of the discussion.
 Dr. Ravitch, now an Assistant United States Secretary of Education, informed Ms. Sanford that her grandparents were poor Jews in Poland who never owned slaves. Ms. Sanford replied she was "speaking ethnically." Ms. Sanford did not return several calls to her home and was said by an acquaintance to be out of the country.
 Mr. Sobol said that in recommending a curriculum overhaul, he had distanced himself from both committees. He ignored the second committee's call that schools prepare students for "promoting economic fairness and social justice" and that the curriculum help lift students' self-esteem.
 "There's enough altruism, enough folly and enough wickedness scattered right throughout the human race to cover us all, and what we need to tell kids is the full truth about history, not to make up things to make them feel good, not to engage in ethnic cheerleading," he said.

Ford Rebate Plan

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Aug. 1

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company changed its incentive program for its 1991 model cars and trucks by raising the cash rebates on some vehicles. The company will now provide $2,000 rebates on its three Lincoln models, for which rebates were not previously available. The company also increased rebates in the Northeast for Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars, Aerostar mini-vans and Econoline vans. Rebates on the two models of the South Korean-made Ford Festiva will be lower in the Northeast than the rest of the country. The various Ford rebates will range from $500 to $2,000 depending upon the vehicle.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher; Gold Prices Decline in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher on world currency markets yesterday in active but uneventful dealings.
Gold prices declined slightly in the United States after rising overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current deliver settled at $363.20 an ounce, down 40 cents from Wednesday's level. The Republic National Bank said gold lost 30 cents an ounce for a late bid price of $363.40. 
 The dollar held to a narrow range, with little news to spur activity ahead of today's release of United States unemployment data for July.
Analysts expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 7 percent, with non-farm payrolls posting a slight gain. The Labor Department report, which some say already has been discounted in the markets, is expected to underscore the belief that the recovery is slow.
Still, an increase in non-farm payrolls "will be positive for the dollar," at least in the short term, said John Marchese, chief economist at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
Still, currently there "isn't enough news to make the dollar break out of its current ranges," said Andrew Busch, a trader at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
Traders said there was minimal reaction to a survey of purchasing managers, which indicated that the economy grew in July for the second straight month.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 137.20 yen from 137.83 on Wednesday. Later in London, it rose to 137.65 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 137.55 yen, up from 137.36 on Wednesday.
In London, the pound fell to $1.6725, from $1.6810 late Wednesday. In New York it dropped to $1.6745, from $1.6860 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Wednesday, were: 1.7570 German marks, up from 1.7440; 1.5335 Swiss francs, up from 1.5233; 5.9700 French francs, up from 5.9310; 1,312.00 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.1498 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1513.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $363.50 an ounce, up from $363.00 late Wednesday. The markets in Zurich were closed for a national holiday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.52, to $365.44.

HEADLINE: Jordan Badly in Need of Peace Accord

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 1

 BODY:
When Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d arrives here on Friday to seek King Hussein's renewed support for the American peace initiative for the Middle East, he will find the Jordanian King eager to improve ties with America and badly in need of a settlement with Israel.
But while the King has already accepted the American proposal in principle, Mr. Baker will also find Jordan's support limited by the suspicions of many of the nearly two million Palestinians who live in Jordan. The influence of these doubters has been enhanced by the recent democratic openings here. 
 King Hussein is personally eager for a Middle East peace settlement for a mixture of political and economic reasons, Jordanian officials and foreign diplomats here agree.
With Palestinians making up about 60 percent of the country's 3.4 million inhabitants, the King and his Government fer that without a quick peace agreement, Israel will soon be forced by the continuing influx of Soviet Jews to annex the West Bank, leaving no real prospect for the peaceful establishment of a Palestinian state.
 
Fear of a Dumping Ground
 "Jordan could become the dumping ground for millions of Palestinians from all over the world," Prime Minister Taher Masri warned Parliament this week.
In a recent interview, King Hussein described the American initiative as "the last chance for a peace future generations can live with."
A settlement would also help stabilize Jordan's internal political situation, many diplomats and officials here say, by removing an irritant that has provoked insurrection in the past.
In 1971, King Hussein sent his army to expel Palestinian Liberation Organization guerrillas from the country in a struggle that came close to civil war. And last month, the Government reported unearthing a large arms cache belonging to a Muslim fundamentalist group it accused of planning bomb attacks and assassinations.
Jordan also badly needs a peace agreement with Israel to shore up its crisis-torn economy. Peace now would allow it to reduce the military budget, which absorbs more than 30 percent of government spending. A jointly negotiated Arab settlement with Israel might also improve relations with Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf Arab countries, officials say, restoring aid that was cut off after Jordan refused to join the military coalition against Iraq.
The country is in serious need of a new infusion of foreign aid to help it absorb the more than 250,000 expatriates who have fled Iraq and Kuwait since the invasion of Kuwait a year ago. Their return to Jordan has lifted the country's unemployment rate from 16 percent of the labor force to 25 percent.
But Jordan's position as home to so many Palestinians means the King and his Government can deal with Israel only on terms acceptable to the P.L.O., diplomats say. And it remains uncertain how far the P.L.O.'s executive committee will go toward endorsing the American peace approach at talks still being held in Tunis.
In Algiers today, a member of the P.L.O. executive committee, Abdallah Hourani, was quoted as saying the organization insists on naming the Palestinian part of a proposed joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to a peace conference and that it must include residents of East Jerusalem.
He also said that the P.L.O. wants international guarantees that a Middle East peace conference would lead to Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories as well as an end to Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
The Israeli Government rejects a P.L.O. presence in the delegation to the peace talks, sticking to its policy of refusing to talk to what it considers a terrorist group. Neither does it want to sit down with any residents of East Jerusalem, which Israel has annexed.
Faced with Israel's strong stand on principle, King Hussein and his ministers are appealing to the P.L.O. leadership to put principle aside. This week, the King said in an interview that P.L.O. leaders should now give top priority to alleviating the suffering of Palestinians in the occupied territories instead of pursuing policies for appearance's sake.
 
Commitment to Democracy
 The King has considerable power under Jordan's Constitution, but a new commitment to promote democracy is making it more difficult for him to exercise that authority against the wishes of the Palestinian majority in the country, diplomats here say.
Jordan held its first elections in over 20 years in 1989. The 80-member Parliament has adopted a skeptical approach to the American peace initiative, arguing that it is asking more from the Arabs than from Israel.
On July 18, Prime Minister Masri won a parliamentary vote of confidence in his Government, but by the relatively close vote of 47 to 31. This was seen as reflecting dissatisfaction among fundamentalists and Palestinian hard-liners with the King's interest in opening peace talks with Israel.
Three days later, during Secretary Baker's last trip to Jordan, Parliament passed a resolution rejecting "a peace conference that would enhance Israel's occupation of Palestine and bring to an end its enmity with surrounding Arab states" just as the King was agreeing to cooperate with the American plan.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Ex-Bonwit Chairman Joining Bloomingdale's

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Less than two months after joining the swelling ranks of merchants without stores, Frank Doroff, former chairman of Bonwit Teller, is expected to join Bloomingdale's as its executive vice president and general merchandise manager.
He will become the chain's top merchant, with responsibility for women's ready-to-wear apparel and accessories, a large chunk of the Bloomingdale's business. 
 Mr. Doroff, who was at his home in Harrison, N.Y., declined to comment. But industry sources say the highly regarded retailer will begin work at Bloomingdale's, which is owned by Federated Department Stores Inc., later this year.
Mr. Doroff, who was with Federated before joining Bonwit's, was once rumored to be a possible candidate to replace Marvin S. Traub, Bloomingdale's chairman and chief executive. Michael Gould, 48 years old, has been named Mr. Traub's heir-apparent. As executive vice president, Mr. Doroff, 42, would be Mr. Gould's right-hand man.
He would step into the shoes of Russell Stravitz, who became president of Federated's Rich's/Goldsmith's chain of department stores based in Atlanta.
Mr. Doroff gained a reputation for taking innovative risks to turn stores around while he was a senior vice president for Macy's in New York and Bullock's department stores in Los Angeles, where he was president.
Two years ago he left Bullock's to become chairman of Federated/ Allied Merchandising Services, the companies' New York buying offices, after Robert Campeau, the Canadian developer who owned the department store companies, promised him the top operating post at one of the chains. But Mr. Campeau's connections with Federated were severed after the company's voluntary bankruptcy in 1990, and the promise was unfilled.
Mr. Doroff started his retailing career in Macy's executive training program in 1972, after graduating from Washington and Jefferson College with a degree in economics and then earning a master's degree from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although he has spent almost 20 years in the retail business and comes from a retailing family -- his father was executive vice president of John Wanamaker Inc. in Philadelphia -- executive recruiters say his youth works against him.
When he announced his resignation from Bonwit Teller, Robert Nesbit, managing partner of Korn/Ferry International, a New York executive search company, said: "I think he would have to revert to his real forte, merchandising, rather than administration. I think he is still unproven as a president with its multifarious disciplines."
If he takes the executive vice president's job at Bloomingdale's, he will be following that advice.

HEADLINE: Banking Legislation in Doubt Before Congress Recesses

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
The Senate Banking Committee moved at a snail's pace today through a series of votes on amendments to a bill overhauling the nation's banking laws. The slow deliberations threw into doubt whether the panel could complete the effort before its August recess, a delay that would be a political setback for the legislation.
For the second day in a row, the committee members spent more time bickering than voting and put off debate on most of the key elements of the legislation, leaving them to further negotiations behind closed doors. 
 The postponement of the votes on scores of amendments and the complete lack of consensus on many major issues appeared to make it unlikely that the lawmakers would be able to meet a deadline imposed by the committee's chairman, Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, to complete work on the measure by the end of this week, when Congress goes into recess until after Labor Day.
The deadline was imposed because of the prevailing political view on Capitol Hill that chances of passing a broad banking overhaul diminish as the lawmakers face their final stretch of the term this fall with a full plate of other pressing issues.
The banking legislation, which was proposed by Senator Riegle, would permit banks to open new branches across state lines and also allow investment banks and commercial banks to merge. But it rejects the Administration's recommendation to permit industrial enterprises to own banks.
"The legislative window is closing on us," Mr. Riegle said at the outset today.
To be adopted, any measure that passes the committee would face a debate on the Senate floor and must be reconciled with action decided upon by the House. The House Banking Committee has already adopted a measure that more closely resembles the Administration's proposal. But it still faces serious obstacles in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, whose chairman, John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, has raised objections to most of it.
 
New Auditing Measure
 The committee approved a measure by 15 to 6 that would require bank auditors of the 2,000 largest institutions to report directly to regulators on the adequacy of management and soundness of the banks that they audit.
The proposal, which had been recommended by the General Accounting Office after it found serious accounting lapses in many institutions that have failed, was sponsored by Senator Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado.
The committee rejected an attempt to take out a provision in the legislation intended to limit the Federal Reserve from lending money to weak banks that ultimately fail. Such loans are fully collateralized by bank assets. But some lawmakers and critics of the Fed have asserted that the loans make bank collapses more costly by allowing the banks to stay afloat long enough for the largest customers to transfer their deposits.
The legislation seeks to discourage such loans, made through the discount window of the Fed, by requiring the loans to be uncollateralized.
Since earnings of the central bank are returned to the Treasury, opponents of the legislation have said the proposal giving the Fed the authority to decide to lend money without collateral would commit taxpayer funds for bailing out institutions.
 
Termed a Fundamental Change
 "We are voting here today on whether to fundamentally change the way the Fed operates," said Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, who sponsored the amendment to delete the provision. "If we enact the provision, we guarantee that the first person to lose money is not the insurance fund but the American taxpayer."
But Senator Riegle and other Democrats said Fed lending had already contributed to the taxpayer costs of the bailout of the nation's savings associations. Mr. Gramm's amendment failed 12 to 9, with the votes cast along party lines.
The banking measure approved by the House Banking Committee would continue to permit the central bank to make short-term loans that are fully collaterized to weak banks. It is supported by the Fed.
By voice vote, the committee adopted a measure by Senator Alan J. Dixon, Democrat of Illinois, that would set up a three-year pilot-project of pricing bank deposit insurance based upon a bank's financial health. Now all banks pay a flat rate of 23 cents for every $100 in deposits. The project, which would involve 50 banks with more than $1 billion in assets, would for the first time also involve the participation of private insurers to help set rates.
A similar measure has passed the House Banking Committee, but it does not rely on private insurers.
Like its counterpart committee in the House, the Senate committee also adopted a measure to provide $180 million in Federal loan guarantees to help bail out the failure last January of the private insurer of credit unions in Rhode Island. The measure, sponsored by Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, was adopted by voice vote.

HEADLINE: U.S. Judge Blocks Bridgeport From Bankruptcy Court

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Connecticut succeeded today in blocking the City of Bridgeport from bankruptcy court when a Federal judge ruled that the city, despite its financial troubles, was able to pay its bills.
Declaring that Bridgeport was not insolvent, the judge, Alan H. W. Shiff of Federal Bankruptcy Court in Bridgeport, said the state's largest city "has no choice but to continue with the budget and collective-bargaining processes." 
 Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said the ruling protected the state's commitment to help all of its distressed cities with its "full faith and credit," which would have been jeopardized had Bridgeport won and become the nation's first major city to enter bankruptcy court.
He spoke, however, at a news conference at the Capitol dominated by the threat of state offices shutting down next week because Connecticut does not have a state budget.
Judge Shiff's ruling, in any case, was strongly sympathetic to Bridgeport's financial problems and left open the door to bankruptcy court if the city's finances worsened. The city's lead lawyer, Richard D. Zeisler, said the opinion carried a strong message.
 
Need to 'Find a Solution'
 "The unions, the city and the state better get to the table in good faith and try to find a solution," said Mr. Zeisler, a partner in the Bridgeport law firm of Zeisler & Zeisler.
Bridgeport filed for bankruptcy protection on June 6, the day before a state financial review board was to set a budget requiring an 18 percent property-tax increase.
The city's Mayor, Mary C. Moran, said she hoped to avoid the tax increase by using bankruptcy court to reorganize the city bureaucracy and break "onerous and economically burdensome" union contracts. She pledged to continue paying the city's bills and bond payments.
The state board, which had ordered Bridgeport not to seek bankruptcy protection, responded by instructing State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal to block the bankruptcy bid.
The case attracted national attention as Bridgeport portrayed itself as a city abandoned by industry, left to bear alone the poverty and social problems of Fairfield County that its suburbs turned their backs on.
Judge Shiff, in ruling that Bridgeport was not eligible for bankruptcy court because it could still pay its bills, nevertheless was sympathetic to its problems and ruled against the state on important points.
In an opinion issued in July, the city won a major point when Judge Shiff ruled that Bridgeport did have authority to file a bankruptcy petition and that the state board, the Bridgeport Financial Review Board, lacked authority to bar it from doing so.
In his opinion today, Judge Shiff recalled that earlier ruling in saying that Bridgeport could return to court when it could show it would run out of money soon.
The judge also wrote that the city had "demonstrated that its ability to provide even minimal services to its residents is strained, and that its financial condition might get worse if drastic steps are not taken soon."
But, he wrote, "the flaw in Bridgeport's argument is that financial difficulties short of insolvency are not a basis" for relief under Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code.
 
Ability to Pay Debts
 "I agree with Bridgeport that a city should not have to wait until it runs out of money in order to qualify for bankruptcy protection," Judge Shiff wrote. "It must, however, demonstrate, as a condition precedent to filing, that in the near future it will run out of money and be unable to pay its debts as they become due."
The state's victory rested on its argument that Bridgeport had a $27.9 million cash reserve as it filed for bankruptcy protection, enough to operate at a $16 million deficit through the current fiscal year and still begin the next one with cash to pay its bills.
The city argued unsuccessfully that the reserve fund had to be repaid at the end of the fiscal year, and so it would be unable to pay its bills sometime in the following year.
Judge Shiff said Bridgeport was projecting too far ahead to be reliable, given the factors that could affect its financial condition, from the health of the economy to the level of state and Federal aid to labor-union concessions and a more efficient bureaucracy.
 
'Unwarranted Intrusion'
 "I conclude that to be found insolvent a city must prove that it will be unable to pay its debts as they become due in its current fiscal year or, based on an adopted budget, in its next fiscal year," he wrote.
"In the absence of that proof," he continued, "it would be an unwarranted intrusion into the political and collective-bargaining processes for a bankruptcy court to become involved in the resolution of that city's economic problems."
James Spiotto, a municipal bankruptcy expert and partner in the Chicago law firm of Chapman & Cutler, said the opinion, broke no new ground but offered a well-reasoned reminder of the purpose of Chapter 9, which was enacted during the Depression to aid troubled municipalities.
"Chapter 9 is intended to be the remedy of last resort," Mr. Spiotto said. "It is the hope that everyone addresses the problems and resolves them before you ever get there. For any large municipality, the filing of Chapter 9 creates a real trauma."
Today's ruling, however, left unclear what happens next. Bridgeport remains under orders from the financial review board to balance its $319 million budget.
Mayor Moran, at a news conference, pledged to "not raise your taxes as a result of this court's decision." She added, "The city will continue to provide the essential services necessary for the recovery of our city."
 
'Final Opportunity'
 She said she would appeal to Governor Weicker again for assistance and resume discussions with the review board and the city's unions.
"As the court has recognized," she said, "the city, the state and the unions must now use this final opportunity to cooperatively resurrect Bridgeport.
City officials and their lawyers plan to meet to decide whether to appeal the ruling in Federal District Court.
In Hartford, Attorney General Blumenthal said he and the head of the review board, William J. Cibes, the Governor's budget director, would begin studying their next step. He said the city had many ways to balance its budget without raising taxes, by, for example, renegotiating tax abatements, collecting a higher percentage of its taxes or cutting more services.
Douglas Cutler, an under secretary at the Office of Policy and Management, which Mr. Cibes heads, said one effect of the bankruptcy ruling was to "lift a cloud" from high-level discussions that have been held among state commissioners, city officials and Bridgeport business executives on how to help the city's economy.

HEADLINE: U.S. Effort On B.C.C.I. Is Assailed

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
William von Raab, the former Commissioner of Customs, today accused the Bush Administration of dragging its feet on an investigation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and of barring him from sensitive information about the scandal-riddled bank when he pushed for stronger action.
The Treasury Department, under which Mr. von Rabb served as Customs Commissioner, immediately replied that the commissioner was, indeed, kept away from sensitive information for fear he would disclose it. 
 This exchange marked another chapter in a long-running feud between Mr. von Rabb and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. Still, it also underscored the political tensions involved in the hearings on B.C.C.I. conducted today by the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and international operations.
 
Big Point of Contention
 The question of whether the Treasury Department, the Justice Department and the Federal Reserve Board ignored warnings that B.C.C.I. was engaged in criminal activities and was the secret owner of First American Bankshares Inc., a company with strong political connections, has emerged in recent days as a big point of contention between the Administration and critics in Congress and elsewhere.
Senator John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat and subcommittee chairman, has been criticizing the Government and pressing for answers as to why the Government knew so much about B.C.C.I.'s potentially criminal tendencies, yet appeared to have ignored the evidence. Mr. von Rabb was one of several witnesses during a day of accusation and official denial that produced the following accounts:
*Officials of the Federal Reserve said the bank was never informed that the Central Intelligence Agency knew at least five years ago that B.C.C.I. illegally controlled First American Bankshares, Washington's largest banking company.
*The State Department said it learned in 1986 through the intelligence community that the organization of a leading terrorist, Abu Nidal, used a B.C.C.I. branch in Europe for commercial transactions. In his written testimony, A. Peter Burleigh, the department's coordinator for counterterrorism, said that information was used to disrupt Abu Nidal's commercial activities in an international effort. A number of countries, including East Germany and Poland under Communist governments, were approached as part of the effort with requests that they close down businesses in their countries that were working with Abu Nidal.
*Jack Blum, a former investigator for the subcommittee, testified that he had been told by a former bank official that B.C.C.I. worked with "about 3,000 high-net-worth criminal clients," and that the rest of the bank's apparently legitimate banking activity was set up to shroud its business with those clients.
*According to an affidavit introduced at the hearing, a former B.C.C.I. official who had been subpoened in 1988 to testify before the subcommittee told an undercover Customs agent that he had been advised by Clark M. Clifford, who represented B.C.C.I., to get transferred to Paris to slow down Senator Kerry's investigation. Robert S. Bennett, a lawyer for Mr. Clifford, the chairman of First American, did not return a call for comment last night.
 
Reports of Weapons Deals
 The hearing also brought out a number of allegations about the bank's involvement in illicit activities and weapons deals. These included statements that B.C.C.I. had been involved in financing a shipment of Scud missles to Syria and had assisted Pakistan in its efforts to obtain triggers for nuclear weapons.
In his statements, Mr. von Raab said that he had been "eased out" of responsibility for a 1988 Customs investigation of money-laundering at B.C.C.I. in Florida, and that sensitive documents had been kept from him by order of officials with the Treasury Department just as the inquiry was reaching its peak.
"I was told I was not to have information from the B.C.C.I. case," Mr. von Raab said, "They felt I was overzealous in my drug enforcement efforts, and they were uncomfortable with the way I worked with Congress and the press to push cases."
He asserted this as part of his contention that the Government had been "lackadaisical" in its prosecution of criminal cases against the bank, which was indicted in 1988 for money-laundering at a Tampa, Fla., branch office. The bank pleaded guilty in 1990 and forfeited $14 million.
 
Plea-Bargain Agreement
 More important, the plea-bargain arrangement included an agreement that the Justice Department could not prosecute B.C.C.I. for any illegal activities that the Government was aware of at the time. The deal formally entered in the Federal District Court in Tampa in 1990.
At the time, the Justice Department had possession of tape recordings, made by undercover Federal agents, in which B.C.C.I. officials openly claimed to control First American Bank and could rely on the influence of its chairman, Mr. Clifford, a prominent Washington lawyer and Democratic presidential adviser.
Mr. von Raab's criticism was a footnote to a long history of clashes with Mr. Brady and criticism of the Administration's drug enforcement efforts. Upon leaving his job in 1989, Mr. von Raab wrote an emotional letter to President Bush, warning him that that the Treasury Department, the State Department and the Justice Department did not have the zeal to fight a war on drugs.
But today, the Treasury Department replied with unusual bluntness. Desiree Tucker-Sorini, a spokeswoman for the department, confirmed that Mr. von Raab had been precluded from seeing classified information in the B.C.C.I. investigation after a Federal prosecutor in the case complained that there had been leaks of sensitive documents that could jeapordize the case.
 
Limited Distribution
 "The decision was made at that point to limit the classified information to the very pure definition of who needs to know," Ms. Tucker-Sorini said. "From then on, there was a limited distribution solely to the people investigating the case. No information was withheld from the people working on the cases."
In response to the former Customs Commissioner's criticism that Federal prosecutors had allowed B.C.C.I. to escape serious penalties, Doug Tillett, a Justice Department spokesman, said that Mr. von Raab never made his objections known, and that the deal had been supported by others who brought the case against the bank in Tampa.
 But Mr. von Raab said much of the support developed as a result of the team of Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations firms hired by B.C.C.I. during its legal troubles. He said that after the bank was indicted for money-laundering, it was able to plead guilty and forfeit only $14 million -- relatively modest for a global bank with $20 billion in assets -- partly because of the "influence team working up and down the Eastern seaboard" on behalf of the bank.
That team, he said, included Mr. Clifford and Patton, Boggs & Blow, a Washington law firm with close ties to the Democratic Party, as well as Hill & Knowlton, the public relations firm headed by Robert Gray and Frank Mankiewicz, both of whom had successful political careers before entering the public relations business.
Robert S. Mueller 3d, who has headed the department's criminal division since last September, said none of the bank's lawyers had ever approached senior officials with the Justice Department on behalf of B.C.C.I. or First American. Mr. Mueller's predecessor, Edward S. G. Dennis, said in an interview that he could recall no contact with the bank's representatives.
Mr. Mankiewicz, the vice chairman of Hill & Knowlton, also disputed Mr. von Raab's testimony, calling it "incredibly irresponsible and false." In a statement, Mr. Mankiewicz said no one at his firm, including Mr. Gray, had ever contacted anyone in the Administration or in Congress about B.C.C.I.

Peruvian Official Resigns
 LIMA, Peru, Aug. 1 (Reuters) -- A Peruvian representative at the World Bank, a former official of Peru's central bank who also once worked for the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, resigned today.
"Mr. Brian Jensen, who worked in B.C.C.I., has been in the post of alternative assistant in the World Bank," Peru's Economy Minister, Carlos Bolona, said at a news conference at the Government palace. "Mr. Jensen is definitely no longer in this post."
Mr. Bolona said Jensen's relationship to B.C.C.I. "was the factor that determined his resignation." He did not say, however, that Mr. Jensen had been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with B.C.C.I.
"We are trying to determine responsibilities," Mr. Bolona said.
Mr. Jensen, who is also a former official of Peru's central bank, could not be reached for comment.
Peru's Attorney General has opened an investigation into possible wrongdoing by former central bank officials in connection with B.C.C.I., which was seized by regulators in several countries last month amid allegations of widespread fraud. Earlier this week, the Manhattan district attorney's office accused two former Peruvian central bank officials of accepting bribes from B.C.C.I. in return for deposits.
Peru's President, Alberto Fujimori, has said his Government would take strong action if it found crimes had been committed in connection with B.C.C.I.
Mr. Jensen was general manager of Peru's central bank in 1984 when the bank approved the opening of a B.C.C.I. branch in Lima. The branch never opened, however. Mr. Jensen was employed by B.C.C.I. when Peru placed the reserves in the bank in 1986, during the administration of former President Alan Garcia.
Juan Candela, who was central bank chief at the time the decision was made to deposit the reserves, said, "I do not know of any action that Mr. Jensen may have made on behalf of Peru."
Mr. Candela said he was not aware of any bribes or commissions in connection with the deposits. He said the decision to place the reserves with B.C.C.I. was made after the bank offered Peru a $60 million credit line on the condition that Peru place $200 million dollars in the bank.
"There were very few banks that were willing to lend money to Peru at that time," Mr. Candela said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Holding the Edge In Paper Business

BYLINE: By Jonathan P. Hicks

 BODY:
THESE are not the best of times for paper companies. The recession has left them with sinking profits, sagging demand and eroding prices for a number of products.
For example, the price of market pulp, the material from which paper is manufactured, has plunged 35 percent in two years, while prices of coated paper -- the slick paper used in magazines and advertising supplements -- are down 10 percent in that period. Even bleached board, the profitable paper used for frozen-food containers and packaging for cosmetics, has languished. 
 But the International Paper Company has gone against the grain. In this difficult economic environment, the company, the world's largest paper producer, has outperformed its competition. While profits for the industry dropped 38 percent last year, International Paper earnings fell by only 16 percent.
Fortified by acquisitions of paper companies in Europe and specialty paper-related companies in the United States, International Paper has managed to post earnings that, while lower than those in year-earlier periods, have been the envy of the industry.
Now, though, some question if this will last. Recently, International Paper announced that second-quarter earnings dropped 44 percent from the period last year. While many analysts predict that the industry on average will see an earnings drop of about 50 percent -- some companies are expected to report losses -- the recent earnings suggest that the gap between International Paper and its competitors is narrowing.
Indeed, the features that analysts credit with keeping International Paper's financial performance above the competition are the same ones that are now the source of their concerns.
For one, International Paper expanded in Europe in the last few years with acquisitions of paper producers. The company has also acquired domestic paper-distibution companies, stable businesses that, while generating low margins, are not capital intensive. In addition, the company has acquired profitable makers of photographic plates and chemicals.
And while other domestic paper producers were spending huge sums adding capacity, International Paper concentrated on acquisitions and spent little on machinery.
But the recent strengthening of the dollar and the signs of weakness in Europe have caused some analysts to question how well International Paper will fare in the coming quarters compared with competitors.
"Over the last two years they have done all the right things to shield their earnings decline," said Sherman Chao, an analyst with Salomon Brothers. "But growth in Europe is now slowing and the likelihood that the domestic economic recovery will be gradual suggests that we will have little price recovery in the paper industry."
Officials at International Paper suggest that the second-quarter drop represents the bottom of the cycle and that the company will continue to outperform the competition, particularly those companies with a similarly broad-based mix of products like Boise Cascade, Georgia Pacific and Westvaco.
"Many analysts look at the economic situation in Europe and suggest that we will be adversely affected because of softness there," said Robert C. Butler, chief financial officer for International Paper. "But there are more factors than our geographic diversity that will enable us to outperform our competitors."
Mr. Butler said the company's specialty and distribution businesses, which account for about a third of sales and include nonwoven fabric products, imaging products and chemical operations, "don't have cyclicial swings in earnings."
Also, he added, "In most of the commodity grades, we are a low-cost producer if not the low-cost producer."
Mr. Chao predicts that International Paper's earnings will fall to $3.90 a share for all of this year, down sharply from $6.47 in 1990. But he forecasts that earnings will rebound, to $4.50 a share next year, as the economy improves.
Some analysts have been more optimistic. "The industry consensus is that their earnings will be about $4.30 for this year," said Robert E. Hanss, an analyst with Edward D. Jones & Company. "Even with their exposure in Europe and the economic problems in the industry, we still expect International Paper to be heads and tails above the others in the industry."
Investors apparently agree. the stock, which was at $53 at the beginning of the year, closed yesterday at $68.625, off 87.5 cents for the day.

HEADLINE: Public Works Aging Fast, Report Says

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
New York City's antiquated sewers, water mains, roads and bridges are falling apart faster than the city is fixing them, according to a new engineering study that is the first to measure both the aging of the system and the current pace of repairs.
It paints a grim picture of New York circa 2030 in which pipes are bursting like cheap balloons and citizens are struggling without running water for days on end; in which roads and bridges are being closed for fear of collapse, and every corner of the city is immobilized in epic traffic jams. 
 The study also proposes a solution: money.
"The good news is that it is all manageable and fixable if we put a long-term plan into place now that spreads the cost over many years," said Samuel I. Schwartz, an engineering professor at the Cooper Union Infrastructure Institute and a former deputy transportation commissioner for the city.
He said his study is the first to assess the age of the city's water distribution, waste management and transportation systems and to provide a time frame for when these systems will reach the end of their life cycle.
 
A Worst-Case Scenario? <EH>
 City officials acknowledged yesterday that the system is deteriorating, but said it is not useful to predict conditions so many years in advance. Current repair plans will change, they said, according to need and economic conditions.
Ian Michaels, a spokesman for the city's Environmental Protection Department said that while the agency is reviewing the study, the findings appear to paint a worst-case scenario. "We realize full well that these aging water mains will have to be replaced and they will in fact be replaced," Mr. Michaels said. "The city would certainly not allow conditions to deteriorate to the point where an entire neighborhood would not have water for several days."
Joseph DePlasco, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation, said: "I think the report is a good first step and it's important that private groups are looking at the city's infrastructure and analyzing what it will cost us to return it to a state of good repair."
The Cooper Union study found that most of the city's water mains, sewers, bridges and streets were constructed starting in the 1890's and that these public works, which have an average life span of about 100 years, will reach maturity within the next 30 to 40 years. By the year 2020, more than one-quarter of all the city's mains will be 100 years old and by 2040 the percentage will rise to 40 percent.
By the year 2030, the study says New York City is expected to have more than 1,600 water main breaks annually, given the current rate of repair. That compares with 601 water main breaks in 1990.
"We cannot afford to wait for the day when all the mains start breaking and sewers collapsing," Mr. Schwartz said. "By then it will be too expensive and too late, and virtually nothing we can do about it." To reverse the trend, Mr. Schwartz said that a long-term plan must be formulated to spread the cost of repairing the city's infrastructure over time and to insure that financing for such a rebuilding program is not cut in hard economic times.
The Cooper Union report contrasts sharply with the upbeat assessment of the city's infrastructure that was provided by the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, in which Mr. Schwartz served as deputy transportation commissioner. In 1989, Koch administration officials said that there was "a misunderstanding about the state of the city's infrastructure" and that the city's public works were rebounding.
Mr. Schwartz said that such an assessment was "probably a lot rosier than it should have been" and was made in the wake of an election campaign.
The study found that the city's current replacement cycle for water mains is 150 years, and for sewers it is 255, while the useful life of both is estimated at 100 years. The researchers said that it is important to replace water mains and sewers before they reach the end of their life cycle because many of them were not designed to withstand the stresses caused by subways, heavy traffic, and construction and are particularly susceptible to breakage.
The study noted that the city's street repair policy has shifted to repaving and away from reconstruction, in which sewers and water mains are replaced. Streets like Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, which has water mains that are 120 years old, are likely to suffer major breaks, the report said.
Clark Wieman, chief researcher for the Cooper Union study, said that deferring maintenance and repairs on the city's infrastructure will be more costly for the city in the long term. For example, he said that if the city reconstructed sewers at the end of their useful lives instead of replacing collapsed sewers, it would save nearly $150 million on sewer reconstruction over the next 10 years. He estimated that the city could save $250 million a year by adopting a preventive maintenance program for all the city's bridges.
The study was based on data provided by city agencies, municipal employees, and studies performed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Seeking Fairer Health Coverage

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
MOST business executives, Government officials and union spokesmen deplore the failure of the health-care system to serve the growing numbers of Americans who do not have medical insurance. For one thing, with at least 33 million people uninsured, their largely unpaid hospital and doctor bills are often passed along in higher costs to employers and others who pay for health care.
Companies that have good health plans pay for the care of 16 million employees' spouses, for example, who have jobs with other employers that do not provide coverage. And millions of Americans are covered only for big-ticket emergencies. 
 The inadequacies of health coverage are a growing national concern, as shown in recent opinion surveys. But the political problem is to make the system more equitable without upsetting the many influential participants -- doctors, hospitals, insurers and employers -- that have blocked previous proposals for change. And, of course, there is the thorny problem of how to pay for expanded care.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, disclosed cost estimates last week for a health-care bill that he is co-sponsoring with George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate Democratic leader. Economists who developed the plan said at a Senate Labor Committee hearing that it would add $18 billion, or about 2.4 percent, to the $756 billion in current health-care spending, as more people gain access to the system. The economists contended that such an increase would not undermine employment or hurt American competitiveness overseas.
The Kennedy-Mitchell bill would expand coverage for the poor, replacing the existing Federal-state Medicaid program. Physicians' fees would be raised to attract doctors who currently shun these patients. John Sheils, a vice president with Lewin/ ICF, a Washington-based consulting firm, said state and local government health-care spending could drop by at least $7 billion as Federal responsibility grows.
The Democratic proposal would probably add $28 billion to $30 billion to Federal spending, according to Mr. Sheils and Karen Davis, chairman of the department of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. The Congressional Budget Office is preparing its own estimate.
Under the plan, all employers would either have to provide basic benefits or pay a 7 percent payroll tax to help finance a public program. To attract support from groups that fought previous health-care plans, the burden would be relatively light for small businesses with only a couple of low-paid employees: only $105 a month, for example, for an $18,000 annual payroll. And Mr. Sheils said that large employers might save $12 billion, as hospitals and doctors stopped shifting to them the costs for people who do not pay.
He added that small businesses already typically spend 7 percent of their payroll on health benefits, when they can afford them. Large employers spend 4 percent to 5 percent for basic coverage and perhaps 2 percentage points more for extras that, not incidentally, add to health-care inflation.
The Mitchell bill would supersede state laws that specify types of coverage like chiropractic and dental care. It would retain coverage of prenatal and well-baby care, pap smears, mammograms and mental health services. Companies with narrow profit margins could get tax credits to reduce their health costs.
Trying to rein in the runaway costs and utilization of care that are expected to add at least 12 percent to national health expenditures this year, the bill would create a Presidential commission to set spending targets. And to encourage local price competition, hospital fees would be published. Measures that restrict health maintenance organizations in some states would be outlawed.
If hospitals and doctors were unable to agree with the commission on the spending targets, as seems likely, the targets would be published anyway to guide Federal and private insurers. Ms. Davis notes that Medicare, the Federal program for the elderly, is already trying spending targets for physicians. And because the Medicare spending exceeded the target percentage increase last year by 1.5 percentage points, the Department of Health and Human Services has reduced its request to Congress for Medicare fee increases for 1992 by an equal amount.
Sharon Canner, an assistant vice president with the National Association of Manufacturers, called the Mitchell-Kennedy bill "a good first step" that is "forcing some of the discussion." But Ms. Canner noted that the Bush Administration had yet to address it. She said she did not expect a new health-care law to be enacted until after the 1992 Presidential election campaign.
Stephen H. Long, an economist in Washington with the Rand research group, said that "desperation" with the health-care system's shortcomings "seems to be deeper and wider than it's been for a lot of years." But he added that it was still "not very clear what is going to handle the cost-control problem."

HEADLINE: Jackson Organizing March From Bridgeport to Hartford

 BODY:
The Rev. Jesse Jackson plans to lead a march through Connecticut from Aug. 11 to 17 to draw attention to the social impact of the budget crises in the state Capitol and in Bridgeport.
Mr. Jackson said he intended to walk at least 55 miles from Bridgeport, which yesterday lost its bid for bankruptcy protection, to Hartford, where the failure to pass a state budget caused a partial shutdown in state services in July. 
 "I'm urging people to mass mobilization," Mr. Jackson said yesterday, adding he would demand "attention for distressed municipalities and human needs."
Mr. Jackson wants the Connecticut General Assembly to "define what the human needs would cost" and "what it would cost not to address them." He listed unemployment, health care, education and housing as some of the issues cities face.
The National Rainbow Coalition is organizing the march.

HEADLINE: After the Summit;
Bush, in Ukraine, Walks Fine Line on Sovereignty

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: KIEV, U.S.S.R., Aug. 1

 BODY:
Walking a fine line in the struggle for self-rule that is bedeviling Mikhail S. Gorbachev, President Bush warned today of the excesses of "suicidal nationalism," but said the United States would not choose sides between the Government in Moscow and restless Soviet republics.
Still Mr. Bush spent much of his day here praising Mr. Gorbachev and his vision of the Soviet Union. 
 Descending from the summit diplomacy of Moscow to the grass-roots fervor of the Ukraine, the President said he would reject the "false choice" being pressed on him by some separatists -- either supporting Mr. Gorbachev or the independence leaders of the Soviet republics.
"We will not try to pick winners and losers in political competitions between republics, or between republics and the center," the President said, stopping here for a six-hour visit after finishing his two-day meeting in Moscow with Mr. Gorbachev.
"That is your business, and not the business of the United States of America," he said to the Ukrainian Parliament in a speech that included the caution that democratic unity is urgently needed if the Soviet Union is to resurrect its economic and political life.
 
Endorsement of Gorbachev
 "Americans will not support those who seek independence in order to replace a far-off tyranny with a local despotism," he said. "They will not aid those who promote a suicidal nationalism based upon ethnic hatred." [Excerpts, page A8.]
But for all his proclaimed neutrality in the nation's sovereignty struggle, Mr. Bush made a point of strongly endorsing the program of Mr. Gorbachev in liberalizing the country. The Soviet leader was the object of complaint and some derision among the street crowds, but Mr. Bush stood fast.
"In fairness, President Gorbachev has achieved astonishing things," he said in his Parliament speech. And later in the day, he even linked Mr. Gorbachev with Lincoln as a man who believed that history should be studied for its truth and not "to settle political scores."
"We will maintain the strongest possible relationship with the Soviet Government of President Gorbachev," Mr. Bush declared. "But we also appreciate the new realities of life in the U.S.S.R. and therefore as a federation ourselves we want good relations -- improved relations -- with the republics."
The President got a kaleidoscopic if brief look at Kiev during his visit, moving out quickly from the airport, where the welcoming committee included some Ukrainians in embroidered belted blouses that billowed in the stiff wind of a cloudy day. He was not the first American President to visit Kiev; Richard M. Nixon was here in May 1972.
 
Visit to Babi Yar
 Beyond addressing Parliament, the principal event for Mr. Bush was a visit to the Babi Yar memorial. This sculpture stands in mourning for the scores of thousands of people shot to death and their bodies thrown into a forest ravine by the Nazis in 1941-43.
In his comments at the monument, Mr. Bush declared: "For many years the tragedy of Babi Yar went unacknowledged, but no more. You soon will place a plaque on this site that acknowledges the genocide against the Jews, the slaughter of gypsies, the wanton murder of Communists, Christians, of anyone who dared oppose the Nazi madman's fantasies."
The killings at Babi Yar began with the machine-gun execution of more than 33,000 Ukrainian Jews over 36 hours beginning on Sept. 29, 1941. In the next 18 months, many tens of thousands more victims, both Jews and non-Jews, were killed as the mass executions continued.
"Babi Yar was the beginning of the fascist genocide of the Jews," said Aleksandr Burakovsky, co-chairman of the Sholom Aleichem Cultural and Education Society, who said the Soviet authorities still resist acknowledging that half or more of all the victims were Jewish. "The fact that they refused to say anything specific about the Jews is a sign that anti-Semitism has not really died here."
 
'Inspires Great Confidence'
 On the flight from Moscow, Mr. Bush spoke with high respect for Mr. Gorbachev.
"You're dealing with a man who is coping with enormous problems and handling them well," the President said aboard Air Force One.
"The man just inspires great confidence in you," he continued, chatting in the aisle, wearing a white windbreaker imprinted with a map of the world.
Crowds of Ukrainians proudly welcomed the American visitor as evidence that the republic, with 52 million people and deep agricultural and industrial resources, is potentially the independent equal of some Western European countries.
Fervent chants for independence broke out at some points. There was a sense in the streets of the Ukrainians enjoying both the moment and the momentum in their quest for sovereignty.
 
Evolution of Nationalism
 This push began a year ago with a surprising declaration endorsed by the Communist majority in the republic's Parliament. It continued with student protest strikes and has lately evolved into resisting Mr. Gorbachev's hopes for a new, more workable form of power-sharing with the republics.
"This is the first signal that the outside world is finally viewing us as a sovereign nation, not as part of Moscow's periphery," said Zenon Lotsunyak, a 50-year-old lawyer watching along the parade route.
Petro Sarafanyuk, a 14-year-old student in an embroidered Ukrainian shirt who was moving amid an independence demonstration of several thousand marchers, said, "I think Bush should pressure Gorbachev to stop squelching our movement toward independence." Another student said Mr. Bush should deal only with popularly elected leaders and withhold aid "until the Communist-fascist regime has no money in its pockets."
The crowd was particularly sensitive to the power the Ukraine currently holds: It is being courted by Mr. Gorbachev to approve a new union treaty, with its provisions for increased power-sharing with the republics.
The Ukrainian leadership, sensing the growing popular demand for self-rule, has been delaying the quick approval of the treaty sought by Mr. Gorbachev.
Mr. Bush endorsed the Gorbachev approach, telling Parliament that the new agreement "holds forth the hope that the republics will combine greater autonomy with greater voluntary interaction" and thereby avoid "the hopeless course of isolation."
What Mr. Bush sought to avoid as a "false choice" was more or less the issue being pressed on him by independence demonstrators who sometimes politely, sometimes stridently, lined the President's parade route. They waved yellow-and-blue independence flags and protested that he had not given a separate audience to the leaders of the Ukraine's leading independence movement, called Rukh.
The Rukh chairman, Ivan Drach, rebuffed in seeking a private meeting, complained that Mr. Bush had no sense of the true democratic struggles under way in the republics. He belittled the President as a "messenger" fresh from the summit gathering who had been "hypnotized by Gorbachev."
 
Communists With Survival Skills
 Nevertheless, Mr. Drach was included in a luncheon gathering with the President. It was given at the 250-year-old Mariinsky Palace by Leonid M. Kravchuk. He is the highly adaptive Communist leader who is chairman of the republic's Parliament and is widely regarded as the front-runner in the republic's presidential election, scheduled in December.
White House specialists had carefully researched the convoluted politics of the Ukraine, in which the Communists have retained their power, for now at least, by recasting themselves in relation to the drive for Ukrainian nationalism.
As "sovereignty Communists," they have maintained an ever-shifting, 2-to-1 edge in Parliament over an opposition minority that, with its own aggressive discord, still provides the cutting edge for insurgency in the republic.
Thus, the 50-guest luncheon list for President Bush was a blend of Mr. Kravchuk and the ranking Communists of the government, plus some opposition leaders. Chief among them were Mr. Drach; Levko Lukyanenko, chairman of the Ukrainian Republican Party; Yuri Shcherbak, chairman of the Green Party; Volodymyr Yavorisky, a member of Parliament, and Igor Yukhnovsky, leader of the National Council, the opposition legislative bloc.
The day of bristling politics, and a few quick motorcades across the rich green Ukraine before Mr. Bush returned to the White House tonight, offered him a portrait of a republic that is virtually a separate nation from the power centers of Moscow.
In contrast to Moscow, the President found a far more excited and politically involved public here. Many Ukrainians heatedly debate between outright independence or militant nationalism as the best alternatives for curtailing the power of the central Government.
 
'No Heartburn'
 President Bush said on Air Force One that he had asked Mr. Gorbachev in advance whether he had any concerns about his touching down here.
"No, there is no heartburn at all that I can detect about going there," he said. "And I think we'll handle it with proper balance."
He added that Mr. Gorbachev "feels he has assurances" that the Ukraine will eventually support the new union treaty.
Opposition politicians theorize that Mr. Kravchuk, as a transmogrified Communist, will hedge on the treaty until after the December presidential election and then, once elected, will support it.
Mr. Bush left Moscow with a freshly signed strategic arms agreement as a promise against future war. He left here with a remembrance of a past war's atrocities at Babi Yar.
"In the vast quiet here," the President said, "something larger than life assails us: the shadows of past evils, the light of past virtue."
The Babi Yar memorial where Mr. Bush spoke is not at the actual site of the Nazi massacre of civilians in the fall of 1941. This was done a mile away by firing squads' systematically shooting families of people so that their bodies tumbled into the natural grave of the ravine.
Two years later, when the German armies were in retreat, they sought to cover the evidence by having the bodies retrieved and burned near what is now the memorial site. The grisly pall from the burning bodies hung over Kiev for days and is well remembered by older residents.
The memorial, put up in 1976, depicts 11 victims as they die at the edge of the ravine, the central figure being a Communist resistance fighter.
Mr. Burakovsky, the co-chairman of the Sholom Aleichem Society, said that whereas a century ago there were six million Jews in the Ukraine, now there are 500,000. Most of them -- perhaps 350,000 -- have plans to emigrate, he said, because of the lack of economic opportunity for their families.

HEADLINE: As the Games Begin, Havana Is Glowing With Self-Satisfaction

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAVANA, Aug. 1

 BODY:
After five years of wondering whether their hometown could meet the challenge, the people of this tough-minded city full of contradictions and rustic charm are prepared to welcome athletes from 39 hemispheric neighbors Friday evening for the beginning of the Pan American Games.
As recently as this spring there were serious questions about the ability of Cuba -- in the face of a severe economic crunch and growing diplomatic isolation -- to complete all the construction needed to accommodate 17,000 athletes, journalists and tourists for 16 days. 
 But now, a day before the opening ceremonies at Pan American Stadium, the facilities are ready and the visitors have been accommodated. And Havana, glowing with a sense of self satisfaction, is preparing to reward itself.
An atmosphere of want and need, created by chronic shortages of basic supplies, has given way -- for the time being -- to rapidly escalating good feeling.
And for the Cubans who will admit it, there is an overriding feeling of amazement that the work has been finished.
"To do this with so few resources, in such a short time during this special period and to do it with quality has been good," said Ulices Sanchez, a nurse here.
 
'We Cannot Complain'
 Sanchez and his wife, Rosa, strolled through the Miramar section of Havana with their 3-year-old daughter, Yanetsys, eating ice cream and enjoying a balmy summer evening. They agreed that Cuba's ability to complete the work was a monumental achievement.
"The Pan American village is beautiful," said Rosa, also a nurse. "I studied in Cojima, and that area used to be a desert. The multipurpose center is beautiful; those are works I myself thought would never be finished on time. Even in January it looked as if they were just beginning."
Her husband cut in: "Not January. In May people said it was not going to be finished. The velodrome is one of the things I thought would never be finished, and the bowling alleys. But you see, they are done. So we cannot complain."
"Just imagine," Rosa added. "After such a long time we've been struggling so that the games will be held here and they are here. I think it's a step forward in relationships with others."
Onidia Parrodi Diaz, an unemployed woman in her mid-20's, said the games represented a change of pace, an opportunity to meet new people and an excuse to party.
"For the next three weeks young people are going to be very happy," she said. "It means entertainment, amusing ourselves, going out for parties.
"I also feel excited because we are going to meet Americans, French, Russians, Spaniards, Venezuelans. And I think because everybody contributed to the games everybody is happy. It is a sense of satisfaction."
 
Something for Their Money
 But the games are also expensive, some estimates putting the cost at $156 million. This at a time when homes of the masses are crumbling, food is in short supply and the majority of Cubans are not allowed to possess United States currency.
Ivan Valladares, a waiter at a tea room near Luyano section of Havana, said that Cubans would receive a high return on their money. "After the games finish, everything used for the games will be used by the population," he said. "There are people who have needs, people who really live in a chaotic situation. That's life around the world. When the games finish, all those facilities built for the games will be used for the people."
Asked if he had any special feelings for visitors from the United States, Valladares said, "I regard all the visitors here as brothers, even the United States. As long as they come as brothers, I will treat them as brothers."
For Cubans like 71-year-old Arturo Sosa Martinez de Celis, the Pan American Games, for all their excitement, are a mere pebble in Cuba's long, winding history.
A former medical translator, he lives by himself in a weatherbeaten white cottage that faces a beach and sits at the end of a dead-end street in Santa Fe, a city about 11 miles outside of Havana.
His father built the house in 1936 as a second home for his Havana-based family. After the revolution, Celis moved from Havana to the five-room cottage and teaches English, sometimes in his home, "sometimes in my pupil's house."
His interest in the games is not high ("At my age?" he said) but theoretical. "Every country needs something of this importance," he said.
The presence of the games here, and the infusion of tourists and dollars, represents a new phase for Cuba and a respite from the decades of isolation it has suffered since Fidel Castro came to power three decades ago. "Will I go to the games?" said Celis. "Maybe. I don't know exactly. I don't leave here very much. I'm out of everything."
The old man sighed and stared in the distance at the Pan de Gujaibon mountains. "Everything is older now," he said. "The only thing beautiful now is the sea and the sunset."

HEADLINE: Senate Votes $5.8 Billion For Extended Jobless Pay

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
The Senate tonight passed a $5.8 billion program to extend unemployment benefits to people who have been out of work more than half a year.
After a week of delaying actions by Republicans in both houses, passage came swiftly tonight on a voice vote with no opposition heard. 
 The House is expected to adopt the measure Friday, but what President Bush will do when it goes to him is uncertain. All week long his senior aides have been saying they would advise him to veto the bill.
Since last week Democrats have seized on jobless benefits as an effective political issue, contending that Mr. Bush was ready to declare emergencies to help the Kurds or the Bangladeshis. They made that argument again tonight. "The Bush Administration has an economic program for every country in the world except this one," said Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan. "Tonight we're stepping up to help the American people."
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that about three million people would be eligible for benefits before the temporary program expires next July.
 
Bush Declaration Needed
 The bill would declare a "dire emergency" under last year's budget act, a declaration necessary to allow adoption of measures that would increase the Federal deficit.
But as the Senate bill was drafted, the benefits would only flow if Mr. Bush not only signed the bill but also issued a declaration that an emergency existed.
Tonight Republicans sought to make it clear, as Senator Bob Dole said, that "no one disputes the pain and hardship of many of the unemployed." But he argued that it was unwise to add to the deficit and said it was untimely because the recession was ending. He proposed a smaller program, costing $3.2 billion, and proposed raising the money through various methods.
Another measure Mr. Dole obtained as political cover for his party was an agreement that there would be no roll-call votes, so Republicans would not be put in the position of either voting against the Administration or against the unemployed.
Senator Bentsen concentrated on the domestic argument, saying, "Today we have an opportunity to help families pay their rent; to help them buy gas for the car so they can get out and look for a job; to help them keep food on the table and kids in school."
 
Tapping a Trust Fund
 Mr. Bentsen said his bill was spending money that had already been raised by taxes for a trust fund intended to pay for extended benefits. He said the bill was necessary because the standards of existing law made it too hard to qualify for benefits, and $8 billion had piled up in the fund.
Under current law, benefits can be extended beyond the regular 26 weeks in a state when joblessness among those covered by unemployment insurance reaches 6 percent in that state, or when the insured jobless level exceeds by one fifth the average levels in that state over the past two years. In only Alaska, Maine and Rhode Island and in Puerto Rico are the long-term unemployed now eligible for extended benefits, which are now paid half from state and half from Federal funds.
The bill, whose entire cost would be paid by the Federal Government, would shift the standard from the insured unemployed rate to the total unemployed rate in a state, on the ground that if total unemployment is very high, then it is very hard to find a job, regardless of insured status.
In states with 8 percent unemployment, averaged over the last six months, an additional 20 weeks of benefits could be paid. In states where the level was at least 7 percent, 13 weeks could be paid. In states with 6 percent or more, 7 weeks of benefits could be paid. In all other states, four extra weeks of benefits could be paid.
Finally, military veterans, who now have to wait four weeks to collect any benefits and can then collect them for only 13 weeks, would be eligible like civilians for 26 weeks of regular benefits, after only a one-week wait.
 
A Temporary Measure
 The bill would be effective from Sept. 1 through next July 4. After that the old standards will apply.
A key to tonight's agreement, after Democrats in both bodies had denounced the Republicans for delay, was accepting the Senate version of the bill, rather than the similar House measure.
One reason was that the Senate bill is temporary, while the House bill was permanent.
But even more important was the fact the President could thwart the extended benefits under the Senate bill. Under the House bill, if the bill was passed over his veto, it would go into effect anyway, thus contradicting the principle of the budget act that both the legislative and executive branches had to agree before an emergency could be declared.
A final reason for the agreement, which contemplates that the House will pass the bill around midday Friday, was that fact that Congress has scheduled a five-week vacation period to begin this weekend. The Democratic leaders of both houses had insisted they would keep Congress in session this weekend to get the bill passed if the Republicans kept delaying.
Referring to the anxious desire ofmany of his colleagues to leave on vacation, Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, observed, "those jet engines are beginning to whine."
 
Fewer Jobless Seeking Benefits
 WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 (Reuters) -- The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell nearly 5 percent in mid-July, the Government said today, signaling possibly brighter job prospects.
New applications for unemployment insurance fell to a seasonally adjusted 404,000 in the week ended July 20, a drop of 21,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department said.
"This is indicating that the job situation is improving somewhat," said Jean Sundrla, an economist with Evans Economics Inc. in Washington, a private economic forecaster. "It's in line with other indicators that say the economy is continuing to improve very slowly."
Among those indicators was a new report from the National Association of Purchasing Management that showed its index of manufacturing activity in more than 300 companies at 51.8 percent on July 31, its highest since April April 30, 1989, when it reached 52.1 percent.
Also, the nation's gross national product, which measures the total output of goods and services, grew at a 0.4 percent annual rate between April and June. Although the gain was slight, it was the first sign of revival after two quarters of contraction.
The Labor Department will release its report on national unemployment in July on Friday.

HEADLINE: Gulf War, and Peace, Revisited

 BODY:
Before 100 hours passed, the ground war had turned into a "turkey shoot." With word from Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf that Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard was shattered and his nuclear capacity "neutralized," the President decided the fighting had gone on long enough. The invasion of Kuwait that horrified the world a year ago today had been undone.
Americans greeted the Feb. 28 cease-fire with relief and pride -- relief at miraculously few U.S. casualties and pride in the brilliant performance of the allied forces. 
 Yet a remorseless Saddam Hussein remains in power, cruelly repressing Kurds and Shiites, defiantly playing nuclear hide-and-seek and maliciously manipulating the Iraqi people's misery. Even liberals who thought Mr. Bush was too quick to pull the trigger in January now wonder if he should have finished off Saddam Hussein and his army when he had the chance.
But the doubters do not do justice to Mr. Bush's restraint. With the benefit of later information showing, for instance, that Iraq's losses had been overestimated, Americans can sensibly wish he had gone on somewhat longer. But even with hindsight, his decision deserves credit.
That can be seen by asking what if Mr. Bush had gone all the way, wrecked the rest of Iraq's war machine, marched to Baghdad and overthrown Saddam Hussein?
With no evident successor to restore Iraq's unity, defend its borders or even maintain rudimentary services, there probably would have been a plague of troubles: many more allied and civilian casualties . . . protracted civil war, with allied troops by the thousands caught in the middle . . . Americans hated throughout the Arab world as an occupying army.
For all the ugly ambiguities of the actual consequences, Mr. Bush has avoided the quagmire and preserved his two triumphs: the extraordinary cooperation among coalition members and the revived self-confidence of Americans.
This was very much George Bush's war. He defined the options and framed the debate, at home and abroad. He gambled his Presidency on a quick and decisive struggle, and won. In personalizing the conflict, he tended to identify regional security and stability with the end of Saddam Hussein's army and rule. These goals were critical to his contention that the international economic embargo on Iraq would not suffice, necessitating the use of armed force.
But even if Mr. Bush overpersonalized the war, he was careful to defer to his allies. He thereby assured their loyalty and also enhanced the prospects for enduring cooperation in Iraq and for new coalitions in the future. That may disappoint unilateralists in the U.S. who hoped the war would give rise to a Pax Americana. But it's the most promising way to bring a measure of stability and security to this troubled region.
It is obviously impossible to render a final judgment now on Mr. Bush's war policy. We and others argued last fall that it would have been wiser to give the international economic embargo against Iraq more time to deny Iraq its billions in oil revenue. We thought he was in too much of a hurry to start shooting. That said, the President was right to stop it when he did.
By thundering on to Baghdad, Desert Storm might have brought some immediate satisfaction to Americans who have grown increasingly frustrated and furious about Saddam Hussein. But had that happened, just imagine where Americans would be today, a year after the invasion: still in Baghdad, in more danger and more frustration, and with no end in sight.

HEADLINE: One Year After the Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait: What Did Winning Mean? And What's Next?;
Blood, Sweat And Paradox

BYLINE: By Roger Morris; Roger Morris, author of "Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an American Politician," was on the staff of the National Security Council under Presidents Johnson and Nixon.

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M.

 BODY:
At the moment of the German surrender in May 1945, the Supreme Allied Commander, Dwight D. Eisenhower, called for a toast. The Champagne turned out to be flat. It was an omen, some thought later, of the spoiled, cold-war peace that lay ahead.
A year after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and five months after the apparent triumph of Operation Desert Storm, the taste of victory in the Persian Gulf remains similarly stale, if not yet bitter, for the Commander in Chief, George Bush. 
 For all its anguish, the results of this eventful year have been paradoxical at best. Kuwait is free of Iraqi conquest yet unfree of its own feudal oppression. U.S. arms triumphed in the gulf, yet Europe and Japan remain dependent on Arabian oil and the U.S. is hostage to its own refusal to pursue energy alternatives. War curbed the real or imagined threats of Saddam Hussein, yet his thuggish regime survives. The awful human toll mounts, still uncounted, no end in sight.
Mr. Bush assembled the most impressive coalition since World War II. He balanced disparate interests, partially destroyed Iraq to hold Iran and other would-be territorial predators at bay, and even kept lines open to the Jordanians and Palestinians despite their pro-Iraqi sympathies.
Yet the Arab allies were soon riven by old factionalism, which divided them on further actions toward Iraq, thwarting gulf security arrangements, threatening to draw the U.S. by default into an uneasy military protectorate over the region.
War did not reduce the vast gap between Middle East rich and poor, and volatile resentment at Western domination. Despite his tyranny, Saddam Hussein symbolized these grievances to millions by defying the status quo. Anti-American fundamentalists and radicals remain sullenly undefeated from Teheran to Algiers.
Diplomatically, President Bush's war policy, whether as expedient or principle, lent an authority to the U.N. not seen since the Korean War. Washington's invocation of international edict and collective action, however, now compels it to observe resolutions on Palestine and ultimately to confront Israel, our client.
Israel, the silent partner in the Desert Storm coalition, was defended during the war as never before by American patronage and for the moment is rid of a menacing enemy. But even the erratic Scud missile attacks exposed the irrelevance of the occupied territories as strategic buffers.
However sternly Mr. Bush denied "linkage," the war brought unprecedented U.S. pressure on the Israelis to settle the Palestinian issue. The result in August 1991 is an Israel more militarily secure than ever, more politically challenged than a year ago.
Not least are the American paradoxes of this year of yellow ribbons. In punishing Iraq, Desert Storm was also a showcase war, a deterrent demonstration of might to subdue spreading doubts about American power. At home, it was a war to end the shame of the last, a staging of pride and prowess against deep feelings of unrequited sacrifice.
Yet a tortuous postwar period has raised new questions about the limits of U.S. power, the impotence of Mr. Bush's policies beyond the battlefield. The great expedition also left untouched the root economic and social condition of the U.S. No satellite reconnaissance is needed to see an America even more troubled this summer than last.
With so much of its prestige invested, and a secure peace yet so unfinished, the U.S. has more at stake in the Middle East today than when Iraqi tanks churned into Kuwait last August. The efficacy of Washington's showcase war has come to depend on an equally exemplary peace.
The symbol and substance of that peace is an Israeli-Palestinian settlement, a task requiring U.S. leadership no less than in Desert Storm, with long-term American interests uniquely in the balance.
It is not only that Mr. Bush pledged to his Arab allies that he would turn after the fight to heal this old wound, or that a settlement would effectively disarm anti-American Arabs -- though both factors are crucial to stability in the Middle East. Just as the war displayed military power, an Israeli-Palestinian peace through American mediation will show political-diplomatic strength of incalculable value in dealing with both resurgent allies and reborn adversaries in the complex new world of the 1990's.
To succumb to the old drift is only to fortify Middle East enmities. To abdicate initiative to the Europeans is to squander the influence and leadership won in the war. To cede a settlement to a U.N. resolution is to reduce the U.S. to veto or acquiescence. To suffer diplomatic defeat in the wake of military victory is to breed distrust and disillusion at home, where the political reaction would be unpredictable.
Far more imposing to Mr. Bush than Saddam Hussein and his peasant army is an obdurate Israeli regime, being led to the peace table by Secretary of State James Baker. Mr. Baker's shuttle diplomacy has produced initial Arab concessions but scant progress from Israel. The U.S. effort is also haunted by the pro-Israel lobby, perhaps the most impregnable bloc supporting the interests of a foreign government ever assembled in American politics.
Like Desert Storm, the peace campaign will demand Mr. Bush's all-out commitment of Presidential power. But as in the war, he does not lack means.
Internationally, an Israeli-Palestinian peace is the one cause that still unites the gulf crisis coalition. Moreover, just as Soviet temperance was crucial in the gulf war, Moscow, as it has indicated in this week's summit, will be a ready ally in negotiations -- both as a great power presence in future regional guarantees and as a potential arbiter.
In moving the Israelis, the White House has not only $5.6 billion in annual U.S. aid vital to Israel's economy, but also the $10 billion requested by Israel for housing loan guarantees over the next five years, money necessary to cope with the flood of Soviet immigrants who are demographic insurance for Israel's long-term hold in the Middle East.
Against pro-Israeli support, much of it Democratic, the President can marshal most of his own party, new allies in the American Jewish community and, ultimately, the vast, grass-roots constituency of Desert Storm.
Before his eventual preoccupation with re-election in 1992, President Bush has a fleeting chance to show that we can construct as well as coerce, sustain as well as savage, that Desert Storm was not the spasm of an ebbing power but part of the statesmanship and world leadership he always claimed.
Beyond a Middle East peace lies a renewed opportunity to engage worldwide challenges of poverty and famine, education and disarmament, and in new-found security to turn to America's needy homeland. It is altogether the test of his Presidency.
A year after the violation of Kuwait's frontier, months after Desert Storm's guns fell silent, our real Middle East crisis is only beginning.

HEADLINE: When Politics Topples Precedent, That's Chaos

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Court Reversals" by John W. Farrell (letter, July 23) deals with an important subject in constitutional law and sorely needs correction. Overruling precedents recently made is quite different from overruling decisions that were themselves in conflict with earlier decisions, and from overruling old decisions after substantial changes in social and economic conditions have occurred. 
 Mr. Farrell cites cases in three areas: segregation, the right to counsel and the role of the judiciary in reapportionment. On segregation, a half-century had elapsed between Plessy v. Ferguson and Brown v. Board of Education, and a growing part of the population had come to see racism as an evil. It had also become clear that "separate but equal" was a fatuous notion, enforced separation being itself a form of inequality.
As for the right to counsel, the decision in Betts v. Brady (1942), overruled by Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), was itself contrary to decisions of the Court rendered in 1932, 1936 and 1938. As to Baker v. Carr (1962), the legislative-district case, there was no precedent to overrule, no holding directly in point.
Our law, essentially the Anglo-American common law, involves the judiciary in both attachment to prededent and adaptation to changing conditions and ideas. The law must be reasonably stable so that we know where we stand. But the world is not immobile. Adherence to precedent is a gravitational pull rather than an unyielding hobble.
The present Supreme Court, in contrast to its predecessors, overturns decisions recently made despite the absence of social or economic developments that might require a different judicial response. As Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist puts it, a precedent may be overruled because it was "badly reasoned." That is, he may ignore the precedent because he prefers his reasoning to that of those who set the precedent. Or, as Associate Justice David Souter says, a precedent may be overruled because it was "wrongly decided." That is, he would have decided it differently.
Such thought destroys our legal system. We are given a prescription for chaos.

HEADLINE: MONY, Sorely Tested, Reassures Customers

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
The Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York boasts about its 148 years in the business, its 145 years of uninterrupted dividends and its financial strength as the nation's 13th-largest insurance company. Even the company's more familiar name -- MONY -- seems to instill confidence.
But now MONY's reputation is being sorely tested. Two weeks ago, Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating of the company's financial strength to Baa-1, which effectively means "adequate," from A-2. The change makes MONY the only one of the nation's 20 biggest insurers not to receive an A-or-higher rating, which implies "exceptional," "excellent" or "good." 
 Moody's, which commands enormous attention in the financial community, cited the size of MONY's capital cushion and concerns about its portfolio of mortgages and real estate investments.
The lower rating comes despite the fact that MONY's management has moved for more than a year to increase its capital cushion, raise cash and jettison money-losing operations. The company has been talking with American International Group Inc., another insurer based in New York, and other companies about joint ventures or transactions to increase its capital -- only the latest indication that its management is eager to bolster its financial condition.
But all its efforts may be futile if fears about the company's strength and solvency scare policyholders and pension investors into a run that could turn a manageable situation into a devastating crisis. Hoping to prevent the kind of withdrawals that have badly hurt some other insurers in recent months, MONY has been taking out newspaper ads to reassure policyholders and has even set up an 800 number, open 11 hours a day, to answer questions. It has also been meeting with some of its pension fund clients.
Analysts say that MONY and insurers like it can probably survive and thrive if given the opportunity and time to improve their balance sheets.
"My impression is that they have been moving quickly to get out of losing lines, cut losses short and take some action to boost surplus," said Fred Townsend of Townsend & Schupp, a firm that advises, among others, corporate treasurers who buy guaranteed investment contracts from MONY. "In my view they were taking steps to improve what had been a below-average performance in the past few years."
 
Claims of Financial Strength
 The company's top management defends its financial strength by insisting that MONY's surplus capital is more than enough and that its talks with potential investors are simply business as usual.
"We do not feel our levels of capital are inadequate," said Michael I. Roth, president of MONY. "If someone was to come to us with capital we would look to deploy that capital to grow our business."
James B. Farley, MONY's chairman and chief executive, emphasized that the talks the company has had about raising capital have nothing to do with its liabilities.
MONY has had troubles on several fronts. Real estate investments and mortgages represent percentages of the insurer's invested assets that are substantially above the industry averages. The total mortgage portfolio is $5.5 billion, including $300 million for farm loans. At the end of this year's first quarter, mortgages represented about 40 percent of the insurer's $14 billion or so in assets, which is substantially above the 24.5 percent average for the industry.
 
Rise in Nonperforming Mortgages
 The nonperforming mortgages for the insurance industry went from an average of 2.4 percent in 1989 to 3.1 percent in 1990, while MONY's nonperforming mortgages went from 1.8 percent to 3.5 percent.
Direct investments in real estate totaled about $740 million at the end of the first quarter. Those investments are carried at book value, not market value. Given the troubles of the real estate markets and how difficult it is to judge value, the market value of some of these investments may fall substantially below their book value.
In the first quarter, MONY foreclosed on about $23 million of real estate, which regulators say represents a slight increase over the amount on which it foreclosed in the year-earlier quarter. The total foreclosed property on the company's books rose $109 million last year and totaled about $274 million at the end of the first quarter this year.
 
Extent of Troubled Real Estate
 At year-end, delinquent mortgages totaled about $169 million, leaving the company with at least $443 million in troubled real estate on its books. Because mortgages and real estate investments are carried at book value rather than market value there is the potential that the company has substantially bigger real estate problems. Mr. Roth said a special $73 million fund would be established by year-end to guard against such a surprise.
Junk bonds are another area that troubles MONY. About 9.5 percent of MONY's $5.9 billion of bonds are rated below investment grade, with about a third of that rated B or lower by the ratings agencies and the other two-thirds rated BB. According to Weiss Research, a Palm Beach, Fla., firm that rates insurance companies, the junk bond holdings represented 186 percent of the company's capital at the end of last year.
The company's executives argue that more than half of its junk bonds fall in that vast middle area of medium-quality, below-investment-grade securities, but analysts find little comfort in that argument. Mr. Roth emphasized that MONY has had a strong record managing its portfolio of junk bonds.
 
A Borderline D-Plus Rating
 The junk bonds and the heavy mortgage exposure are the greatest concerns Weiss researchers have about MONY, to which they give a borderline D-plus rating. (Weiss, with its consumer orientation, uses a grading system that descends from A to F.) Weiss estimates that on a risk-adjusted basis, MONY has less than 68 percent of the capital it needs to remain solvent during an average recession and 41 percent of the capital it needs during a severe recession with a large number of defaults.
"They are undercapitalized and their investments are weak, so any activity they could implement to raise capital would help them," said Anthony McCoy, Weiss's director of research.
MONY has about $806 million in surplus capital and in a mandatory contingency fund for losses on bonds, preferred stock and common stock. The company has not set up reserves for its mortgage portfolio and is not required to, so losses in that area are charged against capital surplus.
In addition to the real estate and junk bond exposure, MONY has suffered over the last few years with money-losing group health and disability insurance businesses. The company's group health business has lost about $181 million over the last five years. There have also been losses in other subsidiaries.
MONY claims $4 billion in liquid assets. Of those assets, 41.5 percent are bonds and 69 percent of those bonds are private placements. The resale market for the private placement bonds might be quite thin if the company had to raise cash quickly. MONY has $14 billion in liabilities, of which about $9.8 billion can be withdrawn on demand. The pension liabilities are about $6.8 billion, with $2.2 billion in guaranteed investment contracts, $2.3 billion in group annuity contracts, $970 million in (401)k plans, plus other liabilities.
"If you assumed there was little liquidity in their private placement bonds, we would estimate their liquid assets at $2.5 billion and their demand liabilities at $9.8 billion," Mr. Townsend said, meaning that if MONY had to raise large amounts of cash on short notice it might not be able to raise enough to cover all its liabilities, because not all the privately placed bonds would be quickly sellable.
Mr. Roth has defended the liquidity of MONY's private placement securities by noting that a major investment bank has promised the company that if necessary $1 billion could be raised in three weeks on the portfolio of $3.6 billion in private placement junk bonds.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 3, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A table in Business Day yesterday with an article about the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York misstated the relationship of mortgage investment to statutory equity in one listing of figures for several insurance companies. The figures, which were correct, were for mortgages as a multiple of equity, not as a percentage of equity.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Bush's Ukraine Speech: Working 'For the Good of Both of Us'

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: KIEV, U.S.S.R., Aug. 1

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's speech today to the Ukrainian Parliament:
 This beautiful city brings to mind the words of the poet Aleksandr Dovzhenko: "The city of Kiev is an orchard. Kiev is a poet. Kiev is an epic. Kiev is history. Kiev is art."
 Centuries ago, your forbearers named this country Ukraine or frontier because your steppes link Europe and Asia. But Ukrainians have become frontiersmen of another sort. Today you explore the frontiers and contours of liberty.
 Though my stay here, as I said, is far too short, I've come here to talk with you and to learn. And for those who love freedom, every experiment in building an open society offers new lessons and insights.
 You face an especially daunting task. For years people in this nation felt powerless, overshadowed by a vast government apparatus, cramped by forces that attempted to control every aspect of their lives. And today your people probe the promise of freedom. In cities and republics, on farms, in businesses, around university campuses, you debate the fundamental question of liberty, self-rule and free enterprise.
 Americans, you see, have a deep commitment in these values. We follow your progress with a sense of fascination, excitement and hope. And this alone is historic. In the past, our nations engaged in duels of eloquent bluff and bravado, and now the fireworks of superpower confrontation are giving way to the quieter and far more hopeful arts of cooperation.
I come here to tell you we support the struggle in this great country for democracy and economic reform. And I would like to talk to you today about how the United States views this complex and exciting period in your history, how we intend to relate to the Soviet central Government and the republican governments.
 
 
 
U.S. Support Outlined
 In Moscow I outlined our approach. We will support those in the center and the republics who pursue freedom, democracy and economic liberty. We will determine our support not on the basis of personalities but on the basis of principles. And we cannot tell you how to reform your society. We will not try to pick winners and losers in political competition between republics or between republics and the center. That is your business. That's not the business of the United States of America.
 Do not doubt our real commitment, however, to reform. Do not think we can presume to solve your problems for you. Theodore Roosevelt, one of our great Presidents, once wrote: "To be patronized is as offensive as to be insulted. No one of us cares permanently to have someone else conscientiously striving to do him good. What -- we want to work with that someone else for the good of both of us." That's what our former President said.
 We will work for the good of both of us, which means that we will not meddle in your internal affairs.
 Some people have urged the United States to choose between supporting President Gorbachev and supporting independence-minded leaders throughout the U.S.S.R. I consider this a false choice.
 In fairness, President Gorbachev has achieved astonishing things and his policies of glasnost and perestroika and democratization point towards the goals of freedom, democracy and economic liberty.
 We will maintain the strongest possible relationship with the Soviet Government of President Gorbachev, but we also appreciate the new realities of life in the U.S.S.R. and therefore, as a federation ourselves, we want good relations, improved relations with the republics.
 Lord Acton once observed,"The most certain test by which we judge whether a country is really free is the amount of security enjoyed by minorities." Freedom requires tolerance, a concept imbedded in openness, in glasnost, and in our First Admendment protections for the freedoms of speech, association and religion, all religions.
 
 
 
Freedom and Hope
 Tolerance nourishes hope. A priest wrote of glasnost: "Today more than ever, the words of Paul the Apostle spoken 2,000 years ago ring out. 'They counted us among the dead but look, we are alive.'
 In Ukraine, in Russia, in Armenia and the Baltics, the spirit of liberty thrives. But freedom cannot survive if we let despots flourish or permit seemingly minor restrictions multiply until they form chains, until they form shackles...
 And yet freedom is not the same as independence. Americans will not support those who seek freedin in order to replace a far-off tyranny with a local despotism. They will not aid those who promote a suicidal nationalism based upon ethnic hatred.
 We will support those who want to build democracy. And by democracy we mean a system of government in which people may vie openly for the hearts and yes, the votes of the public. We mean a system of government that derives its just power from the consent of the governed, that retains its legitimacy by controlling its appetite for power...
 Democracy is not a technical process driven by dry statistics. It is the very human enterprise of perserving freedom so that we can do the important things, the really important things -- raise families, explore our own creativity, build good and fruitful lives.
 In modern societies, freedom and democracy rely on economic liberty. A free economy is nothing more than a system of communication. It simply cannot function without individual rights or a profit motive, which give people an incentive to go to work, an incentive to produce. And it certainly cannot function without the rule of law, without fair and enforceable contracts, without laws that protect property rights and punish fraud.
 
 
 
Free Economies
 Free economies depend upon the freedom of expression, the ability of people to exchange ideas and test out new theories. The Soviet Union weakened itself for years by restricting the flow of information, by outlawing devices crucial to modern communication, such as computers and copying machines. And when you restricted free movement, even tourist travel, you prevented your own people from making the most of their talent. You cannot innovate if you cannot communicate.
 And finally, a free economy demands engagement in the economic mainstream. Adam Smith noted two centuries ago: "Trade enriches all who engage in it. Isolation and protectionsim doom its practitioners to degradation and want."
 I note this today because some Soviet cities, regions and even republics have engaged in ruinous trade wars....The vast majority of trade conducted by Soviet companies, imports and exports, involves, as you know better than I, trade between republics. The Nine Plus One Agreement holds forth the hope that republics will combine greater autonomy with greater voluntary interaction -- political, social, cultural, economic -- rather than pursuing the hopeless course of isolation.
 And so American investors and businessmen look forward to doing business in the Soviet Union, including the Ukraine. We've signed agreements this week that will encourage further interaction between the U.S. and all levels of the Soviet Union. But ultimately, our trade relations will depend upon our ability to develop a common language, a common language of commerce-currencies that communicate with one another, laws that protect innovators and entrepreneurs, bonds of understanding and trust.
 It should be obvious that the ties between our nations grow stronger every single day. I set forth a Presidetial initiative that is providing badly needed medical aid to the Soviet Union, and this aid expresses American solidarity with the Soviet peoples during a tie of hardship and suffering. And it has facilities in Kiev that are treating victims of Chernobyl.
 You should know that America's heart, the hearts of all, went out to the people here at the time of Chernobyl.
 An old Ukrainian proverb says, "When you enter a great enterprise, free your soul from weakness." The peoples of the U.S.S.R. have entered a great enterprise, full of courage and vigor, and I've come here today to say we support those who explore the frontiers of freedom. We will join these reformers on the path to what we call, appropriately call a new world order...
 This has been a great experience for Barbara and me to be here. We salute you. We salute the changes that we see. I remember the French expression, "Vive la difference," and I see different churnings around this chamber and that's exactly the way it ought to be. One guy wants this and another one that. That's the way the process works when you're open and free, competing with ideas to see who's going to emerge correct and who can do the most for the people in Ukraine.
 And so for us, this has been a wonderful trip, albeit far too short. And may I simply say may God bless the people of Ukraine. Thank you very, very much.

Chief Leaves Square D As Schneider Moves In

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

 BODY:
No one was surprised when Jerre L. Stead stepped down yesterday from his job as chairman, president and chief executive of the Square D Company, the $1.65 billion electrical distribution equipment giant. Once Square D was acquired by Groupe Schneider S.A., the French electrical equipment maker, in May, analysts said it would be only a matter of time until Mr. Stead moved on.
"He was not entirely in favor of the takeover, so I'm not surprised he is leaving," said Russell Leavitt, an analyst with Salomon Brothers. 
 Employees in the company's Palatine, Ill., headquarters will be told today that Didier Pineau-Valencienne, Groupe Schneider's chairman and chief executive, will take on those titles at Square D and that Charles W. Denny 3d, who has been with Square D for 31 years, will become chief operating officer. Mr. Denny, 55, will oversee day-to-day operations of Square D and report to Mr. Pineau-Valencienne. Both appointments are on an interim basis but are expected to become permanent in October, Mr. Stead said.
Square D was acquired for $2.23 billion in a hostile takeover by Schneider after a 10-week fight. The deal made Schneider the world's largest maker of electrical distribution equipment including circuit breakers, switches and infrared measurement devices.
Mr. Stead, 48, said he planned to announce his new job on Tuesday. He refused to give any details. He has been with Square D for four and a half years, joining the company in 1987 as president and chief operating officer and becoming chairman in 1989. Before joining Square D, he was an executive at Honeywell Inc.
Mr. Stead said the merger would be completed within 30 days and it was time to "move on to other challenges." He acknowledged that there was concern on the part of employees about his plans, but he insisted that employees had remained neutral throughout the merger process.
Despite his initial rejection of the takeover attempt, Mr. Stead says he has had an excellent relationship throughout with Mr. Pineau-Valencienne and is pleased with the transition. He said Mr. Pineau-Valencienne had asked him to stay on for five years when the merger first happened, but that he said at the time he would only remain through the transition period.
Mr. Stead said he announced his departure about a month early to settle the question for employees as to whether he would stay or leave. "The global business market is far too demanding for the energy to be wasted on me staying or leaving," he said.
Mr. Stead said he had actively pushed for Mr. Denny to be named chief operating officer. Mr. Denny has been executive vice president in charge of Square D's $1.2 billion worldwide electrical distribution business since 1989.
A native of Middletown, Ohio, Mr. Denny holds a bachelor's degree in economics from Wesleyan University and an M.B.A. from Northwestern University. He joined the Barkelew Electric Manufacturing Company in 1960 and stayed on after Barkelew was acquired by Square D in 1967.

HEADLINE: One Year After the Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait: What Did Winning Mean? And What's Next?;
Oil Business, Not Oil Politics

BYLINE: By Daniel Yergin; Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, is author of "The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Iraq's bid to dominate world petroleum supplies lies smoldering in the still burning oil fields of Kuwait. The aftermath of Baghdad's defeat could turn into a period of calm for oil producers and consumers. For, while the Persian Gulf crisis turned out to be about oil and geopolitics, its outcome suggests that the "business of oil" could take precedence over the "politics of oil" in the years immediately ahead.
The U.S., along with some coalition partners, has assumed an explicit role in assuring the secure flow of oil, and that certainly affects the orientation of the oil exporters. 
 OPEC, as always, reflects the balance of interests and power among its members. Today, Saudi Arabia is more dominant among the exporters than ever. Committed to moderate prices and stable supplies, it has no doubt that its fortunes depend on the Western economies; and, with a quarter of proved world oil reserves, it wants to be assured of a long-term market. At the same time, the crisis demonstrated that Saudi security is entwined with the West.
But the Saudis' strategy is not much different from that of most other exporters, who have much greater respect for the power of the marketplace today than in the era of oil nationalism. They have learned that customers count, and they want to demonstrate that they are reliable suppliers. Even Iran is showing some stirrings in that direction.
The economic imperatives of the 1990's also are pushing the exporters toward a new flexibility. With the question of sovereignty over oil resources resolved in their favor, they are now preoccupied with more pragmatic and acute needs -- chiefly, for capital and technology. They need more income from oil just to keep up with their rapidly growing populations. And since they are unlikely to gain more revenue from much higher prices (because they will lose customers), they need to pump more oil. And that requires new investment in exploration and production capacity.
But how to pay for it? There is a general expectation of a capital shortage in the 1990's. So the one place oil exporters will look for investment funds is in the once-banished foreign oil companies. As a result, doors that slammed shut with nationalization in the 1970's will swing open again in the 1990's, and companies will find themselves exploring and producing in territories they never expected to see again.
In the aftermath of the gulf crisis, attention has actually shifted away from the Middle East, toward the Soviet Union, which will become a more important, if uncertain, factor in international oil. If a secure contractual basis can be established with Western oil companies, the Soviet Union may, in some degree, balance the world's dependence on the Persian Gulf.
The biggest battle over oil in the 1990's may not even concern producing countries directly, but will be the struggle within the industrial countries over energy needs and environmental values. It could turn out that America's "energy strategy" is actually embodied in initiatives like the 1990 Clean Air Act. Right now, there is an unprecedented state and Federal effort to regulate into existence a market demand for alternatives to gasoline, challenging the basic role of oil.
The petroleum industry is anticipating a huge bill for new environmental investments. Perhaps oil demand, not oil supplies, will be the question of this decade.
Or will it? Oil remains a strategic commodity, and recent history shows that just when calm is taken for granted, some new surprise, mixing politics and economics, comes along and shakes all assumptions. Even now, one can see the possible elements of a surprise during the next two or three years.
The world is producing oil near the limits of capacity, meaning there is little room for error. But "error" could arise from a combination of political change and capacity limits in the Middle East, declining U.S. production, falling Soviet oil exports and rising demand resulting from economic recovery. Then what?

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Plunges on Report Of Continued U.S. Layoffs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply yesterday in heavy trading after the release of a report that indicated United States companies continued to lay off workers in July.
The Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate slipped to 6.8 percent in July from a five-year high of 7 percent in June, but the improvement was attributed to job seekers giving up the search. Separately, the Government said non-farm payrolls declined last month by 51,000. 
 "The data were far weaker than expected in terms of payrolls," said Robert Hatcher, a corporate dealer at Barclays Bank, noting that some economists had recently revised their estimates upward and were actually looking for payrolls to increase by as much as 75,000.
"The market was badly, badly surprised, and the dollar just plummeted" after what appeared to be a buoyant opening, he said.
Traders were concerned that after several rounds of favorable data, the economy may be slipping back into another decline in what economists call a double-dip recession.
That raises the possibility that the Federal Reserve will be inclined to cut interest rates to spur growth. Lower interest rates are negative for the dollar because they make dollar-denominated securities less attractive to investors.
Mr. Hatcher said dollar-selling was heavy throughout the session, particularly since traders had been expecting the data to be different.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to close at 137.53 Japanese yen, up from 137.20 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 136.75 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 137.20 yen, down from 137.55 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.6945, from $1.6725 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.6890 to buy 1, up from Thursday's $1.6745.
Against the German currency, the dollar fell to 1.7415 marks, from 1.7570.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5147 Swiss francs, down from 1.5335; 5.9210 French francs, down from 5.9700; 1,301.50 Italian lire, down from 1,312.00, and 1.1505 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1498.

HEADLINE: Atom Arms Labs Defend Role In the Post-Cold-War Future

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
Budgets for nuclear weapons will shrink with the ending of the cold war and the conclusion of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, but "nuclear competence," a very expensive commodity, remains essential to the nation's defense, say directors of the laboratories that design America's nuclear weapons.
Conserving that competence, which consists of specialized laboratories and equipment as well as a cadre of scientific specialists in nuclear weapons technology, now costs some $3 billion a year, not counting the cost of manufacturing the weapons themselves. 
 With the United States nuclear arsenal of about 20,000 warheads slated for eventual reduction to 12,000, critics in Congress and elsewhere assert that continued multibillion-dollar spending on nuclear weapons plants far exceeds the reduced needs of national defense.
 
Administration Defends Labs
 But the Administration strongly opposes major reductions in the strength of the nuclear weapons laboratories.
In his testimony before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Secretary of Energy James D. Watkins said on Tuesday that the United States must continue research in nuclear weapons to maintain nuclear deterrence in "an international scene that is multipolar rather than bipolar."
Mr. Watkins, whose department pays for the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories, said that scientists from these institutions had played vital supporting roles as advisers in the negotiations for the new treaty, and that the security of the world would depend partly on the laboratories' continued technical strength.
"Put bluntly," Mr. Watkins said, "even if we reduce our stockpile to just one weapon, I believe that this nation must still have a strong cadre of the world's best nuclear weapons designers and engineers, if we want to anticipate how other nations might try to build a clandestine bomb, to track the telltale signs of such activity."
Critics say that the Department of Energy laboratories now design two new warheads a year, considerably fewer than during the height of the arms race, but that the laboratories' budgets and staff are only slightly smaller.
Speaking for the Washington-based organization Physicians for Social Responsibility, Daryl Kimball said that the functions of two of the nuclear weapons laboratories, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory, could be merged, and that the money saved should be used for cleaning up nuclear waste and other contaminants from the half-century-old bomb program.
"We're not sure which laboratory should be saved, but only one is necessary," he said.
The laboratory directors concede that some budget cuts may be likely, but counter that the need for weapons-related research remains as great as ever, even if the strategic arms treaty signed this week is approved by the Senate.
"The build-down of the nation's warhead stockpile," said Dr. Siegfried S. Hecker, director of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, "means that the warheads we retain must be all the more reliable and effective, if we are to maintain a credible nuclear deterrence."
 
Future Needs Unpredictable
 Moreover, he and the directors of the country's two other nuclear weapons laboratories said in interviews, the world is far short of achieving general nuclear disarmament, and it is impossible to predict future American needs requiring nuclear expertise in defense, deterrence, intelligence and disarmament verification.
Even if the weapons laboratories' only purpose were to to detect the clandestine nuclear weapons programs of other nations, they said, this ability would be well worth the cost.
Dr. Albert Narath, president of Sandia National Laboratories, said that budget cuts at all three laboratories were inevitable but that if cuts were too severe, national security would be at risk.
"We all know that we'll have to take our knocks," he said, "but if the cuts are so deep that we lose our pools of experts, the nation will lose nuclear competence -- an indispensable asset in a world where nuclear proliferation has yet to be halted."
 
Safety Issue Cited
 Dr. Hecker of Los Alamos said that nuclear weapons continue to become obsolete, and that the most important object in the design of new weapons was safety. Weapons need to be made even more resistance to accidental detonation, either of a nuclear charge or of the chemical explosives used to initiate the nuclear blast. A major challenge for designers has been the development of "insensitive" chemical explosives that are not easily detonated.
"A Congressional advisory panel headed by Dr. Sidney Drell of Stanford University recently concluded that safety must be incorporated in future nuclear weapons themselves, not merely in the procedures used in handling them. The committee ordered top-priority competition between the nuclear weapons laboratories to develop such safety features, and that's the major thrust of our present work," Dr. Hecker said. Keeping track of the proliferation of nuclear weapons in many developing countries has become a major problem that American weapons laboratories are particularly qualified to address, according to Dr. John H. Nuckols, director of Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.
"The world has had some unpleasant surprises in Iraq," he said. "Iraq's use of the calutron electromagnetic method for separating weapons-grade uranium came as quite a surprise. Our proliferation group at Livermore is rethinking these problems, with the object of reducing future surprises."
 
New Cleanup Methods Sought
 Finding effective and economical methods for cleaning up the radioactive messes created by nearly a half century of nuclear-weapon production at such plants as Savannah River, S.C., and Rocky Flats, Colo., also figures prominently in the post-cold-war plans of Los Alamos and its two sister research laboratories, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California, and Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., and Livermore, Calif.
Reflecting the change in research goals, the Department of Energy has ordered the spending of $4 billion this year on cleaning up buildings, land and waterways near nuclear weapons plants that have been contaminated by various dangerous byproducts. This is more than one-third of the $10.5 billion budgeted by the department this year for nuclear weapons research, testing and production.
All three nuclear weapons laboratories owe their existence to war or the threat of war.
Los Alamos was founded in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project that developed the first atomic bombs for use against the Axis. Livermore was created in 1952 during the Korean War, partly to develop a hydrogen bomb and partly to compete with Los Alamos, thereby spurring rival teams of scientists to extra effort.
The founding director of Los Alamos, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, and one of Livermore's founders, Dr. Edward Teller, were political as well as scientific adversaries, and the bitterness of their famous McCarthy-era dispute helped to create the competitive tradition between the laboratories that persists to this day.
 
Under One University
 Both laboratories were placed under the administration of the University of California, which the Energy Department redesignated on Wednesday for another term as administrator.
In 1949, the Government also created Sandia, a third nuclear-weapons laboratory, under the administration of what is today A.T. & T. Bell Laboratories. Unlike Los Alamos and Livermore, Sandia does not deal directly with nuclear explosives but designs and tests other parts of nuclear weapons, including the complex electronic devices intended to allow only authorized officials to arm warheads. Much of Sandia's work is devoted to developing systems that guard against accidents or the use of weapons for nuclear blackmail or terrorism.
The three laboratories are roughly equal in size. Livermore employs about 8,000, including 3,000 nuclear weapons experts, and its current budget is $1.175 billion. Los Alamos has about 7,540 employees and a budget of $928 million. Sandia has 8,500 with a budget of about $1.2 billion.
Roughly one-third of the money spent by Los Alamos and Livermore is for the "core" mission -- research, development and testing of nuclear weapons. If such related fields of research as arms-reduction verification, nuclear intelligence, safeguards, security and improved nuclear processing methods are included, nuclear weapons account for somewhat more than half of the laboratory budgets.
 
Competition Called Wasteful
 Los Alamos and Livermore remain in direct competition for funds, projects and scientific talent -- a fact that critics regard as wasteful. But the laboratory directors believe the competition is essential.
Dr. Narath of Sandia said that although his laboratory was not itself in competition, rivalry between Los Alamos and Livermore "creates a kind of peer-review system, in which the two laboratories check each other and point out research errors and alternatives."
All three laboratory directors said that their research goals began a transition from nuclear weapons as long ago as the early 1970's, and that programs unrelated to nuclear weapons benefit many branches of science. Research involving antimissile defense programs, which will continue at Livermore and Los Alamos, has produced laser systems that laboratory officials expect to benefit astronomy and other sciences. The gigantic power of computers used by the weapons laboratories to simulate the dynamics of nuclear explosions has been put to use on many other programs.
Los Alamos, for instance, is a major participant in the Human Genome Project, a detailed analysis of the complete genetic code by which a human being is assembled from proteins and other substances. Besides conducting some of the analysis itself, Los Alamos is the repository of the GenBank, the national computer data base of all genetic sequence information.
 
Work on Fusion Energy
 All three weapons laboratories have been deeply involved for more than a decade in efforts to exploit fusion energy -- the same source of energy that powers hydrogen bombs and stars -- as a cheap and nonpolluting alternative to the fossil fuels polluting the atmosphere.
"If we are to take timely action to head off the effects of greenhouse warming," Dr. Nuckolls said, "it's essential that we move as fast as possible toward developing fusion power. The national laboratories are uniquely equipped to do this." But although directors of the laboratories feel that extracurricular projects contribute greatly to the value of their institutions, the main role of the Los Alamos, Livermore and Sandia will always be the maintenance of America's ability to wield and counter nuclear weapons.
"That is our core mission," Dr. Hecker said, "and as long as the world faces threats of war, we must try to meet our responsibilities."

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Precious Metals Off Sharply; Platinum Leads the Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Precious metal futures prices fell sharply yesterday. Platinum led the decline in reaction to heavy Japanese selling, fears of Soviet selling and perceptions that industrial demand is fading.
Platinum futures settled $9 to $9.20 lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the contract for delivery in October at $355.10 an ounce, the lowest price since early 1986. 
 On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled $7.60 to $9.80 lower, with October at $358.90 an ounce and August at $355.60. Silver was 11.8 cents to 14.2 cents lower, with September at $3.935 an ounce.
Platinum plunged at the opening bell after an overnight selloff of platinum futures on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc.
There was little other news, but platinum remained lower and gold and silver steadily eroded against a backdrop of bearish developments. Among them were the slow economic recovery, slack investor demand for precious metals and fears the Soviet Union would be forced to sell huge amounts of platinum to raise hard currency.
Soybean futures prices rallied to a 13-month high on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders overwhelmingly bet against weekend showers halting the spread of the Midwestern drought. Grain futures finished mostly higher.
"If we don't receive the kind of rain forecast by meteorologists over the weekend, it's going to be off to the races again next week," said Richard Feltes, research director with Refco Inc. in Chicago.
Wheat futures settled unchanged to 3 1/2 cents higher, with September at $2.98 a bushel. Corn futures were 1/4 cent lower to 1 1/4 cents higher, with September at $2.62 1/4 a bushel. Oats were 1/2 cent lower to 1 1/2 cents higher, with September at $1.35 a bushel. Soybeans were 9 1/2 cents to 23 cents higher, with August at $6.37 a bushel, the highest settlement of a near-term soybean contract since July 3, 1990.
Gasoline Pushed Higher
Oil prices held firm and gasoline shot up in quiet trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange on the anniversary of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
There was no news motivating the market, but gasoline prices were pushed higher by strong demand in cash markets, analysts said.
Crude oil futures finished 2 cents lower to 10 cents higher, with September at $21.32 a barrel. Heating oil was 0.26 cent to 0.35 cent higher, with September at 59.80 cents a pound. Unleaded gasoline was 0.55 cent to 1.22 cents higher, with September at 66.40 cents a pound. Natural gas was 2 cents lower to 3.5 cents higher, with September at $1.26 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Hog futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid expectations for increased hog slaughtering next week. Cattle futures ended mostly lower.

HEADLINE: Tale of Political Ties and Bad Debt

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH with STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
A prominent Republican family in New Hampshire with close ties to the White House is hoping to stave off the imminent collapse of its real estate empire, and it says it is close to reaching an agreement on a four-and-a-half-year moratorium on repaying more than $100 million it borrowed from New England lenders.
There is no evidence of any improper interference in the renegotiation of the debts of the Tamposi family of Nashua, N.H. But regulators and borrowers say such a lengthy moratorium is exceptional, and some New Hampshire businessmen with large debts who have been unable to get the same terms are upset. 
 The story of the rise of the Tamposis and their current plight is a personification of the nation's banking crisis.
The family has been one of the largest borrowers in a region with the nation's weakest banking system. The negotiations over the Tamposis' loans, as well as the Federal bailout of insolvent New Hampshire banks, also illustrates the wide discretion allowed banks and Federal regulators in resolving troubled debts and rescuing banks. This power is often exercised out of public view.
Charles Dougherty, a lawyer in Boston for the six Tamposi children, said the renegotiation of the family's debts was not a result of any special treatment but the most efficient and economical way to handle the bad loans.
"When the banks have a lot of money at issue, they're going to find ways to improve the situation," he said. "The Tamposis have been central to the development of real estate in southern New Hampshire. That has necessitated a lot of borrowings. They have a wonderful reputation. Banks thought they were good loans; the Tamposis thought the same. Now it turns out it's not the case for some."
The troubles of the Tamposis and the troubles of the New Hampshire banks have the same root: countless real estate deals of the last decade that have now gone sour. The family's real estate holdings stretch from New Hampshire to Florida. Much of it was purchased through bank loans during the last decade at the height of the market, before prices plummeted in the worst recession to hit the New England region in decades.
The family, Mr. Dougherty said, has "by and large" stopped making payments on their loans and sought time to try to sell their holdings at better prices in order to make good on loans to some 50 lenders.
A. Roland Roberge, the state's Banking Commissioner, said, "There isn't a bank in the state that hasn't done business with them." He added: "Four-to-five-year moratoriums are very, very exceptional. That is not normal."
The Banking Commissioner declined to discuss any specific transaction but said each loan renegotiation depends on its own set of circumstances.
 
The Family
Vacuum Cleaners To Real Estate

Samuel A. Tamposi Sr., the family patriarch, rose from modest beginnings as a farmer and vacuum cleaner salesman to become New Hampshire's largest commercial real estate developer.
He bought a minority interest in the Boston Red Sox and enlisted the help of the former baseball star Ted Williams in a large development in Florida called Citrus Hills. Mr. Williams, who has a home in Citrus Hills, has helped attract New Englanders to the development, which is about 75 miles north of Tampa and has a golf course designed by Arnold Palmer.
Mr. Tamposi's six children also became involved in real estate, including the Citrus Hills project.
Mr. Tamposi has resigned from the boards of two banks and said in a recent interview that he was trying to help his children. The family has also been significant stockholders in some of New Hampshire's banks. While the substantial holdings of Mr. Tamposi do not appear to be in jeopardy and are not part of the loan negotiations, not all his real estate investments have proved to be winners.
One deal he struck in partnership with the Amoskeag Bank of Manchester, N.H., involved the joint ownership and development of a 14-story office building in West Palm Beach, Fla., and was financed by $16 million from the bank.
The building has lost money and is now owned by the bank. Amoskeag recently agreed to take it back from Mr. Tamposi and another partner in exchange for assuming all the debt, said Cathleen Maloney, a spokeswoman for the bank. The building is half empty and is valued at $13.5 million, but the resolution was fair to all parties, she said.
 
Politics
Longtime Ties With the G.O.P.

Like many real estate developers, Mr. Tamposi was politically active, raising money for Republican candidates and bringing Ted Williams to some party functions.
The list of those Republicans Mr. Tamposi has backed or raised money for includes President Bush, Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and John H. Sununu, who served as New Hampshire's Governor for six years before joining the Bush Administration as White House chief of staff.
And Mr. Tamposi's daughter Elizabeth served in the New Hampshire legislature during some of Mr. Sununu's tenure as Governor. Now 36 years old, she was named assistant Secretary of State for consular affairs in 1989, after running unsuccessfully for Congress in 1988. Mr. Sununu endorsed her in that campaign.
From 1984 to 1989, Ms. Tamposi was also a director and borrowed heavily from what has since become First New Hampshire Bank, records show.
To help finance her campaign Ms. Tamposi borrowed $233,000 from a Nashua bank, Nashua Trust, where her father and brother served as directors.
Another $10,000 was borrowed from Nashua Trust on Dec. 13, 1988, three months after Ms. Tamposi lost the primary election. The day the money was borrowed, Ms. Tamposi's committee paid $10,165 to Mr. Sununu's gubernatorial campaign committee, mostly to repay a three-month-old debt for advertising services her committee had obtained from Mr. Sununu's committee, and also to buy an inventory of postage, said Edwin D. Duvall, treasurer of Mr. Sununu's committee, and Mr. Dougherty, the Tamposi family's lawyer.
Since deciding in June 1988 not to run for another term as Governor, Mr. Sununu has used his campaign fund to pay for his family's travel expenses, which is permissible under New Hampshire law.
Most of the Tamposi campaign loans have since been repaid, records show, but they were not properly disclosed until six months after the election ended. Mr. Dougherty said the reporting delay stemmed from a "misunderstanding of Federal Election Commission regulations."
About one month after the Presidential election in 1988, Ms. Tamposi sought a job in the Bush Administration, with the help of Senator Rudman and Mr. Sununu, she told the Senate in 1989 during her confirmation hearings for her current State Department post.
Mr. Rudman, who recently talked with the family about their financial situation, said their political connections carried no weight in debt negotiations.
"There is no way anybody is going to say, 'They're friends of powerful people, so be nice,' " he said, having called a reporter at the urging of the Tamposis.
 
The Lenders
Banks Are Moving To Collect

While the recession in New Hampshire real estate has been going on for some time, it was not until several months ago that the Tamposi children stopped making payments to their lenders.
According to court records in New Hampshire, lenders have provided more than $140 million to finance the business ventures of the Tamposi children.
Some family's holdings, like raw land near the Manchester airport, produce no income, while other ventures, like a 484-unit condominium project in Nashau, are not generating enough income to meet the interest payments on the loans the family took to finance the projects.
In addition, many banks, having provided the family millions of dollars in unsecured lines of credit, have moved in court to try to seize Tamposi real estate as collateral. If the family should seek protection under Federal bankruptcy law, a distinct possibility if the negotiations fail, the unsecured creditors would be last in line to recover their loans.
The banks are themselves under considerable pressure. A number of the state's largest banks no longer have any capital.
But the Tamposis have tried to keep the banks from moving too fast, arguing that a forced sale of their assets would leave a deficit of more than $15 million, according to court records.
A $5 million loan for one of the family's larger projects has already figured in the $2.5 billion collapse earlier this year of the Boston-based Bank of New England, making the Federal Government one of the family's creditors.
The loan for the Nashua condominium project became part of the bad loans taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, according to public records and Mr. Dougherty. Earlier the agency rescued the bank and sold its good assets to the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.
 
The Bank Rescue
The Federal Plan In New Hampshire

Fleet has a prospective role in the plan by the F.D.I.C. to rescue and reorganize New Hampshire's banking system.
Regulators say that under the plan, the F.D.I.C. would merge five of the state's largest banking organizations into two groups and inject capital, along with private investors.
Many of these banks, like Amoskeag, have been insolvent since last year but have remained open with the assistance of the Federal Government. "The F.D.I.C. position is that if the current management of the bank is acceptable and doing everything the F.D.I.C. would do if they were in the bank, and if the process is leading to an eventual resolution and is proceeding in an orderly way, why rush in," said Mr. Roberge, the state Banking Commissioner.
Amoskeag and its sister bank Nashua Trust have received waivers from the F.D.I.C. to use brokered deposits, which are large deposits brought in by outside brokers who are paid a fee by the bank. Under the 1989 legislation that rescued the savings and loan industry, troubled institutions were prohibited from using brokered deposits, which can increase an institution's costs, unless the agency grants them a waiver.
Amoskeag has also borrowed more than $125 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, secured by home mortgages, and delivered $132 million in other collateral, including commercial loans, to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, in anticipation of further borrowing needs, according to bank filings.
The F.D.I.C.'s consolidation deal is expected to be completed in September. Another large banking company, the Bankeast Corporation, that is part of the F.D.I.C. deal, filed for protection under bankruptcy laws in October.
The other banks that are part of the consolidation plan are Dartmouth, Numerica Savings and New Hampshire Savings.
 
Negotiation
The Family Tries To Make a Deal

While the Tamposi family has been quietly working with lenders for months in an effort to reach some sort of agreement, it was not until some banks went to court to try to attach the family's assets that the negotiations became public.
Some of the court proceedings have been reported by New Hampshire newspapers, but the length of the moratorium the family is seeking has not been mentioned in the news reports.
In one court filing, the Bank of New Hampshire said in June that a month earlier "the Tamposis requested forebearance and interest concessions from the bank and further represented that no payments would be made to the bank until Dec. 31, 1995."
Referring to the deal that is being worked out, the bank said: "The plan seeks to transfer the Tamposi's interests in over 75 entities and 250 assets into a plan administered by the Tamposis on behalf of their creditors."
Mr. Dougherty said that despite the motions by some New Hampshire banks, "all signs point to having an agreement in the next several weeks."
Other New Hampshire businessmen say they are not being offered such a moratorium by the state's banks.
"There is a general atmosphere among members of the business community; it is generally recognized that the Amoskeag Bank has been extremely difficult to arrive at a forebearance, a workout, or negotiations," said Frank Yanco, an auto dealer in Manchester who is involved in a lawsuit with the bank.
The bank's spokeswoman, Ms. Maloney, said, "We try to work out each situation separately; they are looked at on a case-by-case basis."
That is not much consolation for John E. Pearson, a large New Hampshire developer and former partner of the Tamposis who is now in litigation with them and some banks.
Last week Mr. Pearson sent a letter about the concessions being sought by the Tamposis to a bank managing bad loans made to both the Tamposis and one of Mr. Pearson's ventures.
"I do not have any political connections that could intercede on my behalf," he wrote. "However, I feel in all fairness that we are due equal treatment."
Mr. Dougherty, the Tamposi lawyer, said the family was not seeking any special favors.
He described their plan this way: "The plan anticipates an orderly sale of the present assets of the Tamposi family group over a period of four and a half years up to and including Dec. 31, 1995" and is "designed to maximize returns to creditors" though there is "no requirement of payment on a particular date other than Dec. 31, 1995."

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Cut as Labor Dropouts Rise

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment rate dropped slightly last month, not because more people had jobs but because people dropped out of the labor market.
As a result, the Labor Department's monthly employment report, released today, the first comprehensive data about the state of the economy in July, was inconclusive. It showed mainly what economists already knew: that the economy was not growing at a robust pace. 
 Janet L. Norwood, Commissioner of Labor Statistics, observed that the unemployment rate last month, 6.8 percent, and the number of people employed, 116.7 million, were the same as in March, and she cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from the month-to-month fluctuations.
 
'Little Clear Direction'
 "Changes in the labor market continued to show little clear direction in July," she told the Congressional Joint Economic Committee.
The unemployment rate was two-tenths of a percentage point less than the 7 percent rate in June, the highest in five years. Seasonally adjusted, 8.5 million people were officially out of work last month, 1.6 million more than in July 1990, the month the recession is said to have begun.
Economists tend to look first at the number of people employed, rather than the number unemployed, because the former is a better measure of economic growth. An erratic pattern of job growth, up one month and down the next, is typical for the early stages of a recovery.
 
Payroll Decline of 51,000
 The number of people with jobs grew in May and June, but as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of households, 172,000 fewer people had jobs in July than in June. By another measure, a survey of businesses, the number of people on payrolls fell by 51,000 last month.
Some economists predicted that the weak employment figures and a slight decrease in hourly earnings last month, an indication that inflation is under control, would convince the Federal Reserve that it should reduce interest rates for the first time since April. On Wall Street, bond prices rose rapidly today in anticipation of lower rates.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has described the central bank's posture as one of "watchful waiting" to see how fast the economy pulled out of the recession and whether inflation was tamed.
Predictably, the Bush Administration viewed the inconclusive figures as a glass half full. "I don't read the unemployment news as anything but very good news for the American people," President Bush said at a news conference.
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said he was pleased because a decline in the unemployment rate was "a major Administration priority." He added that the Fed should certainly lower rates if the nation's money supply did not soon begin to grow faster.
Democrats naturally took the half-empty glass approach. "A falling unemployment rate caused by a sharp rise in labor force dropouts, in my opinion, is no evidence of a healthy economy," said Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.
Private economists were mildly disappointed by the decline in employment.
Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said the firmest conclusion he could draw was that the economy was "slow to recover from the recession," but he added that the new figures did not mean the recovery had stalled.
John M. Albertine, the head of an economic forecasting and consulting company in Washington, said the new data showed that the economy was "sputtering along at a very slow speed."
The drop in unemployment came primarily among blacks and women, but the black rate, 11.8 percent, remained almost twice as high as the white rate, 6.2 percent. Dr. Norwood, the Labor Statistics Commissioner, observed that the fall in the rate for women resulted almost entirely from women who stopped looking for jobs and thus were not counted as unemployed.
The number of construction jobs fell by 22,000, an indication that the recession in real estate has not abated.

HEADLINE: Pan Am Plans to Dismiss 5,000 Employees

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
More than a fifth of the employees of Pan American World Airways will lose their jobs in the next few weeks, the troubled carrier said yesterday.
Pan Am, which is operating under Federal Bankruptcy Court protection and is in the process of selling most of its assets, said it would dismiss 5,000 of its 22,300 employees worldwide "in all work categories." About 10,500 of Pan Am's entire work force, nearly half, works in New York, and it could not be learned yesterday how many of those jobs would be spared. 
 A spokesman for the airline, Jeffrey Kriendler, acknowledged that the cuts go deeper than the usual yearly reduction after the peak summer season. "We are going to be cutting schedules unrelated to any future asset sales to reflect what we feel will be continued soft demand in the fall," he said.
Yesterday, the carrier's parent company, the Pan Am Corporation, released its second-quarter results, which showed that the company lost $125.3 million on an operating basis in a period when traffic and profits usually pick up and that it netted $99.9 million, counting a $260 million one-time gain from its sale of London routes and other assets to United Airlines. The airline had an operating loss of $8.5 million and a net loss of $49 million for the quarter last year. Revenues for the recent quarter were $721.2 million, down 29.3 percent from the $1.02 billion posted last year.
Affected employees will be notified starting Monday, Mr. Kriendler said. Asked where the cutbacks would be concentrated, he said they would hit management the hardest.
But George Miranda, a vice president of Local 732 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 5,400 reservation agents and other Pan Am workers, said he would be surprised if management bore the brunt.
"I'd like to see that," he said. "I haven't seen that in any previous layoffs. Maybe it's about time."
Though job losses had been expected for some time because of the airline's dire straits, union officials took the news hard.
"Five thousand is a big number," Mr. Miranda said. "We don't lay off 5,000 every year. Under normal circusmtances, you may get some adjustments, 100 here or 200 there, as you adjust your schedule, but 5,000 -- this is a major layoff."
The announcement also comes at a time when New York's economy is already losing thousands of other jobs to bank mergers and when its once-thriving financial-services sector is shrinking.
Certainly, the prospect of a deep thinning of the ranks at Pan Am is only likely to turn up the heat on Pan Am's management to look hard at how many of its remaining 17,300 jobs would be preserved under various competing offers it has received for its route system.
 
Outlook Under Delta's Offer
 The offer it has tentatively accepted from Delta Air Lines would save 6,500 jobs and possibly another 6,500 or so if Delta and Pan Am come to terms on a plan, partly financed by Delta, that would allow Pan Am to reorganize as a smaller airline flying mostly to Latin America.
United, by contrast, has offered to hire 2,500 of Pan Am's employees as part of its deal and to give priority to another 2,000 if industry conditions permit it to expand its work force in the future.
American Airlines so far has refused to bid on Pan Am alone, because it has a well-known aversion to any deal in which it would have to hire and assimilate large numbers of unionized employees from a competing carrier.
For that reason, American has teamed up with Trans World Airlines, which so far is talking about saving at least 14,500 jobs. T.W.A.'s proposal, however, would also appear to have the harshest impact on the New York region, since Pan Am's and T.W.A.'s operations at Kennedy International Airport duplicate each other and would be ripe for paring.
"We would hope whoever wins out has a plan of reorganization around the Latin American division," said Mr. Miranda, who represents his union on Pan Am's creditors committee. Such a plan would presumably save the most jobs.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bonds Rise Sharply On Jobs Data

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose sharply yesterday after a weaker-than-expected employment report for July gave rise to hopes for lower interest rates, with or without a push by the Federal Reserve.
The buoyancy of the Treasury market quickly spread to the corporate sector, inspiring a flurry of new offerings by corporate treasurers eager to take advantage of good investor demand. By the end of the day, new corporate issues totaling $1.05 billion were offered by Tenneco, the Shell Oil Company, the Norwest Financial Corporation, the Sonoco Products Company and Dillard Department Stores. 
 In the continuing debate about the strength of the economic recovery, analysts said yesterday's report of a decline of 51,000 in non-farm payrolls during July was evidence of a weak economy. But they added that the signs were not dramatic enough to prove that the recovery was stalled or to show a clear need for a quick move by the Federal Reserve to push down short-term rates.
 
Long-Term Rates Down
 "The problem for the economy is not with short-term rates, the area where lower rates would be a big help is in the long-term market," said Donald Fine, an economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank. He said the Fed would want more evidence of a faltering economy before pushing short-term rates lower, and that meanwhile, long-term interest rates had declined without any Fed move.
The yield on long-term Treasury bonds, which serves as a benchmark for fixed-rate mortgages and corporate bonds, fell yesterday to 8.24 percent, the lowest level since late May and down from 8.38 percent a week ago. By late in the day the closely watched 8 1/8 percent Treasury bond due in 2021 was offered at 98 22/32, up 1 6/32, or $11.87 for a $1,000 bond, and its yield had fallen from 8.35 percent a day earlier. In advance of next Tuesday's auction of three-year Treasury notes, securities dealers offered the issue to large institutions with a yield of 7.01 percent, down from 7.15 percent. The 10-year Treasury notes to be sold on Wednesday were at 8.03 percent, down from 8.15 percent.
"The employment data raise some questions about the sustainability of the economy's expansion, and increase the possibility of another easing in monetary policy," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh. But he added that declines in payrolls in the early stages of a recovery were not unusual and that upward adjustments to payrolls reported yesterday for June and May "show that the employment picture recently is really more flat than down."
A weaker economy, which is associated with slack credit demand and low inflation, results in lower bond yields, as investors and traders buy bonds in expectation of lower interest rates and higher bond prices.
There were no signs yesterday of a change in Fed policy, as the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market continued to hover around its recent average of 5 3/4 percent. The overnight rate is closely controlled by the Fed and is a benchmark for other short-term interest rates. But the absence of any signals of a change in Fed policy did not prevent securities dealers and other speculators from pushing up prices of Treasury bills enough to lower the rate for the three-month issue to 5.47 percent from 5.54 percent.
Among new corporate offerings, Tenneco's notes due in 1998 were so avidly sought at a yield of 10 percent that the size of the issue was increased to $500 million from $300 million. The notes were rated Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation and offered through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley & Company with a yield 2.1 percentage points higher than comparable Treasury notes.
A $250 million issue of the Shell Oil Company's 7 1/8 percent notes due in 1994 was offered at 99.746, to yield 7.22 percent, by a Lehman Brothers group. The notes, which are expected to be rated triple-A, did not sell as briskly yesterday as other new issues because they offered only 22-hundredths of a percentage point more in yield than three-year Treasury notes.
Smaller offerings included a $100 million issue of Dillard Department Stores A-2/A+ rated 9 1/8 percent debentures due in 2011, offered through Morgan Stanley with a yield of 9.195 percent, and $100 million of the Norwest Financial Corporation's Aa-3/A+ rated 8 1/2 percent notes due in 1998, offered with a yield of 8.625 percent through Merrill Lynch. The Sonoco Products Company's $100 million issue of 9.2 percent bonds due in 2021, rated A-2/A+, was offered with a yield of 9.208 percent through J. P. Morgan Securities.

The Economy
The Senate Banking Committee narrowly approved a measure to overhaul the nation's banking laws in a way significantly different from either the measure proposed by the Bush Administration or the one passed by the House Banking Committee. [Page 33.] 
 The U.S. unemployment rate dropped slightly last month, to 6.8 percent, not be cause more people had jobs but because peo ple dropped out of the labor market. As a re sult, the Labor Department's monthly report was inconclusive. It showed mainly what economists already knew: that the economy was not growing at a robust pace. [7.]
 Congress sent President Bush a $5.8 bil lion measure to aid people who remain unemployed for more than half a year, a total of about three million Americans. [1.]
 A prominent Republican family in New Hampshire with close ties to the White House is hoping to stave off the imminent collapse of its real estate empire, and it says it is close to reaching an agreement on a four-and-a-half-year moratorium on repaying more than $100 million it borrowed from New England lenders. [33.]
 Defying the national trend, Santa Fe's hotel business has been roaring, chalking up impressive occupancy rates while vacancy signs are going up in most of the rest of the country. [33.]
 A 90-year-old woman had no doubts about Keating's guilt as his trial began. Screaming "You took all my money," she shook him by the lapels in the courtroom before being hustled away. [35.]
 
Companies
More than a fifth of Pan Am's employees will lose their jobs in the next few weeks. Pan Am said it would dismiss 5,000 of its 22,300 employees worldwide "in all work categories." [33.]
 Metropolitan Life and Prudential said they would probably assume some of Mutual Benefit's liabilities related to life insurance, annuities and other obligations. [33.]
 McDonnell Douglas lost an order for up to 20 jets said to be worth $2 billion from Singapore Airlines, which chose Airbus. [35.]
 
International
Several reports about B.C.C.I.'s illegal activities were disseminated by the C.I.A. to other Federal agencies in the early 80's even as the agency was using the bank to finance operations abroad, a senior C.I.A. official and other U.S. Government officials said. [34.]
 Peruvian Government officials detailed how B.C.C.I. assisted in a secret effort to hide Peru's money from creditors in 1986. [34.]
 
Markets
Treasury bond prices rose sharply after a weak employment report gave rise to hopes for lower interest rates, with or without a push by the Federal Reserve. [33.]
 Blue-chip stocks fell slightly for the second day after a three-day advance, with the Dow ending at 3,006.26, off 11.41 for the day but up 33.76 for the week. [40.]
 The dollar fell sharply in heavy trading after the release of a report that indicated that U.S. companies continued to lay off workers in July. [42.]
 Precious metal futures prices fell sharply, with platinum leading the decline in reaction to heavy Japanese selling, fears of Soviet selling and perceptions that industrial demand is fading. [42.]

 People should examine their disability coverage to see if it is sufficient and see what else may be available to them, financial advisers say. Your Money. [34.]

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Armed with Israel's conditional agreement to a Middle East peace conference, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today sought to convince the Palestinians, the last party yet to agree, that even if they accepted Israel's terms they still stood to gain the most from the process.
Mr. Baker first met for four hours with three prominent Palestinians in Jerusalem, then flew to the Jordanian capital, Amman, for talks with King Hussein. Under the American plan, the Palestinians would take part in the first stage of the peace conference in a delegation with Jordan. 
 A quick agreement between the Palestinians and Mr. Baker had not been expected since, as the Palestinian group made plain, they did not have the authority to accept or reject the restrictions on Palestinian participation raised by the Israelis.
That decision, both the Palestinians and Arab leaders agreed, must come from the Palestine Liberation Organization, which despite disarray remains the principal umbrella organization for most Palestinians in and out of Israel.
"It's a question of principle and who has the right to form the Palestinian delegation," said Prof. Hanan Ashrawi, a participant in the talks with Mr. Baker. "This is only the P.L.O. and the Palestinian people. Who has the right to interfere, to dictate, to veto? No one."
The Secretary said he tried to impress on the Palestinians that "in our view, the Palestinians have more to gain from a viable and active peace process than do almost anyone else."
 
'The Most to Lose'
 "Further to that," he added, "in our view at least, Palestinians have the most to lose if there is no process.
"So the United States at least, we are very hopeful that Palestinians will determine that they want to be part of this process and that they will determine that they want to take advantage of His Majesty's offer here of an umbrella in the form of a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation."
Speaking at a news conference alongside King Hussein at the King's summer palace outside Amman, Mr. Baker indicated that a resolution of the problem was not imminent and that work on it would continue "over the course of the next few weeks."
So far, the P.L.O. has not budged, but the Palestinians, Mr. Baker and King Hussein all insisted that the peace process had not derailed.
"I can say that we are working on everything to move the obstacle put in front of us," said Faisal al-Husseini, who spoke with Mr. Baker. The third Palestinian in the talks, Zakaria al-Agha, did not speak to reporters.
Mr. Baker described the meeting as a "very serious engagement" and said he was "pleased" with it.
The question of how the Palestinians should be represented has emerged as the last and stickiest in the Bush Administration's campaign to bring Israel face to face with its Arab adversaries, because it touches on fundamental principles in the bitter dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.
 
October Goal
 At their summit meeting in Moscow earlier this week, Presidents Bush and Gorbachev announced that they would try to convene an inaugural international conference by October.
On Thursday, Israel agreed to attend on the condition that the Palestinian representatives not include members of the P.L.O., stateless Palestinians or Palestinians from East Jerusalem.
For Israel's conservative Government, Palestinians from Jerusalem or elsewhere would implicitly raise property claims and question Israel's control over East Jerusalem, which the Israelis deem non-negotiable.
For the Palestinians, restricted representation would imply accepting a dependent status and suspending claims to former homes and to East Jerusalem. In Mr. Baker's view, the Palestinians' stand on principle has worsened their plight through all previous efforts at negotiating a settlement, dating to the creation of Israel.
Reporters traveling with the Secretary were reminded of the remark by the Israeli statesman Abba Eban that "the Palestinians never pass up an opportunity to pass up an opportunity," and Mr. Baker believes that the Palestinians have a chance to prove this wrong. Mr. Baker's argument was that with every passing crisis, the Palestinians have found themselves less united, more scattered and ever less welcome in other Arab countries.
While Egypt regained the Sinai through willingness to establish relations with Israel, Palestinian forces were chased from Jordan and Lebanon, tens of thousands remained in refugee districts and Israel became ever more rooted in occupied territory.
By accepting at least partly the hard realities of the region and joining in the peace process, the Palestinians stood to gain at least a measure of sovereignty and security.
 
Jordan's Palestinians
 Mr. Baker has refused to divulge any possible compromises discussed with the Palestinians. But Arab and Israeli newspapers have suggested that the Palestinians could be represented by Palestinians with Jordanian or other citizenship. Jordan, in particular, has many Palestinians in high positions, including Prime Minister Taher Masri.
According to the American blueprint for the Middle East conference, an opening session of one or two days would be co-chaired by the United States and the Soviet Union and attended by observers from the United Nations and the European Community.
That would create an international framework in which Israel and its neighbors -- Syria, Lebanon and a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation -- would sit down to separate talks.
On the Palestinian issue, the first stage of the talks would deal with Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. Part of the problem is that any Palestinian who agrees to join the conference without P.L.O. sanction would do so at risk to his or her life.
Reporters with Mr. Baker were told that he appreciated "the large element of personal courage" required of the Palestinians in this process.
In the latest effort, the Palestinians have found themselves alone. All other Arab states involved have agreed to attend, and Saudi Arabia has given its endorsement to the process.
 
'Comprehensive Settlement'
 King Hussein has been particularly eager for the Palestinians to join, since his participation in the process has brought him under criticism from hard-liners in his Parliament for abandoning the Palestinian cause.
At the news conference today, the King said, "The time has come, hopefully, for Palestinians to decide in view of all the circumstances and opportunities the moment presents on their participation in efforts for a comprehensive settlement." The King has pinned hopes on the peace process to lift the political and economic penalties imposed by the United States over his pro-Iraqi stance in the Persian Gulf crisis.
Mr. Baker's visit coincided with the anniversary of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the publication of a "white paper" by the Jordanian Government in which it sought to explain and justify its position. The document tried to show that Jordan opposed the acquisition of territory by force, and that King Hussein wrote President Saddam Hussein of Iraq warning that aggression could prompt Israeli retaliation.
 
'You Will Understand'
 "I still believe maybe one day you will understand what our position was," King Hussein told the news conference today, citing some of the arguments in the "white paper."
Jordan's support for the peace process has brought moves by the Administration to restore some of the military and economic aid frozen last year.
"I told his majesty that the President had executed the determination required under our legislation to make it possible to reinstitute some of the programs which we had ongoing which were suspended by legislation, and we discussed that subject in some detail," Mr. Baker said. Alluding to the King's domestic problems with the peace process, Mr. Baker praised him for showing "the courage you have demonstrated in the past."
On Saturday, Mr. Baker will meet with Prime Minister Masri and then fly to Morocco to start a two-day visit to Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria.

HEADLINE: Saudi Financier Quits Beirut Rebuilding Plan

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, Aug. 2

 BODY:
A Saudi financier who had expressed willingness to invest millions of dollars in the reconstruction of Beirut has backed out, citing Government corruption, officials here say.
The businessman, Rafik Hariri, who is of Lebanese origin, had proposed to set up a joint venture company of landowners and investors to rebuild downtown Beirut. According to his plan, a modern complex of towers and tunnels was to be put up on the Green Line, the battered area in the central city that served as a dividing line between the city's mainly Muslim and Christian halves for the last 15 years. 
 But Mr. Hariri backed out on his offer recently, asserting that some Government ministers and deputies were blackmailing him for commissions and briberies in exchange for their support. He was not specific about his charges.
American diplomatic officials said they thought Mr. Hariri backed off because of Saudi Arabia's desire to keep its money from pouring into Lebanon before the country fully recovers from the civil war. They fear the money would be wasted like it was after the 1982 invasion of the country.
Lebanon has turned to the task of rebuilding after the Government of President Elias Hrawi, with the support of about 40,000 Syrian soldiers, started to reassert control over the nation under a reconciliation pact reached in late 1989 under Arab mediation in the Saudi resort of Taif.
Economists said Mr. Hariri's decision was a severe blow to any chance for reviving Lebanon's collapsing economy and caused panic in Beirut's money market.
 
Lebanese Pound Drops
 After the news was reported here, the value of the Lebanese pound fell against the United States dollar, from 850 to 900, the central bank said.
Mr. Hariri, who is 56 years old, is from a fisherman's family in the southern city of Sidon. A former school teacher, he traveled to Saudi Arabia to work there and became close to the ruling family and was entrusted with some of their businesses. He then started his own construction company there and his business flourished. He he is now considered the richest man in the Middle East, according to An Nahar, a Beirut newspaper.
Mr. Hariri has done previous reconstruction work in Beirut, and has contributed large amounts of money to the Government. President Elias Hrawi lives in Mr. Hariri's appartment in West Beirut, and Mr. Hariri pays for Mr. Hrawi's bodyguards. He has also been paying the residency costs of the Syrian officers who are entrusted to keep order in Beirut since 1987.
Former Prime Minister Salim al-Hoss, an economist, said Mr. Hariri's withdrawal was an economic and moral blow to efforts to restore peace to the country.
Economists estimated that Mr. Hariri's departure represented a loss in opportunity of some $7 billion.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT IS SENT MEASURE TO WIDEN JOBLESS BENEFITS

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Congress today sent President Bush a $5.8 billion measure to aid people who remain unemployed for more than half a year, a total of about three million Americans.
But Mr. Bush is expected to keep the extended benefits from flowing, according to White House aides and Republican lawmakers. Mr. Bush would not commit himself at a news conference, but he warned against increasing the Federal budget deficit. 
 Before the House passed it on a 375 to 45 vote this afternoon, Democrats appealed to Mr. Bush to sign it and also to make the accompanying declaration of emergency that is required under last year's budget act for the bill to go into effect because of its impact on the deficit. The legislation cleared the Senate by voice vote Thursday night.
 
'Sign the Bill'
 "Sign the bill, declare the emergency, use your enormous power to help the people who elected you," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader.
The bill cleared Congress a few hours after the Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate dropped slightly last month, to 6.8 percent from 7 percent. But the report showed that the reason for the improvement was that more people had dropped out of the labor market, not that more workers had jobs. [Page 7.]
As they had ever since they seized on the extended-benefits issue last week, Democrats berated Mr. Bush, asserting that he was more interested in disaster victims abroad than at home. Citing the emergencies that the President has urged Congress to accept, involving the Kurds, Bangladesh and Egypt, Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the incoming Democratic whip, told the House it was now time to help "American middle-income families who are suffering."
 
Little Response From G.O.P.
 In contrast, Republicans had little to say and did not use all their allotted debate time before the vote. Representative Jerry Lewis, of California and chairman of the Republican Conference, said, "Democrats had plenty of time to change the law" when the recession was more severe and should have acted sooner if they were serious.
Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, said, "Their real emergency with long-term unemployment is the long-term unemployment of their Presidential candidates."
At his news conference, which began soon before the House acted, Mr. Bush said, "The last thing we want to do is break the budget agreement and spend outside to increase the deficit." The President couched his answer with optimism about the economy and said the lower unemployment level for July was "very good news."
A White House spokesman said the current plan was for Mr. Bush to sign the bill but not issue the emergency declaration. Such a strategy would allow the President to avoid a veto and with it the continuing public attention that would accompany the Congressional votes to override.
Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the senior Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, said it was "unlikely" that Mr. Bush would issue the emergency declaration.
 
Paying for the Benefits
 The bill would cover the period from Sept. 1 through July 4. It would provide benefits beyond the basic 26 weeks' unemployment compensation much more widely than under current law. To pay for the new benefits, the Government would draw from an $8 billion Federal trust fund.
Under current law, benefits can be extended for 13 weeks in a state when joblessness among its workers who are covered by unemployment insurance reaches 6 percent. The benefits can also be extended when the rate reaches 5 percent if the level of the insured jobless exceeds by one-fifth the average level in that state over the last two years.
The unemployment rate among those covered by insurance, about half of the workforce, is much lower than the total unemployment rate. As a result, only in Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico are extended benefits now being paid.
Under the bill, the measuring standard used would be total unemployment, not insured unemployment. In states with 8 percent unemployment, averaged over the last six months, an additional 20 weeks of benefits could be paid. If the law were in effect today, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi and West Virginia would be added to the list of states that now qualify.
In states with 7 percent unemployment, an extra 13 weeks of benefits could be paid. The nation's two most populous states, New York and California, are among 13 that would qualify.
In states with 6 percent unemployment, an additional 7 weeks of benefits could be paid;, and in all other states an additional 4 weeks could be paid.
The other major change provided by the bill would be permanent rather than expire next July. It would make people who leave the armed services eligible for 26 weeks of benefits, instead of the current 13 weeks. They would also be able to start collecting after one week instead of the current four. Under both changes, they would be treated like civilians.
Democrats in the House disputed Mr. Bush's conclusion that the recession was ending, noting that the main reason for the decline in the unemployment rate was that many workers had given up trying to find jobs.
But the Democrats also argued that unemployment would remain high for some time even if the economy turned up and that as many as 300,000 workers would exhaust their regular 26 weeks of benefits each month. And they assailed Richard G. Darman, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, for saying earlier this week that too generous an unemployment system encouraged people to stay out of work.
"It's Republican macho that the unemployed enjoy unemployment," said Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Long Island, the bill's principal House sponsor.
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said Mr. Darman's remark was "in the worst tradition of stand-aside attitudes on the part of people in government."
Mr. Foley told a news conference that if the President did not implement the extended benefits, "we are going to be right back here in September with another bill." And Mr. Gephardt said that the House might pass a bill then that did not allow the President to sign it and then nullify it by refusing to issue an emergency declaration.
The bill that passed today is expected to be delivered to the White House formally on Monday. That would give Mr. Bush until Aug. 15 to act, or it would become law without his signature. But it would have no effect unless he issued the emergency declaration.

HEADLINE: Bush Says Only Bad Health Would Bar Candidacy in '92

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
President Bush all but announced his intention to seek re-election at a Rose Garden news conference today, saying that only a change in his health would deter him from seeking a second term.
Mr. Bush then tested a potential campaign theme by accusing a "frustratingly negative" Congress of blocking his domestic legislative agenda. 
 As if determined to allay any lingering concerns about his health, Mr. Bush declared, "I feel like a million dollars," and said he was extraordinarily "blessed" for a man of 67.
The remarks, his first since his return last night from the Soviet Union, were aimed at Democrats who this week accused him of abandoning social and financial problems at home for the glitter of global summitry.
 
Initially Coy About Plans
 When asked about his re-election plans, Mr. Bush was initially coy, saying he had not decided whether to try for a second term and might not do so until next year. But moments later, he added that he knew of nothing that would stop him from making such a bid.
"I'll be honest, the only thing would be a health problem, and I don't have one right now," Mr. Bush said. "But, I mean it wouldn't be fair to the American people to ask to be re-elected knowing that you, in your heart of hearts, might feel you couldn't finish the job. But I don't feel that way."
With that comment, Mr. Bush edged close to making the formal announcement that he said he would make early next year. Although incumbent Presidents are usually reticent about announcing for a second term, Mr. Bush's strong hint may have been intended to scotch rumors among some Bush family friends that his wife, Barbara, might oppose a second term for health reasons.
The President stressed his feeling several times that he had fully recovered from the heart arrhythmia and thyroid problems he experienced in the spring. The White House later said that Mr. Bush had been examined by his doctor, Burton Lee, and pronounced in "excellent health."
The President said he would discuss his prospects for a second term with his Washington political advisers this weekend at the Presidential retreat in Camp David, Md.
The White House press office declined to disclose who would attend that meeting, saying Mr. Bush did not wish to publicly embarrass anyone left out.
Associates of Mr. Bush said that the meeting was to be an informal gathering meant to convey the message that the President was serious about preparing for a second term and that no one should be lulled into overconfidence by his current political popularity.
Those associates later said that a mix of Mr. Bush's current advisers and veterans of his 1980 and 1988 races for the White House would go to Camp David. They included Robert Teeter, Mr. Bush's pollster; Frederic V. Malek, an airline executive and longtime political friend; Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher; Vice President Dan Quayle; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady; Ronald Kaufman, a White House staff member and political adviser; Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter; Jeannie Austin, co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee; Craig L. Fuller, who headed Mr. Bush's staff when he was Vice President, and Mr. Bush's current chief of staff, John H. Sununu.
 
Attacks on Congress
 Mr. Bush appeared to revel in the back-and-forth about his political plans. Asked when he would announce his re-election plans, the President answered, "Well, I want to get some opinion from all these gurus with whom I'll be surrounded here." Then he added: "Maybe January, I don't know. It's just -- please don't write 'maybe January' down. It may be February. It may be March. I don't know."
But he reserved most of his energy for attacking Congressional Democrats, who have begun criticizing what they say is his apparent lack of sustained interest in domestic problems like welfare reform and economic policy and who have begun to make political issues of his record on matters like civil rights, abortion and drug control.
Recent public opinion polls have suggested that while the public believes Mr. Bush can handle national security matters more effectively than his Democratic critics, the Democrats are seen as better able to deal with domestic issues like the environment and education.
At one point, Mr. Bush turned from the crowd of reporters in front of him to the television cameras recording his news conference, making his point directly to viewers.
"So please, American people -- let me look over this way -- please, do not listen to the charges by frantic Democrats who are trying to say we don't have a domestic policy, when we have a very good one," he said.
As prime examples of his Administration's interest in domestic matters, Mr. Bush cited his initiatives on civil rights, education and housing, although the Senator who has been trying to work out a compromise with the White House on civil rights legislation, John C. Danforth of Missouri, has failed in his effort.
Later, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Ronald H. Brown, attacked Mr. Bush for opposing the civil rights legislation and a Democratic proposal to extend unemployment benefits for about three million jobless people.
"While the Soviets, the Syrians and the Chinese get an animated George Bush ready to cut deals and get things done, back home on the domestic front, he's just the veto man," Mr. Brown said in a written statement.
Mr. Bush called the charges part of "a concerted liberal Democratic attack on the President" and suggested that he would mount a stiff counterattack after returning from his vacation at his home in Kennebunkport, Me., the day after Labor Day. He indicated that he would use his attack on the Democrats in campaign trips this fall for Republican candidates for Congress.
"Wait till you see me come back after August, after I'm rested up a little, to take on these fellows," Mr. Bush said.

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Journal;
Egan for Mayor. Ah, but Which One?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL DeCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 2

 BODY:
The Republican City Committee met one night this week in Palumbo's Nostalgia Room in South Philadelphia to nominate a candidate to replace Frank L. Rizzo, who died of a heart attack last month in the middle of his fifth mayoral campaign. But everybody already knew that the new candidate had been selected, though there has been much confusion involving his name and exactly who he is.
Earlier this week, William A. Meehan, the last big-city Republican Party boss in America, gave his endorsement and, for all practical purposes, that was that. The rest was cigar smoke. "I've never lost a roll-call vote, but there is always a first time," Mr. Meehan, a 66-year-old lawyer, predicted Thursday afternoon, just before the ward leaders voted unanimously to accept his choice. (Never mind that the Republicans have not had a mayoral victory since 1947 and have won only a few citywide races in those years.) 
 Mr. Meehan endorsed, and the Republican ward leaders nominated, Joseph J. Egan, a commercial real estate broker, as the choice to lead the party's ticket Nov. 5 against the Democratic mayoral candidate, Edward G. Rendell, a former Philadelphia District Attorney.
But it would not be Pennsylvania politics this year without a lawsuit to scramble things.
On Thursday, a civic leader filed a suit in Federal District Court saying the city Republican Party's nominating process was undemocratic and unconstitutional. The suit comes at a time when the Federal Courts are considering challenges to the state's elections laws dealing with Congressional races.
There is also confusion about the Republican candidate. Mr. Egan, like many recent Republican mayoral candidates, is a former Democrat, and this year he was running for a seat on the City Council in his first attempt at an elected office.
Many people erroneously think Mr. Egan is another Egan, the Egan who twice before, in 1983 and 1987, ran unsuccessful Republican mayoral campaigns. The confusion increased when the lesser-known Mr. Egan introduced the well-known John J. Egan, the two-time loser, as his campaign adviser this week.
"I know Egan, he ran for mayor before," a police detective said this week, confusing, as many do, the well-known Egan with the lesser-known Egan. "I wish him luck, whoever he is," he added. The detective, who was taking a walk downtown during his lunch break, said he did not want to give his name. But he said it was not Egan.
A spark of controversy helped clear the air a bit when the well-known Egan announced Wednesday that he would not become the lesser-known Egan's campaign manager after all, because of a perceived conflict of interest. It seems that the well-known Egan is a member of the new nonpartisan financial oversight board, which the State Legislature created to help Philadelphia out of its fiscal crisis. Democrats, including state legislators, said that because board members would be passing judgment on the next mayor's budgets, board members should not be running a mayoral candidate's campaign.
Will the name confusion help or hinder Mr. Egan's campaign? "There is a benefit there, but it's negligible," the candidate said in an interview on Thursday. Mr. Egan said he was putting together a campaign staff and was trying to raise $1.5 million for the 14-week campaign.
By comparison, Mr. Rendell spent $1.8 million in the primary and is preparing to spend $2.2 million to $2.5 million in the general election, said David L. Cohen, Mr. Rendell's campaign manager. "Egans, Egans, everywhere, but we're treating any candidate the Republicans nominate as a serious threat," said Mr. Cohen, adding that Mr. Rendell was vacationing in Bermuda.
Political analysts say the Republicans are giving the election away. "Joe Egan has no name recognition, no previous citywide campaign experience, no money and no campaign organization," said David Buffington, editor of the Pennsylvania Report, a political newsletter. "No way can he enter the race at this late date and be, even remotely, a credible candidate."
Candidate Egan is a native Philadelphian, a high school graduate who worked his way up to partner in a major real estate brokerage. He has also served as president of the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation, a quasi-public economic development agency. He is married, has three adult children and describes himself as "a results guy, a coalition builder."
The theme of his campaign, he continued, would be "change." He also said he planned to pick up where Mr. Rizzo left off with his law-and-order theme.
The rest of his campaign platform, as he described it, is identical, even in its vagueness, to Mr. Rizzo's. If elected, Mr. Egan said he would hire more police officers, reduce spending on social services and bring better management to government without turning over city services to private companies, a major campaign issue this year.
To help the electorate sort out the Egans, Candidate Egan, who is 57 years old, gave this tip: "I'm younger and better looking than John Egan."
To which John Egan, who is 48, responded: "Joe must have been kidding."

HEADLINE: Sweeping Health Care Bill Drafted, Charting Path for Congress Next Year

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, today introduced a bill that would essentially set price controls for health care services, lower the age of eligibility for Medicare to 60 and impose new taxes to finance health insurance for millions of Americans who lack such protection.
Neither Mr. Rostenkowski's bill nor a similar measure offered by Senate Democratic leaders is likely to be enacted this year. But they provide a road map for Congressional action in 1992 or 1993, and they stake out a political position from which Democrats plan to chide President Bush and other Republicans in the 1992 campaign. 
 The Administration has been studying the issue since February 1990, but appears to be internally divided on how best to help the 34 million people who have no health insurance.
Mr. Rostenkowski, a Democrat from Illinois, would gradually reduce the eligibility age for Medicare to 60 from 65, to cover the many workers who retire early. Aides to the Congressman estimated that this change, when fully effective, would cost $25 billion a year. The Census Bureau says there are more than 10.5 million people from 60 to 64 years old.
 
A Price-Control Approach
 Mr. Rostenkowski's bill rejects proposals for national health insurance monopolized by the Government, calling instead for the Government to establish price ceilings so that health spending would grow at roughly the same rate as the gross national product, the total output of goods and services, starting in 2001. In recent years, health spending has grown much faster than the economy as a whole, partly because of the growing number of elderly people and partly because of life-saving improvements in medical technology.
The Ways and Means panel originates tax legislation and is responsible for Medicare, so Mr. Rostenkowski is in a strong position to influence any change in the nation's health-care system. He said he would hold hearings on his bill in October, and he emphasized that he was open to suggestions for improving it.
"There is no more important problem confronting our country today than health care," Mr. Rostenkowski said in introducing his proposal. "It is time to abandon the catchy slogans and gear up for the legislative long march."
But he said, "Absent Presidential leadership, we will not be able to achieve a major reform of the health-care system." He said he was willing to see health care as "the cornerstone issue of the next Presidential election," and he asserted, "George Bush is wrong to duck this issue."
Mr. Rostenkowski's bill, like the one introduced by the Senate's Democratic majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, says that all employers must provide basic health insurance for employees or pay a tax to help finance care under a Government program like Medicare. This requirement would be phased in gradually from 1993 to 1996, starting with employers who have more than 100 workers.
Mr. Rostenkowski proposes a surtax that would increase the income tax obligations of individuals and corporations by 6 percent in 1993 and 1994, by 7 percent in 1995 and by 9 percent in 1996. The surtax would help pay for the care of people who did not receive health insurance from employers or other sources.
 
Panel to Hold Down Costs
 The Rostenkowski bill would set limits on the permissible growth in national health spending and would create a panel of 11 experts known as the Health Care Cost Containment Commission. The panel would would negotiate with health-care providers to decide how much of national health outlays should go to doctors, hospitals, laboratories and other entities. Prescription drugs are not subject to cost control in the bill.
The Secretary of Health and Human Services would translate the commission's decisions into reality by setting annual payment rates for health care services. The rates would establish the maximum amounts to be paid for specific services by Government, employers and private insurers.
To cover the additional costs of having more than 10 million more Medicare beneficiaries, Mr. Rostenkowski would increase the amount of wages subject to the Medicare payroll tax, and the tax rate. Under current law, employer and employee each pay a Medicare tax equal to 1.45 percent of the first $125,000 of earnings. The amount of earnings subject to the tax was increased from $51,300 last year and would be raised again, to $200,000 in 1993, under Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal. He would increase the rate to 1.55 percent in 1993 and to 1.65 percent in 1996.
Mr. Rostenkowski did not have an estimate of how his bill would affect families. But it is clear that the tax increases could be substantial, especially for those with high income.
 
National Health System Seen
 As lawmakers left town for the summer recess, few were available to comment on the new proposal.
Stuart M. Butler, director of domestic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, said: "These bills purport to be a kind of midway position between what we now have and universal national health insurance, like what exists in Canada, Britain or Sweden. But in practice these proposals are unstable. They will degenerate or evolve into some type of national health system."
But John C. Rother, legislative director of the American Association of Retired Persons, said he supported the idea of lowering the age of eligibility for Medicare, and he praised the Congressman for candor in specifying how to pay for his proposals, something the Senate plan does not do.
The basic benefits required under Mr. Rostenkowski's bill would generally be the same as those available through Medicare. But preventive and pediatric health services would be added to the Medicare package.
The bill would also set Federal standards for health insurance sold to groups of employees, and it would allow self-employed people to take larger tax deductions for such insurance, provided the coverage met Federal criteria.

Weigh Basic vs. 'Big' Research

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"NASA's Untouchable Folly" (editorial, July 14) was right on target.
As chairman of the House Budget Committee task force on defense, foreign policy and space, I held a hearing last week on the budgetary consequences of "big science" projects like the space station and the superconducting supercollider. The hearing made it clear that financing these projects may very well come at the expense of other compelling science needs that provide a far stronger contribution to the maintenance of America's scientific base and our international economic competitiveness.
Under President Bush's budget proposal, spending on large research and development projects increased by 29 percent over fiscal year 1991 levels, and would consume an increasing share of the domestic discretionary spending during the first half of the 1990's.
The President's proposed increases for the space station and supercollider represent 50 percent of all his proposed increases for domestic discretionary spending in fiscal year 1994. If we include NASA's earth-observing system, these three largest projects represent 90 percent of the President's request for domestic discretionary spending growth in fiscal year 1994. These increases stand in sharp contrast to the $3.6 billion in Federal spending reductions in fiscal year 1994 that were imposed by last year's budget agreement.
My task force will hold another hearing to examine our investment in "small science" projects and the contributions which basic and applied research make to United States competitiveness and the maintenance of America's scientific base. In these times of severe budgetary constraints, Congress must invest scarce Federal research and development dollars wisely and in a way that will insure that the United States gets the greatest possible return for these dollars.

HEADLINE: Congress Gets in Way Of Microenterprises

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We are pleased that Lorna Hahn (Op-Ed, July 22) recognized the long-term support by the United States Agency for International Development given to South African black private enterprise, and A.I.D.'s microenterprise assistance program, which operates in more than 50 developing countries.
Several points require clarification, however. A.I.D.'s commitment to its microenterprise program does not depend on Congress passing the microenterprise development portion of the foreign aid bill. Funds increased from $57.5 million worldwide in 1988 to $85 million in 1990 and are projected to grow to more than $137 million in 1992. The legislation Ms. Hahn refers to calls for a program level of only $85 million next year.
As is often the case, apart from setting a target level for spending on microenterprise, the legislation Ms. Hahn supports contains restrictive provisions that would decrease the agency's flexibility to fashion microenterprise programs to the situation of each recipient country.
Rather than helping microentrepreneurs in South Africa and elsewhere, such restrictions can actually thwart the legislation's purported objectives.

HEADLINE: Dow Declines 11.41 Points, to 3,006.26

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
The prices of blue chip stocks fell slightly yesterday, with analysts citing disappointingly weak employment numbers released in the morning. They said the decline reflected investor concern that the current economic recovery may be anemic, at best.
 Falling for a second day after a three-day advance, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 11.41 points, to close at 3,006.26. Still, the Dow remained above the 3,000 mark and ended 33.76 points higher than when the week began. The day's volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 162.3 million shares, down from 170.6 million on Thursday. 
Smaller stocks fared better. Prices were higher on the American Stock Exchange, where the value index rose by 0.16 point, to close at 368.40. In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq composite index rose by 1.52 points, to 505.67.
 
'A Very Disappointing Day'
 "It was a very disappointing day," said Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. "Any day that employment numbers come out is an important day. But based on the numbers that the market saw, it was disappointed."
 In what is considered the first significant economic indicator of the third quarter, the Labor Department reported yesterday morning that nonfarm employment fell by an unexpected 51,000 jobs. Many analysts had expected employment to rise. In response to this weak showing, the bond market rallied, reflecting a belief that the Federal Reserve would act soon to lower interest rates.
 In theory, falling interest rates should be good news for stocks. But the market saw it differently. Because of poor earnings at many corporations, investors saw the weak employment numbers as a sign the recovery might be particularly weak.
 "The belief is that corporate earnings will not be strong enough to validate stocks at their current levels," Mr. Johnson said.
 
A Rise at the Opening
 The market opened higher, even though the opening bell on the Big Board came more than an hour after the Labor Department issued the employment statistics. And stock prices continued to rise for about an hour, going as high as 3,042. But as the employment numbers were analyzed by economists and the view was decidedly gloomy, the market quickly tumbled and stayed down the rest of the day.
 "The bears were in the economic firms," said William M. LeFevre, a market strategist with Tucker Anthony Inc. "And they were talking about a weak recovery and job losses."
 One positive sign was that more Big Board stocks closed up than down, by 894 to 683. "We're at the point where the stock market needs improving earnings more than lower interest rates," Mr. LeFevre said.
 
Gains for Some Stocks
 Individual stocks and groups of stocks performed in line with yesterday's economic news. Companies that tend to do well in good times and bad did well. The most important of these were pharmaceutical stocks, which as a group closed higher. The leader was Eli Lilly, which closed at 79, up 2 3/4. Consumer and household stocks, which also do well in weak times, did well yesterday. Coca-Cola closed at 61 7/8, up 1, and Gillette closed at 40 3/4, up 1/2.
 While most oil stocks ended the day slightly off, one big gainer was USX-Marathon, which rose 1 3/4, to 27 5/8. The stock gained on reports that a newly discovered Tunisian oilfield may be bigger than typical oilfields in that region.
 Some stocks were hurt by bad news yesterday. McDonnell-Douglas fell to 54 1/4, down 2 1/8, after Singapore Airlines canceled orders for some 20 MD-11 midrange airplanes, chosing Airbus Industrie instead. Analysts took this as a bad sign for future orders to American companies from other Asian carriers.

HEADLINE: Corporate Lessons In Campus Quality

BYLINE: By Claudia H. Deutsch

 BODY:
JUDGING by the more than 75,000 students who pursue M.B.A.'s each year -- and the businesses that recruit them -- American executives have swallowed whole the idea that exposure to professorial research and classroom wit is essential to success.
Now, the tables are turning. Universities, facing a demographically induced shrinkage in the pool of students and a recession-induced shrinkage in financial support, are discovering that neither their staff theoreticians nor their professors-cum-consultants have a magic pill that attracts and retains customers. 
 So now, universities are going to industry to learn, not lecture. Their plea: Teach us about quality, customer service, teamwork, all the things we've supposedly been teaching you for lo these many years.
"We've finally recognized that there's an awful lot a university can learn from a corporation," said William E. Kirwan, president of the University of Maryland.
 
Turning to Industry
 Specifically, university administrators have asked companies to help them set up Total Quality Management programs. Called T.Q.M. throughout industry, these popular programs are as much mindset as method. They require every corporate department to define its customers, beef up activities that are directly linked to serving those customers and eliminate most everything else.
"T.Q.M. is a leadership philosophy, an ability to look at every product and service you provide from everyone's point of view," said Aris Melissaratos, a vice president of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation who often helps universities with T.Q.M.
Last year more than 500 academics came to hear industry speakers at the first Total Quality Management in Academia symposium, hosted by the University of West Virginia. Maryland held its own daylong T.Q.M. conference in March, at which executives and university administrators took turns discussing their experiences. Nearly 900 people showed up.
Corning, Westinghouse, Xerox, Hewlett-Packard and other large companies regularly send executives, gratis, to speak to university administrators about T.Q.M. The Ford Motor Company brings in delegations from universities to observe its T.Q.M. program.
The University of Pennsylvania is paying Frank Topper, a consultant, to teach quality processes to its administrative staff. "They're learning how not to waste other people's time or dollars," Mr. Topper said.
These are not easy lessons to absorb for the political minefield that is academia. T.Q.M., by its nature, is apolitical. It defines "customer" as anyone who uses a department's services -- even people normally considered the "enemy." Under T.Q.M., people in purchasing, for example, must put top priority on easing the process for ordering supplies -- and that means catering to the very people whom purchasing has traditionally held responsible for bidding and ordering problems.
"T.Q.M. is a team approach, and universities notoriously don't work well as teams," said L. Edwin Coate, vice president for finance and administration at Oregon State University.
Nor do universities easily embrace the idea that they have customers, rather than supplicants and apprentices. "While companies are figuring how to better focus on their customers, schools are still defining who those customers are," said Charles P. Kendig, a Xerox quality specialist on loan to the University of Maryland.
Universities do, in fact, deal with multiple customer groups: the students who pay tuition, the companies that hire those students, the people who approve research grants and the people who use the research.
And university bureaucracy can be a killer. Take the "simple" process of collecting money for grant programs. Faculty members file grant proposals with department chiefs, who file them with the head of the school, who files them with the office of research negotiation, who negotiates terms with the sponsor. By the time they get to accounting, there have been hundreds of chances for mistakes -- and no way to place blame.
 
Order From Chaos
 T.Q.M. breaks such chaotic problems into manageable tasks. The University of Pennsylvania carved a team out of every group involved in the grant process, and charged it with reducing errors and lowering deficits. As of June the team had redesigned invoices, mapped out negotiation guidelines and simplified communications and accounting. "They went on a diagnostic journey, not to fix blame but to fix systems," Mr. Topper said.
More universities are trying this approach. Their T.Q.M. teams are interviewing students, faculty members, campus recruiters, all sorts of "customers," to see what they want done differently, and devising ways to do it.
At the University of Maryland, Mr. Kirwan and his vice presidents went through a one-day brush-up program on the rudiments of programs that address quality issues. Now they are talking about pushing T.Q.M. principles at the faculty.
"They should provide a clear syllabus on day one, accessible office hours, advance notice of when the final exam will be," Mr. Kirwan said. "They must think what students want from the classroom experience, and give it to them."
Oregon State is also broadening its T.Q.M. scope. This year its benefits office changed its call routing methods, and increased by 40 percent the number of calls answered by a person rather than an answering machine. Its purchasing department rethought a few forms and reduced the number of vouchers returned to other departments for more information by a staggering 94 percent. Now, to please "customers" in industry who complained about new hires who can't write well, Oregon State is teaching students to write better.
Similarly, after focus groups with students, the University of Tennessee's College of Business Administration scuttled an arbitrary system of scheduling 15-minute sessions with counselors in favor of one that allots time in terms of problem complexity. At the request of participants in the advanced management program, it has instituted follow-up visits by faculty members to company premises months after the courses end. To please other departments, financial affairs provides simplified accounting statements for department heads and more detailed ones for donors who want to see where their money goes.
Now C. Warren Neel, the business school's dean, is thinking the unthinkable. He is asking faculty teams to examine whether by rescheduling some classes they can ease parking congestion and uneven classroom utilization. "Tampering with scheduling strikes at the heart of faculty autonomy," Dr. Neel said. "But if it is important to students or other customers, we have to address it."

HEADLINE: SPECIAL REPORT;
Catering to a New Crowd

BYLINE: By Jonathan P. Hicks

 BODY:
EIGHT YEARS AGO, Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond allocated about $147,000 for child-care services, which provide developmental programs and meals for children of students throughout the workday. That budget has since grown 61 percent, to more than $200,000, for the school year ending this spring.
The increase largely reflects the higher number of older students with children who are returning to the university to complete degrees or entering the university later in life to pursue a deferred ambition of higher education, university administrators say. 
 "The average age of our students is 26," said Eugene P. Tranni, president of Virginia Commonwealth, which has a student body of 21,700. "For the first time this past year, we had more first-time transfer students than we have first-time freshman students. When you have numbers like that, you are catering to older students and you have to do things differently and develop programs with these older students in mind."
The increase in child-care spending is only one of many ways in which the sprawling campus in Richmond has joined universities nationwide in responding to the growing number of college students over age 25.
"With 18-to-20-year-old students, you have more services dedicated to nonacademic programming: intramural activities, concerts and the typical things you find on a college campus," Dr. Tranni said. "But when the average age is 26, you have students who are more concerned with placement services, part-time jobs and university services that are open at times when working students can take advantage of them."
The distinctive schedules, budgets and life styles of these young adults has prompted changes in the structure and economics of many universities.
Colorado State University, for example, is providing credit courses in 21 disciplines through videotapes to about 100 sites -- mostly for corporation employees. Students send completed assignments and tests to the university in Fort Collins for grading. Faculty members can be consulted during arranged hours.
The University of Maryland's University College leads a consortium of eight other universities in providing degrees through cable television. "There are a number of working adults whose schedules and geographic locations make it impossible for them to attend a traditional class in a traditional setting," said Lissa Brown, a University College spokeswoman. She said the program is designed to make a college education attainable to "everyone from firefighters and homemakers to workers whose workshifts change repeatedly."
Even the scheduling of courses in more traditional settings has begun to reflect the needs of a growing number of students who hold full- or part-time jobs. University officials say they now offer a larger number of classes beginning before 8 A.M. and after 5 P.M. More classes are being scheduled on weekends.
"Surveys of students' class schedules have shown that 47 percent of all the adult students who are studying for credit take classes after 5 P.M.," said J. Noah Brown, director of governmental relations with the National University Continuing Education Association, a Washington-based organization promoting programs for older students. That has meant keeping buildings open longer, which has driven up maintenance costs.
Mr. Brown also said that, while the increased number of older students has not dramatically affected most college curriculums, it has fueled an expansion in certificate programs, nondegree courses that carry specific academic requirements and are a recognized credential in fields like real estate and conflict resolution. "There has been a big explosion in these programs, largely because states are mandating more of them within many professions," he said.
 
Not All Schools Are Affected
 Not all schools have been affected by the rising number of older students. Some officials of smaller, private institutions in smaller communities contend that adults in their 20's and 30's often find their curriculum too rigorous and their tuition too high.
Nonetheless, to compensate for the declining population of 18-to-20-year-olds, many smaller, private colleges are spending large sums to recruit older students, through brochures and by sending administrators to address business and professional groups.
University administrators say older students are less inclined to pursue liberal arts majors than business, engineering and computer science courses.
"Most are not coming back with the idea of self-improvement in mind, but to pursue what they consider practical means of career advancement or professional development," said Beverly R. Greenfieg, a coordinator of the Returning Students Program at the University of Maryland in College Park, a separate program from the one at Maryland's University College.
 
 
'Services We Haven't Thought About'
 Like other universities, the University of Maryland has created programs aimed at easing the transition for these new kids on campus. "We are discovering that a larger number of older students are taking care of parents who need care," said Barbara J. Goldberg, another coordinator of the Returning Students Program. "That means that we have to begin to think about services we haven't thought about before," like adult day care, which the university is exploring.
The university also provides networking meetings, where older students can meet one another and discuss assertiveness, financial assistance, study skills and other concerns.

HEADLINE: The Great Alaska Debate

BYLINE: By Timothy Egan; Timothy Egan is Seattle bureau chief of The Times.

 BODY:
THE BEST-KEPT SECRET in the oil industry lies under a steel pipe, six inches in diameter, that pokes out of the tundra inside one of the world's last truly wild places. Eight months of the year, the pipe is surrounded by the frozen chop of snow and blue ice that covers the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Alaska. A desert, with less than 10 inches of annual precipitation, the flat land bordering the Beaufort Sea holds the imprint of a savage wind for most of the year: snowdrifts contorted and hardened, a landscape like paste from a blender.
In the summer, when the sun circles the horizon but never sets, the snow melts, wildflowers rise in the plain and great masses of caribou arrive to give birth to their young, seeking the coastal wind as refuge from swarms of mosquitoes. Driven by biological imperative, the animal herds gorge themselves on grass and flowers, storing fuel for the long migration through the Brooks Range in mid-summer. 
 In September, the tundra freezes again, the sea hardens, grizzly bears hibernate in pockets of warmer air near the mountains, daylight is squeezed from the sky. Through the seasons, the pipe remains -- a totem of the great mystery whose resolution may determine the future of American energy policy. The five-foot shank of steel marks an exploratory oil well, called KIC-1, that was drilled by a partnership led by Chevron U.S.A. in 1985 and 1986 at a cost of more than $40 million. The oil companies drilled to a depth of 15,200 feet on land owned by an Eskimo regional corporation in order to peek beneath the permafrost. They may have discovered the largest recoverable oil field in North America, or they may have struck out, reaching only natural gas or water in a reservoir mapped out by geologists.
Fewer than 10 people know what was found beneath the pipe, says Tom Cook, a geologist who is Chevron's exploration representative in Alaska. The oil company considers the information obtained from its exploratory well proprietary and will not share its findings. Test drilling for oil, like trying to forecast the weather, is risky, an inexact science. Nobody, not even the Chevron geologists, knows for sure how much oil there may be under the refuge, or how much of it is recoverable. But the test results must have been tantalizing enough, prompting the intense lobbying now underway in Congress by the major oil companies.
"What you get from that kind of well is a better understanding of the geology," Cook says, poker-faced. He lights a cigar inside one of the drab huts latched to the tundra in the oil town of Deadhorse, at Prudhoe Bay, 65 miles west of the refuge. "Hopefully that puts us at a competitive advantage when -- if -- we start production," he says.
The question of whether the nation's second-largest wildlife refuge (the biggest is the Yukon Delta Refuge in western Alaska) will be opened to roads, drilling pads and the clank of industry pursuing another jackpot is up to Congress. In May, the Senate Energy Committee passed legislation that would allow drilling in the refuge, and the full Senate is expected to take up the matter in the fall. For the time being, by law, the 19-million-acre refuge is for the predominant use of wildlife so abundant inside the Arctic Circle that the area is often called the American Serengeti. (Map on page 26.) In a symmetry so perfect it suggests a modern parable, the refuge also happens to contain what many geologists consider the last great untapped oil field on the continent -- with a potential for yielding up to nine billion barrels, nearly matching that of Prudhoe Bay, America's biggest. More than 180,000 caribou, a herd that is to the native Gwich'in people what the Great Plains bison were to the Lakota Sioux, migrate annually to calving grounds in the same general area where the oil is supposed to be. Chief among the questions now before Congress is whether oil production and caribou can share the same patch of cold ground.
Beyond that, the fight over the Arctic refuge has once again raised the question of just how far Americans are willing to go for more domestic oil -- how many more wilderness areas, pristine beaches and wildlife refuges will be violated as the oil runs out. Eighteen years have passed since the oil crisis of 1973, but American energy policy has barely changed. More than 100 years ago, when oil production began in earnest in this country, the wells were located on industrial land, close to cities. Now drillers are knocking at the door of an Arctic wilderness in the most remote corner of the continent. For conservationists who would draw the line around this vast home for caribou and musk oxen, all other environmental battles are dwarfed by this epic struggle over the Arctic refuge. It may be the last big land fight of its kind.
 PRESIDENT BUSH has made drilling in the refuge the centerpiece of his national energy policy; Democrats, joined by many Republicans, are pushing fuel efficiency as an alternative. Increasing the average fuel-economy standard for new cars from 27.5 to 34 miles a gallon by the year 2001, the argument for conservation goes, would save more oil than could ever be pumped from the refuge. But the President will veto any energy bill, according to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, that does not include lifting the restrictions on Arctic oil development.
For those who want cheap Alaskan crude to keep flowing into the next century, the argument is simple. As Tom Cook says, "Do you want your energy policy always to be, 'Shoot the guy who's got the oil,' or should we develop our own resources?"
Sixty-five percent of the world's known oil reserves are in the Middle East; the United States has only about 4 percent. Conservationists point out that even if the Arctic refuge proved to be a bonanza as big as Prudhoe Bay, which produces about 1.5 million barrels a day but is declining at a rate of roughly 10 percent a year, the United States will continue to have to import up to half its oil. "We simply cannot drill ourselves to energy independence," says George T. Frampton Jr., president of the Wilderness Society.
The Arctic refuge -- with its prehistoric-looking musk oxen, millions of migratory birds, Dall sheep, wolf packs, moose, majestic caribou herds and fearsome polar bears -- has taken on an importance well beyond its potential ability to keep gas prices down and soldiers out of foreign lands. The ancient human cultures of Inupiat Eskimos on the one side and Gwich'in Indians on the other are also part of the refuge's ecology. As metaphor, the refuge is a sort of frozen Eden, the last paradise at the far northern edge of the Final Frontier. Larger than 10 of the states, it is without the industrial footprints that cover the rest of the globe -- the "geography of hope," as the writer Wallace Stegner defined wilderness.
Even the most poetic of nature writers find themselves straining to describe the coastal plain -- 8 percent of the total refuge -- which is where oil drilling would take place if Congress gives its approval. Few would call it majestic. "Grave, austere and beautiful" is how Peter Matthiessen described it recently. Unlike the rest of the refuge, which enjoys the more moderate climate of the south and abounds with spruce trees, flowering heathers and alpine crags, the 1.5 million acres of the coastal plain are flat and harsh. For most of the year, the area lacks color and the untidy edges of life. "A barren desert," in the words of Alaska Senator Ted Stevens, perhaps the most vocal proponent in the Senate of opening the refuge to drilling. But its emptiness is what some people find so redeeming. They see value in what the plain does not have -- the heavy metal and caterwauling tools of the oil industry. Of the 1,100 miles of northern Alaska coast along the Arctic Ocean, only the 125-mile stretch inside the refuge is off limits to development.
"Oil and gas development would destroy this area, with all its wild and spectacular diversity, forever," Sydney J. Butler, a vice president of the Wilderness Society, wrote in a letter to United States Senators in May. At the same time, three major environmental groups -- the National Wildlife Federation, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Trustees for Alaska -- released a report in which they pleaded with Congress to keep the refuge inviolate. At stake, the report said, is "the biological integrity of America's only Arctic sanctuary and the future of the wildlife it protects."
 FLYING LOW OVER the snow on a day when the surface is crackling under 24-hour sun, we leave the intersecting roads around Prudhoe Bay and enter a white wilderness. The landscape seems to be in a hurry to make the elemental transformation from ice to water -- alive with "breakup," a word used by Alaskans to describe late spring. The snow pack is surprisingly low, less than a foot on average. Bits of grass show here and there. The Beaufort Sea is just starting to reveal itself through broken ice; offshore, Eskimos have begun their annual hunt for seals. Inland, about 25 miles from the coast, grizzly bears are rousing themselves from a winter slumber in the foothills of the Brooks Range. And all through the low draws and passes of the range, caribou, led by pregnant cows, are heading north.
A large, picked-over piece of whalebone, a remnant of a spine bigger than most living rooms, is perched on the beach outside the town of Kaktovik, the only human community inside the refuge. Entering the village of 200 people, you can see the two worlds, past and future, of the Inupiat, a name that means "the Real People." They still hunt bowhead whales, their centuries-old source of subsistence. But the town has satellite dishes, off-road vehicles, new housing -- all spoils of oil money. Chevron's exploratory well was drilled just a few miles from this village, on lands for which the mineral rights are owned by the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, whose shareholders are Eskimos. Any further drilling would require Congressional approval.
"We don't want to return to the past," says Archie Brower, a Kaktovik resident, toothless and chain-smoking. "Oil is the future."
In 1980, 20 years after the refuge was set aside, Congress designated the northernmost 1.5 million acres as a "special study area" for its oil and gas potential. In 1987, the Interior Department estimated there was about a 20 percent chance of recovering large quantities of oil in the Arctic refuge. This year, citing more accurate geologic studies and recent wells drilled on the periphery of the refuge, the department upped the odds to 46 percent -- a move environmentalists label political, timed to influence the legislation now making its way through Congress.
The Government places the amount of recoverable oil in the refuge at between 600 million and 9.2 billion barrels. The mean, estimated at 3.57 billion barrels, would be enough to meet the United States' total oil demand for 200 days. But if that oil were pumped at a rate of only 1 million barrels a day, it would keep the Trans-Alaska Pipeline -- the vital artery on which Alaskans depend for everything from an annual check to performing-arts subsidies -- busy for another decade or two. For the companies that run the pipeline, timing is crucial; the vast oil complex inside the Arctic Circle must be fed a steady diet of North Slope crude. If the refuge were opened to drilling today, it would take 8 to 12 years in exploration and construction time before oil could flow from the coastal plane to the pipeline.
In one report, the Interior Department drew a picture of what oil development in the refuge would be like. The handful of oil companies expected to be involved would need about 100 miles of pipeline, 120 miles of main roads and 160 miles of less-developed spur roads, two airfields, some 60 drilling pads and up to 50 million cubic yards of gravel, used to make hard surfaces over the tundra. The coastal plain is underlaid by up to 1,500 feet of permanently frozen water, rock, sand and loose soil -- called permafrost. The thin layer atop this, which thaws to a depth of several feet, is considered extremely vulnerable to environmental damage. To minimize the industrial footprint, the oil companies have said they would try to do much of the construction work in winter, using ice roads instead of those made of gravel. They say new technological advances make it possible to put all the drill pads and service centers closer together and to use about half the space required for the construction at Prudhoe Bay in the early 70's.
The oil would be sent to the lower 48 states through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which dissects the state and runs 800 miles from its origin in Prudhoe to the ice-free port of Valdez. What happens after the oil leaves the frozen north, of course, has as much to do with the politics of opening the refuge as what may happen near the drill sites. Legislation to allow drilling cleared the Senate Energy Committee once before, in 1989 -- eight days before the Exxon Valdez struck a reef and ruptured, spilling nearly 11 million gallons into Prince William Sound. The nation's worst oil spill, killing more than 260,000 birds, at least 3,500 sea otters, 200 harbor seals and staining a marine wilderness with blankets of crude, caused many in Congress -- and in Alaska -- to think twice about the pursuit of black gold inside the Arctic Circle. The measure to open the refuge died in the 1989 Congressional session.
"After the spill, when I went to give talks about oil development in the refuge, I had some people spit on me, call me every name in the book," Cook, the Chevron geologist, says. "It was rough."
One who did not change his mind about Alaska's relationship with oil was Walter J. Hickel, the state's new Governor. He dismisses the Exxon spill as a "mechanical thing" that would never have happened if there had been tugs escorting oil tankers all the way through the sound. Running on the platform of Alaska's Independence Party -- which advocated secession from the Union, an idea he later disavowed -- the 71-year-old Hickel was returned to the Governor's mansion last fall, more than 20 years after an earlier term in the Statehouse. Elected with less than 40 percent of the vote in a three-way election, Hickel's vision for Alaska includes opening up the refuge, laying railroad tracks to the far north and constructing a pipeline to deliver fresh water from his state to the parched metropolises of Southern California.
The state controls less than one-third of Alaska's 370 million acres. The rest is tied up in national parks, wilderness preserves, wildlife refuges, military fields and land owned by native corporations, the 13 regional groups that represent 70,000 Aleuts, Eskimos and Athabascan Indians. In his inaugural address this year, Governor Hickel described Alaska as "a state on the brink of colony status once again -- because we have let our rights be taken away by the Federal Government."
The Governor's plan for Alaska has been dubbed "Wally World" by the Anchorage press. He has just limped through a legislative session in which few of his initiatives were passed into law, and his deal to settle all legal claims against Exxon in return for a payment of $1.1 billion fell apart under a shower of criticism. Nonetheless, in his disdain for official wilderness areas, he speaks for a large segment of Alaskans. Wild areas, off limits to motorized vehicles and resource extraction, are, he says, "places where people have to break laws in order to see them."
 CERTAINLY, FEW people have ever tried to see the Arctic refuge. Last year, only about 15,000 visitors were recorded, an amount equal to, say, the number of people who might cross the street in Times Square on a given morning. Hiking the coastal plain, in summer, has been compared to walking on a water bed. Those who do visit come to raft under the midnight sun, to camp in the foothills of the Brooks Range, to take pictures of the big animals or to exalt in the feeling of being an inconsequential part of nature.
Even if a million visitors a year came to the Arctic refuge, it would not change the core argument against oil development. For ANWR (pronounced an-whar), as it is called, is not primarly for people, but for animals.
In arguing that industry and wild animals can share the same land, the oil companies that want to drill in the refuge -- Chevron, ARCO, British Petroleum, among the major ones -- cite the experience of the Central Arctic caribou herd, just to the west of the refuge. The fear expressed during the last great Alaska lands debate, over the pipeline, was that North Slope production would harm this herd. But in the last 18 years, following large-scale development at Prudhoe Bay, the herd has grown from 3,000 to nearly 20,000. Pictures of caribou crossing under elevated pipelines and over gravel roads are regularly trotted out to show that oil drilling has had no discernable effect on the animals. During the 1988 Presidential campaign, George Bush proclaimed that caribou like to "snuggle up next to the pipeline."
The animals are a common sight at Prudhoe during the summer. "They cross pipelines and roads with very few problems," says G. Scott Ronzio, manager of environmental sciences for ARCO Alaska. While conceding that there is "a lot of mystery to these animals," Ronzio says, "I'm fairly confident that oil development can continue on the North Slope with no harm to caribou."
The expansion of the Central Arctic herd has been attributed by biologists to a retreat of predators, mainly wolves and grizzly bears, which keep their distance from humans, to a series of mild winters and to normal ups and downs of animal population cycles. Caribou have increased throughout Alaska. Most biologists, Ronzio among them, think the Central Arctic herd will eventually decline, and there is evidence that their growth rate is already shrinking.
The animals that migrate to the refuge, known as the Porcupine caribou herd (named for the Porcupine River, which flows through the southern edge of the refuge), are a different story. For one thing, the Porcupine herd is nearly 10 times larger than the Central Arctic herd. For another, the bigger herd does its calving in an area where oil development would take place; about half of the Central Arctic calving takes place away from oil facilities. Few biologists know exactly what would happen if pregnant caribou cows, given their limited time to give birth, tried to calve within sight and sound of an industrial complex.
"Among the Central herd, females have never adjusted to oil development," says Dr. David R. Klein, a biologist considered one of the nation's foremost experts on caribou. A frequent witness before Congressional hearings, Klein has been studying Arctic caribou for nearly 30 years. "What oil could mean to the Porcupine herd is that the females and their young would be deprived of their best feeding grounds," he says.
Caribou eat grasses and flower buds, at a rather intense rate, during the short Arctic summer. The swarms of mosquitoes that rise from the spongelike tundra have driven them to the coast for the relief of ocean breezes. If the animals were forced to scatter inland, says Klein, insects would likely harass them to a point where they would be unable to eat enough food for their return migration, a march of nearly 1,000 miles.
Of equal concern to Klein are the musk oxen, which look like creatures out of the "Star Wars" movies. The musk oxen are native to Alaska, but were hunted to extinction. Since their reintroduction 20 years ago, they have thrived in the refuge, where they live year round, eating shrubs and willows in the valleys of the Brooks Range. Now numbering about 500, the musk oxen in the refuge make up one of the largest populations in North America. Klein worries that gouging streams in the refuge to build new roads would displace the shaggy, lumbering oxen from their prime habitat, a concern that the oil companies say is ill-founded. According to Ronald W. Chappell, a spokesman for ARCO Alaska, gravel would most likely be taken from one or two central pits.
Klein speaks in the cautious language of science. Both sides of the refuge debate have tried to use his conclusions to bolster their arguments. When asked for his opinion on whether the Porcupine herd could survive oil drilling in the refuge, he says: "These animals are extremely complex, but I believe it would be very difficult for oil development to take place in the coastal plain without having a detrimental effect on them. How great that would be, no one knows."
For the Gwich'in Indians, who live in 15 tiny communities just south of Alaska's Brooks Range and the Canadian Yukon, the caribou are a matter of survival. Most Gwich'ins, who number about 7,000, live a subsistence life, depending on the Porcupine caribou herd as their primary food source, much the way some coastal Alaskan communities still survive on seasonal salmon runs. The Gwich'ins are the northernmost Indian tribe in North America, perhaps the last big aboriginal group to resist assimilation and modern ways.
"For too long this has been an issue about environment versus energy, and no one wanted to hear about the Gwich'in," says Sarah James, a native leader who lives in Arctic Village, just south of the refuge. In a statement before the Senate Energy Committee in April, James compared the Gwich'in to the buffalo-hunting Sioux of the Great Plains: "The Gwich'in are caribou people. For thousands of years we have lived with caribou right where we are today. We're talking about an Indian nation that still lives on the land and depends on this herd. In my village, about 75 percent of our protein comes from caribou."
In Arctic Village, heat from the summer sun is used to dry caribou meat. Unlike other native people, the Gwich'ins do not own any mineral rights in the refuge and have not organized into a regional corporation. Caribou is the center of their lives. The Gwich'ins consider themselves part of the natural ecology of the Arctic refuge. "We think of it as a biocultural reserve, not just a wildlife refuge," James says.
The Gwich'ins, who have barely been heard from during the decade-long debate, came together for a meeting in the summer of 1988, the first time all the tribal communties had gathered in one place in more than 100 years. They signed a proclamation, agreeing to "speak as a single voice" against oil development in the refuge.
The other native people near the refuge, Eskimos on the northern border, take the opposite stand. Whale hunters represented by a powerful regional corporation, the Inupiat say oil has changed their lives for the better. They receive millions of dollars in royalties from drilling on the North Slope, and stand to gain additional millions if the refuge is opened. About 6,000 Inupiat live in eight villages inside the Arctic Circle, most of them in the town of Barrow.
"We used to be afraid of what the oil industry would do, but we saw that it has not harmed fish or wildlife," says Warren Matumeak, an Inupiat elder who lives in Barrow. "Things have changed for the better. We have schools, roads, firefigthing equipment. Our houses have kitchens and flush toilets and TV's. It's sad that some people think we should have to go back to the old ways."
Matumeak was with his grandson, fishing for char, a type of Arctic trout, four summers ago, when he suffered a heart attack. "I said, 'Grandson, I'm going to where Jesus is.' " His cholesterol built up, he said, because he was spending too much time in front of the television, dipping caribou fat in whale blubber -- a tasty snack. He survived the heart attack, thanks to a helicopter from Barrow that airlifted him to a hospital -- a search-and-rescue made possible by oil money. Matumeak still remembers when some Eskimos lived in igloos; now his grandchildren wear Los Angeles Raiders caps and the family takes occasional vacations to Disney World.
Some Inupiat are angry that they cannot lease their own land, inside the refuge, to oil companies. "We've lived here thousands of years," says Matumeak. "We should be able to do what we want with our own land. And what we want is to allow drilling. Oil is the best thing that ever happened to us."
Despite such statements, the Eskimos take a somewhat contradictory approach to oil drilling in the far north. While they advocate opening the refuge, which would benefit them economically, they are among the strongest opponents of an Interior Department plan to allow offshore drilling in the Arctic Ocean, which poses a potential threat to their whale hunting.
For most Americans, it would be easier if all the remaining oil fields were in West Texas or Oklahoma. But the search for petroleum has now gone to the far edges, near pleasure beaches in Florida and California, off the wilderness coast of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State and inside an Arctic preserve that was supposed to belong to wild animals. These potential drill sites, on or near national treasures, force the question of just how far the nation will go to satisfy its oil habit.
Those who want to open the Arctic to development see a peculiar form of American naivete in the arguments for preservation. The idea of all that oil just sitting there, untapped, while the United States ups its trade imbalance with Middle Eastern countries is ludicrous, they say. But by keeping the refuge inviolate, the counter argument goes, Americans can take the first steps toward independence from a substance that, once pulled from the ground, inevitably spawns trouble -- wars, foul air and dirty water. The debate, in itself, is familiar. What has changed is that we are running out of places over which to have the argument.

HEADLINE: Spending Your Dollars in Europe: Greece;
In Europe's Best Bargain, the Prices Are Still Antique

BYLINE: By TULA BOGDANOS

 BODY:
Greek tour operators may be shaking their heads and muttering "terrible," but the tourism slump after the Persian Gulf war and the dollar's recent rise against the drachma means 1991 is a very good time to visit one of Western Europe's most inexpensive countries. Hotel and agency owners never quite recovered from the beating they took late last winter when scores of summer clients canceled, and some are offering discounts of up to 50 percent; especially outside of Athens, travelers can often negotiate room prices.
Travel costs have increased 10 to 15 percent because of Greece's rampant inflation. Museum fees, however, doubled: entrance to the Acropolis jumped from 800 to 1,500 drachmas (about $7.50). But because the dollar now equals 190 drachmas rather than the 150 it did in 1990, American travelers may find themselves paying much the same, if not less than last year. Some examples of average prices: package of four day-trips (Athens, Sounion, Delphi, island cruise), $107 ($109 in 1990); taverna meal, $8.90 ($8); Athens Festival ticket, $5.10 to $87.10 ($3.30 to $66.65); tourist-class ferry, Athens to Mykonos, $11 ($10.30); taxi from the center to most hotels mentioned here, $1.55 ($1.45). 
 Even in Athens, summer specials abound. For example, the deluxe Athenaeum Inter-Continental at 89-93 Syngrou offers a $135 rate until Sept. 1 for doubles with breakfast that usually cost $235 to $285; reservations must be made outside Greece. In the United States phone (800) 327-0200. The lovely Hotel Divani Palace Acropolis at 19-25 Parthenonons, below the Odeon Herod Atticus, may post an official $171 rate, but doubles with American breakfast this summer go for $94.80. Telephone 922-2945.
The Hilton is an oasis in hectic Athens with its Olympic-size pool, excellent staff and most sights a five-minute cab ride away. Standard rates for a double are $205 to $230 but, depending on the number of rooms available, can drop to $143; packages with doubles as low as $60 have been offered. The Athens Hilton is at 46 Vassilias Sofias; telephone 722-0201. In the United States, phone Hilton International, (800) 445-8667, for specials.
Tucked away in the Plaka district, Electra Palace Hotel (18 Nikodemou; 324-4201, $83 for double with buffet breakfast) has a roof garden, pool and comfortable rooms. Best of all, Plaka's winding streets and cafes, the Cine Paris outdoor cinema and a major Athens Festival site are all nearby. The city now has so many summer festivals with performers from Iggy Pop to Pavarotti that Greeks have coined the verb "to festivalize."
Travelers who want to avoid the touristy bluster of restaurants in Plaka's main square should dine at Platonos (4 Diogenous; 322-0666), a few streets over from Electra Palace. Run by the Karianos family since 1932, the taverna serves impeccable Greek food at Greek prices -- about $7.60 a person with wine: garlic-yogurt dip, octopus, juicy potatoes from the oven and grilled meats.
Even the least intrepid traveler will find reasonably priced vacation spots throughout Greece, such as uncrowded islands like Chiros, Antiparos and Anafi. A less explored region northwest of Athens, Epirus, offers majestic scenery, friendly people and a strong regional identity.
At Ioannina, the capital of Epirus, sites include the town's citadel with crumbling mosques and minarets; nearby Perama, with Greece's largest caves, and Dodoni's elegant ancient theater and the ruins of the Oracle of Zeus, important long before Delphi.
From Ioannina, visitors usually head to Zagoria -- wild mountains, rushing streams, 46 villages of stone mansions and cobbled streets -- and eventually the Vikos gorge, the mainland's rival to Samaria Gorge in Crete. Accommodations in Epirus range from $15.80 to $71.70; call the Athens tourist office at 325-2267 or, in Epirus, the Ioannina travel police at 25763.

HEADLINE: Spending Your Dollars in Europe: Germany;
East and West Are Often Equal in Prices, but Not in Amenities

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

 BODY:
For travelers, Germany has been expensive for decades, but since unification it has become even more so. Still, cities like Berlin remain less costly than London or Paris. To be sure, inflation in June, while still a respectable 4 percent, was running higher than in France for the first time since 1973, largely because of recently raised taxes on everything from clothes to gasoline to pay for the rebuilding of eastern Germany. Nevertheless, the strength of the American dollar actually makes things a bit cheaper, in dollar terms, than last year.
Take hotels. A comfortable double room at the Savoy, one of the better hotels in Berlin, costs 410 marks this season, compared with 360 last year and only 260 five years ago. But with the dollar worth 1.8 marks, compared with 1.5 last summer, the price for Americans has actually dropped, to $228 from $240. The increase in the price in marks, hoteliers say, is purely a result of demand. Moreover, the summer discounts offered this year are less of a bargain. Last year a double room that normally costs $250 was discounted to about $130, but this year the $250 room drops only to about $210. Even so, it's worth asking if summer discounts are available. 
 A nice spot when visiting Berlin is just off the Kurfurstendamm, where the city's showiest boulevard spills out of the downtown at the Hotel Kronprinz (1 Kronprinzendamm; telephone 896030). Occupying a lovely beaux-arts townhouse, the Kronprinz has 53 rooms, and a double with bath and shower costs $125, up slightly from $120 last year. That includes a hearty German breakfast of coffee or tea, rolls and rich breads and an assortment of cheese and cold meats, jams and jellies. For lunch or a light supper, loll at the open-air cafe under the spreading chestnut trees in front, where you can enjoy a simple soup or platter of open sandwiches with cheese or cold lunch meats. A beer and sandwiches cost about $6.
Out of Berlin, note that tourist services in eastern Germany are still pretty abysmal. Hotels and restaurants are in short supply, so it's a seller's market with no one caring much to assure that customers come back again. Moreover, since last July's currency union, prices have shot up to western levels without standards of comfort following suit. East Germany used to be cheap; now it's just poor value. The best bet is often to stay with a family in rooms that are usually clean, if simple, and can cost as litle as $14 a night. Most hotels will supply the phone number or address of a local bed-and-breakfast exchange.
If you're leaving Berlin for a day or two, head for the Spreewald, an hour's drive southeast of the city. Its haunted marsh landscape has been inhabited for centuries by Slavic peasants -- the Sorbs -- who constructed their homes and tended garden patches among endless canals and waterways that crisscross the region. Like most eastern German sites that western Germans are rediscovering, the Spreewald becomes bedlam on summer weekends. So pick a weekday and, if you drive, take the Dresden autobahn for Lubbenau. Or take one of the buses that leave Berlin Fridays and Sundays from May to September at 8:30 A.M. from a site along the Kurfurstendamm near Fasanenstrasse. A day trip that includes a gentle round in a typical Sorb punt costs $27; reserve a place by phoning 8831015. From Lubbenau, take the footpath to Lehde, a quaint Sorb village with an outdoor museum that has assembled a wondrous collection of simple thatched Sorb peasant dwellings.
At prices such as these, and using the bargains available in Berlin, travelers to Germany not intending to splurge should budget about $1,220 to $1,390 a week for two persons.

HEADLINE: Spending Your Dollars in Europe: Austria;
Vienna is Losing Its High-Priced Name, but Not Its Luster

BYLINE: By BRENDA FOWLER

 BODY:
Vienna's reputation as one of Europe's most expensive cities is slowly fading. Granted, a good dinner can rarely be found for less than $15 and double rooms in the center for less than $100 are only slightly more available. But compared with cities in Italy and Germany, Vienna -- and Austria in general -- is a reasonably priced vacation spot.
One reason Austria appears affordable is that its inflation is so low -- only about 3.5 percent last year. Whereas in such Italian cities as Venice the price of a simple tomato and cheese pizza has more than doubled, and in some areas tripled, in the last six years, the price of a Viennese melange (coffee with milk) in Vienna has stuck at just about $2, and you can buy one coffee and sit until closing time. A glass of draft beer at a sidewalk cafe is about $1.90. For Americans, the low inflation in Austria helps make up a little bit for the steep fall in the dollar in the last six years. In 1985 the dollar stood at 21 schillings while it now stands at about 12 schillings, a slight improvement over the rate at the same time last year, when it was down to nearly 10 schillings. Egon Smeral, an economist at Vienna's Institute for Comparative Economic Studies, says that German unification has slightly lowered prices in Austria because of more competition, and Austrians are hoping that their entry into the European Community, which is not expected before 1993, will guarantee stable prices in the future. 
 A tourist on a week's visit to Austria who pays for half the cost of a double room with shower and breakfast and eats in restaurants for lunch and dinner should expect to pay about $504.
In Vienna, a restaurant with good value is Restaurant Beograd (7 Schikanedergasse; telephone 587-7444), just outside the Ringstrasse in Vienna's fourth district, which has customers ranging from gypsy wedding parties to local artists and an occasional off-the-beaten-path tourist. The walls of this comfortable restaurant are crammed with old photographs and paintings, many from the Balkans, whose cuisine is featured. Meat grilled over a wood fire is one of the specialties here. Cevapcici with onions, a spicy Yugoslav meat patty, costs $4.50. A shish kebab with three types of meat costs $7.50 and a large cucumber and tomato salad topped with grated goat cheese (sopska salat) costs $2. A hotel offering good value is Hotel Graf Stadion (5 Buchfeldgasse; 425284, doubles with shower and breakfast $79 to $86), old-fashioned, on a quiet street in Vienna's Josefstadt, an artists' district with many good restaurants and theaters nearby. The spotless rooms are renovated and have some old furniture and new carpet.
Most American travelers to Austria usually stick to Vienna and Salzburg, a popular axis that is slightly more expensive than the rest of the country. One undeservedly neglected area -- and compared with Vienna and Salzburg less expensive -- is Styria, a largely rural and mountainous province south of Vienna that stretches to the Yugoslav border. Graz, its capital, is a well-kept river city whose narrow streets are filled with Renaissance and Baroque houses that are as picturesque as any in Salzburg. South of Graz the landscape settles into rolling hills that are lush in the summer and perfect for campers. Styria, called Steiermark in German, is well-known for its wines and pumpkin seed oil, which the Styrians use in potato, bean and leafy salads.

HEADLINE: Spending Your Dollars in Europe: Italy;
Make a Wish, and Try 5 or 10 Coins in the Fountain

BYLINE: By MAUREEN B. FANT

 BODY:
With the unveiling of the restored Trevi fountain, Rome this month is recalling la dolce vita, the postwar era of pleasure and prosperity and, for Americans, a muscular dollar. The not-so-sweet reality today is that Americans and Italians alike consider Italy one of the most expensive countries in Europe.
But with an exchange rate of about 1,350 lire to the dollar, against 1,200 in 1990, the dollar has risen faster than inflation (6.5 percent in June 1991). Prices in dollars are more than double 1985 levels, when the dollar broke 2,000, but are slightly better than last year. In 1985 a double room at a top hotel in Rome cost less than $200. In 1990 that room cost $466, today $414. A typical double in a small hotel in Rome cost $39 in 1985, $90 last year and $85 today. 
 Americans should budget about $1,200 for a weeklong stay, at a three-star (out of a possible five in the government rating system) hotel with meals in trattorias, for two people traveling together.
Though prices are high across the board, northern cities cost more than southern; the seaside more than the mountains; the Tyrrhenian (western) coast more than the Adriatic, and any place is cheaper out of the high season, July and August.
All of northern Europe knows about the Rimini area for bargain beach holidays. The Dolomite mountains offer fresh air and spectacular scenery for very reasonable prices. Venice is notoriously expensive, and Milan and Florence are too, but you can save by staying in a smaller city outside the metropolis (such as Padua or Jesolo for Venice; Pistoia for Florence) and commuting by train.
For logistical reasons, this option is less effective for Rome, but does work in Naples.
For normal tourist needs, a three-star hotel is sufficiently luxurious and a two-star just fine. In Rome, for a double with bath, the centrally situated three-star Hotel Portoghesi (1 Via dei Portoghesi; telephone 6864231) charges $88, including breakfast; the two-star Kolbe, across from the Forum and Palatine (44 Via St. Teodoro; 632955), charges $51, without breakfast.
Many hotels and restaurants are currently upgrading facilities and prices; be sure you have recent prices and ratings.
It's not hard to spend $75 to $100 or more for dinner for two. But you can eat well for less. At Il Dito e la Luna (51 Via dei Sabelli; 4940726) you can try traditional and "creative" dishes for around $30 a person, and that's as high as you need go. Lots of small trattorias will give you a simple meal for under $22 a person. The cheapest evening meal is pizza, not more than $11 for a pizzeria supper with beer or wine.
Inflation has not touched at least one major attraction -- a single coin in the Trevi fountain will still guarantee a return visit.

HEADLINE: Postings: Restoring Astor Row;
A Bucolic Harlem Haven

 BODY:
In the 1880's, William Astor owned much of the land between Fifth Avenue and Lenox Avenue in Harlem, and when 28 brick rowhouses with wooden porches and small front yards was built along the south side 130th Street, the street became known as Astor Row.
The houses were designated landmarks in 1981, and now an ambitious program of loans and grants, including a grant of half a million dollars from the Vincent Astor Foundation, has been created to help restore those brick facades and bucolic porches. 
 The project is being managed by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and the New York Landmarks Conservancy, a private group, along with Astor Row homeowners who belong to the West 130th Street Block Association.
The ornately spindled and bracketed wooden porches, "together with the houses' front yards, provide a rural feeling unusual in New York City," said the Landmarks Conservancy in a statement.
Besides the Vincent Astor money, grants of up to $15,000 a house will be made available for facade work under the Facade Improvement Program of the Preservation Commission, and subsidized interior improvement loans at a 3 percent rate of interest will come from the New York City Historic Properties Fund.
Work on the street-long restoration is expected to begin in the fall.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in: Hamden

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
HAMDEN is affectionately called the Land of the Sleeping Giant because of the huge reclining figure formed by a mountain in Sleeping Giant State Park, visible from most parts of town. Until recently the term seemed appropriate to the quiet, contented community.
But in the last five years its population has been shifting from third- and fourth-generation working people to a suburban mix that includes more transients. 
 "We get 30 to 40 percent relocated professionals," said Florence Michaud of the local Beazley Realty office. And now development is taking place in the once unspoiled western and northern hills.
Situated midway between Greenwich and Hartford and seven miles north of New Haven, Hamden is frequently the choice of two-income families when husbands and wives travel to work in opposite directions.
Typical buyers are Daniel Stanick, a sales representative for a heating and air-conditioning firm in Milford, and his fiancee, Deanne Dietrich, a legal secretary for a Hartford firm.
"We were looking for new construction," said Mr. Stanick, "so that limited our choice."
After looking at seven homes in Wallingford, North Haven and Hamden, they bought a 2,300-square-foot, 3-bedroom colonial on a half-acre on Kirk Road for $190,000.
"With current prices depressed by more than 20 percent, there are excellent opportunities between $175,000 and $225,000," said John Cuozzo, owner of a local realty firm. "Building lots are $65,000 to $200,000. Condominiums have dropped 25 percent."
Homes of 3,000 to 7,000 square feet on one to five acres are available in town from $400,000 to $900,000. On Birch Wood Drive, a handsome 3,500-square-foot house on one acre costs $250,000.
"Dozens of big houses were built three and four years ago, when land was expensive and the economy was strong," said Richard de Podesta of De Podesta Real Estate Company. "Since then, many have gone into foreclosure and are being sold at a loss."
Possibly the largest residential project in the state, the $150 million Hamden Hills, broke ground last month as a joint venture of Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Connecticut and Trammell Crow Company of Dallas. In the next six years, more than 1,400 units will be built on 136 acres off Evergreen and Dixwell Avenues.
The first 430 apartments are scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. The 650- to 1,300-square-foot units will rent for $700 to $1,000 a month. Yet to be built are 1,500- to 2,400-square-foot single-family homes, 900- to 1,400-square-foot condominiums and 800- to 1,600-square-foot condominium units for the elderly. Homes will sell for $80,000 to $265,000. Common amenities include pools, tennis courts, fitness centers, clubhouses, jogging trails, children's centers and a health-care facility.
"It should bring in more than $2 million in taxes," said Mayor John Carusone, "and since we have recently enlarged the capacity of our schools and our fire and police departments, it should have no appreciable effect on town services."
Hamden operates eight lighted tennis courts, where fees are $2 an hour, a free swimming pool at the high school, 25 ball fields, 7 miles of walking trails, cross-country skiing and a petting zoo at the 195-acre Brooksvale Park, and an 18-hole golf course called Laurel View Country Club, where a season pass costs $350.
THE Miller Library complex is the cultural center of the community. Concerts, lectures, arts festivals and children's programs are offered year round in its Thornton Wilder Hall, named for the playwright, who lived in Hamden until his death in 1975.
Near the New Haven border, at Whitney Avenue and Armory Street, is the Eli Whitney arms factory, established in 1798, where Whitney originated weaponry with interchangeable parts. It was restored in the 1970's as a museum, technical school and performing arts center.
Hamden was a northern enclave of the New Haven Colony in 1638. Named for an English statesman, John Hampden, it was incorporated in 1786, and in the 18th and 19th centuries it was a mecca for Italian, Irish and German immigrants seeking jobs in its sawmills and stone quarries.
In the 20th century, prospering immigrants' descendants, bankers, businessmen, lawyers, engineers and Yale faculty members built large Tudor, Victorian and colonial homes on tree-shaded streets off Whitney Avenue. Some are still occasionally available at $450,000 and up.
The diversity of Hamden's inhabitants is reflected in its restaurants, which are informal and multi-ethnic. At one of the most popular, Friends & Co. at 4137 Whitney Avenue, international dishes are translated into an eclectic American cuisine and dinner for two is about $40.
At Hamden High School a Human Relations Club was formed to promote better understanding of the newest residents, among them Asians, Hispanics and blacks, and classes in English for foreign students are available at all levels. Out of a total enrollment of 5,379, 20 percent are from minority backgrounds.
OUTMODED school plants are being upgraded or replaced in preparation for a projected pupil increase of 10 percent in the 90's. Church Street Elementary School was replaced by a new building last year, Helen Elementary's new building is to open this fall and Alice Peck, the town's ninth elementary school, will reopen in September. A middle school for grades seven and eight remains untouched.
Hamden High, built in 1935, is one of five Connecticut high schools to participate in the International Baccalaureate Program administered in Geneva and New York City. Around 50 students a year take special classes and examinations in English, a foreign language, science, math, social science and an elective, resulting in advanced college placement.
The drama department won 12 out of the past 15 Connecticut High School Drama Festivals, but Scholastic Aptitude Test scores in math remain below state levels. They have improved, but an intensified math program in the elementary grades begins next year.
Hamden Hall Country Day School, a private, 80-year-old college preparatory institution, places 15 foreign students a year in area homes. The remaining 535 pupils come from 25 towns and 30 ethnic backgrounds. Annual tuition ranges from $8,300 to $9,650.
If a State Supreme Court decision expected this fall favors the planning and zoning commission over protesting neighborhood groups, Hamden could acquire its first mall. Upscale shoppers currently drive to the Danbury Mall, the Meriden Mall and even the Waterford Mall, 50 miles away.
A 600,000-square-foot enclosed mall has been proposed by Homart of Chicago and the Fusco Corporation of New Haven, to be built on 36 acres along Dixwell Avenue. Sears, which owns the land and has a store on the site, and G. Fox, a Hartford-based department store, would be the anchors for 100 shops and a food court.

"We chose 'golden bells' for a name," said Chris Rendeiro, chairman of the event since its inception, "because the children couldn't pronounce forsythia."

HEADLINE: Opinion Split On Proposals For Chemical Cleanups

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
WHEN the State Department of Environmental Protection recently proposed regulations that would make the state the first in the nation to establish comprehensive standards for cleaning up chemically contaminated sites, the department asked for reactions from people and businesses concerned with environmental law.
The department sent out 900 queries and received 105 replies, many of them praising the request for their opinions, but some criticizing the proposal. 
 Some environmentalists surveyed said that while the regulations might protect people from being exposed to hazardous chemicals, they would not go far enough in protecting the environment from man-made pollution.
Some specialists in hazardous-waste removal said the draft regulations perpetuated the practice of establishing cleanup standards that were unnecessarily strict and enormously costly to comply with. And some business executives and lawyers said the regulations would encourage industry to shun the state's larger cities and relocate, taking industry to otherwise pristine lands.
The draft proposal establishes numerical standards for the cleanup of contaminated areas. Most states, including New Jersey, either address cleanup case by case or handle it under legislation on specific environmental threats, like underground storage tanks or ground-water pollution.
The draft is expected to be revised and published as an official regulatory proposal later this year. The regulation is then subject to the final approval of the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, Scott A. Weiner.
"What the department is trying to do here is answer the long-debated question, how clean is clean?" said Lance R. Miller, an assistant commissioner of the department. "And that is a very difficult question to answer."
 
'Pressure' for Unified Standards
 Dr. Richard Greenberg, president of Environmental Waste Management Associates, an environmental cleanup concern based in Wayne, and one of the experts the department asked for comment, said, "The department has been under pressure for a while to come up with unified cleanup standards."
Under current law, he said, property owners sometimes face vague or even conflicting rules on removing chemical contamination. For example, he said, a property owner might remove an underground tank under one set of regulations, then a year later, in trying to sell his land, find himself subject to another set. "So you were subject to a double jeopardy," Dr. Greenberg said.
The proposal, he said, would establish acceptable levels for chemical contaminants in soil, ground water and building interiors. In addition, Dr. Greenberg said, the proposal treats contamination in certain areas differently from contamination in other areas. For example, he said, industrial areas might not have to be as clean as areas that might be used for housing.
And different standards would apply to contaminated soil that is within two feet of the surface. That soil is presumed to be exposed to people and would be held to a stricter standard than soil farther below the ground. Stricter standards would also apply to soil over potable aquifers.
"If human contact and human drinking uses are a concern, they use a more stringent standard," Dr. Greenberg said.
In general, he said, the proposed standards are not as stringent as some current state standards. If a property owner could prove that contamination was not likely to migrate into ground water or come in contact with people, it might be allowed to remain at higher levels.
But that concession does not come without a price, Dr. Greenberg said.
"They've made accommodations, but then they take all those accommodations right back with one little item that they threw in," he said. "Essentially, they came forward with their draft regulations and said: 'We're going to allow you to keep this contamination in place, but we want one little thing in return. We want you to put a notice on your deed saying that this property contains hazardous waste.' "
The notice, called a deed restriction, would alert potential buyers to the contamination and could restrict future uses of the property. The proposed regulations would also require property owners to give the department a perpetual easement to enter the property for cleanup or testing.
 
'No One Will Buy It'
 Dr. Greenberg said he opposed those two rules. "The deed restriction and the perpetual easement are absurd," he said. "You can't get financing on such a property, and you can't sell it because no one will buy it."
Because most contaminated sites are in older, urban industrialized areas, he said, the proposal would create an environmental and economical paradox.
"They will restrict development of the urban properties and encourage industry to move out into the country and develop pristine properties, while letting the center of our cities continue to rot," he said.
Among the experts who said that the standards were too stringent was William D'Angelo, president of Kaselaan and D'Angelo Associates, an environmental engineering company in Haddon Heights.
"There's been a great deal of concern that we're spending a lot of time and money getting down to numbers that really don't give us more risk reduction," he said. While removing 95 percent of the contamination might eliminate 95 percent of the risk, he said, removing the last 5 percent might cost more in time and money than the small reduction would warrant.
"Some cleanup projects will just never meet some of the standards they've set," Mr. D'Angelo said.
 
'Some Significant Concerns'
 But environmentalists said the standards were not strict enough.
"We have some significant concerns," said Edward Lloyd, general counsel for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, a public advocacy organization, and director of the Environmental Law Clinic at the Rutgers University Law School in Newark.
Mr. Lloyd said the environment was threatened by smaller levels of contamination than threatened people. "It's the D.E.P.'s duty to protect both the environment and human health," he said, "and we think this proposal totally fails to protect the environment."
Mr. Lloyd said his organization compared the proposed standards with Federal Environmental Protection Agency regulations governing land disposal of hazardous waste and "found that the E.P.A. standards were tens to hundreds to thousand of times more stringent than the D.E.P. standards."
"Toxins in the ecosystem can be far more toxic to fish or plants than to humans," he said. "We have to protect those ecosystems as well as protecting human health. And these standards fail to do that."
 
Suggestion Called Absurd
 On the deed restriction, he said: "I don't think deed restrictions protect either public health or the environment. We recommend that if you're going to put a deed restriction in, you should have the property fenced off and put up huge signs that say this site does not meet minimum cleanup standards."
But business people who sell industrial property call such a suggestion absurd.
"You do that and you destroy the tax base of every urban center in this state," said David T. Houston Jr., the president of a real-estate brokerage in Bloomfield that bears his name. He said the Department of Environmental Protection was already too intrusive in regulating industry.
"Some of the standards we've got are far too strict anyhow," he said. "Some of them aren't even achievable."
 
Worried About Legal Aspects
 David B. Farer, an environmental lawyer from Westfield, said he was worried about the legal aspects of the proposed regulations. He said he was particularly concerned about a provision that would allow "any citizen of the State of New Jersey" to sue a landowner whose property was subject to a deed restriction if the citizen believed that the landowner was violating the restriction.
"This substantially expands the rights of nonparties to sue individuals who enter these agreements," he said. Only people who are likely to suffer damage or the department should be allowed to sue, he said.
Despite his reservations, however, Mr. Farer, like most experts who have commented on the proposal, said the department should be commended for its efforts to solicit early recommendations.
"The D.E.P. is in a very difficult position here," Mr. Farer said. "On the one hand, they've got the environmental lobby watching every move they make, and on the other hand they have a very well-organized and intense business lobby telling them at every turn that they're pushing business out of New Jersey."
Mr. Miller, the department's assistant commissioner, said the agency had anticipated the debate that the proposal has generated.
"It is resulting in a lot of rethinking on our part," he said. "We didn't think we had all the answers when we put out this draft, and the comments we've received have affirmed that."

HEADLINE: County Considers Opening An Off-Track Betting Theater

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

 BODY:
"COME on, baby! You're all alone!" a gleeful supporter yelled at Mary in theMorning, a 3-year-old filly who had pulled out of the pack and was roaring down the backstretch on her way to winning the second race at Saratoga last week.
No matter that the man was a few hundred miles away in Connecticut, shouting at a giant video screen. In his air-conditioned grandstand seat at the Teletrack in New Haven, he was part of it all. The three-story-high screen simulcasts the latest odds and the race, while betting windows, snack bars and cocktail lounges are just a few steps away. 
 That scene may soon be repeated in Westchester, where county officials are negotiating a contract with the New York Racing Association to build a $10 million teletheater in the central part of the county, although no site has been picked.
The contract could be ready by the middle of September, Roger Biagi, the deputy county executive, said last week. But he added that the negotiations have been difficult and that the outcome is not assured.
If agreement is reached with the nonprofit racing organization and approved by the County Board of Legislators, Westchester's first venture into off-track betting could give the county an additional $6 million in yearly revenue, with another $1 million going to the municipality where the teletheater is situated.
 
A Rejection of OTB
 The latest of several proposals for an off-track betting system in Westchester came last year from County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke in his State of the County address.
After review by a special bipartisan legislative committee set up to consider revenue sources for the county and changes in state law governing off-track betting in Westchester, a decision was made to negotiate with the New York State Racing Association rather than to join the regional Offtrack Betting Corporation.
The teletheater would be the first off-track betting system in the state controlled by the association under contract with a county, and not by a group of cities and counties that have chosen to join one of the state's six regional OTB corporations.
The proposed single-site arrangement, advocates say, would give Westchester County more control over betting operations and a larger share of the profits. Up to this point the association has had no control over off-track betting profits, except those it generates from its track-to-track simulcasting system.
Under the OTB regional concept, participating local governments in a designated multi-county region share in a percentage of the profits under a formula based on each county's population and wagering totals. Because the OTB system allows the corporation to establish as many betting parlors as may be profitable and to override local zoning in determining their location, the concept has proved unpopular in Westchester.
Although the proposed teletheater would avoid these conflicts, it would compete with the Yonkers Raceway, the county's only professional sports arena and the only place to bet on horse racing, with live harness racing each night and simulcast thoroughbred racing every afternoon. Officials of the New York Racing Association insist that the Westchester betting market can accommodate both locations. But Yonkers political leaders and race track officials concede that they are worried about the future of one of the city's largest taxpayers and employers.
"I want to be fully versed on the potential impact before I sign off on it," said Katherine S. Carsky, a Republican legislator representing Yonkers. "If the raceway were to leave, it would not only leave a significant amount of space to be sold at a down time in the economy, but it would generate tax certioraris and threaten 1,200 jobs."
Mrs. Carsky is chairwoman of the Budget and Finance Committee, which would review a completed contract.
 
Fourth-Largest Taxpayer
 "Obviously, we are very concerned about the impact on the raceway and on the city," said Thomas J. McSpedon, Commissioner of Finance and Management Services for Yonkers. The raceway is the city's fourth-largest taxpayer.
"If the racetrack left, it would leave a $7 million hole in our budget, and I don't know where we would fill it," Mr. McSpedon said.
The raceway pays about $2 million in city taxes, but Yonkers receives an additional $4.2 million annual surcharge imposed on winning bets placed at state Offtrack Betting locations on races run at Yonkers.
The 92-year-old track has struggled to survive a series of misfortunes since the glory days of the 1960's. In those days, 30,000 to 40,000 fans crowded the grandstand every evening and helped make Yonkers the first harness track in history to handle $3 million in a single night.
 
Afternoon Simulcasting
 In the last 20 years, a series of setbacks, including competition from the Meadowlands, Atlantic City and the off-track betting market has contributed to an 88 percent decline in attendance, said Timothy J. Rooney, the raceway president. Last year, just when the situation seemed hopeless, simulcasting gave bettors a reason to come back to the track, or at least to the audio and visual coverage of other races that Yonkers Raceway now provides.
The introduction of afternoon simulcasting at the raceway, under a contract with the New York Racing Association, has kept the track alive, offering track-to-track telecasts of thoroughbred racing at Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga and providing a daily average handle of $330,000.
A competing teletheater, although operated by the same association, would provide the same coverage and have "an adverse affect" on raceway operations, Mr. Rooney said, referring to county and raceway studies that predict a 10 percent loss in the handle at the track.
A decline in revenue would also affect state and city shares of the fees and taxes paid by the Yonkers track, which are $7 million to the city and $8 million to the state.
"We have weathered lots of storms, but we have been doing it from much higher heights," Mr. Rooney said, adding that although he is worried, he would wait to see what the future brings.
"For years, we have known we could develop the property and make more money," but his sports-minded family, he said, "likes doing what we are doing."
The five brothers in the Rooney family also own the Pittsburgh Steelers football team, an organization founded by their father, Arthur J. Rooney, as well as dog tracks in Vermont and Florida.
 
Local Zoning an Issue
 Race track owners have realized that the dramatic switch from betting at a track to off-track betting, which they once vigorously opposed, must be accommodated, Mr. Rooney said, and they can do so profitably. "OTB brought us to the 20th century," he said. "Now closed-circuit TV will take us into the 21st."
Although the potential profits of off-track betting have tempted many Westchester political leaders, county legislators have refused to endorse an OTB system that would supersede local zoning. Neighboring Putnam County has been in turmoil over the issue since legislators there approved the measure last year.
In April, the State Supreme Court in White Plains threw out a challenge by Putnam County political leaders opposed to OTB. Current efforts by the Catskill Region OTB to place a betting parlor in Carmel have met stiff local opposition, and the town board has been flooded with petitions from angry citizens in the neighborhood.
 
Breaking a Monopoly
 Although New York was the first state to permit off-track betting, it did so over the objections of track owners, and it is now the only state in which the off-track betting system is not supervised by the race track owners.
If Westchester reaches an agreement with the New York Racing Association, it would break the monopoly that municipalities have held over off-track receipts, said John M. Dailey, director of racing and OTB for the New York State Racing and Wagering Board.
"The tracks will muscle in and take over," he said. "They want to market their own product."

HEADLINE: PROFILE;
Switch-Hitter Of Academe

BYLINE: By Roberto Suro

 BODY:
WHEN Barry Munitz was appointed Chancellor of the California State University, the nation's largest four-year university system, both supporters and detractors fixated on the uncanny ease with which he moves between the worlds of public service and private interests.
In the last 25 years, Mr. Munitz has switched from college teaching to foundation work to major posts at the Universities of Illinois and Houston to his most recent post as vice chairman of Maxxam Inc., a Houston-based holding company involved in several controversial corporate takeovers and in the failure of a large savings and loan association. 
 His most recent career change began on Thursday, when Mr. Munitz took office at Cal State, returning to the kind of job he once described as "caught between rising expectations of accountability and declining flexibility of action."
 
 
'That Fuzzy Ambiguity'
 The dilemma, he says, is now more acute than ever at Cal State, which has some 370,000 students on 20 campuses and is battling to defend its $2 billion budget from proposed cuts in the 5 to 10 percent range.
"Compared to the private sector," Mr. Munitz said, "where decisions can be made quickly and implemented relatively cleanly, I'm going back to that fuzzy ambiguity of faculty senates, deans and campus presidents, where you have to be extraordinarily cautious to be sure that every base is touched and every potential decision is adequately reviewed." To prepare for the switch, he said, "I have been adding several gates between my brain and my mouth."
At a news conference after his selection by the Cal State trustees was announced April 4, Mr. Munitz was asked why he took the job. He joked, "It's not for the salary," and indeed his pay of $175,000 a year as chancellor is less than half what he was making at Maxxam.
In a recent interview, he elaborated: "At a certain time I came to believe that to be truly useful in the broadest sense you had to understand both worlds, public and private. One of the reasons I'm going back is that there is a limit to what a corporation can or should do on public-policy issues."
There is no such limit to what the head of such a vast university system can do regarding national debates on educational policy, and Mr. Munitz is already sketching out a strategy for some fundamental issues.
He believes, for example, that a large public system like Cal State should make itself a bigger part of the educational process that begins in prekindergarten; that definitions of prestige should be revised to give undergraduate teaching greater recognition, and that the state should encourage the university to seek extra compensation for this mission from the private sector.
Mr. Munitz, who is 50 years old, approaches these tasks with a deep appreciation of the university's role in society. His own undergraduate experience was at Brooklyn College, which was then free of charge. "Like many Cal State students," he said, "I came from an immigrant background, and Brooklyn College was the only place I could go for an education. It was my only prayer for socioeconomic mobility."
Mr. Munitz's extended family came from Eastern Europe to the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, where he and his sister were born and raised. Only their father, Raymond, an accountant, had attended college. Raymond's talent for chess led him to the Marshall Chess Club in Manhattan, often accompanied by his son. Mr. Munitz said his father taught him to play chess before he learned to read.
His parents were divorced when he was 8; Mr. Munitz lived with his mother. During college, he held full-time night jobs to help support his family.
Typically, the career path that leads to top university posts is paved with faculty positions and jobs like provost or school dean, and Mr. Munitz began conventionally enough -- as a junior professor of comparative literature at the University of California at Berkeley. "I studied literature because I thought there was no better life style than to get paid to read and then have a bunch of people listen to you talk about what you've read," said Mr. Munitz, who earned his doctorate at Princeton.
He is still a voracious reader and jokes with friends that he maintains two lists on his refrigerator door: one of people who have died while reading, which so far has only one entry, Pope John Paul I, and another of the many people who have died while exercising.
After less than three years on the Berkeley faculty, where he went upon receiving his Ph.D., Mr. Munitz gave up teaching full time. He had caught the eye of Clark Kerr, then president of the University of Californa, and the first of Mr. Munitz's well-positioned mentors. When Mr. Kerr became chairman of the Carnegie Foundation Commission on Higher Education in 1968, he recruited Mr. Munitz as a staff associate.
Two years later Mr. Munitz moved to the University of Illinois, and was promoted to academic vice president of the Illinois system in 1972. At 35, he was appointed chancellor of the University of Houston-Central Campus in 1977.
By then Mr. Munitz was a professional university administrator. "Barry is a well-recognized student of the process of academic governance," said Harold Enarson, president of Ohio State from 1972 to 1981 and now a consultant to various universities, who has known Mr. Munitz since his Houston days.
In 1982, Mr. Munitz was a candidate for chancellor of Cal State when a friend and tennis partner, Charles Hurwitz, persuaded him to choose the business executive's life.
Mr. Hurwitz played the hardball game of corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts during the 1980's. A worldly New Yorker, Mr. Munitz aidedhim in top management positions, but often specialized in tasks requiring diplomacy.
 
 
Large Rolodexes
 A man with large Rolodexes and many of them, Mr. Munitz even today is as likely to be found at a Hollywood party with his old friend, movie producer Sherry Lansing, as playing host at a fund-raiser for Senator Bill Bradley, whom he has known since Princeton.
"Someone on the ordinary academic career track could never have accumulated Barry's extraordinary network of individual and corporate contacts," said Alex Schilt, chancellor of the University of Houston system. "He will use those contacts to help his institution move forward in terms of fact as well as perceptions."
But Mr. Munitz may just as easily suffer from a corporate-life hangover. He has already had his first headache -- a meeting with faculty members at the Cal State Sacramento campus who were seeking his ouster even before he had assumed office. The professors, and some students, objected to Mr. Munitz's involvement with the Pacific Lumber Company, which increased the number of redwoods it chopped down after its hostile takeover by Maxxam. Greeted by protesters wearing six-foot cardboard cutouts of evergreens, Mr. Munitz tried to charm them by starting, "Good morning ladies, gentlemen, trees." The audience was amused but undeterred.
Initially, his major goals do not involve changing what Cal State does so much as how it is perceived. The prevailing definition of academic prestige is symbolized by the highly selective institutions that prize faculty research, Mr. Munitz says.
By contrast, the Cal State system is primarily designed to draw from a broad pool of high school students, including those of lesser economic means, and must accommodate nontraditional undergraduates, such as part-timers and commuters.
Given California's rapid demographic growth into a multi-ethnic society and its ever-increasing demands for a more skilled work force, Mr. Munitz says, institutions like Cal State can no longer be relegated to second-class status.
"Most of the recognition and the rewards have been going to people who discover knowledge through research rather than those who transmit knowledge through teaching," he said. "At Cal State we have a chance to be a national model in giving legitimate value to what happens in the classroom."
He finds ammunition for his case in the fact that the Cal State system produces 10 percent of all the elementary and high school teachers in the nation and 70 percent of those in California. Mr. Munitz said he wanted to broaden the university's links to the public school system through the creation of model schools on Cal State campuses and expanded consultation on issues like curriculum and teaching strategies.
And at a time of ever-tighter public spending, Mr. Munitz wants to turn to the private sector for money to improve the undergraduate education that for many students is still the key to socioeconomic mobility. He thinks the private sector may be delighted to oblige.
Business executives are unhappy having to train and retrain people at the entry level, he says. "So they are coming to institutions like ours across the country to see what support we can provide. We, in turn, will be asking them to think about endowing undergraduate faculty rather than, say, giving a grant to a research institute."
He speaks as something of an interpreter of academia's needs to the corporate world. Could he envision a return to that world? Said Mr. Munitz: "That yo-yo has snapped to the finger for the last time."

BYLINE: By Jed Stevenson

 BODY:
Dollar bills come and go so quickly that hardly anyone ever thinks of the strange design on the back: the great seal of the United States, with its bristling eagle, strange pyramid and hovering eye.
Who would take the time, buying a cup of coffee or an ice-cream cone, to consider the mystery of these symbols, which change hands countless times every day? 
 Over the years many attempts have been made to give a reason for the presence of the symbols on the seal and the bill. One explanation is that many leaders of the American Revolution were Freemasons, and that the group's symbols might therefore have found their way into symbols of the emerging nation.
That is by no means the accepted explanation. In "The Eagle and the Shield: a History of the Great Seal of the United States," a 1976 State Department publication, Richard S. Patterson and Richardson Dougall argue that, "It seems likely that the designers of the Great Seal and the Masons took their symbols from parallel sources, and unlikely that the seal designers consciously copied Masonic symbols."
But the argument that there are Masonic elements in the seal can be a discussion-stopper. Who wants to think that a national symbol is linked with a secret organization?
Those who support the case for Masonic symbolism recall that in England in the late 1600's, stonemasons found their numbers declining. To bolster their rolls they began accepting honorary members: men who couldn't lay a course of stone but were highly regarded by their neighbors and might have had a few quid for refreshments.
By 1717, a Grand Lodge was formed in London, and by 1738 the old order of stonemasons had evolved into the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, an order with few real masons but many "accepted," or honorary, members. The implements of masonry began to take on symbolic meanings, many of them religious.
American Masons first met in 1720 in Boston. Within half a century, Freemasons were meeting in the lodge rooms of Boston and at the Green Dragon Tavern there, plotting the overthrow of the British colonial authorities.
While many non-Masons were also involved, Masonic historians say that three of the best-known firebrands -- Peter Faneuil, Paul Revere and John Hancock -- were Masons.
With many of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence Freemasons, it is possible that when the great seal of the United States was to be designed, Masons were among those asked to help prepare it. While it is hard to know today what the designers were thinking, some modern Masons point out some interesting associations.
The eye, they say, is the eye of the all-seeing Grand Architect, a Masonic term for God. And to Masons the pyramid signifies the release of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, a theme the economically enslaved colonists may have embraced.
There are certainly many symbolic elements that have less to do with Freemasonry than with the Revolution. The pyramid has 13 courses of stone, one for each rebel colony, and the date across the bottom, shown in Roman numerals, is 1776.
The motto "Annuit Coeptis," Latin for "He has favored our undertaking," appears above the pyramid. "Novus Ordo Seclorum," meaning "A new order of the ages," appears underneath.
On the right side of the reverse of the dollar bill appears the face of the great seal, the coat of arms of the United States. Here it is more difficult to make a case that the symbols are specifically Masonic. But some Masons assert that the eagle represents the patron of Freemasonry, St. John the Evangelist.
It might take the most imaginative of symbolists to find a Masonic connection in the number of feathers the eagle displays. But some who are that imaginative note that one wing has 32 feathers and the other 33.
Perhaps it is just chance: who would require an artist to depict the same number (or any particular number) of feathers in each wing of an eagle? But it is at least a coincidence that 32 and 33 are the highest number of degrees conferred on a Mason as he passes through the Scottish rites, one of two series available to a Mason. The other, called the York, has only 9 ranks -- the number of feathers in the eagle's tail.
Whether these symbols are truly derived from Freemasonry or were just an amalgam of popular designs of the late 18th century, no one may ever know. But the odd design can certainly give pause.

Buffet Takes a Stake in American Express
Warren E. Buffett, one of the world's most successful investors, wanted more of the American Express Company than he actually bought last week. "But Jimmy didn't want to issue that many shares," he said referring to James D. Robinson 3d, chairman of American Express. So Mr. Buffett, who is chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., contented himself with a mere $300 million purchase of preferred shares, convertible into 12.2 million common shares at the discretion of American Express. The cash will help Mr. Robinson clean up his company's balance sheet. In return, Berkshire gets higher dividends than common shareholders (the ones that don't call Mr. Robinson "Jimmy"). Berkshire gets 8.6 percent, common shareholders are getting 3.6 percent. But share appreciation is limited. "This deal won't make us as rich as the last couple of deals," said Mr. Buffett. But then he is already a billionaire.
 
Dingell Takes On Citicorp
Representative John D. Dingell may be a powerhouse in Washington, but Citicorp thinks he's a pretty poor banking analyst. Last week, Mr. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and an outspoken foe of the Administration's proposal to give banks more powers, said Citicorp was "technically insolvent" and "struggling to survive." He also asserted that Citicorp was borrowing heavily from the Federal Reserve. Citicorp disagreed. So did L. William Seidman, the nation's top banking regulator, who added that he did not believe Citicorp was "insolvent under any standard." Citicorp issued a statement saying it had borrowed from the Fed just twice in the last 12 months and only for a day at a time. Not a bad record. The big bank's stock barely budged after Mr. Dingell's diatribe, closing the week at $14.25.
 
Stumbling Along at T.W.A.
 The best deal, they say, is the one that makes all parties equally unhappy. By that standard, Trans World Airlines's reorganization plan, still to be approved by Federal regulators, is a very good deal. Under it, T.W.A. would land in bankruptcy court sometime next year. Carl C. Icahn, who now owns 90 percent of the faltering airline, is to turn over most of his stock to T.W.A.'s creditors. He loses control. In return for stock, the creditors, who originally wanted cash, have agreed to wipe out about $1 billion of T.W.A.'s debt. But what about the airline? With the nation's oldest planes and a stripped-down route structure, it still needs money to survive. The deal may not give it enough.
 
B.C.C.I. - More Charges Fly
For nearly a month, tales of the misdeeds of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International have been circling the globe. The bank has been home to drug lords, terrorists, spies and money launderers, it is alleged. Last week, a grand jury in New York City handed up a 12-count indictment naming the bank and two of its officials: Aga Hassan Abedi, the Pakistani who founded B.C.C.I., and Swaleh Naqvi, its former chief operating officer. But also last week, William von Raab, the former Commissioner of Customs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the Bush Administration had been dragging its feet. B.C.C.I. should have been investigated years before. Now the case is before a New York bankruptcy judge.
 
Those Irksome Gas Contracts
Long-term thinking is supposed to pay off big, right? It didn't for Columbia Gas System Inc., one of the nation's largest natural gas companies. It filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 last week. The company said its long-term supply contracts were forcing it to pay up to five times the current market price for natural gas. But according to David N. Fleischer, who follows the company for Prudential Securities, the company's net worth is far greater than the $1 billion it said it would lose from the contracts. The company agrees. Mr. Fleischer says the bankruptcy filing may be a ploy to force a renegotiation of the company's long-term contracts.
 
Helmsley Still Headed for Jail
 New lawyer or not, Leona Helmsley is likely to spend time behind bars. She was sentenced in August 1989 to four years in prison and ordered to pay a total of $9 million for, among other things, evading taxes by billing luxury items (and some not-so-luxury items, like girdles) to her hotel business. But last week the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld the conviction. No new trial, the judges said. One concession: the sentence will be reassessed. The Supreme Court next?.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
A Favor for the U.S.S.R.
 The list of goods the Soviet Union has to trade reads like a description of a neighborhood lawn sale: lots of handicrafts, a few useful and not-so-useful scientific gadgets, but not much in the way of really tantalizing goods. So last week, when President Bush granted the Soviet Union most-favored-nation status, it was mostly symbolic. Yet, putting the Soviet Union on equal footing with America's other major trading partners makes it a full participant in the world economy. The change in status must be submitted to Congress.
 
Detroit Eats Japan's Dust, Again
In the technology department, Japan already seems to be positioning itself for the next oil shortage. The Honda Motor Company and Mitsubishi Motors last week revealed new fuel-efficient engines that will go on sale soon. These engines will improve mileage in cars by 10 to 25 percent -- much more economical than Detroit's offerings. "Ford and G.M. are working on the same technologies," said Richard Ko, an analyst in Tokyo. "But the speed with which Japan is bringing these to market will open the gap even further."
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
A Candle in the Gloom
 Some economists were beginning to fear the economy might lurch back into recession. Growth in the gross national product was as weak as a summer breeze. But last week even the gloomiest economists had at least some of their fears allayed. Personal income and consumer spending were both up by a surprisingly strong 0.5 percent for June, according to the Commerce Department. Since the consumer accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity, those numbers have real clout. "It's another piece of data that the third quarter is locked in as fairly solid," said Lawrence H. Meyer, an economist in St. Louis who heads his own forecasting firm.
 
The Economy's Slothful Growth
The Commerce Department's index of 11 leading economic indicators -- the Government's primary forecasting tool of economic growth -- grew by 0.5 percent in June. That's good news because the indicator usually gives a fairly accurate glimpse of economic activity six to nine months into the future. But a closer look at the components of the indicator reveals that all is still not well. Six of the 11 indicators shrunk back. "The increases are less than we've been accustomed to in a recovery," said Robert G. Dederick, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. That means growth, but just barely.
 
Behind the Good Numbers
Unemployment dropped in July to 6.8 percent, from 7 percent, the Labor Department said last week. A tiny shift, granted, but at least a move in the right direction. Still, economists felt little joy. The drop in unemployment was accompanied by a decline in the size of the nation's payroll. According to the Labor Department, 51,000 jobs were eliminated in July, on top of 20,000 the month before. "The major message is that the decrease in unemployment camouflages weakness underneath," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago.
 
The Big Board Backs Off
Futurists say the world is supposed to be moving toward global, 24-hour trading. If it is, last week that march encountered an obstacle. The Big Board said it would backtrack from a plan to open half an hour earlier and stay open later at night. The Big Board currently does business from 9:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. The exchange's West Coast members, who work from 6:30 A.M. to 1 P.M. Pacific Time, do not want to start at 6:00 A.M. But what about the 24-hour day? "It will take 5 to 10 years to evolve," said Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Securities Dealers Association, a rival to the Big Board that is also attempting to trade securities on a longer day. That still assumes Californians -- and everyone else -- will give up some sleep.
 
Nice Try, Bridgeport
When Mayor Mary C. Moran, said Bridgeport, Conn., would seek protection from its creditors under Chapter 9 of the Federal bankruptcy law, it was a stretch. Especially since the city had $25 million in the bank. Last week U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Alan H. W. Schiff, ruled against the city. Chapter 9, he said, is for chronic problems, not for balancing a budget that is temporarily out of whack.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Bank Rates, Low Now, Even Lower Later

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
There are people around -- this columnist among them -- who can remember a savings account paying 3 percent interest. But for many Americans, such low interest rates seem outrageous.
"Savers rolling over C.D.'s are beyond being surprised," says Chuck Clough, Merrill Lynch's chief strategist. "Now they're getting madder and madder." Rates are nearing 5 percent. 
 Those persistently lower rates may tell the most important investment story of 1991. They are cited by bulls as providing fuel for booming stock and bond markets, and by bears as a sign of the deflationary credit crunch that may bring back recession.
The bullish case is more enjoyable to contemplate and has the virtue of having a lot of history on its side. In the past, low short-term rates have generally helped to spark rallies in stocks and bonds.
Investors who want yield must take some risk, and inevitably some of the money that had been in bank accounts will flow into other assets. Bulls talk of a return to the good old days of the 1960's, when stocks formed a much larger percentage of the average family's financial assets than they now do. Last week the Dow Jones industrial average fell just short of setting a new record, rising 33.76 points, to 3,006.26.
But before rushing to buy, at a time when low dividend yields on stocks already reflect a lot of optimism about the economy, it may be worth asking just why short-term interest rates are so low.
One answer is that banks don't want the money. They have been burned by bad loans, and new capital rules provide an incentive for banks to shrink assets. So the banks are, as Mr. Clough puts it, "bidding down" for deposits. Holders of maturing C.D.'s at Citibank are even being called these days by the bank and urged to consider other investments, including bonds.
During the real estate boom, many commercial mortgages were written to require balloon payments in a few years. The assumption was that they would be refinanced then. Now the question is who will step up to renew the loans. John Garamendi, the California insurance commissioner, says the banks are trying to get out, while insurers don't want to write new mortgages.
"In the past," says James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and a bear on stocks, "the extreme of recklessness in credit has been corrected by an extreme of timidness."
Such a refusal to lend is bad news for job creation, and could be a precursor to more drops in asset values, with would-be buyers unable to finance purchases. Such declines could lead to an even greater hostility to lending and to more failures of financial institutions.
Mr. Clough, a bull on bonds, is not that pessimistic. "What this says to me is that there is a bit of a high wire act," with the risk being deflation and the hope being low inflation with decent growth.
But he is confident that lower short-term rates are here to stay. "The 3 percent savings account," he forecasts, "may come back."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Postwar Winners and Losers

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
THOUGH the United States and its allies were victorious in the fighting that grew out of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the impact of Saddam Hussein lingers on in some of the world's financial markets a year after the invasion.
Of the 24 stock markets followed in the Financial Times world index, only 10 have returned to or surpassed their pre-invasion levels since reaching their lows before the actual fighting began in January. 
 The 10 rising markets include those in the United States, up 9.5 percent over the Aug. 1, 1990 level; Great Britain, up 9.5 percent; Hong Kong, up 16.8 percent; Mexico, up 113.7 percent; the Netherlands, up 3.3 percent; South Africa, up 8.4 percent, and Canada, off now just 0.6 percent after passing the Aug. 1, 1990 level in March.
Of the remaining 14, 10 are still 10 percent or more below the Aug. 1, 1990. Of these, the Austrian market was off 31.2 percent; New Zealand, 25.1 percent; Italy, 21.6 percent; Norway, 18.7 percent; Germany, 17.7 percent; Japan, 14.6 percent, and France, 10.7 percent. (The Financial Times index will not match exactly the performance of the main local stock market indexes because the it may have a different mix of stocks and a different number than the local index.)
To be sure, President Hussein's invasion intruded on stock markets already weakend by rising interest rates, the onset of recessions in the United States and Britain and economies, like those in Continental Europe, that were slowing down.
But the shock that Iraq's invasion caused, the ensuing rise in oil prices and the drop in consumer confidence all combined to drive the markets down sharply. Returning from this extra-low point has made the struggle to come back difficult for many of the markets.
"There is no doubt that the downturn was made much more severe by Saddam,," said Geoffrey Dennis, a global strategist for James Capel Inc. in New York.
This has been especially true in Continental Europe, where stock markets declined sharply after the invasion. And instead of rebounding, these markets have had to endure a second blow from slowing economies and relatively high interest rates that have been mandated by Germany's tight monetary policy.
Though Japan's stock market is down, too, it seems to have suffered more from Japan's domestic economic and political problems -- and lately an embarrassing stock scandal -- than from the shadow of the invasion. Its economy was not slowed by concern over the invasion and its market plunge preceded the invasion and still continues. Japan's 14.6 percent market drop in the past year is still not as steep as those in many of its European counterparts.
The postwar bull markets have been in the United States, Britain, Mexico and South Africa. Their markets rose less than the world average of 16.4 percent during the war rally starting Jan. 16, the beginning of the bombing of Iraq, and ending Feb. 27, when President Bush declared a ceasefire. Since then, however, they have moved on to new record highs. In the United States and Britain, the moving forces were lower interest rates and the expectation of an end to the recession. In South Africa, the lifting of economic sanctions, a rally in gold stocks and a mad scramble of local investors for stocks has been more than enough, so far, to overwhelm the political scandals of the DeKlerk Government and the doubts about a smooth transition to a post-aparteid government.
In Mexico, the rally is one that just doesn't want to die. The Mexican market's 113.71 percent gain since the Iraqi invasion has been powered by the economic reforms of the Salinas Government and the hope for a successful negotiation of a free trade agreement with the United States.
The market in Hong Kong has also moved to record highs on the back of an agreement with China on a new airport in the colony, a rally in property stocks and the expected renewal of China's most-favored-nation trade status with the United States.
Other signposts in the year since the invasion of Kuwait: Bank stocks worldwide outperformed the aerospace and defense sector, with banks rising 4.5 percent in dollar terms while defense is up 2.2 percent since Aug. 1, 1990. Banks have had a small recovery from very low levels and got a big boost, rising 19.4 percent, during the rally in January and February.
Defense stocks received only a modest boost from the quick success of the war. Otherwise, the negative impact of defense budget cuts around the world seemed to hold sway as the Communist threat continued to diminish with the changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
The best performing sector worldwide since the February ceasefire has been precious metals and minerals, up 14.4 percent. The rise has been propelled by a rally in gold stocks.
The best performing sector in the year since the invasion was health and personal care, up 17.8 percent. The stocks are considered natural buys during economic slowdowns and recessions because of consistent consumer demand. The worst performers were automobiles, down 20.9 percent, and construction and building materials, down 21.0 percent.

Generosity Toes the (Bottom) Line

SERIES: First of two articles on corporate philanthropy.

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
EXECUTIVES in charge of corporate contributions used to worry exclusively about society, while their counterparts on the business side tended to profits. The philosophical paths never crossed.
Now, as both sides try to make do with slashed budgets, the separatism is ending. "We won't make a grant that doesn't fit the business strategy," said Cornelia Higginson, the vice president in charge of overseas giving for the American Express Company. Neither will Paul M. Ostergard, director of corporate contributions for Citibank. "A professional contributions manager puts the company's interest first," he said. "It's a classic case of doing well by doing good."
The timing is no coincidence. As the 1960's hippies and the 1970's yuppies move into positions of power, social conscience and capitalistic pragmatism have replaced social climbing as a prime mover behind corporate giving. "Old-line C.E.O.'s used donations to get on symphony boards; today's C.E.O.'s use the money as a strategic tool," said Craig Smith, publisher of Corporate Philanthropy Report, a Seattle newsletter.
The recession has caused most companies to cut their marketing and contributions budgets at a time when nonprofit groups are also strapped for cash. While the trend may hurt small, esoteric nonprofit groups, the larger, savvier ones have used their new entree to marketing departments to get advertising and promotional advice. And they pander to self-interest -- pointing out that sponsoring an avant-garde arts show will position a company as innovative or that supporting child care programs will help it attract women as customers.
The result: The Chinese wall between giving and selling has come down. Mr. Smith says 55 percent of contributions managers have regular contact with marketing directors. Nissan Motor Corporation in U.S.A. asks line managers to review philanthropic projects. Citibank, American Express and GTE Northwest offer discounts or free tickets to customers at the events to which they contribute. When the American Telephone and Telegraph Company sponsors a play, its foundation often pays production costs, while marketing handles promotions.
The International Business Machines Corporation now authorizes local managers to make grants of up to $25,000 -- presumably to causes favored by local customers and employees. "If a customer is on the board of a worthy museum, why shouldn't that be the one we support?" asked Juan Sabater, director of corporate social policy.
Corporations have grown adept at finding causes that tie in with their products. Since its acquisitions of Kraft and General Foods, the Philip Morris Companies Inc. has sponsored hunger relief and nutritional education programs. "Our giving reflects that we're now a food company," said Stephanie T. French, vice president of contributions.
U S West Inc., whose business strategy includes upgrading rural services and courting small businesses, announced a program this year to offer financial help and advice to small businesses in rural areas. "We always try to marry corporate and community interests," said Jane J. Prancan, executive director of the U S West Foundation.
So does American Express, which is homing in on education projects that stress travel. It sponsors geography competitions for high schoolers and high school programs to teach travel and tourism. Local managers often invite airline and hotel executives to serve as program advisers.
Marketers are listening more closely to what their corporate givers have to say.
Stephen Spurgeon, who handles Nissan Motor's contributions, got marketing to join Tread Lightly!, which promotes the prudent use of off-road land. "It fit with Pathfinder, our off-road vehicle," he said.
And Penny Hunt, who handles philanthropy for Dayton-Hudson department stores, says her marketing counterparts used similar reasoning when they agreed to donate backpacks for kindergarteners. "The Minneapolis schools asked me to do it, but marketing seemed a better fit," she said.
 
 
HOW IT WORKS OVERSEAS
 As American companies expand overseas, so do their giving programs. Following is a sample of such programs.
* American Express is helping Eastern European countries promote tourism. It is preserving monuments in the Caribbean. It runs day-care referral programs in England. And in Mexico, it is coordinating an industrywide effort to start a high school travel academy. "We want the Mexican government to see the travel industry as a powerful coalition," said Cornelia Higginson, who runs the company's international giving programs.
* I.B.M. divides the overseas world into three regions -- Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe -- and leaves project-picking, such as training in Brazil and environmental work in England, to local management.
* Citibank has taken the New York Philharmonic to Latin America, Europe and Asia. Its marketers hold opening night parties for customers in those areas.
* The General Electric Foundation fundseducation projects in "communities where G.E. does business," said Clifford V. Smith Jr., its president. It offers college scholarships in Mexico. It is paying to train doctors in Romania. And it is helping the Hungarian government teach people about capitalism.
* A.T.& T. funds dance projects in Brazil and in Egypt and has more overseas arts support on the agenda. "One reason we bought NCR was to expand internationally, so it makes sense that we'll do more projects," said Timothy J. McClimon, who handles A.T.& T.'s cultural donations.

10 Stubborn Plants That Bedevil Americans

BYLINE: By JOAN LEE FAUST

 BODY:
EVERYONE who grows plants confronts weeds at one time or another. Some weeds are pretty to look at and some are just plain nuisances. Usually when weeds appear in someone's garden, the plants are frowned upon and the garden is relegated to an unkempt category. Besides, weeds compete with desirable plants for soil moisture and nutrients.
Other gardeners are tolerant of weeds, however, and consider them nothing more than plants out of place. After all, they admit, for every weed or unwanted plant there is someone in the world who likes it and covets it. 
 Not many serious gardeners view plants this way. In fact, a recent publication of the United States Agricultural Research Service contains an article called "10 Weeds We Could Live Without." The research service says about 1 of every 10 species of plants is considered to be a weed. Scientists believe that there are 30,000 weed species, with about 1,800 of them causing serious economic losses in crop production.
About 70 percent of the worst weeds in the world are said to grow in the United States. And American farmers spend an estimated $2.1 billion annually for herbicides, plus another $938 million in application costs. The expenditure for these herbicides accounts for more than 65 percent of all pesticide sales in this country.
The newer approach taken by the researchers is to use post-emergent herbicides, those that act on the plants themselves rather than the pre-emergents that are put on the ground to kill the seed. The findings are that the treatment of the weeds above ground is a boon for the environment.
Post-emergent herbicides are believed to be deactivated in the soil, broken down by microbes without the residue effect caused by other chemicals. This research is also leading to answers of why the weeds are killed and opening new discoveries in particular plant pathogens.
What are those 10 weeds that Americans could live without? Although all of them are plagues that farmers battle, many of them are weeds quite familiar to the home gardener. And one curious thing about them is that eight are plants that have been introduced from other lands, while only two are native to the United States.
The two native species that have grown to become weeds are pigweed, an amaranthus that is known to the Great Plains especially but is a familiar weed in almost any garden. If left to grow without any interference, it can become five feet tall.
The other native plant that has become a weed in this country is the common ragweed, which is found mostly in the Eastern and North Central states. It can reach great heights, too, if unwatched, and its pollen causes hay fever for about 35 million people in the nation.
The other eight weeds, introduced to this country, have become naturalized pest plants and serious troublemakers for many who raise plants for profit, nurserymen as well as farmers. Probably one of the worst is that pretty little, but aggressive, plant, annual morning glory. Any of these Ipomoea species are aggressive in fields, even though many admire their lovely flowers. It is one of the toughest plants to get rid of, because it has a strong clinging habit.
Its cousin, field bindweed, is also on the weed hit list and has the distinction of being one of the worst weeds in the world. Field bindweed can be found in 47 of the 48 contiguous states (all but Florida). One of the researchers described this weed as an "out of control morning glory." Its roots go down about six feet.
Canada thistle is another nuisance, and a tough one, because it has a deep root system. It is also perennial, as is the dandelion, and tops broken off only leave the root to remain and grow for another season. The common cocklebur is in the same nuisance category, a bushy plant with prickly seeds.
Lamb's-quarters, which was introduced from Europe, is a thin-leaved annual weed highly susceptible to drought. If it has enough moisture, however, it will thrive aggressively and become a nuisance.
Although many landscapers may not recognize it as a weed, nutsedge is becoming an increasing problem. It is a tough-leaved perennial grass with unattractive blades. Although it is rampant in the southern portion of the country, it does make its appearance in the colder states and may be due to invasive spreading by poor quality seed mixes. It needs to be routed out of lawns as soon as it appears, lest it take hold by its aggressive creeping tendrils.
Although the last two weeds are not seen much in the Eastern states, they are problems elsewhere. Velvetleaf, an abutilon that was introduced from India, is so named because it has velvet hairs on its many branched stems. This weed is a pest in soybean and corn fields. Wild oats, another aggressive field weed, causes problems for wheat farmers in the Northern Plains states.

HEADLINE: Arms Makers and Military Face a Wrenching New Era

SERIES: Military-Industrial Upheaval/First of five articles.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
For dozens of communities, hundreds of companies and tens of thousands of workers who have thrived off the nation's vast weapons industry, life may never be the same. But early indications are that for the nation over all, the effect of sharply lower military budgets will be less severe than many had feared.
Some find the deep military cuts astonishing, some alarming and others long overdue, but no one doubts any longer that the end of the cold war and the monstrous Federal budget deficit make these reductions unavoidable. 
 The initial jolt for some individuals and regions has been severe, to be sure. Some towns may yet lose their largest employer. Some companies will merge, and others will go out of business altogether. Some engineers, managers and assembly-line workers will have to find new jobs.
 
Adjusting to New Climate
 But more than 30 years after Dwight Eisenhower warned of the difficulties of restraining the military-industrial complex, after decades when threatened weapons programs found ways time and again to stay alive, many communities and companies that have relied on Pentagon money have reconciled themselves to the fact that their world has changed. Since protest would be futile, they are concentrating on adapting to the new climate.
For example, in the St. Louis area, a center of the weapons industry and now nearly a year into significant cutbacks, the overall economy has shown encouraging resiliency.
One reason why the pain may not be so severe after all is that although the military budgets have grown over the years, the economy itself has grown faster. So military cuts have much less impact than they once did. The military and its suppliers now make up only about 5 percent of the $5.5 trillion in goods and services Americans produce each year.
Another reason is that many American cities and towns have diversified and become less dependent on manufacturing.
Moreover, new work may be found in a vast program the Pentagon has quietly embarked on to clean up environmental hazards at military bases.
Congress actually began cutting funds for the military five years ago. But because of the lag between the time money bills are enacted and when the funds are spent, the effects are only now beginning to be felt.
The Bush Administration plans for military spending to fall by another 20 percent over the next five years. Many politicians and military analysts expect Congress to cut even more.
Purchases of aircraft, ships, tanks and missiles -- the lifeblood of an industry larger than the auto industry -- could well be halved.
Illustrating the pressures on businesses dependent on military contracts, the General Dynamics Corporation announced in May that it might cut its work force by nearly a third over the next four years. Most stunning, the announcement came barely a week after the company, the nation's second-largest weapons supplier, had won a share of the biggest military contract up for grabs in this decade.
"Our defense establishment is shrinking at an alarming rate," William A. Anders, the former astronaut who has been General Dynamics' chairman and chief executive since the first of the year, explained in a letter to employees. "As our market shrinks, we should plan to shrink as well."
To a large extent, according to more than two dozen Defense Department officials, out-side military experts, corporate executives, politicians, economists and social scientists interviewed over the last two months, the decisions on just which individuals and communities will be hit most turn on the answers to some fundamental questions that are only beginning to be addressed:
*Which companies, industries and arms-research projects must be kept alive in case someday a rapid military buildup is warranted?
*Should the Government keep companies alive just for the sake of competition?
*How many large military contractors will the shrunken market bear, and how many small, specialized companies can the country afford to lose?
*Can military suppliers diversify into civilian work?
*Can the Pentagon learn to use equipment and component parts made primarily for civilian consumption?
"I don't think the Administration, the military or the Congress has really decided where we want to be," said Senator William S. Cohen of Maine, a senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee.
 
 Politics, as Usual
 To a degree, of course, decisions on who wins and who loses in an ever-shrinking arena will depend on politics. It is not coincidental, for example, that the House of Representatives, over the objection of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, insisted in June on producing the V-22 Osprey, a tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter but flies like a plane. Much of the work would be done in Pennsylvania, the home state of Representative John P. Murtha, a powerful Democrat who heads the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Defense.
The decisions will also depend on how a basic institutional disagreement between the military and Congress is resolved. The Pentagon generally wants the latest in high-technology weapons. Congress, on the other hand, usually favors building the same old planes and ships so that existing jobs are not lost.
However these decisions are made and whatever the short-term adverse consequences, economists generally agree that the country will benefit in the long term from spending less of its resources on the military.
 
The Background
Military Boom
Draws to Close
 From 1980 to 1986, the Pentagon's budget doubled, to $281.4 billion from $140.7 billion. After inflation, that represented a 50 percent increase, the biggest peacetime expansion of the military in the nation's history. Most of it was defended on the basis of the possibility of a war with the Soviet Union. Around Boston, Los Angeles, Seattle, St. Louis, Washington and dozens of other metropolises, the military buildup fueled an economic boom.
But by 1986 the budget deficit was out of control, and Congress put on the brakes. In the last half of the 80's, despite the Reagan Administration's requests for increases, the money Congress allocated to the Pentagon fell by more than 20 percent after inflation.
Until last year, however, actual spending cuts were made by stretching out contracts and taking other relatively painless steps rather than by actually eliminating weapons systems. But the diminished threat from the Soviet Union and the Government's great budget deficit led the Bush Administration last year to propose military spending reductions of 20 percent through 1996.
"In the last 12 months," said Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan, authoritative research organization in Washington, "the Pentagon abandoned the pinking shears approach and took a dagger to the heart."
 
Pentagon Spending Fixed
 Last October, President Bush and Congress struck a five-year budget deal to reduce the Federal deficit by nearly $500 billion. Pentagon spending was fixed through 1993. But beginning in the fiscal year 1994, military and domestic programs will once again be competing for funds.
Congress's instinct will be "to cut even deeper because of competition from popular domestic programs, no doubt about it," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, an influential Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.
The Administration's plan is to reduce active-duty troop strength from 2.2 million in 1987 and 2 million last year to 1.6 million by 1995. The Army and Air Force face the largest cutbacks. The Administration wants to make deep cuts in the Reserves and National Guard as well. Spending for research and development would be cut slightly over this period, and the purchase of weapons could fall by more than 40 percent.
Even if Congress cuts no more than the Pentagon recommends, the military's share of the gross national product will fall to 3.6 percent by 1996, from 6.5 percent in 1985 and about 5.5 percent in 1990.
In dollar terms, the cutbacks will be equivalent to those after World War II, Korea and Vietnam. But the overall economy is much larger than it was in those days, so military production is a much smaller proportion of national output. In World War II, military spending reached 39 percent of G.N.P; it was 13 percent during the Korean War and 10 percent at the height of the war in Vietnam.
Though the decisions have been made to cut spending, the battles have barely begun over how and where.
This spring, for instance, the House voted to continue producing a number of weapons that the Pentagon wanted to terminate, including the M-1 tank and the F-14 and F-16 fighter planes. To pay the bills, the House wants to slash billions of dollars from two of the Pentagon's favorite projects, the B-2 stealth bomber and the "Star Wars" missile defense system.
The Senate voted this week to provide the money the Pentagon wants for the B-2 and the Star Wars system and to discontinue production of the M-1 tank and the planes.
The issues will be settled in a House-Senate conference committee this fall. But whatever the immediate outcome, calculations by experts in and out of the Government show that the amount of money available by the middle of the decade will not be sufficient to pay for the weapons programs and troop strengths the Pentagon is planning on.
 
The Industry
Some Companies
May Not Survive
 For industry, the changes mean different things to different companies. Basically, there are four types of military contractors:
*Large companies whose business primarily is with the military and almost entirely with the Federal Government. Among these companies are General Dynamics, the Grumman Corporation and the Martin Marietta Corporation.
*Large military contractors that also do a substantial amount of civilian work. This group includes McDonnell Douglas, Boeing and Raytheon.
*Primarily commercial companies with military divisions like General Electric and Westinghouse.
*Small businesses that supply the prime contractors and major subcontractors.
For the first two groups of companies, the next few years will be a fight to the finish with many not surviving. For instance, seven big companies now make aircraft frames. Most analysts believe that by the end of the decade, two or three at most will remain.
 
Some Have a Leg Up
 Those already with large amounts of civilian work have a distinct leg up. Boeing, for example, has a backlog for commercial jets that will last into the next century.
These companies, said Robert Paulson, an adviser to military contractors for the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, realize they must lower their ambitions, but each insists that it will be able to survive by increasing its slice of the shrinking military pie.
Renso L. Caporali, Grumman's chairman, acknowledged that some executives were overly optimistic about the prospects for their company's survival. "All of us," he said, "are hoping that somehow we'll dance through the raindrops."
The announcement by General Dynamics in May that it will cut its work force from 90,000 employees now to as few as 63,000 by 1995 came only nine days after it won a share of the contract to build the F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighter, the biggest weapons contract of the 90's. The Air Force plans to buy 648 of these planes at a cost of $95 billion.
 
Others Take Similar Steps
 General Dynamics has not said where jobs will be cut; its biggest plants are in Texas, Ohio, Michigan, California and Connecticut.
Other large military contractors are taking similar steps. McDonnell Douglas, the biggest Pentagon contractor, has cut thousands of jobs in the last year, mostly in St. Louis and Long Beach, Calif., and further cuts are in the offing. Grumman, with headquarters on Long Island and plants in Florida and Texas, is 25 percent smaller than it was five years ago and will shrink 5 to 10 percent more in the next year alone, Mr. Caporali said.
Many companies in the third category, those with businesses that are primarily commercial, have sold or are divesting themselves of their military divisions; among them: Goodyear, Honeywell and Chrysler.
No one knows for sure how many small businesses work on military subcontracts or how many people they employ. Paul H. Nisbet, first vice president for research at Prudential Securities, estimates that 120,000 such suppliers existed five years ago, that only 25,000 are in the business today and that half of these will get out of military work in the next five years.
Military planners are not overly concerned that some aircraft companies might go under. Commercial needs guarantee that the necessary technological edge will be maintained and that a base will remain if a production increase is required in a crisis.
Ships are another matter. The few remaining shipyards rely almost entirely on the Defense Department. A similar problem exists in the case of tanks. General Dynamics plans to close its tank plant outside Detroit this fall, leaving only one tank factory, another General Dynamics plant in Lima, Ohio.
Officially, the Bush Administration's view is that the Government should rely on "market forces" and not be in the position of subsidizing companies or factories to keep them alive. But in the case of weapons production, said Mr. Caporali, chairman of Grumman, "the Government is the only market."
The Defense Department estimates that 2.75 million Americans work in industry jobs financed by contracts with the military. Most of them hold jobs that are indistinguishable from those in the civilian world, driving trucks, say, or writing computer programs. These people, if they are laid off, should have little trouble finding other work.
Only about 500,000 workers are actually making weaponry, according to the Labor Department, and Government analysts doubt that more than 10 percent of them will lose their jobs. In a country with nine million people unemployed and an additional six million unable to find full-time work, 50,000 more on the street is statistically insignificant.
The problem could be worsened by several factors: The job losses will be concentrated in particular communities, the jobs that are lost tend to be high-paid positions, and minority workers are likely to be disproportionately affected.
 
 California Biggest Loser
 Economists in and out of the Government generally believe that large metropolitan areas with many military-related jobs but diverse economies should quickly produce enough new jobs to take up the slack. The Center for the Continuing Study of California, a research organization in Palo Alto, estimates, for instance, that despite the military cutbacks, three million net new jobs will be created in the state by the end of the decade.
More worrisome are the isolated areas. In southeastern Maine, for instance, the Bath Iron Works Corporation's shipyard is the main employer in a five-county region. The shipyard soon will have only one contract, to build Arleigh Burke-class destroyers for the Navy. If the Navy cancels that, as it well could, the shipyard would have to close and the region might not recover for years.
 
Diversification
Little Success
Converting Plants
 Weapons plants have rarely been converted profitably into civilian factories.
The list of companies whose weapons divisions have failed to make the transition is legion. Grumman tried without success to sell buses, and Boeing's helicopter division to sell subway cars. "When it comes to diversification," said Norman R. Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta, "the defense industry's record is unblemished by success."
Murray Weidenbaum, director of the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis, said there were three main reasons: Military contractors do not have the experience or the network of distributors to market commercial products; they are not used to producing at the mass scale needed for commercial success, and they do not know how to cut costs to sell a product.
While most executives of these companies have given up on commercial products, some hope for work from other Government agencies. Martin Marietta, for example, is working on an automation program for the Postal Service, and Grumman builds postal trucks.
The military contractors may be further disadvantaged if, as politicians and academic experts have been advocating for years, the Pentagon begins rewriting the specifications for weapons parts so that more commercial products can be used.
Donald J. Yockey, Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, pressed on this point at a recent Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, conceded that a small edge in technology might have to be relinquished to get rid of "impossible specs."
Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, the committee's chairman, said he was skeptical that anything could be accomplished in this area. "How are you going to do that?" Mr. Nunn asked. "You're talking about changing the culture of military procurement. You have thousands and thousands of people over there writing military specifications."
But to some degree, that may be precisely what will be taking place in the coming years: changing the way the military does business.
NEXT: A huge environmental cleanup.

HEADLINE: After 6 Months of Changes, Haiti Is Surprised by Its Leader's Moderation

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
When the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide overwhelmed his rivals in December in Haiti's first democratic elections, many supporters hoped and opponents feared that his inauguration presaged a period of jarring economic and social change for the country.
The leftist Roman Catholic priest, champion of ambitious programs like a radical reorganization of the peasantry and universal literacy, continues to chant his campaign mantra of "justice, openness and participation," themes that have been used to encourage crackdowns on people thought to be connected to past dictatorships and urge the poor not to wait passively for government to address their grievances. 
 But six months after his inauguration, the 38-year-old leader's calls for change have given way to an unanticipated degree of moderation in many areas that has pleasantly surprised some skeptics while disappointing some supporters.
A stock item of the President's speeches these days is a warm salute of the American Ambassador, Alvin P. Adams Jr., the representative of a Government that he recently excoriated as the driving force of neocolonialism. By all accounts, the two men have developed a close working relationship.
 
Promises of Foreign Loans
 "He has gotten off to a very credible start," Mr. Adams said of the new President. "The process is well begun."
But the most important signal of the Aristide Government's evolution occurred in July, when a delegation of senior Haitian officials returned from a World Bank-organized international lenders conference in Paris trumpeting their success in obtaining promises of $442 million in new loans and aid for Haiti.
Father Aristide was a longtime opponent of foreign assistance, instead favoring self-reliance and greater freedom from the international financial institutions and Western governments, which he often accused of working in concert with a tiny Haitian elite to keep the country mired in poverty.
No sooner did word spread about the coming loans and what officials called the "advanced state" of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund than the Government began to be reminded, often in strongly critical terms, of its previously stated hostility to such engagements.
 
Realism and the Skeptics
 "In taking this path, senior officials risk being considered as traitors," said an article in Balance, a left-of-center Haitian weekly that has been a strenuous supporter of the Aristide Government. "By trying too hard to please foreign governments, our leaders are losing the esteem and confidence that many people placed in them."
Amid the free-for-all jumble of Rue Pavee, a thickly congested commercial thoroughfare, a businessman said that his customers speak with worry about the mysterious "palace powder" whose aroma is said to exert a powerful influence on all those who come to occupy the capital's gleaming, White House-inspired executive mansion, making even the most sincere sounding politician soon forget pledges to remedy the problems of the poor.
But the businessman, who had apprehensively spoken of the President before his inauguration as a mixture of Fidel Castro and Ayatollah Khomeini, said that he is now cautiously optimistic.
Many in Haiti's business community who had been skeptical of the President's politics said they were cheered by what they saw as the new Government's realism. But some cautioned that a true test of leadership would not come until the fall, when the austerity measures are put into effect, incurring certain popular displeasure with the higher gasoline prices, new taxes, layoffs and currency devaluation that World Bank and I.M.F. assistance will probably bring.
 
Lack of Ready Options
 "There is bound to be a clamor that the Government is following a path different from the one that got it elected, and it will get louder and louder," a businessman said. "You can't be certain about Aristide's direction until he withstands that test."
Others saw the Government's moderation as a reflection of a lack of ready options rather than a new-found conviction in fiscally conservative policies or World Bank-style export-based development strategies.
"He would probably love to do something else, but he doesn't see any alternative," said Leopold Berlanger, a political analyst who directs a private Haitian institute for community development, speaking of Father Aristide. "Alan Garcia in Peru and Michael Manley in Jamaica each tried a different path, and it didn't work. The only thing left is the conventional way."
In an interview, President Aristide said his longtime criticism of Western development aid should be seen in the light of Haiti's past experience.
"We grew used to seeing our Governments on their knees because these financial institutions demanded a cleanup," he said. He added that past regimes "were unable to clean things up because they were the very people doing the stealing."
"Our policies must always stand for dignity, and for the people that means work," Father Aristide said, acknowledging the surprise caused by his economic program. "Some people who were expecting a great shock and were ready to celebrate it are disappointed in our balanced approach. I expect them to complain."
Those who remain suspicious of the new Government's intentions point to its early weeks to suggest that whatever its current direction, its instincts are far from conventional.
At the outset, fired with idealistic visions of rapid change nourished by Father Aristide's success in garnering nearly 70 percent of the popular vote, the new administration immediately began to explore alternative ways of jump-starting Haiti's moribund economy.
 
Protests by the Unemployed
 The Government began by soliciting donations from Haiti's large expatriate communities in the United States and France, and by urging -- some said browbeating -- the wealthy classes in the country to contribute money, hire more workers and increase their investments. In April, facing a serious cash-flow shortage, the Government alarmed many by urging "patriotic" businessmen to contribute "thousands and millions of dollars" within a space of four days.
Although several million dollars were ultimately raised through various efforts of that type, the economy continued to decline. Major employers at Haiti's industrial zone on the edge of Port-au-Prince, where clothing is made and simple assembly of manufactured goods is performed for re-export, began to warn that thousands of jobs were being lost.
Meanwhile, the presidential palace began to be the site of almost-daily demonstrations, often by poor and unemployed people demanding Government action. A seemingly frustrated President Aristide began making frequent pointed allusions to members of the bourgeoisie, whom he sometimes described as self-interested "pocket patriots," quickly alienating many of the people whose cooperation the Government badly needed.
"He gets wrapped around his rhetoric sometimes, like any good speaker," a diplomat said. "Judging from the reaction it got, those are comments he would probably like to take back."
In May, Renaud Bernadin, the Minister of Planning and Cooperation, raised eyebrows when a French news magazine reported his presence in Libya on the anniversary of the United States' 1986 bombing of Tripoli. The Government quickly disavowed any official sanctioning of the trip, and quietly expressed regrets to diplomats here. But many saw the visit as a last-ditch attempt to obtain quick cash or petroleum assistance to lift the Haitian economy.
As alternative efforts like those failed, Haitians close to the President say he gradually resigned himself to contracting large-scale international assistance to bring new jobs, clean drinking water and passable roads to the hemisphere's poorest country.
"What brought us to this decision was the total bankruptcy of the country," said Fritz Longchamps, a longtime acquaintance of the President who was recently appointed representative to the United Nations. "The most important thing is to get the economy going again. Then we can worry about the question of dependence."
In recent weeks, Father Aristide has turned most of his attention to the punishment of partisans of former dictatorships, collectively referred to as Macoutes, after the notorious Tontons Macoute militiamen of the 29-year Duvalier family dictatorship.
 
Rooting Out Every Macoute
 Judgment of the Macoutes has been a constant concern of the President, drawing complaints from some quarters that he has interfered in the judicial process and is exploiting a populist issue to distract attention from other problems.
With the approach of the trial of Roger Lafontant, a former Interior Minister who attempted a coup in January that would have prevented the President-elect from taking office, Father Aristide gave an angry televised speech in which he banged the table for emphasis, promising "to root out every Macoute" in the Government.
[On July 30, Mr. Lafontant was convicted and sentenced to life in prison at hard labor. President Aristide decreed a national holiday. Mr. Lafontant protested that he had not been able to offer a defense with lawyers of his choice because they had been too intimidated to take the case.]
In the interview, Father Aristide denied that he had improperly interfered in the legal process.
 
Trust in the Army
 "Without the institutional structures of justice, we will always return to Macoutism," he said.
In fact, diplomats and Haitians say Mr. Lafontant's January coup attempt was a boon of sorts for the President. The violent popular reaction to the takeover of the palace, which set off several days of looting and lynchings, sent many of the remaining partisans of past dictatorships fleeing the country.
The rejection by the army of Mr. Lafontant's call to join in the coup established a bond of trust between the new leadership and the military, which has continued to grow.
From his first day in office, Father Aristide has worked to reshape the army, promoting young officers and rooting out others whose associations with an unruly and corrupt past were too direct.
Last month, the President eased into retirement Gen. Herard Abraham, who had served briefly as head of state and as caretaker commander-in-chief since the departure into exile early last year of Gen. Prosper Avril, the last of a series of military strongmen. Replacing General Abraham is Gen. Raoul Cedras, a much younger officer, who one senior diplomat called "the best choice he could have come up with."

HEADLINE: Insurers' Raters Are on the Spot For Inaccuracy

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 3

 BODY:
The giant insurers taken over by regulators this year -- Executive Life, First Capital and Mutual Benefit -- all received high marks from rating agencies not long before they were seized. Now, ratings companies are scrambling to make their evaluations more accurate, while a growing number of consumers, insurance agents, regulators and lawmakers say drastic changes are needed.
"If the rating agencies were getting constant information from the insurance companies, then they have a lot to explain in terms of how they missed the boat on Mutual Benefit, Executive Life and First Capital," Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, said in a telephone interview this week. "Their credibility has been severely tested."
 
Flaws Acknowledged
 The leading ratings companies -- A. M. Best, Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's -- dismiss much of the criticism as mere hindsight. But they have, in effect, acknowledged flaws in their methods: Best announced on Thursday that it would add investor confidence to the categories it analyzes, and Standard & Poor's and Moody's said they would give greater weight to that criterion. 
 The executives at the companies acknowledge that they have always paid closer attention to insurance companies' assets, rather than their liabilities. They also say they have rarely if ever included in their analyses the large withdrawals by investors -- the equivalent of a run on a bank -- that have led regulators to seize several companies.
But the many critics have other complaints. They note that the ratings companies may have a conflict of interest, because they sell their services to the insurance companies. If not to please the insurers, these critics ask, why would the ratings system be structured in such a way that a company can have its rating reduced five or six times and still have an A rating?
The insurance companies take the ratings seriously, and those with top ratings mention them in their advertisements and sometimes include them on their stationery.
And consumers also take the ratings seriously. Many people frequently check them to see whether their pension money, savings plans or life insurance policies are safe. They turn to the ratings guides at public libraries around the country.
Now, the problems at big insurers have affected more than a million policyholders, through either reductions in retirement benefits or the inability to gain access to their savings.
Dr. J. Steve Brodie, a retired physician in Los Angeles, said he bought more than $1 million in life insurance from Executive Life largely on the strength of an A+ rating from A. M. Best. He said he would have cashed in his policy months before Executive Life's failure if Best had cut its rating earlier.
"Virtually right up until the end I was getting communication from my agent and from Executive Life that the company was still rated tops," said Dr. Brodie, who has joined in a lawsuit against the rating agencies. "For me, Best blew it."
 
Ratings Called Generous
 Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, commented: "What we tell people is that the insurance ratings are extremely generous. We're telling people that if they have substantial assets tied up with a life insurer they should consider shifting if from any company not rated tops."
At the core of the criticism is a simple fact: Before they were taken over, the insurers that failed recently had ratings at or near the top of the rating agencies' safety scales. Mutual Benefit, for example, enjoyed A. M. Best's top rating of A+ until July 3, six days before it was taken over. Moody's had Mutual Benefit listed as an A company, and so did S.& P.
The rating agencies' analysis of First Capital was no more cautionary. By last spring, First Capital's sizable investment in speculative-grade junk bonds was well known in insurance circles, and pension managers had begun to avoid the company. Yet it was not until May 7, a week before it was taken over by the California Insurance Commissioner, that First Capital lost its investment-grade rating of BBB+ from S.& P. First Capital was rated A-, or excellent, by Best until the day of the takeover. Moody's had not rated it.
"A. M. Best really has not been paying attention to potential troubles in the last five years," said Ardian Gill, a New York-based industry consultant. "They have been sort of asleep."
Paul Wish, a Best spokesman, said the company's ratings system had been based on the premise that a company would continue to operate and did not address the question of whether a company could withstand a run. Earlier this week, Best announced that it would factor into its ratings an assessment of insurers' vulnerability to runs. In its announcement, Best said, "This factor addresses the unprecedented environment caused by the combined effects of a recession, a national depressed real estate market, a decline in consumer confidence in financial institutions and new legal pressures on pension managers."
Other ratings agency executives have offered other defenses.
At Standard & Poor's, Mark Puccia, a senior vice president, argues that no ratings agency could have predicted that panicked policyholders would flock to cash in their policies. Nor could the agencies have predicted that regulators would seize companies still afloat. That was the case at Mutual Benefit; the New Jersey insurance commissioner, Samuel F. Fortunato, took control of Mutual Benefit to stop a run on a company that was very much a going concern.
"You have companies with positive net worth being put in conservatorship," Mr. Puccia said.
At Moody's, Kenneth J. H. Pinkes, the senior insurance specialist, said a lot of the accusations amount to after-the-fact criticism by people working with perfect hindsight. Referring specifically to the Executive Life debacle, Mr. Pinkes said it was not obvious in the late 1980's that Executive Life's investments in junk bonds would cause its downfall.
"How many people would have forecast Drexel Burnham's failure in the fall of 1989?" Mr. Pinkes asked. "It was still a powerhouse." He added that the real test of a rating agency, which he said Moody's was passing, was whether over the long run lower-rated companies fared worse than higher-rated ones.
But critics note that at all three rating agencies the distribution of ratings is not what one would expect -- with many companies rated average. Rather, many companies are rated "excellent" or "superior."
A major part of the problem, critics say, is that insurance companies are far more complex than they were a decade ago. While insurers have always invested in real estate, the introduction in the 1970's of variable-rate life insurance, variable-rate annuities and other savings vehicles in which the interest credited to a policyholder's account was tied to market rates has forced insurers to seek higher returns themselves by investing in higher-risk real estate.
"What's really coming to the fore now is how difficult it is to evaluate real estate," said Brian Ternoey, a senior insurance specialist at A. Foster Higgins & Company, the big benefits consultant based in New York City.
 
New Obligations
 The nature of insurers' obligations has also been changing. In the past, a life insurer's main liability was to pay death benefits -- entirely predictable in the long run. Today, most large insurers have billions of dollars in "guaranteed investment contracts" on their books.
These contracts require an insurer to pay a guaranteed rate of interest on a set amount of principal, typically to a company's 401(k) plan. While the contracts, like bank savings certificates, normally have a date on which they come due, they also typically allow the holder of a 401(k) plan to withdraw money early, often with minimal penalty and with as little as 30 days' notice.
The result is that some insurers are vulnerable to large-scale withdrawals should contract holders get nervous. Many companies would have no problem handling such withdrawals because of their sizable capital bases and large cash balances. But it was largely the huge withdrawals of investment-contract money and similar investments that brought down Executive Life, First Capital, and Mutual Benefit.
Some industry experts question whether the ratings agencies grasped this, and they ask whether the ratings reflect the true risks.
"It's clear to me that the ratings agencies did not understand the insurance companies," Mr. Ternoey said. "They concentrated on the assets, not the liabilities."
 
Conflict of Interest Seen
 Another complaint is what critics call a conflict of interest. Insurers pay Moody's and Standard & Poor's up to $30,000 a year for ratings. A. M. Best rates insurers for a nominal sum but is constantly selling industry guides, reports and newsletters to insurers and agents. Because the ratings agencies depend on the industry for revenues, the agencies might be reluctant to cut ratings, critics contend.
Ratings executives vigorously dispute this, noting that insurers agree to pay for ratings and publications well in advance of the assignment of a rating.
The lettering system used to evaluate insurers is also at issue. The ratings agencies say the system makes sense since, in the case of Standard & Poor's and Moody's, it is the same as what they use to rate bonds. Critics note that under the system an insurer's rating could be cut six times at Moody's or S.&P. and remain in the A category. At A. M. Best, such a downgrading could occur five times.
"It's a merchandising ploy," said Roy Schotland, a specialist in pension law and insurance at the Georgetown Law Center. "Why should A be three levels from the top?"
Scrutinized as never before, the ratings agencies say they are changing. All three said last week that they were modifying their rating systems to give greater weight to the possibility of withdrawals by many policyholders. Best said it would include a "policyholder confidence factor" in future ratings, intended to measure an insurer's vulnerability to a panic.

HEADLINE: Connecticut's Latest Budget Showdown Runs Down to Wire

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 3

 BODY:
With another shutdown of state offices threatened for Monday, the State Capitol complex was quiet today, except for occasional knots of tourists and two small meetings of legislators.
Party leaders canceled caucuses and a House session scheduled for today, leaving everything to the last day of a temporary budget that expires at midnight Sunday. The House and Senate will both meet, though it remains to be determined which chamber will vote first, and on what. 
 One group meeting today was made up of Democratic House leaders who went over a budget based on an income tax to see whether it could be shaded to attract a few more Democratic or Republican votes. A vote on the plan to impose a 4.1 percent income tax but cut the sales tax and the tax on investment income was put off on Friday because it did not have majority support.
The other group was made up of Republicans and Democrats who have put together and passed two budgets based on an expanded sales tax, only to have them vetoed by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. The politicians were working on a third such plan, called Coalition 3, to have ready on Sunday if the income-tax plan failed.
 
Preparing for a Shutdown
 The General Assembly faces the deadline because a week ago it and Mr. Weicker agreed to extend for seven days the temporary spending measures that have kept the government operating since Connecticut began its fiscal year on July 1 without a budget.
Mr. Weicker has not said whether he will order offices to close on Monday if there is no budget, as he did on July 2, when the state was first left without one. But his staff and commissioners are preparing for a shutdown.
Through today, however, neither legislative chamber has even gone into session. House Speaker Richard J. Balducci said a result is that forging a budget has become the overriding concern of legislators, whether Democratic or Republican, favoring an income-tax plan or opposing one.
"We've got to vote tomorrow, up or down with one, or up or down with the other," the Democrat of Newington said as he arrived for the session with Democratic leaders after having spent the morning talking with Republican leaders.
Any vote on an income tax is complicated by distrust between the House, which has approved one income-tax plan, and the Senate, which killed it. Several House members who voted for the first plan are reluctant to go on the record a second time unless they know that the Senate will follow suit.
The Senate, however, is two votes short of a majority for an income tax, and Democratic leaders there say they cannot muster a majority unless the House votes first. Complicating matters is that those leaders, John B. Larson of East Hartford and Cornelius P. O'Leary of Windsor Locks, will vote against an income tax.
Representative Robert Ward, Republican of Northford, said the coalition working on a compromise based on a sales tax would not contest or delay a vote on an income tax, to leave more time for the debate on their plan, which they expect to follow.
The coalition of Republicans and moderate Democrats is examining ways to widen the 8 percent sales tax beyond the expansion to new goods and services that all the budget plans already include. One alternative is to add a 10 percent surcharge, raising the rate to 8.8 percent, until the $1 billion deficit from the last fiscal year is paid off.
For Mr. Weicker, an independent Governor with no party behind him, Sunday offers the prospect of a third budget based on a sales tax. He vetoed the first two, insisting on a budget that could both raise the revenue to balance this year's budget and stimulate the economy by cutting the sales tax and business taxes.
Mr. Ward said the ideal result would be a two-thirds majority for the coalition budget. That would allow Mr. Weicker to acknowledge the futility of a veto and sign the budget to avoid a shutdown.
If an income tax fails, Mr. Balducci said, he and other legislators who supported it will have to face up to the need for a budget.
"Our bond ratings are going down the tubes," he said. "Our credibility as a state is at stake."

HEADLINE: Black Church Charges Co-op City With Racial Bias Against It

BYLINE: By ROBERT E. TOMASSON

 BODY:
A decision to rent a vacant movie theater in Co-op City to a white bingo operator instead of to an all-black church has unleashed charges of racial discrimination in the huge apartment complex in the Bronx.
The dispute has sent a tremor through Co-op City, the nation's largest apartment complex, with 50,000 tenants in 15,500 apartments and town houses. The complex is a notable example of gradual and largely smooth integration. Once overwhelmingly white, the population has become about half black and Hispanic. 
 On Friday, 150 members of the Protestant Community Church filled a courtroom in the United States Court House in lower Manhattan for the first hearing of a suit that accuses the development's board of voting against renting to the church because of the race of its congregation.
The fight has had an especially wrenching impact because the church has long been a social force in the development, expanding from a few members to about 600, virtually all of them Co-op City tenants. And while those favoring the bingo parlor insist that the decision was purely economic, racial feelings have consistently come to the surface in the prolonged dispute.
 
Church's Efforts to Rent
 At Friday's hearing, the Rev. Calvin Owens recounted his church's repeated efforts to rent the space, which has been vacant for three years. Judge Lawrence M. McKenna adjourned the case until Aug. 19. The suit seeks to compel the board to rent to the church.
The board's decision in favor of the bingo parlor has proved embarrassing, as many Co-op tenants outside the congregation have supported the church.
The board has maintained that the church would be an inappropriate tenant in the front section of the Bartow Shopping Center, one of three shopping centers in the development. For 13 years, the church has rented quarters in the back of the Bartow Center, in a sunken plaza under a branch of the New York Public Library.
"It was the thinking of the board and the commercial development committee that they wanted someone to enhance the shopping patterns of people in the center and thus help the current merchants," said Al Zezula, a spokesman for the Riverbay Corporation, which manages Co-op City.
 
'Bingo Parlor Over a Church?'
 In an interview, Mr. Owens said: "If it was going to be a major commercial tenant that would bring benefit to the people, I could live with that. But a bingo parlor over a church?"
The prospective owner of the bingo parlor, Dominic Castore, said he was surprised and dismayed by the dispute, with its allegations of discrimination. "It was all new to me, but it's up to them; they'll have to decide it."
Mr. Castore is the chairman of Community Board 11 in the northeast section of the Bronx, which does not include Co-op City.
Under the terms of his lease, Mr. Castore would pay $100,000 rent the first year with increases later.
Mr. Owens said that he was never given a chance to match the rent, and that the board did not respond to his offer to pay $70,000 in arrears owed by the former tenant.
 
Co-Op City's Notable Omission
 On May 22, the board voted 9 to 4 to award the lease to Mr. Castore. The four dissenting voters were black, while two black, four white and three Hispanic members formed the majority.
With its 35 apartment towers, scores of low-rise buildings and virtually all the amenities of a small city, Co-op City had one notable omission when it was built in the late 1970's -- houses of worship. Since then six synagogues, a Roman Catholic church and 11 other Christian churches have been established. One of the first was the Community Protestant Church.
In an affidavit to the court, Mr. Owens maintained that the refusal of the management to rent the larger and more visible space to the church was part of a pattern of discrimination:
"Riverbay has never leased any of its properties on the Bartow Avenue frontage of the Bartow Shopping Center to black people even though some applied for such space.
"In addition, Riverbay has leased properties to religious organizations whose congregations are predominately white at more favorable rental rates than it has to congregations whose members are predominately black or Latino."
But Mr. Owens, like several other tenants who were asked, praised the development. "I really do love it here," the minister said.

HEADLINE: U.S. TAKING STEPS TO BAR NEW WAVE OF CUBAN EMIGRES

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Concerned about a resurgence of migration from Cuba, the Administration is taking steps to curb the number of Cubans applying to come to the United States as tourists.
The Administration last week temporarily froze new applications for six-month tourist visas, which are running at a rate about triple that of last year. Not only are more Cubans applying for tourist visas, but more than a third are illegally overstaying the visas. 
 A senior State Department official said Washington would soon announce currency restrictions designed to cut visa fees that have provided the Cuban Government with desperately needed dollars as more Cubans leave.
 
Illegal Entries Increase
 The number of Cubans coming to the United States illegally on boats or rafts is also increasing, but it is far lower than of those coming legally as tourists. Nevertheless, the Defense Department has drawn up contingency plans for a naval blockade in the event that President Fidel Castro unleashes an exodus of the kind that flooded south Florida with 129,000 immigrants in a matter of weeks in 1980.
"There's widespread acknowledgement that Castro could strike out in any number of ways, but we are committed to stopping another Mariel," a senior Pentagon official said, referring to the Cuban port from which the 1980 exodus took place.
Administration officials say the new policies come in response to the sudden surge of migration and are not a ploy to ratchet up pressure on a government they believe is doomed to topple in the next few years.
 
Soviets Urged to Cut Aid
 Senior state Department officials said President Bush's recent public calls for free elections in Cuba, combined with his private urgings to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at this week's summit meeting in Moscow to cut Soviet support to Havana, represent the Administration's major initiatives at isolating and squeezing the Castro Government.
But some prominent Cuban-Americans and Congressional leaders who have the Administration's ear are urging officials to use immigration policy as a weapon against Havana. They say they are convinced that the moratorium on accepting new visa applications represents a testing period to gauge the political reaction of Cuban-American in Miami before the Admnistration moves to impose more drastic restrictions.
While Administration officials do not consider another Mariel imminent, they have become concerned by the growing numbers of Cubans who are remaining beyond their visas with no apparent intention of returning. Officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service say they believe that about 13,000 of the 36,000 Cubans who have come to the United States since November have stayed illegally. If the current rate of applications were allowed to continue, they would total 100,000 this year, as against 35,000 in 1990.
State Department officials say the changes in immigration policy were initiated primarily because Florida officials have warned that such an increase would pose an intolerable strain on the state's schools, hospitals and other social services. But they say the Bush Adminstration would not be unhappy if the new policies put added strains on the Castro Government.
"Cuba is undergoing pressures that are more severe than at any time since Castro came to power," Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Interamerican Affairs, said in an interview. "One of the differences today is that the Cuban people don't believe the future is going to be better under Communism, and obviously that means many more are desperate to leave."
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey and chairman of the House subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs, said he had concluded from his discussions with Administration officials that the new immigration measures "are part of a wider review" of Cuba policy, an idea that Administration officials dispute.
"A pause in the issuance of visas," Mr. Torricelli said, "provides a chance to increase pressure on Castro and explore a change of policy that restricts his ability to export his dissenters and economic problems."
 
The Cuban-American Factor
 The Administration is moving quietly as it tightens immigration regulations because of fears it will put itself on a collision course with politically influential Cuban-Americans in Miami, which has traditionally objected to shutting the door on Cubans trying to flee the Communist Government. But many Cuban-Americans, viewing Mr. Castro as increasingly vulnerable to a possible internal revolt, are beginning to believe that a reduction of immigration might help build pressures on Havana.
Some officials note that Mr. Castro has lowered age restrictions for travel abroad, possibly to unload youthful dissidents on the United States, and they see this development as a "slow-motion Mariel."
While the more than 100,000 "boat people" whom Mr. Castro sent off to the shores of Florida in 1980 included a number of former political prisoners, many more were relatives of Cubans in the United States and included unemployed men, terminal cancer patients and common criminals.
To deprive the Castro Government of badly needed hard currency, the Administration plans to announce restrictions on the transfer of millions of dollars a year that Cuban-Americans send to relatives to help pay their visa fees. Cubans are required to pay up to $1,000 in United States currency to the Cuban Government to process their tourist visa applications. The new controls would require dollars transfered to Cuba to pass through agents licensed by the Treasury Department.
Officials believe that Mr. Castro, while unhappy with the restrictions, will be forced to go along, and that his Government could lose about $20 million a year once the moratorium on visas is lifted.
Officials said the consular office at the United States Interests Section in Havana is buried under a backlog of 28,000 applications for tourist visas, and will not consider new applications until the current number awaiting processing is significantly reduced.
Officials said some Cubans apply for tourist visas because they seek to circumvent the stiffer requirements to receive immigrant visas, about 2,000 of which are granted annually to people with relatives living in the United States. A visitor on an immigrant visa is eligible to apply for citizenship after residing in the country for a year. Administration officials said there were no plans to tighten regulations on immigrant visas or on political asylums, dozens of which have been granted over the last few years.
In recent weeks, the State Department has rejected about a third of the travel visa applications it considered, a rate three times greater than last year's average.
The shifts in Administration policy on tourist visas accompany growing efforts to persuade the Soviet Union to cut economic and military support to the Castro Government and otherwise control Cuba's interference in the affairs of other Latin American countries. Senior State Department officials said Mr. Bush told Mr. Gorbachev at the summit meeting that he would strengthen his campaign for increased Western economic support if he quickened the pace of reductions in Moscow's $4.5 billion in annual aid and subsidies to Cuba.
Mr. Gorbachev made no firm commitments. But Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnyk agreed to sign a joint statement with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d that specifically called on Cuba to help attain a cease-fire and peace settlement in El Salvador, where a right-wing Government battles Communist insurgents. Administration officials said the statement appeared to indicate a growing Soviet willingness to cooperate with Washington in curbing continuing Cuban military aid shipments to the guerrillas in El Salvador.

HEADLINE: BAKER, IN MOROCCO, PUSHES PEACE PLAN

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RABAT, Morocco, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d urged King Hassan II today to join as an observer at the Middle East peace conference that the United States is promoting and to use his influence on the Palestinians to bring them to the table.
Neither Mr. Baker nor King Hassan made any public statement after meeting for almost two hours. But a State Department official said the Secretary raised the possibility of Morocco's participating as an observer in the opening session of the peace conference. 
 Washington hopes that the formalities will be followed by separate negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, with the Palestinians sharing in a delegation with Jordan.
The Baker visit is also intended to pay tribute to King Hassan for his support for the American-led coalition during the Persian Gulf war. Of the other North African nations, only Egypt supported the effort, and King Hassan did so despite considerable opposition at home, sending a force of 1,300 men.
 
'Use His Influence'
 On the peace conference, the State Department official said Mr. Baker "suggested to the King that it would be useful to use his influence" with other parties. That was taken to mean the Palestinians, the last of the principals yet to agree to take part. There was no immediate answer from the King.
The leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasir Arafat, met recently with King Hassan, but the American official said the P.L.O. was not mentioned in today's talks.
King Hassan is also chairman of the Maghreb Union, formed in 1989 to foster greater cooperation among the North African countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania. As one of the longest-serving rulers in the Arab world, with 30 years on the Moroccan throne, he carries weight in Arab councils.
 
Pressure on the P.L.O.
 Mr. Baker's visit to Morocco, to be followed in the next two days by stops in Tunisia and Algeria, is viewed as part of an effort to gain the broadest possible Arab support for the peace process, which Washington hopes to launch in October with an international meeting co-sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union.
That in turn would increase the pressure on the P.L.O. and the Palestinians in general to agree to the conference, despite considerable restrictions on their representation demanded by Israel.
Two days ago, Israel told Mr. Baker that it was prepared to join the talks, but only if the Palestinian delegation excluded the P.L.O., residents of East Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees. Palestinian leaders have denounced the conditions, but Palestinian leaders who met with Mr. Baker in Jerusalem on Friday did not give a final answer.
That, it is generally agreed, must come from the P.L.O., which despite internal disarray remains the principal umbrella organization for all Palestinians. Mr. Baker said in Jordan yesterday that he expected several more weeks of negotiations on what has emerged as the most formidable hurdle toward the peace conference.
 
Terms of U.S. Plan
 Under the American plan, a broad public convocation with observers from the United Nations, the European Community and Arab lands will serve as the prologue to one-on-one negotiations between Israel and its neighbors.
Mr. Baker has argued that even with the restrictions demanded by Israel, the Palestinians must recognize that the peace process offers an opportunity to gain at least a measure of self-rule in the Israeli-occupied territories.

HEADLINE: M.B.A.'s Head for Eastern Europe to Build Capitalism From the Ground Up

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

 BODY:
Wanted: Recent business school graduates willing to forgo high pay for a year or two and risk culture shock to help a small Eastern European company make the shift from Communism to capitalism.
Forty-two young people with M.B.A. degrees responded to just such a challenge, and in July they completed four weeks of training at the University of North Carolina to prepare for assignments as management employees with companies in Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary. They are the first full class of the MBA Enterprise Corps, created by a group of 16 American business schools to help pave the way for Western businesses in newly democratized countries. 
 At the same time, the graduates are to provide small businesses in Eastern Europe with help they say they desperately need in basic business practices, privatization, employee incentives, joint ventures and modern manufacturing techniques.
"This was an opportunity to do something so different that I just couldn't pass it up," said Margaret Minichini, a 37-year-old graduate of the business school here. A former Federal Express employee who helped open that company's branches in the New York City area, she will be working for a newly chartered Czechoslovakian bank that is opening branches in the country's post offices.
 
Getting In on the Ground Floor
 "This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor in a newly developing region," she said. "No matter how this turns out, I will have had an experience that few others have had."
For others, that yearning for experience had more pragmatic roots. Jeffrey Silverberg, 27, a graduate of the J. S. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University, said that in countless job interviews "the big buzz word was globalization." But few corporate recruiters were willing to offer recent graduates an immediate shot at foreign assignments.
 
Teaching Flexibility
 "They all wanted people with foreign-language skills and knowledge of other cultures, but all they were willing to do is hire you for domestic jobs and say maybe in two or three years you might go overseas," said Mr. Silverberg, whose job will be working in small-business clinics being set up in Czechoslovakia.
While he does not discourage such pragmatism, Jack Behrman, director of the MBA Enterprise Corps and a professor at the Kenan-Flagler Business School here, cautioned that none of them could be exactly certain what they would face when they took on their new jobs. But he added that the program would teach them flexibility, how to adapt to changing goals and how to cope with different cultures.
The corps is financed by the United States Agency for International Development, the business schools, and several foundations and American corporations. Corps members have pledged a year to the program; once finished, they will receive a stipend from the group of business schools until they find new jobs.
The idea grew from challenges issued last year by H. Ross Perot, the Texas businessman, and David Gergen, the former White House communications director. They urged M.B.A.'s to help open new paths for American business in Eastern and Central Europe.
 
Not Like Going to Paris
 As a former assistant secretary of commerce under President John F. Kennedy, Mr. Behrman helped in 1963 to establish the International Executive Service Corps, a program that provides foreign companies with short-term assistance from retired American business executives. But the idea of the MBA Enterprise Corps is to integrate the young business graduates into the companies themselves.
All have had intensive language training in the last four weeks and will receive more once they reach their assignments. Their salaries will be comparable to those of other managers in their companies, $150 to $300 a month, and they will be paid by the companies, not the program. Each company will provide them with housing similar to that of average Poles, Czechs or Hungarians, not the luxury hotels enjoyed by many American executives assigned to those countries.
Ann Kalin and her husband, Jack Lynch, will be taking the skills they learned at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania to Cracow Business Services in Poland. "This is not going to be like going to Paris for a year," she said. Sheila Baldwin, 28, a mechanical engineer with an M.B.A. from the Darden School at the University of Virginia, will be assigned to a steel mill in Cracow with 26,000 employees and 40-year-old technology. But she said dealing with the technology might be easier than figuring out how to get the male-dominated factory culture to accept a woman. "It's going to take time," she said with a sigh.

HEADLINE: Bush and Advisers Lay Groundwork for '92 Race

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
President Bush gathered his core group of political advisers at Camp David today, telling them it was his intention to run for re-election in 1992 and laying the groundwork to begin raising money this fall for a campaign.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, and others who attended said Mr. Bush did not make any specific decisions about a campaign organization at the meeting, which involved three hours of discussions and a lunch at the President's Maryland retreat. 
 But it was attended by about 25 people who are expected to play major roles in the 1992 campaign, including Vice President Dan Quayle, whom Mr. Bush reaffirmed as his intended running mate, the President's polltaker, his campaign advertising consultant, press aides and close friends.
The meeting clearly marked an important step in the carefully paced preparations that Mr. Bush has undertaken this year to prepare for his re-election bid.
It also was held as the President got a taste of a probable Democratic strategy for 1992. Returning home Thursday night from diplomatically successful trips to London, Greece, Turkey and Moscow over the past month, Mr. Bush was confronted by Democratic assertions that he had not been paying enough attention to domestic affairs and by some emerging concern in Republican ranks that he has not yet focused enough on the 1992 campaign.
 
Voter Concern With Domestic Issues
 The meeting today was an effort to deal with both problems, said Administration officials and outside advisers to the White House who attended the session in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland and later discussed on condition of anonymity. At the session, they said, Robert Teeter, Mr. Bush's polltaker, reviewed the results of recent polls showing that domestic issues are starting to command more of voters' attention than foreign affairs.
Opening the meeting, Mr. Bush said, as he did on Friday during a Rose Garden news conference, that he was not yet prepared to make a formal announcement of candidacy. But he was more direct in making his intentions clear than he had been on Friday.
One adviser said: "He put it this way: 'I'm not going to try to keep any suspense on this. It's not natural to try to create the impression that I'm undecided. I do intend to run, and the only thing that would prevent me is if there were health problems, and there aren't.' "
Some of those who attended said a consensus emerged that even if a formal campaign does not begin until next year, a fund-raising committee should start its work in the fall.
 
Need to Counter Democrats
 "Most of us thought there was no need to get started any earlier than absolutely necessary, but most of us thought you needed to get the fund-raising group together as soon as possible," one adviser said. "There are requirements for matching funds, but it's also important simply to get going on the money side."
From the point of view of political strategy and organization, another adviser said: "Anything started this year should be very modest in nature, because there really isn't that much you could accomplish and there's no point in getting out there when there are no serious opposition candidates. Most people who were there felt that way, including the President."
In a written statement issued by the White House, Mr. Fitzwater said the President and his advisers "discussed general issues related to a Presidential campaign in 1992." The statement went on, "Although the President made no specific decisions, it was understood that political organizing and financing will begin this fall."
One of those who attended the meeting said that among the issues discussed was the need to counter recent Democratic efforts to paint Mr. Bush as a globe-trotting President who pays little attention to domestic affairs. "He wanted us to understand that we can't take anything for granted and that there is going to be a meaningful campaign," the adviser said.
Another said: "Bob Teeter gave a report on polls he's been doing, and the key finding was that people are focusing a lot more on domestic priorities and economic priorities. He had one poll that showed 51 percent thought the country is on the wrong track."
 
Who Was There
 He said the group discussed "in a general way" how to show Mr. Bush as a President who is concerned about domestic issues as well as foreign policy. "The point has to be made that Bush is spending a great deal of time on domestic and economic issues," he said. "It's just that the things you do in those areas aren't quite as visible or reportable. When you go to Moscow to sign a treaty, that's a major world event. When you have a meeting with domestic advisers, who pays attention?"
Despite his recent political problems, John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, appeared to be fully involved in campaign planning although he did not try to dominate the discussion, those who attended said.
Besides Mr. Teeter, among those at the meeting were Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and Fred Malek, a longtime friend and political aide of Mr. Bush. The three are often mentioned as the most likely group to run a Bush re-election campaign.
Roger Ailes, the New York media consultant who crafted Mr. Bush's 1988 advertising strategy, and Nicholas F. Brady, the Treasury Secretary and one of Mr. Bush's oldest friends, attended the Camp David session. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, perhaps the President's primary political adviser, was out of the country on a diplomatic mission to the Middle East.
In addition to Mr. Sununu and Mr. Fitzwater, White House officials who attended the meeting included Richard G. Darman, the budget director; Sig Rogich, who oversees the scheduling and production of Mr. Bush's public appearances; Ron Kaufman, the White House political director, and Andrew Card, an aide to Mr. Sununu.
Jeannie Austin, the co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, and Mary Matalin, the party's chief of staff, attended, as did Sheila Tate, Mr. Bush's campaign spokeswoman in 1988, and three White House political advisers: Craig Fuller, who was chief of staff to Mr. Bush as Vice President, Charlie Black and James Lake.

HEADLINE: Down From The Summit;
On the World Stage, Moscow Now Plays Second Banana

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan

 BODY:
SITTING side by side last week to announce that they would jointly try to convene a Middle East peace conference in October, Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev made for a heartening sight. To all appearances, the great superpowers were laying aside their swords and propaganda mills to join hands and try to bring peace to one of the most stubbornly volatile parts of the world. "Partnership" was the new buzz word of great-power relations.
Yet when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d took his new mandate back to the Israelis and Arabs, only one superpower was really in play. The other -- for all the MIG's, Scuds and Kalashnikovs still littering the region -- was nowhere to be seen. 
 That inconsistency seemed to capture the new reality of global politics that was already evident in the gulf war, and that peeked throughthe glittering choreography of the Moscow summit. Broke and groping for a new foundation, shorn of its mystique as champion of a new order, the Soviet Union no longer can serve as armorer and ally to third-world rebels and troublemakers or as the global foil to American might. Nor is it really the full-fledged new partner in peace that the Moscow summit portrayed. The renewed search for a Middle East peace is essentially an American show, and Moscow's role is basically to provide a veneer of universal solidarity.
The development is not without irony, since the international conference that Mr. Baker has been shuttling about to convene as a means of bringing Israel face to face with its Arab neighbors is something Moscow has demanded for years. In the old days, before Mr. Gorbachev, the call for a peace conference cosponsored by the two superpowers represented Moscow's perennial quest for a recognized and formal acceptance as an equal to Washington in shaping the world. For those very reasons, the United States did its best to prevent the conference.
With the waning of Soviet powers, however, Washington suddenly decided that such a conference was really not such a bad idea after all. The advantages could be substantial: The Soviet Union could complete the international shell under which the Israelis and Arabs could square off one-to-one to sort out their quarrels, and Moscow could thus publicly demonstrate to its former clients, most notably Syria, that there really is no place left to run. If the United States could get Moscow to sit by its side, the Arabs might come to believe that defying Washington is no longer a practical option. And the disadvantages of teaming up with Moscow have become marginal; there is little chance that Moscow will soon rear up as a major contender again.
Some Soviet officials did squirm at the walk-on role. During the gulf war, many a general or die-hard Communist chafed at the spectacle of a lucrative former arms client getting pulverized by high-tech Western weapons -- with Moscow's endorsement. And when Mr. Gorbachev traveled to London to seek aid from the seven major industrialized nations last month, unreconstructed cold warriors grumbled at the notion of holding the hat out to the ideological foe.
Now, on the Middle East, some Soviet officials privately complained about Western commentaries that implied that Moscow is being treated more as a superpuppet than as a superpower. The "palisade of missiles," as Yuri Andropov once called it, is still there, they noted darkly.
It is, of course. And if superpower status is measured by throw-weight, by potential or by sheer size, the Soviet Union qualifies in anybody's book. But it is equally obvious that without resorting to raw nuclear blackmail, Moscow no longer can muster real clout. A last-minute effort to broker peace with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq in February did nothing but irritate the Western allies, and in the current initiative the choice really has been to accept the proferred role or simply get bypassed.
The new shape of the American-Soviet relationship was hard to miss even in the carefully staged visit by Mr. Bush to Moscow, and "partnership" was not the word that came automatically to mind. Mr. Bush's public lecture to the Soviets about what they are doing right and what they are doing wrong -- the list of missteps included retention of islands disputed by Japan, continuing support for Fidel Castro and a still-sizable level of military spending -- reflected a presumption in Washington and the West that the democracies have a duty and a right to tutor Moscow in the etiquette and organization of their world.
The relationship is not all one-sided. To Mr. Gorbachev, beleaguered from all sides, a ceremonial role in the Middle East peace process provides at least a semblance of the international glamour that forms his strongest claim to remain the paramount chief of his restless and assertive republics.
The Middle East peace process in particular offers Moscow a mechanism to extricate itself with some honor from past relationships. Unlike the war with Iraq, in which the Soviet Union left a former client to the mercies of Western smart bombs, in the Arab-Israeli dispute Moscow can perhaps be seen to be guiding former proteges toward the general peace that all sides say they want.
To anyone who remembers the Soviet Union when its reach extended from Nicaragua to Afghanistan, from Vietnam to Angola, however, the veneer of new partnership is rather transparent. Certainly there was a major measure of courage and "new thinking" in Mr. Gorbachev's willingness to pull back. But it is also obvious that Moscow's ideological and economic bankruptcy have left it with few other serious choices -- that to stand any chance of emerging from the quagmire into which it had sunk, it had no alternative but to abandon the roles of super-threat and super-pest.
At the London summit, as in Moscow, Western leaders seemed prepared to accept that Moscow really had embarked on a new road. But the insistence that Moscow has yet to embrace real economic and political reform, the reserve on pumping new credits into Moscow, the offer of only associate membership in the International Monetary Fund, the patronizing profusion of lectures and advice -- all contribute to the conclusion that the Soviet Union is still on probation.
The West seems prepared to support Mr. Gorbachev, to give him an honored seat in their councils, to dismantle the accumulated baggage of the cold war, to pay homage to the great potential of the Soviet Union, but it is not ready by a long shot to welcome its President as a full member of their club.
Now and then during Mr. Bush's visit, Soviet officials let their pique show. If the cold war is over, why do the Americans still restrict high-tech imports to the Soviet Union? If the Americans are prepared to make deep cuts in strategic missiles, the backbone of the Soviet nuclear deterrent, why is there not similar readiness to curb Star Wars, that child of the Reaganite right? If Mr. Bush deems it possible after 40 years to grant the Soviet Union a favored trading status already bestowed on all but the most naughty of countries, where are the credits and trade that the West dangled as a carrot throughout the cold war?
And yet, even as the powers explore and test the new order taking shape in the aftermath of the cold war, even as Moscow chafes and Mr. Baker uses his new leverage in the Middle East, there is something indisputably heartening in the memory of the two Presidents bantering on stage.
These are still two powers that could destroy each other and much of the world in a matter of minutes, that until a short while ago stood toe to toe in every global hot spot. However unequal, they are both still superpowers, masters of vast expanses of land, awesome resources and formidable arsenals.
Yet at this summit they no longer needed to talk of managing their rivalry, but about how to rescue the Soviet economy and how to defuse conflicts they had so recently helped to sustain. This meeting, at this time, seems to have been almost boringly routine. And if they have managed to disengage, then perhaps even the Middle East is not hopeless.

HEADLINE: Senate Backs $291 Billion Pentagon Budget Bill

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Adapting only slightly to improved United States-Soviet relations, the Senate voted late Friday for a $291 billion military budget bill for the next fiscal year that continues to increase the nation's strategic weaponry.
Under the Senate bill, which passed by a voice vote, the Pentagon would heavily invest in radar-evading technology, buying more F-117 Stealth fighters and B-2 Stealth bombers. The United States would also begin deploying for the first time a ground-base defense against limited nuclear missile attacks, which arms control advocates fear could jeopardize the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, and reignite the nuclear arms race. 
 In three days of votes before the Congressional summer recess, the Senate also overturned a 43-year-old law that bans women from flying combat missions, and defeated an amendment to allow abortions at American military hospitals overseas. Reflecting pressure from constituents, lawmakers trimmed only one-third the number of reservists that the Pentagon had sought to cut.
The Senate bill is closely aligned with Bush Administration's military priorities for the next fiscal year, beginning Oct. 1. But the Senate bill is sharply different from the version approved by the House of Representatives in May. The House cut the budget for the Stealth bomber and the Star Wars antimissile program, and opted to continue production of many existing conventional planes, tanks and helicopters the Pentagon does not want.
Lawmakers from both chambers will meet in September to try to reach a compromise. The budget level itself is not an issue this year. Congress and the Administration agreed last year to budget ceilings for 1992 and 1993. The fiscal 1992 budget represents a 1 percent decline, after inflation is considered, from last year's budget.
 
Veto Threat From Bush
 The White House will be closely watching the deliberations in Congress and lobbying hard. President Bush has threatened to veto the entire budget bill if Congress follows the House lead to cut $1.7 billion from Star Wars and halt production of the B-2 at the 15 planes Congress has already ordered.
The Senate agreed to support the Administration's request to buy four more B-2's, and approved $4.6 billion for Star Wars. The Administration wanted $5.2 billion for the antimissile system.
Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, said this week that the bill "continues the process of reducing and restructuring our military establishment in an orderly process."
Critics of military spending, however, argued that the Senate vote was out of step with budget realities and improving East-West relations symbolized by the signing this week in Moscow of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
"The Senate actions are imprudent, wasteful and inconsistent with the new Soviet-U.S. relationship," a coalition of five lobbying groups on arms control said in a letter sent to senators."
The coalition was made up of the Council for a Livable World, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament, the 20-20 Vision National Project and the Professionals' Coalition for Nuclear Arms Control.
The President has also threatened to veto the bill if lawmakers overturn a three-year old Pentagon ban on virtually all abortions at American military hospitals overseas. The House voted to lift the ban in May.
At issue is whether American military personnel and their dependents stationed abroad should be given access to safe and affordable abortions. No public financing would be involved; patients would pay for the procedure.
But in a procedural vote on Friday, supporters of the amendment led by Senator Tim Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, fell 2 votes short of the 60 needed to cut off debate and permit a vote on the issue.

HEADLINE: Drought Taking Its Toll on California Environment

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 3

 BODY:
The California economy has proved remarkably resistant to five years of drought, but the state's slow and short-sighted response may have inflicted irreversible damage on the environment.
That is a central conclusion of a broad study, made public on Thursday, of the economic and environmental effects of the severe drought that has gripped the West. The study was conducted by the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment and Security, a nonpartisan research organization based in Berkeley, and was requested by the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, which held a hearing on the subject Thursday in Washington. 
 The authors charged that state leaders had been unwilling to recognize that the drought might persist for several years and had continued to support wasteful uses of water by drawing reservoirs down to dangerously low levels for the first four years of the drought. From this, the report drew a pessimistic lesson about how the region might respond to the possibility of permanent climate change. "The experience of the drought suggests that California will not address climatic changes with specific policies until long after the impacts are being felt."
 
Damage to Ecosystems
 The report found that while the effects varied, farming and ranching had survived well by switching crops, pumping more water from under the ground and making more efficient use of irrigation water. Strong demand for California products meant that gross agricultural receipts reached a record high last year, although not so high as they might have been with more precipitation. But the study predicted that the longer-term costs to agriculture could be far higher if the drought persists another year.
The state's fragile natural ecosystems, many already weakened by human activities, have fared much worse, according to the study, which was financed by the Environmental Protection Agency. While other factors contributed, the study cited these direct effects of the drought:
*The winter-run chinook salmon, already listed as a threatened species, is facing extinction because of low river flows. And the catch of coho and chinook salmon off the coast has plummeted, to 4.4 million pounds in 1990, a 70 percent drop in two years.
*The number of striped bass in the Sacramento Delta and in San Francisco Bay has dropped steadily since 1987.
*The herring fishery in Tomales Bay, north of San Francisco, has been destroyed because the reduced flow of fresh water has made the bay too salty; the fish may never recover.
*The decline in the number of water fowl has been quickened as wetland habitats shrink and deteriorate.
*Large patches of trees in the Sierra Nevada have died from lack of water and pest infestation.
In addition, the report said the drought posed added danger to numerous endangered and threatened animal and plant species, including bald eagles, the giant garter snake, 9 types of butterflies and 10 herbs.
 
Hydroelectric Power Loss
 Peter H. Gleick and Linda Nash, who wrote the report, said a a chief economic cost was the massive loss of hydroelectric power. In normal years such power accounts for 20 percent of the state's total electric supply, but it dropped to 12 percent last year. This meant that utilities had to replace it by burning fossil fuels, at an additional cost of $2.4 billion and increased air pollution.
While the overall economy appeared to be resilient to drought, the report said certain industries showed large losses, including skiing, boating and tourism.
The authors said the drought had a positive effect of forcing California to re-examine its water policies, but they found the short-term resiliency of the economy to be deceptive. Up to now, they said, well water and reservoir storage have been used as a buffer against more severe impacts, but those supplies would eventually be depleted if the drought persisted.

HEADLINE: The Region;
How Long Can New York Redistribute Wealth Before the Wealthy Leave?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
IN New York's City Hall last year, iconologists recorded a subtle shift by Mayor David N. Dinkins. The portrait of former Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, a demigod of progressive urban policy, had been moved from Mr. Dinkins's inner office to a secondary place of honor, opposite a men's room. The picture of La Guardia, a Republican, was replaced with a photograph of Paul Robeson, a private champion of social justice and a socialist.
Last week, that shift seemed to have taken on new meaning. From behind his desk, Mr. Dinkins delivered a televised address in which he publicly questioned some of his fundamental assumptions about the government he inherited 19 months ago. He lamented that sharp declines in Federal assistance threaten to relegate the legacy of La Guardia and the New Deal to "a sad remembrance of the past." But he has begun to question just how to pay for some of the programs that they -- and he -- advocated and advanced. 
 Even before the public was invited to troop through his office tomorrow to register its constructive criticisms, Mr. Dinkins had gotten one message: that his government may have gone as far as it can go as a vehicle to redistribute wealth. New York is a city where the growing gap between rich and poor has precipitated a class struggle that elected officials merely referee.
"We let the battle over redistribution be fought out between those who are concerned with taxes and those who are concerned with services, and the politicians withdrew," said Edward V. Regan, the state Comptroller. Yet if New York is still viewed as among the last of the one-party social democratic governments, it is hardly alone in grappling with deficits.
In Connecticut, which boasts the nation's highest per capita income and the largest city trying to file for bankruptcy, a budget stalemate entered its second month because legislators were resisting Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s demand to impose an income tax that would be more progressive than the existing sales tax.
In New Jersey, a tax revolt terrified state legislators and forced Gov. Jim Florio to modify an education aid formula that would have sent more money from wealthier suburban districts to poorer urban school systems.
In New York State, similar attempts have been thwarted by suburban and upstate legislators. And two weeks ago, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo cautioned Mr. Dinkins not to count on Albany, which had earlier assumed New York City's financial liabilities for the courts, the City University and some long-term Medicaid care, to bail it out by taking over the roughly $2 billion the city pays in Medicaid -- a burden that few other states impose on municipalities. As a result of an array of rules and formulas, the city government exercises complete discretion over only between a quarter and a half of its nearly $29 billion budget.
"It's not only a New York problem," says Edward L. Sadowsky, a former city councilman from Queens who headed a city commission on tax policy. "State and local governments all over the country are beginning to bleed."
The hemorrhaging was hastened by the Reagan Administration's "new federalism," which shifted traditional national obligations to states and localities. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan reported last month that in 1990, each New Yorker paid an average of $1,178 more in Federal taxes than came back to New York in Federal outlays.
New York City's political configuration as a conglomerate of five counties and its historic charity -- few other municipalities provide so extensive a public hospital system or housing program, for example -- render it a paradigm either of profligacy or of responsibility to its neediest citizens, depending on whether the beholder is giving or receiving.
"It's not even the middle class subsidizing the poor any more," Mr. Sadowsky said. "It's the poor paying for the poorest: a nurse in a city hospital and her husband, a clerk with the Transit Authority. They're making $60,000 and they're the ones subsidizing the welfare rolls. You can't go on doing that. We cannot do everything."
In an unpublished manuscript titled "New York City Politics and Policy," Raymond D. Horton and Charles Brecher, president and research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, respectively, found that the proportion of the city budget allocated for things that redistribute wealth -- public assistance, health, social services and housing -- peaked in the late 1960's, but still accounts for nearly a third of the budget. Even so, the welfare grant is often insufficient to raise a family's income to the federally defined poverty level.
"The perception that New York City taxes its residents excessively," Mr. Sadowsky's commission reported, "derives in good measure from the fact that a significant portion of the taxpayer's dollar is spent on income transference from those who are better off to those in need, rather than for the delivery of such services as paved roads, clean streets and police protection, services that taxpayers have traditionally expected from municipalities."
The Mayor's speech represented "a 180-degree change," Mr. Sadowsky said. But Mr. Dinkins's view may not be much better in this direction. His promise of "reform and renaissance" was a political decision driven by economic realities.
The Mayor had been resistant, though, for political reasons and for philosophical ones. An experimental program to contain soaring Medicaid costs faced opposition because patients would no longer be allowed to choose their own doctors, and there was no guarantee that care would improve. Even cutting the city payroll has had a social dimension. After proposing that some services might be provided more cheaply by private contractors, Mr. Dinkins cautioned: "We will approach these choices understanding that the bottom line of government cannot be considered successful if it only leads to a longer unemployment line."
"The payroll has always been part of a redistribution system," said Richard C. Wade, an urban history professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center. "It was a way of taking care of people coming up. The city didn't want a large number of unemployed, so it bought off some social tension down the road. But it has just become too expensive."
White Resentment
Moreover, the rising proportion of city employees who are black and Hispanic has further infused the redistributive equation with a racial component that does not necessarily inspire the charitable instincts of the city's dwindling white middle class -- a group that Mr. Horton and Mr. Brecher found has usually been disadvantaged by New York's taxing and spending policies. Which is the reason, said Representative Major R. Owens, a Brooklyn Democrat, that the platform of his emerging Majority Coalition of New York promotes "policies that create a new middle class" -- in part by providing services financed by higher taxes on, among other things, incomes over $125,000.
Will there be enough wealthy people left to pay those taxes within the limits of a city defined 93 years ago by arbitrary geographic boundaries and confined by its inability to raise any tax without state approval except the one on property?
That New York City can only do so much by itself is one reality that the sagging economy is once again forcing it to confront -- just as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal that the Communist Party sever its philosophical lifeline to Marx and Engels is a reflection of economic realities in that country. During Mr. Dinkins's speech last week, the Mayor's eyes never darted to the picture of Paul Robeson. Instead, he quoted Walt Whitman: "New York gives the directest proof yet of successful democracy." The problem may be, though, that when the real-estate market recovers, more of the people who pay taxes to support the poor may vote with their feet.

It Isn't Graceful, but the Laws Get on the Books

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE 102d Congress, like its predecessors, is hardly ever elegant in doing its business. It oversimplifies issues, works irregular hours, plays cheap politics and worships archaic rules that multiply its inefficiency.
And yet it legislates. Incompletely, so far, with action completed into law in only a handful of important instances, but far more seriously on subjects from abortion to energy to health care costs to the future of the military than its ways of doing business suggest. 
 Any look at a new Congress as it breaks for the summer vacation of its first year is inherently a view of no more than the late beginnings of a legislative effort, and so the small-mindedness stands out clearly against a small total of achievements.
But even so there is one profound exception to the petty air that surrounds so much congressional business: the decision to authorize President Bush to go to war in the Persian Gulf. A serious issue, seriously argued, with hardly an attack on personal motives in three long days of speeches. Representative Robert H. Michel, the House Republican leader, thinks it was the most important moment of his 35 years in the House. Speaker Thomas S. Foley feels that the way the Congress approached the issue meant "the country as a whole had a strong and correct sense that there was a government that had gone through a process of decision and then stood by the decision."
The only other big decisions the Congress has finished with have been to grant the Administration more time for "fast track" trade negotiations and to spend $5.8 billion on extended unemployment compensation -- an action completed on Capitol Hill Friday and likely to be thwarted from Kennebunkport in a few days.
Squeezed by the self-imposed discipline of last fall's budget act, the appropriations process has moved ahead faster than usual. As Mr. Michel observed, last year's deal "really is a restraining mechanism on spending." Even so, the goal of passing all the appropriations bills by the beginning of the fiscal year in October is likely to be missed because of Bush vetoes over abortion.
But Congress does find a way to make a spectacle of itself. Filibusters, or threats of filibusters, keep the Senate from taking up some bills and the badly outnumbered House Republicans use meaningless roll-calls as their stock in trade to get the Democrats' attention and slow down the majority.
Those stunts are at least quasi-legislative; they keep things the minorities consider evil from happening, or at least make the majority change them a bit. But then there is Jesse Helms. He got the Senate to pass a bill mandating 10-year prison terms for surgeons with AIDS who operate without warning their patients. No hearings had been held, and the Senate action was "devoid of any careful study," as the majority leader, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, put it.
Mr. Helms does this from time to time, choosing some emotional issue from the news and forcing each Senator to make public his position on it, to take a controversial stand on a proposition that has no chance of becoming law, or on which everyone agrees to begin with. There has been, as Mr. Mitchell says, "an erosion of comity and restraint on such matters." And that is one reason the Senate is a cranky body.
A Helms amendment, even if it never becomes law, can always become a television commercial. A fair amount of congressional worry is devoted to fear of an electorate manipulated by television. When the Senate decided to raise its pay and eliminate speaking fees, it did so suddenly and quietly; otherwise the effort would probably have been thwarted by talk-show hosts.
Legislating with an eye toward commercials is not a uniquely Senatorial prerogative. The House of which Mr. Foley and Mr. Michel are so proud for its January debate on the war went to the other extreme on the civil rights bill in June. Hardly anybody took the floor to say what the problem was and why one approach was better than another. Instead the other side's motives were almost the only issue. Consider this typical exchange:
A Republican from Louisiana rose to say "The last thing our country needs is for us to divide ourselves along racial and ethnic lines. Like it or not, the so-called civil rights bill will do just that -- divide us -- because it is a quota bill." Then a Democrat from New Mexico went to the microphone in front of the ornate Speaker's Desk to proclaim: "This is not a debate on civil rights or job discrimination or capping punitive damages for sexual harassment. This is Presidential politics 1992," he said. "The White House has polled and found by using the word 'quotas,' they pick up votes."
Thus far the Senate discussion has been more restrained and more to the point of what is actually in various bills. But that may not stay true when the bill comes to the floor, and after Senate nerves have been scraped by the debate over Clarence Thomas.
 
Sets of Frustrations
 Congress gets this way because of various sets of frustrations. House Republicans see themselves as a permanent minority, able to stop things but very rarely to cause them. Some Democrats are frustrated because money and other obstacles prevent them from attacking the problems they care about, robbing them, as Mr. Foley put it, of the "psychic income from the job."
And then, when some wanted to follow Mr. Foley and solve one of those problems by rebuilding roads and bridges, paying for it with a nickel-a-gallon gasoline tax, others revolted this week and killed it. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, defended his restive colleagues, saying "Democrats are merely reflecting the frustration of the vast majority of American citizens about the fact that they are very highly taxed."
Washington finds it easy to judge a Congress by the faults to be found in its leaders. By those yardsticks, Mr. Foley and Mr. Michel are sometimes faulted as too reasonable; Mr. Gephardt and Bob Dole, the Republican Senate leader, as too partisan.
But as lawmakers are elected more and more on their own and owe less to parties at home and in Congress, and feel less obligation to chairmen and speakers, they look out for themselves, ducking issues they feel offer the slightest risk to re-election, arguing others in ways that make good TV spots but cheapen the process. Perhaps it is time to be concerned less with Congressional leadership, and more with followership.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "HOW FAR THEY GOT BEFORE THE SUMMER BREAK"
Actions taken by Congress on major pieces of legislation before going on vacation.
 
Gulf War
On Jan. 12, the Congress authorized President Bush to use military force to expel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. The vote was 52 to 47 in the Senate and a more comfortable 250 to 183 in the House. Congress provided $42.6 billion to cover the costs of the war. The bill also included pay increases, educational grants and better health care for all veterans.
 
Unemployment benefits
Both Houses passed a $5.8 billion bill granting up to 20 more weeks of benefits to people who have been out of work for more than half a year. The President has threatened to block the benefits, arguing that the recession is ending.
 
Trade negotiations
The Administration's "fast-track" authority to make trade agreements was renewed so a proposed free-trade agreement with Mexico and a 108-nation pact to lower international restrictions could be negotiated.
 
Trade with China
Both the House and Senate passed bills putting conditions on renewal of most-favored-nation trade status for China: an end to some arms sales, the release of political prisoners, and a halt in exports to the United States of goods made by prisoners. The White House promised a veto.
 
Abortion counseling
Both Houses voted to allow abortion counseling in Federally financed family clinics. The Senate approved contradictory amendments about whether parents should be notified. President Bush has promised to veto easing abortion restrictions.
 
Military
The House passed a $291 billion military budget that holds production of the B-2 Stealth bomber to the 15 on order and makes deep cuts in the Star Wars anti-missile system. A Senate version pays for four more bombers and makes fewer Star Wars cuts; the two will go to conference. The Administration has threatened to veto the entire military budget if the B-2 or Star Wars is cut too deeply. Both bills allow women to fly combat missions.
 
Pay raise
By a 53-45 vote in an evening session, the Senate granted itself a $23,200 raise to $125,100 and banned the acceptance of speaking fees. The measure limits a senator's earned outside income to 15 percent of salary. The House approved the action.
 
 
Civil rights
The House made it easier for victims of job discrimination to sue. President Bush threatened a veto, calling it a "quota bill," and rejected efforts by moderate Republican senators to broker a compromise.
 
Crime
The Senate approved a bill making more Federal crimes punishable by death, limiting Federal court review of inmates' petitions, easing the admissibility of evidence and establishing a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases. The House passed a separate bill with a seven-day waiting period. A proposal by House Democratic leaders includes more money for beat-walking police, for states with lots of drug-related crime and for prison drug treatment. The White House favors the Senate bill.
 
Transportation
The Senate passed a $123 billion bill to repair roads and bridges and improve mass transit. It give states and localities more leeway in spending the money. The House Public Works Committee has approved a similar bill that offers $153.5 billion, but requires a 5-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase. The Administration has threatened to veto any increased gas taxes.
 
Campaign finance
The Senate passed a bill offering incentives like cheap television time to candidates who agree to spending limits. It would also outlaw contributions by political action committees to Congressional candidates.
 
Banking overhaul
The House Banking Committee approved a bill echoing the Bush Administration's plan: letting industrial companies own banks, allowing mergers of investment and commercial banks, dropping barriers to interstate banking. The Senate Banking Committee passed a variant that forces banks to serve lower-income customers and would not let industries own banks.
 
Energy
The Senate Energy Committee has approved an energy blueprint allowing drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, removing obstacles to nuclear power plants, deregulating natural gas pipelines, and repealing a law that limits who can enter the wholesale electric generation market. The Administration opposes plans to require better gas mileage on cars and may veto any bill without the Arctic drilling provision. House committees are still considering energy legislation.

Price of Gas Can Fall, But Taxes Defy Gravity

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
MISSED about as much as a headache that has quietly slipped away, the pain has gone out of gasoline prices lately, and adjusted for inflation, pre-tax prices in recent years have hovered around post-World War II lows. Almost unnoticed, however, something else has been creeping up: gasoline taxes.
The Federal Government raised its take a nickel a gallon last fall, and Arkansas, Idaho, Hawaii, Maine, New York and Rhode Island, among others, have followed suit. Last week, the House Ways and Means Committee approved a proposal for yet another five-cent increase, but Democratic leaders withdrew the measure, at least for now, as Congressional support for it began to crumble. 
 All of this has been camouflaged in part by the fall in oil prices since the height of the Kuwait panic last year. The American Automobile Association reported last week that the average price of a gallon of unleaded regular was $1.132, down 4 cents since early June and down about 25 cents from a year ago. At today's price, a gallon of gasoline made from oil imported from Saudi Arabiacosts less than a gallon of bottled water shipped from France.
It also makes gasoline cheap by historical standards, according to Daniel Yergin, a historian of the oil industry who in a recent study calculated prices since World War II in 1991 dollars. In 1947, the price at the pump read 23 cents, but adjusted for inflation that was worth $1.49. In 1972, the year before the beginning of the Arab oil embargo, the sign on the pump said 36 cents, which would be $1.22 today. The peak was in 1981, when the price was $2.04 in 1991 dollars.
But if the price is low by historical standards, the taxes are not. The American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade association, said earlier this month that taxes now average 32.4 cents a gallon, more than twice as much as a decade ago. On top of the Federal tax of 14.1 cents per gallon come state taxes ranging from 9 cents in Wyoming to 26 cents in Rhode Island. Mr. Yergin, who weighted the average tax by the volume of gasoline sold in each state, put the average figure at 36 cents.
 
'A Money Grab'
 This is not a record in inflation-adjusted terms; that came in the early 1960's, when taxes were nominally a dime -- nearly 50 cents in today's money. But today's taxes are near a record in a different way, as a percentage of the pump price -- currently about 32 percent, up from 9.5 percent 10 years ago. This would not impress motorists in the rest of the industrialized world, where taxes are two to eight times those in the United States. But it impresses some Americans.
"It's a money grab," said William Berman, the American Automobile Association's chief policy analyst in Washington. "For those states that have dedicated fuel taxes for highways and transportation, that's good news, because we need infrastructure improvement," he said. "But many of these states no longer have that."
Mr. Berman called it the "Willie Sutton source of revenue," referring to the notorious hold-up man who is reported to have said, when asked why he robbed banks, "because that's where the money is."
The budget pressures that led to the last increase will only get stronger in future years, said Catherine G. Schultz, a lobbyist with a Washington law firm who specializes in energy. She said that might lead to tax hikes of up to 50 cents in the next 10 years. "They'll never do it all at once," said Ms. Schultz. "They'll do a nickel here, a dime there, like they did with cigarette taxes."
The states are also likely to come back to the trough. Gasoline demand is stagnating, Mr. Berman of the A.A.A. pointed out, with sales down about 2 percent over the last year, mostly as a result of increases in fuel efficiency. "A lot of the state revenue people are watching that with alarm," he said. To get more revenue from gasoline when sales are declining requires raising the tax.
"We don't have to worry about Saddam Hussein starting a war," he said. "Most of our price increases from now on are going to come from politicians."
For the states, that is traditional, said Ed Rothschild, an energy expert at Citizen Action, a Washington-based non-profit activist group. But for the Federal Government, it is new. Citizen Action has mixed feelings on tax increases, he said; on the one hand the Government could use the money to improve mass transit and develop alternative fuels, but on the other hand, outside the big cities with public transit systems, a gas tax is a tax on the poor, he said.
 
Whither Energy Policy?
 But the increases are still too small to make much of a difference in America's driving habits, say experts. Thomas C. Jorling, the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation in New York, said, "To get meaningful decreases in vehicle miles traveled, you have to have 50 cents or more price increases." That, he said, would be a tax levied as part of an energy policy, instead of simply a device to raise revenue.
Such a policy might make sense as oil imports hover near 50 percent of consumption, with two-thirds of the oil going into the transportation sector. But it might also be difficult to implement, with opponents arguing that gasoline taxes burden the poor, who spend a higher percentage of their income on gasoline than the rich do. And anything that reduces the amount that motorists have to spend on new cars is harmful to Detroit, said David L. Lewis, a University of Michigan Business School professor who specializes in the auto industry.
"Right now, nobody wants to administer or receive the medicine," he said.

HEADLINE: The Perils of CAFE

 BODY:
A good way to clean the air is to burn less gasoline. And the best way to do that is to raise gasoline prices. But Congress doesn't have the stomach to levy substantially higher gas taxes so it has imposed regulations -- known as CAFE standards -- that have forced automobile manufacturers to raise fuel efficiency on new cars to 27.5 miles per gallon.
CAFE standards are better than nothing. But they have achieved only modest savings in fuel use and have created a slew of knotty problems. Yet bills before Congress propose sharply raising the required fuel efficiency, and in a way that threatens to make this second-best policy even worse. 
 Rather than setting, as under current law, the same miles-per-gallon standard for every manufacturer, Senator Richard Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, proposes that by 2001 each manufacturer raise the average fuel efficiency of new cars 40 percent. That would force manufacturers that have already achieved the best miles-per-gallon rating to make the most drastic improvements.
Toyota would have to achieve 45 miles per gallon while Ford would need only 37. Indeed, by saddling fuel-efficient Toyotas with expensive technological improvements, the bill could steer buyers toward, say, Ford, raising overall fuel use.
Manufacturers that did the best job of meeting Congress's will in the past would be punished for their effort. That sends a destructive signal. It's also offensively protectionist.
Yet Congress would create equally difficult problems if it continued the current practice of setting identical, but higher standards on every manufacturer. Japanese manufacturers achieve higher fleet averages primarily because they sell smaller cars. A uniform standard would penalize U.S. companies that cater to large families.
Here's another intractable problem. When CAFE was passed, unions insisted that manufacturers separate domestically made cars from their imported cars, and meet the standard on each group. But the regulations backfired. Because U.S. companies produce their largest cars at home, the regulations have forced them to use parts produced abroad. To meet the target on domestic fleets, they have substituted foreign-made parts, thereby qualifying some of the larger cars as imports.
Problems and more problems. CAFE only applies to new cars, leaving drivers of all other cars completely off the hook . . . As a substitute for higher gas taxes, CAFE keeps driving costs low and thereby encourages people to drive more miles; that offsets part of the impact of vehicle efficiency . . . CAFE standards have raised the manufacturing cost, and the price, of new cars, prompting drivers to keep old gas-guzzlers.
CAFE has meant more fatalities and serious injuries as manufacturers have been forced to sell smaller cars to meet the standards. And, by one estimate, it would have taken a tax of only a few pennies per gallon of gasoline to achieve the same fuel savings as the current CAFE standards -- at a fraction of the cost to consumers.
Yet Congress stonewalls. Last week, the House backed away from a proposed nickel-a-gallon tax hike. Even though consumers fret about some higher state gas taxes, and last year's nickel rise in the Federal tax, gas prices are the lowest they've been, after inflation, since World War II. And U.S. taxes are only a fraction of European levels. Besides, if Congress felt obliged to keep overall Federal taxes down, it could offset higher gas taxes with lower income taxes.
CAFE is an inferior policy that survives because Congress won't come clean: a stiff increase in gas taxes, not stiff regulations, is the way to conserve energy and protect the environment.

Do They Have the Nerve?

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
President Bush came home from his virtuoso performance in the Soviet Union only to resume the posture of a petulant preppy. Democrats are "frustratingly negative on everything" and "We need more farsighted people like me in Congress," he said like a Professor Henry Higgins lamenting Democratic Eliza Doolittles.
There is a way for Mr. Bush to have his wish and for Democrats to have a better chance to reclaim the White House -- if they have the nerve. Let's call the idea "modified parliamentary democracy," and it can be done without changing the Constitution. 
 The legislative process would work like this:
* The Democratic majorities in the House and Senate would pass bills as they see fit, representing the Democrats' approaches to dealing with domestic problems, and for which they would bear political responsibility. The Republican President could approve or veto.
* If the bill were vetoed, Democrats then would allow passage of the Republican bill on the same subject, for which Republicans would shoulder responsibility.
The idea is to break the political-ideological stalemate in Washington and establish greater responsibility as a basis for voter choice. Legislation could be passed with much less inter-party dickering and log-rolling. Whatever legislation became law would more clearly be labeled as Democratic or Republican. A confusing case would be where Mr. Bush supported a Democratic measure, but that would be unusual.
Problems would be addressed with either liberal or conservative answers, and voters would know better whom to blame and reward. An example would be the bill to extend unemployment benefits just passed by a large majority against the threat of Presidential veto.
Mr. Bush might have the guts to buy the idea. Republicans like Newt Gingrich in the House, strong believers with policy proposals, might see it as the only opportunity for Republicans to enact their programs and gain control of Congress.
Democrats would be reluctant. House Speaker Tom Foley and the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, seem to think they are being responsible by trying to compromise with Republicans. But the result is almost always either gridlock or mushy, minimal legislation that satisfies only backroom wheeler-dealers. Most committee chairmen prefer the present system for just those reasons. More difficult, many Congressional Democrats would gag at going along with Republican legislation after a veto of their own in areas like civil rights and unemployment compensation. To these Democrats, the only answer is that they have no hope of translating their beliefs into laws in the current system -- unless they capture the White House. Their best chance of doing that is by letting Republicans pass their laws, and triumph or hang themselves.
I turn to this kind of stark and mechanical idea only because the present situation is ridiculous, and I do not see another solution.
For months now Republicans and Democrats have pressed another idea -- urging Mr. Bush to shift his priorities from foreign to domestic. The hope was that if he paid more attention to what was going on in the United States, he would see the devastating problems and go to work. To which he answered on Friday that things were fine at home and "I am not going to lose interest in world peace."
One can only conclude from this masterly retort that Mr. Bush will continue to pay more mind to Cyprus than Cincinnati. Maybe it is better. Every time he resurfaces on domestic issues he scares the hell out of Democrats. Last week Mr. Foley seemed to back away from the Democrats' commitment to a bill that would provide $150 billion for highway and mass-transit construction and repair. Rank-and-file Democrats could not face the prospect of Mr. Bush attacking them over the five-cent-per-gallon tax increase needed to finance the bill.
Mr. Bush also said on Friday that "the last thing" he wanted from legislation was to "increase the deficit." But two weeks ago Richard Darman, his budget tamer, announced that the deficit would be $20 billion to $40 billion larger than predicted for the next several years due to "technical re-estimates" in tax revenues.
Hardly a whimper was heard in Washington. Allow me to grumble for the rest of us, and to search for a way out.

How to Look for M.I.A.'s Travel Barriers Invite Scams

BYLINE: By DAVID C. UNGER

 BODY:
Even during the peak of America's influence in Vietnam two decades ago, many G.I.'s felt there was something otherworldly about the place. Since then, Vietnam's mysteries have deepened. Cumbersome Treasury regulations imposed after the war strongly discourage U.S. citizens from traveling to Vietnam and Cambodia. Hanoi's own bureaucratic rules have multiplied the obstacles.
That double paper curtain has worked to the advantage of unscrupulous con artists who prey on the emotional vulnerability of families of servicemen missing in action. In the absence of real information, it is all too easy to persuade M.I.A. families and friends that many middle-aged American slave laborers populate Indochina's jungles, villages and cities. 
 Pentagon investigators, who do have access to Vietnam and Cambodia, insist that almost all reported M.I.A. sightings turn out to be erroneous or fraudulent. Many Americans, however, are reluctant to take the word of faceless officials. A better response would be to reduce the obstacles to travel, giving ordinary Americans a chance to look around for themselves.
Last summer, I got some idea of what that might be like, visiting Vietnam on assignment. I spent most of my time in major cities and none of it trying to track down M.I.A. reports. If Americans were being held in rural villages or jungle prison camps, I wouldn't have run into them.
But my trip did have the salutary effect of demystifying Vietnam. And it suggested, further, that allowing Americans to visit Vietnam freely might do much to demystify the M.I.A. issue.
I saw an ideological police state, but the repression was not so tight as to smother unsolicited expressions of popular discontent. A sizable proportion of Vietnamese adults speak some English, and many have regular contact with relatives who now live in the U.S. If there were any number of living M.I.A.'s, it would be hard for Vietnamese authorities to prevent some detailed and verifiable information reaching Pentagon investigators -- or the ears of ordinary tourists.
I also found that even hard-line Communist authorities, aware of their country's catastrophic economic failures, were eager for outside investment. Vietnam may still be isolated from the United States but it is not isolated from the larger capitalist world. In addition to growing numbers of Western business people, Vietnam hosts a well-informed and inquisitive diplomatic community, including Australians, Japanese and Swedes. This international presence would surely complicate any hope of keeping large and explosive secrets.
The best reassurance, however, would come from changes permitting a sharp rise in the number of American travelers to Vietnam.
Hanoi has recently started doing its part, upgrading its hotels and simplifying paperwork. Washington still resists. The Bush Administration's policy is that normal diplomatic relations -- including freedom of travel -- cannot begin until there is government-to-government progress on resolving the M.I.A. issue, as well as Vietnamese cooperation in international peace efforts concerning Cambodia.
On the M.I.A. question, that seems to be putting things exactly backward. If there are in fact significant numbers of living M.I.A.'s in Indochina, encouraging American travel would greatly improve the odds of finding them.

HEADLINE: Save Bankers From Themselves by Regulation;
Stop the Big Kill

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your profile of President Bush's friend and policy adviser Thomas Ashley (July 19) began to develop a policy issue of profound significance to the future of our banking system and economy, but then you let Mr. Ashley dismiss it with the words, "We aren't putting trusts back together, we're lifting 50-year-old restrictions that have strangled the industry." 
 At issue is whether or not commercial organizations should control banks, and this was the focus of President Theodore Roosevelt's trust-busting activities at the beginning of this century. President Bush wants this ownership door opened wide. The matter is being hotly debated in Congress and in editorial columns.
Two voices should be set against Mr. Ashley's response. One is the highly regarded former Federal Reserve chairman, Paul Volcker, who on July 17 wrote to Donald Riegle, Senate Banking Committee chairman, expressing strong support for Senator Riegle's bill intended to maintain the separation of banking and commerce. Mr. Volcker stated:
"As time passes, it seems to be more evident that no case has been made, in the broader public interest, for changing the long United States tradition in that respect . . . little or no sympathy exists in other leading countries for such a banking structure, and banks are demonstrating their ability to raise capital in the markets as their circumstances stabilize and improve. I know a relative handful of firms want the option to buy a bank to further their commercial interest, but that hardly provides a dispassionate base for public policy."
John D. Dingell, House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, who will, fortunately, be reviewing the Treasury proposal, was even blunter. In a June 6 letter to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the House, requesting the right for "close and careful" scrutiny of the proposal by his committee, Mr. Dingell stated, "this complex and dangerous proposal should not be railroaded through without that scrutiny."
The stakes in the pending financial reform bill are very high for every American. We are at a historic watershed.

HEADLINE: Who Can Afford to Swap Income for Time?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Americans suffer from an overdose of work," writes Juliet B. Schor, associate professor of economics at Harvard, in "Americans Work Too Hard" (Op-Ed, July 25). "Regardless of who they are or what they do, Americans spend more time at work than at any time since World War II." 
 Only a professor sequestered in the ivory tower of academia could be so misguided.
The suggestion that the responsibilities of salaried employees can fit neatly into the punch-clock structure of a federally legislated 30-hour or four-day workweek demonstrates how far Professor Schor is from the realities that are faced by most working Americans. Anyone who has ever been a salaried worker in private industry knows what I mean.
Sure, many of us are overworked. Sure, many of us would like to spend more time with our families or benefit from paid parental leave. Sure, there is a growing scarcity of leisure. But can we really afford to swap income for time? Of course not!
Ms. Schor also ignores the reality that many salaried workers want to work 60 hours or more a week on their jobs. This is how some workers manifest a devotion to their chosen careers. Those of us who are in the professional service sector must put in the time to serve the client -- however long it takes. All lawyers, doctors, brokers, salespeople, business executives and other such professionals know this all too well.
To suggest that Congress can legislatively increase productivity by cutting the workweek is misguided and unrealistic.

HEADLINE: All About/Foreign Exchange;
A Profitable Niche in Today's Grim World of Banking

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
GOVERNMENTS like to try to keep the value of their currencies stable. To do that, they buy and sell their currencies in the world's $600 billion-a-day foreign exchange market and coordinate their economic policies with one another. Corporations with large sales or operations abroad do not like volatility in the foreign exchange market either. It makes it difficult for them to produce relatively stable quarterly earnings.
But foreign exchange traders love movement: it is a time to make money, not only from trading one currency for another but also from hedging for corporations seeking to protect themselves from the impact of volatility.
Since 1973, when the world abandoned its post-World War II system of fixed exchange rates in favor of the current floating exchange-rate system, traders -- not governments -- have been getting their way. The markets have been volatile. From the beginning of this year until July, the dollar rose 27 percent against the German mark. In the last three weeks, the dollar has fallen 5 percent against the mark. In the same period, the dollar has moved up sharply against most other currencies.
The quarterly reports for the banks that are active traders in the foreign exchange market show that volatility has been good for them. Foreign exchange revenues for the first quarter, when the dollar was most volatile, were up 27 percent to $701 million for the 15 major trading banks in the United States, according to figures compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers.
 
 
Two Who Have Won
J.P. Morgan and Bankers Trust
 For dozens of banks, revenue from foreign exchange operations has become much more important as other areas of their business have suffered. Banks earn fees on foreign exchange services for corporate customers and profit from daily and long-term trading, often with their own money. Fee-based operations, which carry less risk for the bank, are growing. This makes revenue from the category "foreign exchange" more reliable and stable than its name might otherwise imply.
James M. Rosenberg, a banking analyst at Shearson, has used this argument as the basis of his decision to raise the ratings recently of the stock of Bankers Trust Company and J.P. Morgan & Company. Both banks actively conduct trading and hedging operations for their clients. Mr. Rosenberg said this dependable stream of earnings means the banks' stocks were "materially undervalued."
In the first half of this year, J.P. Morgan, the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust, had revenue from foreign exchange of $149 million, or 30 percent of net income. Bankers Trust did better, with revenue from foreign exchange of $182 million or 53 percent of net income.
"The balance has shifted a bit more toward customers," said Peter D. Hancock, the managing director for global markets at J.P. Morgan. "There is a recognition of the important niche that Morgan holds because of its customer franchise. But this is not to say that we do not have a certain appetite for risk."
 
 
What Customers Want
The Biggest Banks Are Most Popular
 With so many banks competing for business, which ones do corporations prefer? In foreign exchange, it does not hurt to be big. Of the top five banks rated as best by corporate treasurers and other customers in Euromoney magazine, four -- Citicorp, Barclays Bank, National Westminster and Union Bank of Switzerland -- are among the 30 largest banks in the world. Morgan Guaranty Trust, rated third, is 59th in assets worldwide.
The Euromoney list also showed that investment banks are making their mark. Goldman Sachs & Company and Morgan Stanley & Company are now rated among the world's 20 most preferred currency traders.
But the credit ratings of the banks themselves also seem to play a role in why some are favored. The banks that rose in the rankings -- like J.P. Morgan, which went from eighth place to third, and Union Bank of Switzerland, which went from 17th to fifth -- both had credit ratings from the Standard and Poor's Corporation of AAA, five levels higher than the rating for Chemical Bank, which fell from third to seventh, and Chase Manhattan, which fell from sixth to 14th in the rankings. These higher ratings bring in customers who are concerned about the state of the banking system and want to do their longer-term transactions with banks considered healthy.
The credit rating issue is very important to the new foreign exchange operations that will be created at the merged Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust.
In comments to analysts, John McGillicuddy, who will be chairman of the combined bank, made clear that the key to improving the new bank's foreign exchange revenues will be to make the financial moves necessary to raise the bank's credit rating first to an A and then to an AA.
"We really have professionals that can execute in these areas if we give them an improved rating to operate with," Mr. McGillicuddy told the analysts. "There are several banking institutions in this city, for example, that really kind of have the field to themselves right now, and it's not, in our judgment, because they're better than we are."
 
 
Traders Without Jobs
Cost Cutting In Currency Units

The explosive growth of the foreign currency market in the 1980's brought new banks and scores of new traders into the business. Now they are elbowing each other for a share. At the same time, cost cutting in the banking industry has spread even to lucrative areas like foreign exchange. Traders are beginning to feel the pain.
A few foreign banks, like Hill Samuel International of Britain, have closed their New York foreign exchange operations. On the West Coast, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and Barclays Bank of Britain have closed their operations.
The New York market is especially tight. At Union Bank of Switzerland and many other banks, managers do not move quickly to replace traders who have left.
"Traders are suffering for the first time," said David Rivers, the executive editor of FX Week, a newsletter for currency traders.
Anthony G. Mecca, a former foreign exchange trader turned headhunter, said job listings are down about 40 percent from a year ago. He has had to turn the efforts of his own firm, the Paulen Company, toward other kinds of job searches because of the slowdown.
"A lot of the people who were unemployed last summer are still unemployed," he said, adding that he has seen more than 30 traders this year who had lost their jobs.
One of the reasons for the cutbacks, beyond cost, is that the boom in foreign exchange trading in the 1980's brought a lot of people into the market who are having trouble handling the business today.
"The 1980's brought in a lot of people who were not up to the quality and talent that you need today," said Robert A. White, vice president at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. He said increased volatility and quick changes in the direction of the foreign exchange market make it much more difficult to make money now than when the dollar was generally going down every day in the mid- and late 1980's.
Traders hired now tend to be more experienced. "I would look for seasoned traders with a good track record," said Albert Soria, foreign exchange manager at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, a Finnish bank in New York. "And a good track record does not mean volatile earnings. A good track record would mean an upward slope in earnings."
The threat of more bank mergers, like the joining of Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover, means there could be other traders on the street soon looking for jobs. Mr. Mecca believes Chemical has the stronger foreign exchange operation, which means it will be dominant in the combining of the companies' operations. But he believes David Puth, manager of foreign exchange at Chemical, will run counter to the rule in the market and take younger people so he can train them. This time "I think you will see a lot of senior people out on the street," he said. A bank spokesman, Joyce Oberdorf, said the bank will train younger traders, "but not at the expense of senior people."
For one senior trader in particular, the situation is a little queasy. J. Thomas Stanley, who was vice president and manager for corporate exchange at Chemical Bank, left three months ago. He left to do the same job at Manufacturers Hanover Trust. At this time, Mr. Stanley has no comment about his future.
 
 
THE DUAL ROLE OF OPTIONS
 ON the floor of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and in banks and investment banks around the world, currency options are being used increasingly to hedge against foreign-exchange losses.
Currency options are a type of right. They give their owners the opportunity to buy a unit of a currency at a prearranged price sometime in the future. As a result, they are an insurance policy against unwanted or unanticipated moves in the foreign exchange market. Options are traded on exchanges in a number of standard forms or individually crafted for special customer needs by banks and investment banks.
While options offer protection, they also give companies the opportunity to take advantage of a positive move. The cost of combining insurance and opportunity is much higher than traditional forms of hedging, which use forwards -- contracts to buy currencies in the future at current price.
Forwards also offer insurance against adverse moves by locking in an exchange rate, but they offer no chance for gains. According to International Risk Control Inc., a foreign exchange consulting firm in Redwood City, Calif., a three-month option can cost four times more than a forward contract or about 3 percent of face value.
Even though options are more expensive, their use is growing. According to Greenwich Associates, a foreign exchange consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn., companies that use options spent a median of $150 million on them last year, up from $90 million the year before.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 11, 1991, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a report in the "All About" column last Sunday, about currency options, misstated the median corporate spending on them. What rose to $150 million last year from $90 million the year before was the volume of median corporate trading; actual spending to buy these rights for future purchases of currency would amount to a small fraction of the face value of the contracts.

HEADLINE: Demand for Rentals Rises in Manhattan

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
FOR Matthew Auerbach, a comedy writer, freelance rock critic and Manhattan renter, the real estate slump could be worse. Later this month, he will bid adieu to a quintessentially New York home, a fifth floor walk-up railroad flat on York Avenue in the 80's that he calls "the North Pole."
He is moving downtown and up scale, joining thousands of New Yorkers who have seized upon the depressed market to seek the best deals they can find in rental housing. 
 "I don't run my personal life on the basis of real estate cycles, but hey," Mr. Auerbach said, "this is a good time to move." He has signed the lease on a large, 16th-floor one-bedroom with curved walls, a bay window and keys to the health club at the Corinthian, a sleek condominium tower at 38th and First Avenue.
"Renters used to be treated like second-class citizens," said John Robertson, the owner of a Manhattan advertising agency who last month rented a large, fully furnished two-bedroom apartment on 66th Street off Park Avenue. "I was wined and dined," he added.
Mr. Auerbach and Mr. Robertson are among a new wave of renters who have entered the New York City market since the first unmistakable signs of a real estate downturn emerged in 1988. Unwilling to buy, they have reinforced New York's position as the nation's preeminent city of renters after the burst of co-op conversion and condominium construction of the 80's created a large new class of homeowners.
Demand for rentals has grown sharply, but so, too, has the supply, offering renters more options and a more inviting market than at any time since the mid-70's. That is because thousands of co-ops and condominiums have been put on the market as rentals by frustrated developers and owners who are unable to sell them.
The result, experts say, is a new dynamic in which many more apartments fall outside the city's rent-control and rent-stabilization laws, rates on most of the unregulated apartments have declined, and renters are bargaining hard to lower even more the rents asked by landlords. But demand is robust and rents are rising for some apartments, particularly large ones and those in a handful of fashionable new buildings.
One truism of New York living remains unshaken -- rent-regulated apartments priced below the market rate still are in intense demand, and are rarely advertised or listed with brokers. As always, these apartments tend to be passed on to people who know the landlord or are already living the building where a vacancy occurs.
Those looking for the bargain of a lifetime are likely to be disappointed. But because of the real estate slump and uncertainty about the market's near term prospects, executives say many more people, including the affluent, are in the market to rent for a year or two or however long it takes before confidence is restored that values will again begin to rise.
"THE rental market has zoomed," said Hank Sopher, president of J.I. Sopher and Company, a Manhattan brokerage. Its records show average rentals of 1,200 apartments a month in May, June and July, nearly double the number it rented in the same months in the previous four years.
"A lot of people who would normally buy are now renting," he added. "They consider a rental a safe haven."
Experts point to several recent developments that reflect the surge in rentals:
* At a time when the prices of the city's most expensive co-ops and condominiums have fallen sharply, in some cases more than 30 percent, a small number of expensive new rental buildings are in high demand. The Lucerne, a 45-story rental building at 79th Street and First Avenue, opened in January and all 236 apartments were rented by July. Rents are lofty, with two bedroom apartments fetching $3,800 to $4,750 a month.
* Although no precise count is available, the number of co-ops and condominiums now rented or on the market for rent has climbed into the thousands and continues to grow. Some brokers say less than half their rental listings are now in rental buildings.
* After a decline of over 10 percent since 1988 on most unregulated Manhattan apartments that are vacated and offered for rent, prices appear to have flattened out or increased slightly this year.
* Some tenants have negotiated lower rents -- or at least put off increases -- while remaining in their apartments. But in most cases -- almost always in apartments that are rent-controlled or rent stabilized -- tenants in occupancy have agreed to slight rent increases, and only those willing to move have been able to exploit their full negotiating clout to lower asking rents.
In one measure of how rents have declined on the most expensive Manhattan apartments, The Feathered Nest, a rental agency, has tracked thousands of transactions it has brokered since 1987. The company's inventory of rentals is evenly split among co-ops, condominiums and stabilized units in rental buildings, according to its president, Nancy Packes.
The analysis, which categorized apartments by neighborhood, size and other factors, found that a studio in an unregulated, doorman building on the Upper West Side would have rented for $1,225 in 1987, but the rent would have fallen to $1,000 by the first half of this year.
RENTS on one-bedrooms in unregulated Upper East Side buildings without doormen fell less, the study showed, from $1,350 in 1987 to $1,275 this year. Rents on some larger apartments rose. The study showed that a two-bedroom apartment in a unregulated doorman building on the Upper East Side would have rented for $2,950 in 1987, and was up to $3,000 this year.
The Feathered Nest inventory of current listings also made clear that many apartments in recently completed condominium buildings, which have been slow to sell, are now being offered for rent by their developers. Examples include a one-bedroom, two-bath unit at 3 Lincoln Center, completed in 1990, which is available at $2,180 a month, and a two-bedroom apartment at the Alexandria, a condominium completed this year at 72d Street and Broadway, which can be had for $3,999 a month.
Some real estate executives maintain that the increased rental activity represents a return to more normal times in a city where renters have always dominated the housing market. They say history may prove the 80's surge of co-op conversion and condominium construction to be an aberration.
"People were buying apartments because it was a way of going into business -- they were speculating," said Daniel Brodsky, a Manhattan developer, who in May began marketing the Concerto, a new, 35-story, 247-unit rental building at 60th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. So far, he said, 60 percent of the apartments have been leased at rents ranging from $950 a month for the smallest studio to $3,900 a month for a three bedroom apartment.
"We are going back to a state of normalcy, where New York is a rental town," said Mr. Brodsky, who added that he plans to break ground on another new rental building at 61st Street and West End Avenue next year.
Other new rental buildings, including some more expensive than the Lucerne or Concerto, have also been attracting tenants, albeit more slowly.
At One East River Place, which was completed in 1988 at 72d Street and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, 75 percent of 415 apartments have been rented at an average of $42 a square foot a year -- $4,100 to $5,300 a month for two-bedrooms.
Analysts say the success of the new buildings makes clear that, despite its economic duress, New York is still home to many wealthy people willing to pay a high price for a fashionable address, a sweeping view, marble bathroom fixtures, and perhaps a doorman with that properly authoritative style of calling a cab. The difference now, they say, is that many would prefer to rent.
"We have a different profile of the renter now," said Jack Heller, a Manhattan developer and president of Heller Equities. "These are high income people who don't want to be required to purchase, and for the first time we have buildings where they can get the amenities they want in a rental."
Mr. Heller said he, too, is planning at least one new rental building.
STILL, although the success of the new rental buildings is heartening to some, landlords and apartment owners in other relatively expensive buildings, including rentals, co-ops and condominiums, are struggling to find tenants.
"The buildings in secondary locations are taking a beating," said Allan Rogers, managing director of Douglas Elliman, a brokerage and management company in Manhattan.
"We are seeing much more mobility within the market, more tenants moving from building to building," he added. "But people are still nervous about New York and their own positions. They are reluctant to spend the maximum they can for housing."
One renter with fresh experience in the market is Harvey Kaufman, the comptroller of a women's apparel company who in July rented a large, 45th floor studio for $1100 a month at the Sheffield, a rental building on 57th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. He looked at 20 apartments before signing a lease.
"This is a renter's market, but not everyone seemed to be facing reality," he said, adding that he had looked at several far less attractive apartments -- including a tiny one room studio without a kitchen -- whose owners were asking over $1,000 a month.
For Mr. Robertson, the advertising executive, finding a luxurious rental at a price he considers a bargain came as consolation for other another real estate headache. Having purchased a four-bedroom, waterfront home in Stamford, Conn., at the height of the boom in 1986, he now owns what he refers to as the "Stamford turkey."
When he decided to move into Manhattan this year, Mr. Robertson said he did not even try to sell the Connecticut house after it was appraised at far below what he had paid. Instead, he has rented it out, fully furnished, and rented his current apartment from a couple who, like himself, have been forced into the role of landlord because of the housing slump.
Even by Manhattan standards, the East 66th Street apartment is not inexpensive -- his rent is $2,800 a month. Still, he estimated that the rent is $2,000 a month less than he would have had to pay for a comparable furnished Manhattan apartment in the mid-80's.
And for Mr. Auerbach, the comedy writer, the move to the Corinthian condominium, which he is renting from the apartment's owner, will mean higher rent checks. Currently paying $850 a month for his York Avenue walkup, his new rent is $1,600.
Still, he said, he will pay less than he expected for what he is getting. "This is a big step up from York Avenue," he said. "As a renter, I've found New York a very friendly place."

A Milieu Apart

BYLINE: By Laura Mansnerus

 BODY:
AT TEMPLE University in Philadelphia, about 350 students pledged fraternities and sororities last year. Staff members at the university's day care center estimate that they fielded inquiries from more than 1,000 students. And the university's Adult Program, whose hottest workshops are "Assertiveness Training" and "Going to College as an Adult," heard from about twice that many.
At Temple, as at many American universities, to be 25 is to be more typical than noticeable. But it is also to be an adult, with adult concerns and an unmistakable sense of purpose. For mny students, college is no longer a stage of life but a place to do work. 
 The campus "is not my life, as it was when I was 18," said Brenda McBride, a 25-year-old senior majoring in journalism, during a break from her job as a lifeguard, which pays tuition.
Ms. McBride lives in Philadelphia's suburbs, works in center city, rarely socializes with students and seems to be talking about another person when she recalls her days at the University of Arizona, where she enrolled at age 18 and quit three years later. "Those were my friends, the people I was going to spend four years with," she said. "Now, I do my work, I listen in class and I leave."
 
A Sizable Majority Over 22
 So do many other Temple students, judging from the university's demographic profile. In the spring semester, more than three-quarters of its 20,000 undergraduates were 20 to 29 years old, with a sizable majority over 22; only 8.7 percent were 18- and 19-year-olds.
There are, of course, plenty of students on campus who took the direct route from high school. There are fraternity mixers and football games and group bar-hopping.
There is even enough youth around to make some of the older students feel conspicuous. "At first I had a complex," said Patty Kahn, a 30-year-old senior literature major. "I wouldn't tell anybody how old I was." (She was 27.)
But Ms. McBride said that she, like other older students interviewed, does not feel self-conscious in the least. As to how these students fit in with younger students, "The only contact I have with them is in the classroom," she said.
These students do not socialize with classmates partly because they have no time, partly because they completed adolescent rites of passage at some other time and place don't want to relive them. "Freshman dorms are terrible," said Ms. Kahn, who lived in one at Ithaca College in New York 12 years ago. "Girls crying on the telephone, men sneaking into bathrooms . . ."
Kate Bovich, who enrolled at Temple at age 32 and graduated with a journalism degree last year, fondly recalls her teen-age years at Reed College in Oregon. But she says that as an older student -- a working, divorced student with a small daughter -- "getting drunk and stupid and worrying about my love life was not something I missed."
"There is a generational difference," said Ms. Bovich, who is now the college's adviser for student publications. "Their experience is different from mine. They watch different TV shows. They didn't go to school when I did. They didn't have the Vietnam War."
At the same time, there seems to be a consensus on the nation's campuses that age does not matter the way it did a generation ago. As young people delay life decisions, it seems that 30-year-olds are dressing and talking more like 20-year-olds than they used to. "I've met 25-year-old mothers of three who look like everybody else to me," said Rebecca Alpert, associate director of Temple's Adult Program, the counseling service for adults (anyone 22 or older, by Temple's definition). "They wear jeans and blend right in."
It is not just to their elders that so many older students look like, well, students. Dina Levy, a 20-year-old junior at the University of Wisconsin, said: "The freshmen somehow you can pick out, and the oldest people you can pick out. But otherwise, when I sit in class, it's not easy to tell how old anybody is."
At the University of California at Berkeley, where in 1964 students were cautioned against trusting anyone<pl48,3.2over 30, age differences are "overwhelmed" by disparities in cultural and economic background, said Anthony J. Cascardi, a professor of comparative literature.
Still, Professor Cascardi said that in class older students were noticeable for taking strong positions. "And when you're teaching literature," he said, "sometimes you're just dying for a solid position to use, other than the one you want to tease out of the students, for the basis of a dialogue."
 
 
Where the Age Difference Shows
 In Paul Sunstein's Intellectual Heritage course at Temple, which runs from Genesis to Kafka, there is much probing of characters' emotional crises. In those discussions the difference between 18 and 28 shows.
"The older ones are better at dealing with the emotional content of literature," Professor Sunstein said. The 18-year-olds, he explained, "think everyone's a fanatic. They're all rational calculators. When in their lives have they ever had a strong experience?"
Jonathan Friedlaender, a Temple anthropology professor, said of his older students: "They're much more likely, if they're paying instead of mommy and daddy, to demand more out the course than just a good grade."
Older students acknowledge that they are nervier than many classmates. Patty Kahn said she often doesn't bother to raise her hand before she speaks. Bill Roper, 34, who returned to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, said he found class discussions more interesting -- if sometimes elementary -- because of his experiences after dropping out in 1977. Besides starting a textbook-sales business, writing computer programs and running a mortgage-finance corporation, Mr. Roper served on the Republican City Committee in Boston, the finance committee of the Massachusetts Republican Party and the National Highway Safety Committee. In Philadelphia, he is active in ward politics.
"Now, if you're sitting in a survey course in political science, you know some of that," he said, adding that he is delighted to debate with the recitation leader.
The same is true of her undergraduates who have worked, said Frances E. Zollers, a professor of law and public policy at Syracuse University's School of Management. "They'll draw a parallel with what they're hearing in class and offer it as an example if I'm struggling," she said. Older students are not necessarily better students, Professor Zollers warned. "They make the same reasoning errors that everybody going through a first-year law class does. They're also not in test-taking mode, which hurts them."
But most professors say older students compensate by asking what they are doing wrong. "Age changes the nature of the exchange," said Jim Gibson, who also teaches Intellectual Heritage at Temple. "They're able to negotiate." Then, he said, they improve quickly.
"I beg for them," said Professor Gibson, who spends much of his class time coaxing and lighting upon hesitant comments from students. "And when they walk in the door I thank them and I coddle them."

HEADLINE: One Day, Junior Got Too Big

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash.

 BODY:
TEN years ago this month, the International Business Machines Corporation introduced its first personal computer, changing the computer industry forever. Almost overlooked at the time was the company chosen to provide key software for the machine, headed by a nerdy programmer young enough to be the son of many of the I.B.M. executives.
 No one is overlooking the results of that decision today. Seizing on that initial opportunity to provide the MS-DOS operating system for I.B.M. personal computers and the clones that followed, the Microsoft Corporation has grown into the world's largest software company, with revenues of $1.8 billion for the fiscal year ending in June. Its reach expands into nearly every nook and cranny of the software business. 
With a market capitalization of $12.8 billion, Microsoft is also one of the 50 most valuable companies in the nation, according to a Business Week ranking, ahead of all computer companies except I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard and in the company of Ford Motor, Dow Chemical and other industrial giants with many times its revenues. The nerdy programmer, William H. Gates, now 35, owns enough of Microsoft to make him worth $4 billion, more than the gross national product of Nicaragua.
 But it is getting lonely at the top. On the way to its current dominance, Microsoft and the intensely competitive Mr. Gates have angered many rivals and even some former partners, including I.B.M. Now, almost everyone in the industry is hatching plans to try to compete with Microsoft for control over the industry's direction. And the resulting massive realignment of forces that is reshaping the industry could pose a severe challenge to Microsoft's hegemony.
 "Our belief is that Microsoft has peaked," said George Colony, president of Forrester Research, a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass. "They have enough hubris now to believe they don't need I.B.M., that they don't need anybody. I think Microsoft will be a big, struggling company in two years."
 Microsoft's relationship with its former mentor, I.B.M., indeed is in a shambles. After a falling out over the joint development of a successor to MS-DOS, I.B.M. is now competing head to head with the software company in what promises to be one of the nastiest personal-computer industry battles of the 1990's. Each company is already trashing the other's product in public. Under the old rubric that "My enemy's enemy is my friend," I.B.M. has even joined forces with its former rival, Apple Computer Inc., to develop software that will compete with Microsoft's offerings. I.B.M. has also formed smaller alliances with other software companies, including the Lotus Development Corporation and Borland International Inc.
 
Others Are Joining Forces
 Novell Inc., which so far has bested Microsoft in software for controlling networks of personal computers, recently strengthened its hand by buying Digital Research Inc., which makes a program that competes with MS-DOS (Page 4).
 And the Federal Trade Commission is investigating Microsoft's practices, spurred in part by complaints from competitors that Microsoft's dominance in operating systems gives it unfair advantages in other categories.
 The key threat to Microsoft, however, is not other companies but a big technology change. With MS-DOS and its newer product called Windows, Microsoft dominates the market for software that controls personal computers. But personal computers are increasingly being linked in networks and with larger machines called servers to handle computing tasks now handled by centralized mainframe computers.
 Not only has Microsoft had little experience with networked systems, but such an interconnected computing world is likely to require cooperation among companies. Some say Microsoft will have a tough time going it alone, especially against I.B.M., which wields considerable influence with corporate data processing departments.
 "No one really likes to do business with Microsoft," said Philippe Kahn, the founder and president of Borland, who predicts that the falling out with I.B.M. will hurt the software company. "He didn't need to declare war on I.B.M.," Mr. Kahn said, referring to Mr. Gates. "That will turn out five years from now to look like his biggest mistake. That's ego."
 To be sure, there is an element of wishful thinking and jealousy in predictions of Microsoft's downfall. For all their moaning that Microsoft was lucky to be anointed by I.B.M., or that it abuses its control over the key operating software, rivals also acknowledge that Microsoft is a superb competitor and has executed its strategy with precision.
 Moreover, most of the threats to Microsoft from new alliances might take two or more years to materialize. In the meantime, Microsoft will likely continue its rapid growth merely by selling Windows to as many as possible of the 70 million users of MS-DOS PC's. "Until anyone sees evidence of a broadside hit, it's just a war of words in my opinion," said David Readerman, a software analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. "The product momentum is very much on Microsoft's side."
 
10 New Workers a Day
 And what momentum it is. Net income has been growing at an average of 64 percent a year over the last five years and revenues at 56 percent. With 8,200 employees, Microsoft has been hiring 10 new people a day, and its campus here, outside Seattle, is in a perennial state of construction.
 Mr. Gates is not unaware of the challenges. "I think I need to work extremely hard if we are to do anywhere near as well as we've done," he said. But he also added that challenges are not unusual. "Name a year and I'll name the people out to get us," he said.
 Mr. Gates also dismissed talk that his behavior has angered his partners and that he, or his competitors, were driven by emotion and ego instead of business sense. "This is business. This is not Divorce Court or Psychology Today," he said. In forming their alliance, he said, I.B.M. and Apple are acting out of perceived needs.
 "I won't take any credit for that wildness," he said, explaining that he thinks the partnership makes little sense, particularly for Apple, which will sacrifice its uniqueness by sharing software development with I.B.M. "Why do they need help? What are they missing?" Mr. Gates said. "It's certainly a huge step backward to have to smoosh it together" with I.B.M.'s effort, he said.
 I.B.M.'s need for Apple and other partners stems in large part from the void left by Microsoft. I.B.M. and Microsoft initially worked together on OS/2, which was supposed to be a successor to MS-DOS, with more sophisticated features. But now Microsoft is backing its own program, Windows, which it began developing long before it started work on OS/2.
 For I.B.M., OS/2 is crucial to tying personal computers to its larger machines. It also needs its own operating system to help differentiate its personal computers from the legions of cheaper clones that have severely cut its market share.
 But clearly, emotions are playing a role as well. Industry executives say I.B.M. feels betrayed, like a father whose son has turned against him. Mr. Gates and I.B.M. executives have not spoken for months. For his part, Mr. Gates said he is angry about a demonstration by I.B.M. a few months ago in which it showed how easy it was to make Windows "crash" or stall. Microsoft responded last month by showing securities analysts how easy it was to crash OS/2 as well.
 Mr. Gates said Microsoft tried to accommodate I.B.M. in every way but at some point, I.B.M. had asked too much. For instance, he said, I.B.M. asked that Microsoft stop work on future versions of Windows, a request Microsoft rejected.
 
A Swollen Budget
 Mr. Gates said he was also worried when the number of I.B.M. people working on OS/2 began to mushroom and costs to escalate and when I.B.M. began pressuring Microsoft to "fund the bloat." Mr. Gates argued that the software could never be profitable if so much was spent developing it.
 Indeed, a March 1990 audit by a leading expert from I.B.M. and one from Microsoft compared the companies' contributions to OS/2. The software written by Microsoft was characterized as "O.K." and in some cases as "slick" or "great," while the portions by I.B.M. were usually characterized as "fat," "slow," "disorganized" and "inappropriate." An I.B.M. spokeswoman this week acknowledged problems existed but said the company has long since taken corrective steps.
 To that extent, not having to work with I.B.M. could be a relief for Microsoft. But Mr. Gates said that he is not relieved and that I.B.M.'s attempt to steer corporate data processing managers away from Windows is Microsoft's single biggest threat.
 With relations with I.B.M. broken off, however, Microsoft is fully committed to Windows. It has sold more than 4 million copies since a revamped version appeared a little more than a year ago, dwarfing the 600,000 copies of OS/2 sold since 1987. Windows works on top of MS-DOS, making it an easier transition than OS/2, a replacement for DOS.
 But being tied to the older technology of MS-DOS could also be a drawback for Windows. So Microsoft is developing a new operating system, known as Windows NT, which it says will be ready next year. The project, which could be the key to Microsoft's future, is being headed by Dave Cutler, formerly a key designer at the Digital Equipment Corporation, a balding, grizzled veteran who stands in sharp contrast to the youthful programmers he commands.
 
Versions of Windows
 NT -- which stands for new technology -- will run on powerful personal computers using different kinds of microprocessors and will be better geared for use in networks. Indeed, Microsoft plans a whole series of versions of Windows for different machines, ranging from pocket-sized personal information organizers to supercomputers. The company is also looking at using Windows to help control computerized facsimile machines, voice-mail systems and high-definition television sets.
 Windows, however, is more than just an operating system. Microsoft is using it to increase sales of applications products like Microsoft Word, its word-processing program, and its Excel spreadsheet by tailoring these programs to run with Windows.
 Competitors are following suit, after having initially ignored Windows in favor of OS/2. Some, in fact, say Microsoft misled them into supporting OS/2, a charge Microsoft denies.
 In any case, Microsoft has had the market for applications that work with Windows nearly to itself. "It's almost like taking candy from a baby," said Scott Oki, senior vice president of sales, marketing and services for Microsoft.
 Microsoft said that in the last year its share of the United States markets for spreadsheets and word processing for I.B.M. and compatible personal computers have both doubled to about 30 percent, as measured by revenues. Mike Maples, the senior vice president of applications software for Microsoft, predicts Microsoft will surpass Lotus in spreadsheets in 12 months. Wordperfect, he said, is a little tougher: "We're not that far, but it's a very steep hill."
 Hogwash, replied Frank King, senior vice president of Lotus, who called Microsoft's market-share claims exaggerated. In units sold, he said, Microsoft is still "solidly in third place" behind Lotus 1-2-3 and Borland's Quattro Pro.
 Moreover, Microsoft's honeymoon is about over. Lotus has said it will have a version of 1-2-3 for Windows out by September and Wordperfect is not far behind. If there is any consolation for Microsoft, it is that the debut of all these new products will help increase sales of Windows.
 Mr. Gates seems determined to enter every major area in the personal computer software business. To develop new software concepts, the company has started a lab, headed by Nathan P. Myhrvold, a physicist who worked with the noted British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking before being bitten by the software bug.
 Rivals have long complained that the rest of the industry has served as Microsoft's R.& D. lab. Windows was clearly inspired by Apple's work with the Macintosh, so much so that Apple is suing Microsoft for copyright infringement. While the Go Corporation has pioneered development of new software to control pen-based computers, Microsoft is adding extensions to Windows to handle pen input. Even MS-DOS, the program that put Microsoft on the map, was acquired from another company.
 "You will have a hard time finding anything that Microsoft pioneered," said Mr. Kahn of Borland. "Guys like Steve Jobs have contributed tons more to the industry than Bill," he added, referring to the founder of Apple and of Next Computer Inc.
 That might be somewhat unfair. Microsoft has been early in some technologies like combining video with computing, and has kept up its investment for years even though a big market has yet to materialize. As the Japanese have proved, what matters most is not the basic invention but the ability to commercialize it. Mr. Gates has proved to be a master at quickly positioning Microsoft to take advantage of new developments.
 Mr. Gates is, by all accounts, a demanding boss. Employees who enter meetings not fully prepared can leave carrying their head in their hands. "At least three times in a meeting he'll say 'That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard,' " said Paul Maritz, vice president for advanced operating systems.
 But Mr. Gates also inspires loyalty. Microsoft has had very little turnover in its top management.
 Mr. Gates works at the same relentless pace as in 1975, when he dropped out of Harvard at age 19 to start Microsoft, staying up late to reply to some of the more than 100 electronic mail messages he gets each day. "You see mail from Bill at 2 in the morning," said Mr. Oki, the senior vice president. It is somewhat disconcerting to Mr. Gates, then, that some of his thirtysomething lieutenants are starting to marry and have kids, and sometimes can't reply to his messages until the morning. A couple of executives have retired to enjoy the wealth they've earned from Microsoft.
 
An Underground House
 Mr. Gates has not had much time to enjoy his fortune, with the exception of a penchant for fancy cars and of a new house he is building, most of it underground, with a garage the size of an airplane hangar and space to seat 250 people for dinner. High-definition television screens will display artworks that can be changed to suit the tastes of guests. The house will also have four children's bedrooms, perhaps a sign that Mr. Gates will someday settle down and marry.
 But most of Mr. Gates's efforts will be occupied with making Windows a broad-based success and extending Microsoft's reach throughout the software business, which could be among the most important industries of the coming decade.
 Said Paul Grayson, chairman of Micrografx, a Dallas software company that was an early supporter of Windows but is now working with I.B.M. on OS/2: "If Bill succeeds in his strategy, in my opinion he'll become the wealthiest, most powerful person in the history of mankind."

 
MICROSOFT'S DIVERSITY STRATEGY
 In an industry in which many companies focus on one type of product, Microsoft has long been known for diversity, from its Flight Simulator game to its Basic programming language. While it is best known for its systems software, Microsoft is also the largest supplier of personal computer applications software like word-processing programs and spreadsheets. It trails companies like Lotus and Wordperfect in individual categories, but has the largest overall revenues, $935 million in the last fiscal year.
 Microsoft continues to expand into new categories. This fall, it is expected to introduce software aimed at homes and small businesses. Microsoft Publisher will be a low-end desktop publishing program to print fliers, say, or menus. Microsoft Money will be for personal finance management. Later on will come programs for checkbook balancing.
 The company is also making a big push for programs, exchanging and commenting on documents and routing forms from place to place.
 Microsoft does not have a data-base program, an important category controlled by Borland International and Ashton-Tate, which are merging. Mike Maples, senior vice president for applications software, said that about 18 months ago, Microsoft realized it was working on the wrong approach to such a product, scrapped its efforts and started over.
 The product it will introduce, next year at the earliest, will allow computer users to retrieve and analyze data without knowing how to program. He said the program might be similar to one by Metaphor Computer Systems that brand managers at companies like Proctor & Gamble use to analyze competitive data.
 
AVOIDING BIG MERGERS
 Will Microsoft jump into the computer industry mergers and alliances frenzy? William H. Gates, its chairman, does not completely count it out. Among computer companies, "Every combination of A with B has not only been thought about, there's been at least one meeting on it," he said.
 Microsoft has made a few small acquisitions but has stayed away from large ones, in part because of the difficulty of merging technology companies. Antitrust concerns could also prevent such mergers.
 Would Microsoft be interested in buying Novell, which is beating Microsoft in the crucial area of networking software? "It'd be interesting," Mr. Gates replied. "It would be new for us to do a big acquisition."
 Industry curiosity was piqued recently when Mr. Gates met with Scott McNealy, president of Sun Microsystems. Sun champions the Unix operating system, a direct competitor to Windows NT. Mr. Gates denied rumors that Sun and Microsoft would join to counter I.B.M. and Apple, or that Microsoft would make a version of its new Windows NT operating system for Sun's Sparc microprocessor. "There's nothing going to happen between us and Sun," he said.
 Microsoft does hope to work more closely with the Digital Equipment Corporation, an I.B.M. rival. But Mr. Gates said there would be no formal alliance. Microsoft and Digital, along with Compaq Computer, are in a consortium trying to set standards for a new generation of desktop computers.

HEADLINE: Urban Outposts Keep Fighting the War on Poverty

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
WHEN the United States declared war on poverty in the 1960's, New Haven was one of the first targets. In 1962 the nation's first community-based antipoverty agency, Community Progress Inc., opened in the city and became the incubator for lasting national programs like Head Start, the Neighborhood Youth Corps and others that offered legal services and job training.
Like other Great Society initiatives, Community Progress ultimately suffered from a tarnished reputation and was replaced by a reconstituted successor. But in New Haven and 13 other communities in the state, local agencies begun in the idealism of the 60's have survived into the 90's, serving some 400,000 people. And as the Federal Government seeks new directions for its current scaled-back efforts to address the lingering problems of poverty, the people who run those programs say they are eager to offer ideas as well as evidence of success, despite the less-than-enthusiastic support they have received from Washington. 
 "The Government set us up to fail," said the executive director of Community Action for Greater Middletown, Idella W. Howell, who has worked for the agency since 1964. "It gave us some money and told us to go out and get rid of poverty within 10 years. Then it started cutting off our funding.
"But the fact of the matter is that, no, of course we couldn't get rid of poverty in that amount of time, and yes, we did make some big mistakes. But we survived, and we have continued to fight the battle we were created to do and with a fair number of successes."
Mrs. Howell, raised outside of Florence, S.C., moved to Connecticut in the late 1940's. While working at a parachute factory, she created a neighborhood organization, La Bonhomie, in her predominantly black neighborhood in Middletown. Members helped each other by minding children, assisting elderly neighbors and holding classes for teen-agers.
Her efforts caught the attention of the four staff members at the city's newly opened Community Action Agency. She was recruited as a neighborhood organizer, going door to door throughout the city, listening to people's concerns. The information was later used to begin or expand programs of job training and child care.
After serving the agency in several administrative positions, Mrs. Howell was appointed executive director in 1977. Since then she has been responsible for raising the funds to support the organization's 11 programs, including $300,000 in local donations toward building a day care and Head Start center in the early 1980's. Most recently Mrs. Howell moved the agency, which now has a staff of 105 and a budget of more than $6 million, to a newly renovated school building in the heart of the city. State funds helped pay for the $1.2 million renovation project.
Though her work consists mainly of administrative tasks, Mrs. Howell remains a consummate outreach worker who will stop vagrants on the street and ask how she can help them. She recently invited a group of alcoholics to the agency's board room to voice their fears about the future.
"First we go out and try and find the need," said Mrs. Howell. "Then we find a way to take care of that need by building a program around the people that we serve."
 
'Try and Break the Cycle'
 The executive director of Norwalk Economic Opportunity Now, Robert Burgess, said his agency's goal is to give people the skills to help themselves. "But we're realists," said Mr. Burgess, who played in the band that toured with the popular music stars Wilson Pickett and the Temptations, until Mr. Burgess began working for community action agencies in the early 1970's. "Whenever you're dealing with human beings, there are bound to be failures.
"The reality is that most people want to be helped out of poverty, yet some people just don't. Nevertheless, it's our job to try and break the cycle of poverty through education, job training and, when necessary, teaching people how to be good parents."
Among the agency's 25 programs is one that offers a supervised alternative to incarceration for some offenders, including the nation's first halfway house where children are allowed to live with their mothers.
Cle Johnson, 18 years old, and his friends Andre Brown and Joseph Mann, both 17, are graduates of the Norwalk agency's youth development program, which serves high school juniors and seniors from low-income families. Through the program they received tutoring that helped them raise their grades and advice on how to study for the College Board exam, they said.
All three will be attending college in Virginia this fall and are currently working as counselors in the summer camp program based at the agency's four neighborhood centers. The camp serves some 600 children each summer.
Mayor Frank Esposito of Norwalk said the Community Action Agency has had a major impact on the city. "Every project they set out to do," he said, "has turned out to be excellent."
 
A Setback in New Haven
 Community Progress Inc. in New Haven, founded in 1962 with help from the Ford Foundation, served as the model for hundreds of similar projects around the country. Its innovations included Head Start, the Neighborhood Youth Corps, the Legal Services Program and the Comprehensive Manpower Training Program. But by the mid-1970's the organization had fallen into fiscal and administrative chaos and became known as a political pork barrel. After a Federal and state investigation, the program was stripped of its government funds and eliminated as the antipoverty agent for New Haven.
In 1977 the Community Action Agency of New Haven was created to replace Community Progress. The successor agency now administers 11 programs, including one that transports elderly residents to medical appointments and another that offers computer training.
Marcial Cuevas, the agency's executive director since 1978, said that although it is able to provide services for some 32,000 residents, it must compete for funds with 200 nonprofit agencies in the city. As a result, "you've got people who need four or five services who have to go four or five places to get them," he said. "It gets to be very frustrating."
The New Haven debacle of the 1970's, like those at community action agencies throughout the country, had a lasting effect on the programs. James H. Gatling, the president of the state Community Action Association and executive director of New Opportunities for Waterbury Inc., said it took years to mend the agencies' image.
"Everyone had such grand ideas in those days," he said referring to the bold social reforms of the Great Society years. "The Feds were pumping money into communities without setting up regulations and allowing people with no management or even social work experience to take charge of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Few considered the consequences."
 
Keeping Pace With the Times
 But as the Federal Government backed away from its promise to fight poverty, he said, many community action agencies matured, built strong local ties and were able to obtain funds to maintain and create programs. And unlike the mid-1960's, when it was assumed that job training was the key to reducing poverty, he said, the rise in AIDS, drug abuse and homelessness and the breakdown of the family have made the agencies' mission much more difficult.
As one of the largest community action agencies in the state, with 45 programs, New Opportunities for Waterbury has tried to keep pace with the times, Mr. Gatling said. New programs offer homemaking skills to young adults who have grown up in the foster care system, therapy for families whose children are at risk of being placed in foster homes and AIDS-prevention education for prostitutes, low-income young people and pregnant women.
Still, Mr. Gatling said he wished that community action agencies could afford to do more. The recession has brought them a new wave of clients, he said, referring to the swelling numbers of middle-class residents who have lost their jobs.
"No matter what the conservative politicians say," said Mr. Gatling, "the community action agency remains one of the few true voices left for the people."

HEADLINE: THE VIEW FROM: NORFOLK;
Businesses Are Joining Forces To Lure More Tourists to Town

BYLINE: By VALERIE CRUICE

 BODY:
THE citizens of Norfolk have banded together against the British, a pack of wolves on Haystack Mountain, the Confederacy and even progress. But in the last few years they have come up against a most formidable foe: the economy.
Michele Sloane, the 37-year-old owner of the Mountain View Inn, issued a call to arms in March, rallying local business owners to respond to last summer's poor economic showing. True to the town's history, they rallied. 
 "We had about 45 at the first meeting," said Ms. Sloane, seated at a dining table in the rambling Victorian-style inn. "I was shocked."
 
18th-Century Tavern
 Norfolk's winter population is 2,200. In the summer, however, it swells to 3,000, owing to the Yale Summer School of Music and Art, the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival and the town's reputation as a summer resort.
The 46.7-square-mile town sits about 1,300 feet above sea level in the Litchfield Hills, its pre-Revolutionary town green flanked by a handsome spired Meeting House; the former Battell Stoeckel mansion, called White House, now a part of the Yale Summer School; an 18th-century building that once served as a tavern and stagecoach stop; a Victorian public library, and several 18th-century homes. The town remains much as it once was.
Down the hill from the green is a modest business district, with a restaurant, grocery store and a few other retailers as well as "For Rent" signs, empty storefronts and, around town, an occasional notice of foreclosure.
With last year's summer business estimated to have been off by 50 percent from the year before, Ms. Sloane said, she was was compelled to form the Norfolk Merchants Association. Since its founding in March, 47 diverse businesses have joined. The group has published a comprehensive and attractive brochure aimed at prospective visitors, complete with three maps, descriptions of the businesses, a brief history and a list of points of interest.
"We printed 5,000, and they're going like wildfire," Ms. Sloane said. "At the end of June we distributed them through all of the merchants, through Yale and the New England Vacation Center in Rockefeller Center. I see people walking in from town for a room, and they're holding the brochure."
A lot of music lovers are drawn to the town by the Yale summer program and the Chamber Music Festival, which run from late June to Aug. 10. Last year the festival celebrated its 50th season.
"We're the centerpiece of the tourist trade here," said Michael Geller, 29, the festival's manager. "When you say tourism, some of the locals are skeptical, because Norfolk is a special place. The Merchants Association is about keeping that special, but letting more people in on the secret."
The Norfolk Chamber Music Festival's 1904 Music Shed seats 2,000, and concerts are frequently sold out. Last year ticket sales were up 19 percent from the previous year.
Also dependent on the summer season are Fred and Mary Ann McGourty, horticulturists and owners of Hillside Gardens, open from May through September. The McGourtys' 18th-century home is surrounded by 25 different perennial borders on five cultivated acres, and they sell a wide selection of uncommon perennials. During the cold months, the couple, authors and editors of a variety of gardening books, lecture across the United States and Canada. Mr. McGourty, who has lived in Norfolk since 1963, said he, too, was surprised by the number of people who attended the first meeting of the Merchants Association.
The group "brings together a lot of individuals in the town," he said. "As far as the business end goes, everybody tends to keep a low profile. It is part of the psychology of Norfolk. Even now I suspect we only know a fraction."
Mrs. McGourty added: "There are a lot of very talented people in town. These are solitary arts, people need space and quiet. The Merchants Association creates a common bond among the business community.
"We joined the Merchants Association because we'd like to promote our own business. But we'd like to see the businesses in town succeed, year-round and week-round, so we're not entirely dependent on weekenders."
But those who hope to promote Norfolk face a paradox, Mrs. McGourty said: "You need to promote yourself, and yet the rural character is what attracts visitors." The association's brochure shows the diversity of the businesses in town. A visit to the local Artisans Guild, where works of many local people are displayed, confirms this. In the corner of what used to be a bank (the vault is used as a walk-in display area), a clavichord made by Carl Dudash awaits a home. His workroom is in a carriage house a few winding blocks away.
Mr. Dudash makes harpsichords and clavichords for musicians from California to Switzerland. His wife, Marilee Wagner Dudash, creates the painted finishes of marbling, arabesques, trompe l'oeil designs and Latin lettering.
 
'A Very Bad Year'
 The Dudashes said they joined the Merchants Association because they thought it would be good for their business.
"Last year was a very bad year, I have to be honest," Mr. Dudash said, noting that sales of luxury items drop when the economy is tight. His instruments start at $5,000 and can go as high as $30,000, depending on decoration. Mr. Dudash said his new line of harpsichords is selling well in Europe, so his own outlook has improved.
"The Merchants Association will stimulate people to come here," he said. "This town has a tremendous potential, which I'd like to see realized. There is a wealth of talented people here and highly diversified: a canoe maker, a guitar maker, furniture makers.
"I can go two blocks away and have the legs turned for these instruments. Or if somebody has a better piece of machinery for something, no problem to borrow it. It's a very nice environment."
For visitors an unusual way to see Norfolk is by horse and carriage. Beth Denis, 37, and her partner, Judy Wiltse, 35, also instrumental in the formation of the association, have operated the Horse and Carriage Livery Service for 10 years, serving weddings and special occasions all over the Northeast. They offer hourlong historic tours of Norfolk in a French vis-a-vis carriage.
With her enormous Belgian horse chomping at the bit, Ms. Denis, elegant in her coachman's hat, guided the carriage up the hill toward the green.
"Business has been a little slow this year as far as hayrides and carriage rides go because of the economy," she said. "The Merchants Association is a great group, because there hasn't been anything cohesive like it. We felt there was a need for everyone to do some referrals back and forth.
"It's critical for us to have people in town be aware of us. And it's nice to have a whole sheet of information to give to guests. There's a lot hidden away here."
As the carriage drew near to the closed railroad station, Ms. Denis said: "The town of Norfolk is so unique. Norfolk has never changed. It still has that old traditional village life. Where else can you go without passing a McDonald's?"

HEADLINE: Leaking Water in Yaphank Dump Stalls Ash-for-Garbage Exchange

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
A CONTROVERSY over a proposed solid-waste agreement between the Towns of Brookhaven and Hempstead is being complicated by the discovery of excess water in the Brookhaven landfill.
The identification of the water, originally feared to be leaks in the liner of the Cell 4 land area, has led the State Environmental Conservation Department to postpone the agreement, which was to have taken effect on June 1. Cell 4 is nicknamed Ski Bowl because of its high hill, inside of which is a carved-out area. 
 Under the pact, known as Ash for Trash, Hempstead would be permitted to bury up to 230,000 tons of ash a year at the Brookhaven landfill, which is in Yaphank. In return, Brookhaven would send 600 tons a day of garbage to the Town of Hempstead incinerator in Garden City.
 
No Environmental Review
 Other municipalities have forged cooperative agreements. Islip and Babylon are trading yard waste and garbage, but the Brookhaven-Hempstead exchange is apparently the first with ash and garbage in the state.
For five years, civic groups and residents near the dump have strongly opposed the proposed exchange, largely because of concerns over the potentially toxic ash to be buried there.
An agreement cannot be enforced or permits issued to the towns without safe conditions, said Assemblyman I. William Bianchi Jr., Democrat of Patchogue. He pointed out that there had been no environmental review of the cell.
When the state serves as the lead agency for a project, an environmental impact statement has always been required, he said, adding that in this case the town of Brookhaven is the lead agency and has not required an environmental review.
"It's a legal and technical point," Assemblyman Bianchi said.
"There is so much water in Cell 4 right now," Mr. Bianchi said, "that if you had a small sailboat, you could sail in it. We're asking the Governor for personal intervention to safeguard the environmental safety at the location."
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has stepped into two related cases. He closed the Port Washington Landfill after many complaints over the odors emanating from the site, and he named Richard M. Kessel ombudsman to investigate smoke and odor problems at the Glen Cove incinerator. The incinerator has been ordered closed for at least a month beginning last Thursday.
Two civic groups have united to hire a lawyer to represent them in their fight against the exchange in Brookhaven. The groups have expressed their opposition at Town Board meetings and in testimony, and the groups have proposed alternatives like recycling and composting.
The state is holding up its approval of the exchange pact until Cell 4 has a new liner and tests determine whether it will prevent leachate from reaching the ground water. Brookhaven garbage is being dumped in the Cell 3 area.
In a double-lined landfill like the one in Yaphank, one liner is on top, and a secondary collection system is between the two liners. Less than 150 gallons of water should come out of the secondary system each day, said Ray Cowen, regional environmental director for the state. The amount has been 800 to 1,000 gallons a day.
The excess water, Mr. Cowen said, may be a combination of water that seeped between the liners during the construction of the landfill and leachate seeping from Cell 1, adjacent to Cell 4.
In the interest of time, Mr. Cowen said, Brookhaven has decided not to repair the secondary liner, but to install a new one. He said the town would then have to certify that the liner is effective and correctly installed, as well as demonstrate that less than 150 gallons a day passed through it.
But many residents voice skepticism that a new liner will be able to handle the ash to be dumped in the landfill. Ash is heavier and more concentrated than raw garbage, which has already been deposited in the landfill, said James Fuchs, president of the Brookhaven Village Association, one of the groups opposing the exchange.
"Four tons of garbage are reduced to one ton of ash," he said. "We are concerned that the concentrated ash will tear the liner and, consequently, pollute the ground water."
An assistant commissioner of environmental conservation, Gary Striar, said that the liners were designed for the weight and that there was no chance that ash would tear the liner.
Mr. Fuchs said the weight of the ash on top of garbage would distort the liner.
The Town of Hempstead has no system to remove toxic substances before burying wastes, Mr. Fuchs said, adding that five schools are within two miles of the dump.
 
Risk to Children
 "No one has done any reports on windblown ash," he said. "We fear that the children will be at risk from ash particles' blowing around in one of the windiest places on the Island.
"The town says that they'll be burying the ash. But it is, in fact, a mountain 200 feet up in the air. Our welfare and safety should be first and foremost. We've given the town documentation, but they don't want to listen."
Brookhaven Deputy Supervisor Peter A. Scully said the ash arrived in concrete form and could not blow around. It hardens in the ground, he added, and it is not very likely to permeate into the ground water.
"There has been a tremendous amount of less-than-accurate information," Mr. Scully said. "Safety requirements for landfills of ash residue are stringent, and we have a great deal of confidence that the exchange will not impact in any way on the water quality."
The battle over the dump has been brewing for years. Opened in the early 70's, it was promoted as an asset that would be used for a finite number of years and then capped, closed and possibly used as a skiing hill like the former Bald Hill Ski Bowl in Farmingville.
 
More Leachate Than Expected
 A liner was installed to prevent leachate from seeping into the ground, and pipes were placed around the edge to collect water and drain it into a designated area. But more leachate was produced than anticipated, and over the years it has overflowed and leaked through the liner.
As far back as 1986, when a proposal was made to turn the landfill into a regional ash-fill site, Brookhaven supported community opposition to the plan, said Lillian Depaolo, another member of the Brookhaven Village Association.
"The Town Board supported us and said they'd never make it a regional dump site," Ms. Depaolo said. "But incineration companies have become big business. Incineration offers a high profit, but is not a good means of eliminating waste."
Federal law has favored incineration, she added, but offered scant tax breaks for recycling or other alternatives.
"This is absolutely a done deal," Ms. Depaolo said. "As a group of civic associations, we have been silenced, and many people in the immediate area do not even know what ash-for-trash is."
 
Divided Views in Hempstead
 Hempstead officials applaud the proposal as a big plus for managing trash and saving considerable tax dollars, said a spokesman for the town, Anthony Santino.
Some residents say they have questions and concerns, but a majority also do not know what ash-for-trash is, said the chairwoman of the Citizens Committee for Civic Action, Viki DeJong.
The town has given the impression that the trade has already begun, she said, adding that informed residents are somewhat concerned about the possible environmental effects on Brookhaven and the economic effects on Hempstead if the ash created problems and Hempstead was forced to look for other alternatives to dispose the ash.
"The ash-for-trash plan is an excellent one," Mr. Cowen said. "Long Island needs to become self-sufficient in solid-waste management, and intermunicipal arrangements are one of the only effective ways to do this. I am not concerned over any health hazards. As a matter of fact, ash is more innocuous than raw garbage."

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
Heard the One About Henny and Recession?

BYLINE: By Nancy Marx Better

 BODY:
A little light touch goes a long way at corporate gatherings in these gloomy days.
ON a stifling Sunday night in late July, 200 people gathered at New York's Pierre Hotel in tuxedos and party dresses for the annual dinner of the Cultured Pearl Association of America. Just after 10:15, the evening's celebrity star, Henny Youngman, broke through the heat and the cigar smoke.
"I feel right at home here," Mr. Youngman told the crowd. "My grandfather had a jewelry business, too. He had an antique watch and on his deathbed guess what he did? He sold it to me." 
 The audience loved it, and that was good news for Jerry Kravat, the entertainment impresario responsible for hiring Mr. Youngman. His New York-based firm, the biggest in the corporate entertainment business, provides everything from opera singers to ice skaters for corporate events -- but fewer stuntmen during this lingering recession. Sending a 150-piece marching band into the Plaza Hotel's ballroom or ordering a unicyclist to ride across a wire in a bank's boardroom is definitely out.
"People aren't asking for as many stunts today," Mr. Kravat said. "They may be too flashy, too 80's."
Indeed, the recession has made many companies more discreet about hiring high-priced entertainers, although they continue to do so. "People are definitely more subtle," he said. "They don't want to rub anybody's nose in it. They want to keep a low profile."
By contrast, stand-up comedians like Mr. Youngman are hot commodities. "People have to lighten up; they're so serious about business these days," said Lee Yoselovsky, co-chairman of the pearl group's dinner and president of Ben Yoselovsky & Company, a New York jewelry company. "We needed a good act this year. We wanted to make people smile."
That's why Mr. Yoselovsky turned to Mr. Kravat, whose business, with 30 full-time employees and sales exceeding $20 million, serves clients like Anheuser Busch, Coca-Cola, DuPont, I.B.M. and Price Waterhouse. Although many companies are cutting costs, Mr. Kravat expects to book more than 1,000 corporate engagements this year, up 15 percent from last year.
"In tough times, people want employees and customers to be happy," Mr. Kravat said. "They don't want to skimp on things that can motivate them to do better work."
Vincent King, senior meeting planner for the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche, which recently held a new-partners dinner-dance at the Waldorf-Astoria, agrees.
"It's important to have quality entertainment," as Mr. King put it. "It lets people know you appreciate their hard work."
Quality entertainment doesn't come cheap. "If you've heard of an artist, he's going to be expensive," said Mr. Kravat. Big-name performers may charge anywhere from $20,000 to $100,000 an appearance, and top stars like Liza Minnelli may command as much as $200,000 for a couple of hours -- plus expenses including airfare, hotel rooms and other incidentals.
But Mr. Kravat, ever the pitchman, says price should not be a deterrent. "I prefer to think of it in reverse," Mr. Kravat said. "It's really inexpensive to bring in Liza Minnelli if she gets the message across to your board of directors or your salespeople."
In the past few months, Mr. Kravat has booked Kid Creole and the Coconuts for a convention of the National Cable Advertisers Association, and Kool and the Gang for a sales meeting held by Pitney Bowes, the computer company. He also landed Patti Lupone for a Fendi perfume introduction, and scheduled Liza Minnelli for a 1993 directors' meeting at a major Midwestern food manufacturer.
Unlike theatrical agents, who receive a percentage of entertainers' pay, Mr. Kravat charges a production fee for each event. This may include arranging lights, sound, housing and transportation -- as well as consulting with the client's top executives about the selection. "You have to match the artist to the event," he said. "You don't want the entertainment to be out of sync with the company's image."
Before signing up an act, Mr. Kravat considers several things. "I ask, 'Who is the audience? What is the message?' " he said. "You wouldn't have a rap group for a staid company, but it could be right on target for a hip, trendy company."
For example, Mr. Kravat booked Yakov Smirnoff, a regular on the talk-show circuit, to perform at a sales meeting of Sanofi Beauty Products Inc. in the spring.
"We have a new fragrance called Tsar," said Joseph R. Messina, Sanofi's vice president for creative services. "We liked the idea of making the connection between a Russian-inspired product and a Russian-born comedian."
And Mr. Smirnoff tailored his material to the cosmetics executives in the audience. "I'd better watch what I say around this group," he told them. "I can't use any dirty words, like Estee Lauder or Calvin Klein or Lancome."
Things don't always run smoothly. Mr. Kravat tells of booking a well-known cabaret singer to perform at the "21" Club for the New York sales representatives of a Texas electronics company. Hours before the event, the performer came down with laryngitis. Panicked, Mr. Kravat called Bobby Short and begged him to substitute. "We sent a limo over to get him at 8:30 and he went on at 9:00," he said. "It could have been a complete disaster if we didn't have a replacement."
Having replacements is one rule of thumb. So is knowing that certain performers are off limits -- regardless of the sponsor.
"If an act is offensive, or ostentatious, it isn't suitable for a business function," Mr. Kravat said. "You want people to enjoy themselves, but you don't want to take any risks."

HEADLINE: Decline in Fish Spurs Moves To Limit Catch

BYLINE: By LEO H. CARNEY

 BODY:
THE populations of several of the most popular species of edible fish have been so severely depleted that state and Federal agencies have begun to draft regulations to reduce the size of the catch for commercial and recreational fishermen off the New Jersey coast.
One such proposal would reduce the allowable catch of fluke and weakfish by more than half, starting next season. Also under consideration is a plan to place limits on fishing of bluefin tuna, mako and other open-sea sharks, sea bass, porgy and bluefish. 
 "Before the end of this decade, every fish species in New Jersey will have some kind of regulation on it," said Thomas P. Fote, president of the 25,000-member New Jersey Coast Anglers Association, a group of recreational fishermen.
With the exception of limits on the taking of surf clams, begun in the late 1970's, and limits on striped bass, begun in 1984, there has never been strict regulation on saltwater fishing off New Jersey.
But marine fisheries experts now say that fish populations probably will have to be subjected to the same conservation measures as land animals and birds have been since the turn of the century.
 
Agreement on Overall Need
 Commercial and recreational fishermen, while they do not all agree on the specific size and catch limitations, agree that there is a need for some regulation to preserve their livelihoods and pastimes.
In 1989, fishing was a $2.1 billion industry in New Jersey, according to the latest figures available from the State Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife.
Statistics provided by a Toms River office of the National Marine Fisheries Service showed that commercial fluke catches alone were generally between 4 million and 6.8 million pounds in New Jersey from 1980 to 1988. By last year, those catches had declined to 1.5 million pounds.
Bruce Freeman, a fisheries biologist and chief researcher for the Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife, said both recreational and commercial fishermen "are fishing to the extent that that we must reduce the allowable catches of fluke and weakfish by 70 percent and 53 percent respectively" in coming years "to protect the immature fish so they can breed once in their lifetimes."
Commercial and recreational regulations calling for new size, catch and season limits on these popular species have been proposed by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, a regional policy group that has jurisdiction of Federal waters 3 to 200 miles offshore, as well as state and interstate commissions that help regulate waters out to 3 miles.
 
Public Hearings Planned
 John C. Bryson, the executive director of the council, said in a telephone interview from Dover, Del., that the council's proposal called for a 25 percent to 50 percent reduction in the catch of weakfish and fluke, beginning next spring. Public hearings on the proposed regulations will be held in Cape May and in Wall Township on Tuesday at 7 P.M.
After the hearings, the fluke and weakfish management plan will be submitted by the council to the United States Department of Commerce. Once approved by the department, the plan and its regulations will be enforced as Federal law by special agents of the National Marine Fisheries Service and conservation officers of the State Department of Environmental Protection, who are also Federal deputies.
Mr. Freeman said compliance by commercial and recreational fishermen was mostly voluntary. But under the new regulations a spot-check of a vessel's dockside catch that revealed violations could result in a fine of up to $100,000, "a considerable incentive to obey the rules," Mr. Freeman said.
Mr. Bryson said, "And there is going to have to be a lot of give-and-take by the recreational and commercial people."
The fluke and weakfish regulations are viewed by experts as merely the beginning of a new wave of regulation that will be extended to species, large and small, to stave off the effects of overharvesting and, to a lesser extend, pollution of the estuaries where the marine species breed.
The National Marine Fisheries Service, the State Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife and their advisory groups, which are made up of recreational and commercial fishermen and scientists, are forming plans to regulate bluefin tuna, mako and other pelagic sharks, sea bass and porgy.
 
Bluefish in Trouble
 In addition, New Jersey has been the only state, Mr. Bryson said, that has not considered the council's 10-catch limit for recreational fishermen on bluefish, which was adopted in 1989. Breeding stocks of bluefish are in trouble along much of the East Coast, he said, and further regulation is being considered.
Axel B. Carlson Jr. of Manasquan, the chairman of the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council and an avid commercial and recreational fisherman since 1937, said he was concerned "about the future of fishing itself because I've seen it going downhill for sometime."
"There are more boats out there fishing in the ocean, both recreational and commercial," he said, "and they are bigger, better equipped with sophisticated electronics, nets and other new gear. After a while they could, indeed, catch that proverbial 'last fish.' "
Comparing the massive catches of fish in New Jersey to hunting in the Wild West, Bill Figley, a fisheries biologist with the State Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife at its Nacote Creek research station, said the spate of new regulations was a sign that "the last of the buffalo hunts are over."
Mr. Freeman and Mr. Bryson said state and Federal surveys showed that small fluke -- 1 to 2 years old -- were being caught in large numbers, thereby reducing the species' potential spawning stocks in the Middle Atlantic States to only 2 percent.
Mr. Freeman said a normal unfished population of fluke required a 20 percent spawning stock to maintain itself. This 20 percent, he said, is normally made up of a variety of year classes up to about 14 years old, with the average spawning fish about 7 or 8 years old.
 
Fluke Minimum Considered
 The council wants to establish a 12-inch minimum size for fluke caught by recreational fishermen and a limit of three fish a day per angler. Commercial fluke fishermen would be subjected to catch quotas for the first time and would be required to use only nets with a 5 1/2-inch mesh, permitting a maximum size of about 14 inches, Mr. Bryson said.
Weakfish would be limited to 10 fish per recreational angler and a maximum size of up to 14 inches and a 5 1/2-inch commercial mesh size would be established, according to some proposals.
Mr. Bryson acknowledged that New Jersey fishermen were adamant about placing regulations on large shrimping vessels in the Carolinas that have a significant incidental catch of small weakfish, which are sold as crab bait. Catching these small fish, New Jersey fishermen say, is one of the major causes for the depletion of the stocks along the East Coast.
"Everything we do here in New Jersey to protect weakfish will be fruitless if there is no size limit placed in the Carolinas," said Raymond Bogan of Point Pleasant, the legal counsel for the United Boatmen of New Jersey and New York, a group that has 320 party and charter boat owners and captains as members.
One of the owners in Point Pleasant Beach is Bob Bogan, a cousin of Raymond Bogan. Bob Bogan said in an interview at sea aboard his vessel, the Gambler, that if state and Federal agencies spent more time and money educating fishermen about dwindling fish populations, there would be less of a need for regulations, which, he said, are too stringent.
He said his clientele had decreased over several years because of a substantial increase in small, privately owned recreational boats.
According to the State Division of Motor Vehicles, there are 164,000 licensed recreational motorboats in New Jersey, excluding most large commercial boats, which are licensed by the Coast Guard.
 
'Fish Don't Have a Chance'
 Mr. Figley, of the State Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife, said the smaller, privately owned recreational vessels had "very sophisticated and very expensive electronic gear like fish finders and radios, and it's devastating; fish don't have a chance."
Raymond Bogan said that because of the difficulties already being experienced by party boats, "the three-fish limit proposed for fluke is absolutely unacceptable to us and we plan to propose a limit of six fish at the hearings."
Commercial fishermen generally approve of the latest regulations "as long as they treat recreational and commercial guys the same," said Nils Stolpe, president of the New Jersey Commercial Fishermen's Association. He said he had seen no evidence that the Magnusson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, passed by Congress in 1976 to protect domestic fishermen from foreign fishing fleets, had done much to conserve fish populations over the years.
 
First Major Attempt
 The act was the nation's first major attempt to regulate coastal fishing. It established authority within the National Marine Fisheries Service and through interstate advisory commissions and councils to assess and set limits on fishing. It also established the Exclusive Economic Zone, known as the E.E.Z., the 200-mile territorial limit that keeps out the foreign vessels.
Mr. Stolpe said the law did "a wonderful job of keeping foreigners out of the E.E.Z., but I don't know of any fish population on the East Coast that's been improved because of it."
Others disagreed. Mr. Figley said the striped bass was the first species whose population had been restored because of the regulations put in place in 1984. Although even more needs to be done to continue to help the striped bass, he said, its success story has inspired many fishermen to be more open and receptive to management plans for other species.
"The buffalo-hunt mentality is slowing dying in New Jersey," Mr. Figley said, "and fishermen at least have begun to accept a new conservation ethic that will be needed if fishing is to survive at all."

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Called Unlikely Soon

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
A continued stalemate between the United States and Western Europe over agricultural subsidies is making the completion of a new global trade agreement increasingly unlikely this year, Administration officials and private trade experts say.
Indeed, the inability of negotiators to agree on new cuts in trade barriers could make it hard for the Bush Administration to win Congressional approval for an agreement before next year's elections. 
 At stake is the opportunity to set global rules for trade that could influence world economic growth into the next century. The question of how to approach agriculture in the talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has bedeviled American negotiators since the current round of negotiations began in Uruguay in 1986.
At the economic summit meeting in London last month, the leaders of the seven leading industrial nations pledged that they would personally try to insure the successful completion this year of the Uruguay Round of talks. But the round was scheduled to end last year, and the summit meeting last summer in Houston produced similar expressions of commitment to free trade without any real compromises.
Even the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, a longtime optimist, sounded a gloomy note at a news conference on Wednesday in Hungary. "I think that it is going to take four, five or six months after we see movement in agriculture to wind up the other 14 areas" of negotiations, Reuters quoted Mrs. Hills as saying.
"So it is possible, but probably not likely, that we would finish precisely on Dec. 31, but I think it is very, very important that we complete our discussion very, very soon thereafter," she added.
 
No New Agreements
 Mrs. Hills had just come from Brussels, where the day before she and Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan had met with their two European Community counterparts. The meeting produced no agreements on how to approach the community's domestic and export subsidies for agricultural products.
The United States and other leading grain exporters have sought the virtual elimination of these subsidies, saying they encourage excessive, inefficient and environmentally destructive production while depressing world prices.
But European countries, led by France, have opposed a reduction in subsidies because such a move could lead to demonstrations, contribute to rural unemployment and make the community's current agricultural policies even more expensive.
 
Paradoxical Effect
 The export subsidies have the paradoxical effect of limiting the cost of the community's agricultural programs. The subsidies allow food bought from farmers at high fixed prices to be resold for part of its current price instead of sitting in warehouses and not being sold at all.
Both the GATT negotiations themselves in Geneva and consultations within the European Community on a compromise position have now been put on hold during August, when many officials go on vacation.
The critical question for many years has been whether Germany is willing to put pressure on France to change its opposition to dropping the subsidies. Herman Otto Solms, the leader of the Free Democratic Party's deputies in the German Parliament, said on a visit to Washington last month that the German Government was moving in this direction.
But the Free Democratic Party is the minority partner in Germany's ruling coalition, and has a history of advocating free trade. Mr. Solms acknowledged that German influence in the community and in Paris might now be muted. "It is a very difficult situation because France is not very fond of the German unification process," he said.
European Community leaders are due to meet next month to review a plan to cut substantially the fixed prices offered to farmers and to encourage their early retirement. But some of the same leaders have been slow to act on less ambitious plans in recent years, so no immediate change in policy is expected.
Mrs. Hills said in a recent interview that she understood the community's political problems in dealing with the opposition to trade liberalization. But the evolution of Western European economies and the soaring cost of agricultural subsidies -- budgeted by the community at $37 billion this year -- means that such support for farmers has "served its day," she added. "It's obsolete; it's wrong now."
 
Potential Political ProbLem
 Delays by the European leaders are creating a potential political problem for the Administration. Before a final agreement can be submitted to Congress, accompanying legislation must be drafted to amend United States laws and Government programs that do not comply. Drafting this legislation is likely to take at least three months, Congressional experts estimate.
The "fast track" procedures for the consideration of such trade pacts then call for Congress to vote on the agreement within about four months. So even if an agreement were finished at the end of this year, a final vote would be unlikely until late next summer. Each month of delay in international negotiations pushes the vote another month closer to next year's elections.
Trade agreements tend to be controversial even outside of election years. Industries facing the loss of their protection from imports have a greater incentive to lobby than industries that may share hard-to-measure future gains from free trade.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Scanning the Sky Over Mexico's Parade

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
In struggling to see the future of the stock market in Mexico, investors abroad have faced an unusual quandry: not only has the market's trajectory been steadily upward, its pace has quickened. For those who turn to the closed-end funds that invest in Mexican stocks, their steady ascent raises questions about how long the dizzying growth can be sustained.
So far, there are few signs of a pause. After grabbing attention with its generally strong performances in 1988, 1989 and 1990, for example, the 10-year-old Mexico Fund, managed by a Mexico City investment firm, has jumped an additional 78 percent so far this year. And after sputtering debuts in the second half of last year, two New York-based funds that invest in Mexican stocks have hit stride. 
 The Emerging Mexico Fund, which includes some unlisted companies and second-tier stocks as well as some of the best-known plays on the Bolsa, as the Mexican market is called, has climbed 79.5 percent this year. At the end of June, it ranked fourth -- just above the Mexico Fund -- on the Miami investor Thomas J. Herzfeld's list of the top-performing country funds.
By comparison, the Mexico Equity and Income Fund has struggled, even though its 31.6 percent rise since January is hardly anemic. The fund had planned to invest about half its assets in convertible-debt securities, but after almost a year its managers have found only one issue they wanted to buy. Even now, 51 percent of its assets are invested in equities and 37 percent in bonds.
With all the good news, Mr. Herzfeld and other analysts have been hearing voices. "Everybody wants to know," he said, "'Where's the bad news?' "
But conversations with a dozen analysts and investors around the United States indicate there is relatively little bad news about Mexican stocks to be found.
"The fact that the local market was up 73 percent in dollar terms in the first six months of the year means that a lot of the good news is already in," acknowledged William Dinning, an investment strategist at Paine Webber Inc., the lead underwriter of the Emerging Mexico Fund. But Mr. Dinning and other analysts say that does not mean investors should now look elsewhere. Instead, the analysts say, investors should begin looking at Mexico differently.
"To go in at this point -- at least if you have a short-term perspective -- is not that attractive," said Antoine W. van Agtmael, president of Emerging Markets Management in Washington. "But for the long run, the Mexican market remains extremely attractive."
On the landscape of emerging markets, where some risks loom like mountains and others nestle in their shadows, concerns about Mexico have not disappeared.
The country's current account deficit has risen steadily, to a projected $7 billion this year from $1.7 billion in 1986. And even though the Government has continued its slow mini-devaluation of the peso, some economists still consider the currency overvalued.
Still, the developments that have sparked foreign interest in Mexico have not been merely frequent, analysts say, they have been fundamental.
As President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has sold off state companies and loosened restrictions on foreign investment, he has nearly closed the budget deficit, which not so long ago stood at 17 percent of gross national product. And inflation has been falling, down to 29.9 percent last year from 160 percent in 1987. This year the inflation rate is expected to slip below 20 percent.
While bankers have not forgotten about the roughly $80 billion that Mexico owes abroad, the debt has meant relatively little to investors since early last year, when Mexico became the first Latin debtor nation to embrace the Brady Plan, named for Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady; the plan provides a framework for reducing and revamping a nation's debt in return for economic reforms by the debtor nation. And even more encouraging news has come this year from Washington, where Congress has voted to give the Bush Administration "fast track" authority to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico.
With foreign involvement already the principal engine in the $42 billion Mexican market, the attraction for investors "is the recognition that there is stability in Mexico," said Luis R. Luis, a Latin America analyst at Scudder, Stevens & Clark in Boston.
The stability has already drawn more conservative institutional investors like pension funds to both the closed-end funds and to Mexican blue-chip stocks like the state telephone company, Telefonos de Mexico, known as Telmex; Cemex, Mexico's leading cement company, and Kimberley-Clark de Mexico. But to some investors with longer experience in Mexico -- players who boast of having bought what are now nearly $4 shares of Telmex at less than one-tenth that price three years ago -- stabilization means the time has come to look elsewhere.
"The guys like me who were looking at Mexico five years ago are now looking at Argentina and Brazil," said Charles H. Brandes, a San Diego investment adviser.
And Douglas A. Campbell, an institutional broker in Los Angeles who has specialized in Mexico since 1986, said, "Let me assure you, the great gains in Mexico are behind us."
Whether Mexican equity funds remain good values is another matter.
Though all the Mexico funds are still discounted, with their prices below the values of their net assets, the discounts vary. The discount on the Mexico Fund, which several analysts pronounced unattractive at less than 5 percent, now stands at a more alluring 10 percent. The Emerging Mexico Fund is discounted by 13.2 percent, and the Equity and Income Fund by 13.56 percent.
Judging the stocks by the ratios of their prices to earnings prompts even more debate. At average prices of 15 or 16 times 1990 earnings, the market already looks expensive to some.
But other investors, who value the stocks at 11 to 13 times projected earnings, find the multiples seductive by comparison to those of emerging markets in Asia, where stocks routinely reach price-earnings ratios of 30 of more.
That can be a tricky comparison, however. Many investors who use it to label Mexican stocks cheap are betting on a continued strong rise in the market. They predict that the Mexican economy will jump from last year's 3.9 percent to an average of 6 percent during the 1990's, as the country's long-repressed consumers gain buying power. Some economists, however, consider such numbers optimistic, if not fanciful.
All of the investors and analysts interviewed expected some market correction down the road. Many considered current demand for the stocks to be inflated, with high turnover rates. (Jose Luis Gomez Pimienta, president of the Mexico Fund, said about 70 percent of the fund's shares had already traded hands this year.)
In the meantime, while one advantage of the closed-end funds rises and ebbs with the size of their discounts, another has seemed almost to disappear. When compared with markets in Brazil, Chile and Argentina, which foreign investors are hard pressed to play on their own, the Bolsa looks positively inviting. More foreign investors might be tempted to bypass the equity funds and invest in shares of specific Mexican companies.
With the opening of Mexico's economy, foreigners are allowed to purchase nonvoting stock directly and other stocks through trusts. Many blue-chip issues -- which, unlike the funds, consistently outperform the market as a whole -- are now offered through American depository receipts, which investors in the United States can buy through American stock exchanges.
In Mexico City, Mr. Pimienta argued that the diversification of his portfolio will provide some insurance if the market falls. But he acknowledged that not all his biggest clients seemed to care.
"I think some of the big players in the Mexico Fund are now going directly into Mexican stocks," he said.

An Odyssey Ends With a Homecoming to Greece

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ACHARNAI, Greece

 BODY:
The sun is roasting the rugged slopes of Mount Parnes, driving families into the strips of shade next to their hot, new cement homes. From the sandy road, this looks like another fresh urban explosion north of Athens.
But telltale crates covered with Cyrillic writing sit in almost every yard. Ask the people who arrived with the crates where they traveled from and they give names of far-off Soviet cities in the Ukraine, Georgia and even Kazakhstan. Many have spent days riding by train from Central Asia or aboard freighters crossing the Black Sea. Yet no one is complaining. For the tens of thousands of newcomers, what matters most is that they have come home. 
 They are the Pontians, or ethnic Greeks of Eastern Europe, a people whose plight has attracted little attention over the nearly 70 years since many of them were forced to flee from Turkey to the Soviet Union and were then persecuted and resettled by Stalin. Now, feeling insecure and harassed by nationalists in several Soviet republics, many have once more had to start a new life.
Arriving at a rate of more than 1,000 a month, they have been able to move because Moscow has eased travel restrictions. The Greek Government says that of the Soviet Union's 500,000 ethnic Greeks, about 30,000 have arrived here in the last two years. Many more are expected.
 
'I've Come Home'
 "Yes, I've come home," exulted Dimitris Apatzides, displaying four gold-framed teeth and explaining that he was born in Kazakhstan, the place where Stalin sent his parents. There he had driven a farm tractor until his family decided they could no longer bear hostility against Greeks.
"The police, the neighbors kept telling us go back to your own country," he said. "Our women were afraid to go out after dark."
Pontians, though, are only some of the refugees pouring through mountain passes or landing in the harbors of Greece. Upheaval among the neighbors to the north, the Government says, has brought perhaps as many as 150,000 newcomers in the last two years.
Among them are about 50,000 immigrants who who came from Albania this year, close to half of them ethnic Greeks. As many as 8,000 Romanian gypsies, Government officials said, have moved into Greece's traditional gypsy camps. Thousands of Bulgarians and Poles have come as tourists or traders and have stayed to look for jobs. The police say undocumented travelers regularly arrive from Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
"We are a door to the West and many people just see us as a first stop," said Vlassis Socratides, who leads an organization that helps returning Greek-Albanians. "Some want to stay but many want to go to America."
Nonetheless, the influx is causing controversy in this nation of 10 million people. By European standards, this country is sparsely populated and Greeks are rarely xenophobic. But they are used to seeing foreigners as tourists bringing money rather than as dependents or competitors.
Greeks still see their country as a disadvantaged nation that remains entitled to help and favorable treatment from richer European neighbors to the west. But while the treasury may be depleted because of past Government mismanagement, Greece looks enticing to its Balkan neighbors. This is a realm where cars and modern gadgets are as normal as a busy taverna, a land where one in three families owns a second home.
Several Socialist newspapers have therefore prodded Greeks to be generous and recalled that Greece itself until recently sent hundreds of migrant workers to northern Europe or to settle in North America. But critics have charged that the newcomers are aggravating unemployment, crime and health problems. The Government is seeking $2 billion in refugee aid from the European Community.
Generous or not, some Greeks have welcomed the new flow of cheap labor. An Athenian businessmen boasted that he had hired an Albanian gardener for half the going rate. "You pay a Greek cleaner $25 per day," said Eleni Floros, a shopkeeper. "We can now get Polish help for $18 and Albanian for $15."
 
'People Do Not Trust Us'
 One morning on Omonia Square, the busy heart of Athens and current labor market for refugees, clusters of Albanian men sat around, looking gloomy. Adriano Gjinis, a 26-year old farmhand from Argyrokastron in southern Albania said he had walked a day and a half to cross the border, slept outdoors, washed dishes and cleaned floors and gardens but could not land a steady job. "People do not trust us," he said, "and landlords think we cannot pay the rent."
Besides, there was nervousness around Omonia as word spread of new police roundups. This year, the police have deported more than 10,000 Albanians who have come without documents.
The Pontian Greeks have had a slightly warmer reception, even though a cultural divide exists. Pontians, by some accounts, take their name from their homeland, Pontus, the ancient kingdom on the south shore of the Black Sea. Many were forced into Greece in 1922 after Turkey's wars with the Greeks and Russians. Others fled to Russia, where they kept their religion, music and language, an archaic form of Greek.
"We are well -- we only wish we had electricity," said Sofia Kianzeva, who came from Sochume, Georgia, and brought her own prefabricated house because she could not bring rubles. Now unpacked, the modest wooden home stands in the new Pontian neighborhood on the slopes of Mount Parnes. It is full of Georgian beds and chairs to accommodate her four daughters, their husbands and her three grandchildren. Some fellow Pontians have had to sell their rugs and samovars in the Athens flea markets to make ends meet.
For its part, the Greek Government is working on new settlement plans. It has started sending groups of Pontians, most of whom are Greek Orthodox, to the northern province of Thrace. There they are to provide a balance for the Turkish Muslim minority. The Turkish Government has protested. Greece has replied that this is an internal affair.

HEADLINE: Fearing Bad Harvest, Gorbachev Moves to Spur Imports of the Basics

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Concerned about the dearth of consumer goods as another worrisome harvest approaches, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev issued an executive order tonight restricting luxury imports and easing customs duties to spur imports of food, medicine and other badly needed basics.
In effect, the Soviet leader was testing his improving relations with the republics by attempting a device -- the executive order -- that was widely ignored a year ago when the economy plummeted and he was deep in a power-sharing fight with the republics. 
 In this new order, Mr. Gorbachev, who has been negotiating a new union treaty of closer relations with the republics, called on the republics and the central Government in the Kremlin to "haul the country's economy out of crisis" with a series of measures ranging from factory incentives to republic bartering, all directed at bracing the life of the battered Soviet consumer.
As the order was announced, the now familiar annual warning about "a real threat of famine" was being issued by Mr. Gorbachev's chief economic officer, First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Shcherbakov, who implored the nation to pitch in and see that this year's grain harvest was a success.
 
Good Crop Last Year
 Similar invocations of famine fears a year ago by the Government proved unfounded as a bumper crop partly compensated for breakdowns in the delivery and storage system that allowed thousands of tons of produce to rot before it could be delivered to packing houses, mills and store shelves.
Soviet consumers scrambled through another demoralizing season of hunting and foraging for needed goods whose shortages were severe but somewhere short of a threat to life.
"There is no time for idle talk," Mr. Shcherbakov declared on television in what the Soviet public takes as a mid-summer pep talk as the grain waits for harvesting. "Everything has to be done to bring the harvest in."
The Bush Administration has had a team of technical specialists visiting the hinterlands in an attempt to recommend improvements for the badly outdated and overcentralized Soviet farm distribution and storage systems.
Mr. Gorbachev made no mention of this or of the broad technical advice pledged to the last month at the London summit meeting of the seven major free-market democracies.
 
Short-Range Help
 But instead of dealing with the longer-range plans for transition to a market economy, the Soviet leader focused on testing once more whether there was enough cooperation between the central Government and the republics to patch together special short-range help this year for the consumer.
On one level, Mr. Gorbachev's order is intended to offer a bit of consumer hope to the public as it awaits the deeper economic changes that President Gorbachev promised during the Group of Seven summit talks last month. The precise nature and timing of those plans, after six years of floundering reconstruction, have not been announced, but the public is bracing for the pains that they are likely to inflict.
The omnibus package of measures that Mr. Gorbachev cited in his order were all directed at consumer shortages, as were similar orders a year ago that proved ineffective. This time, the Soviet leader decreed that more raw materials should be channeled by the Government to consumer goods industries, and that the nation's scarce hard currency supplies would be devoted "first and foremost" to the basics: grain, medicines, building supplies and spare parts for household goods.
 
Extra Incentives
 No longer able to dictate economic life as his predecessors did, Mr. Gorbachev sought in his order to encourage the republics to offer extra profit incentives to farmers who do well with the harvest and to factories that lift consumer production.
He also authorized the auction of unfinished consumer factories to independent bidders, including foreign investors, in order to speed construction and increase consumer output.
The order included some general language urging the speeding up of the "denationalization" and "demonopoly" steps toward a market economy. But once again there was no precise definition of whether Mr. Gorbachev was moving wholeheartedly toward the idea of private property that critics stress is basic for market economics.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Press Notes;
Little Rock newspaper War May Be Heading for a Truce

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
WHEN the Gannett Company bought The Arkansas Gazette in Little Rock for $60 million in 1986, the popular wisdom within the industry was that Gannett would make short work of the rival Arkansas Democrat, which was smaller and locally owned.
But it has not turned out that way. 
 Indeed, speculation has begun to mount that Gannett might be considering a joint operating arrangement with The Democrat, in which the production, advertising and circulation operations would be merged, but the news operations would stay separate.
In a J.O.A., as the arrangements are known, both money-losing papers would be able to raise advertising and circulation rates and become profitable. Both now appear in the morning, but under such an arrangement one would likely be shifted to the less-desirable afternoon position.
Walter E. Hussman Jr., the owner and publisher of The Democrat, said he would enter a joint operating ar rangement with Gannett only if he became the senior partner, with the final say in all business affairs, including which paper moves to the afternoon.
"I won't do a J.O.A. if I can't control it," said Mr. Hussman, who makes up The Democrat's losses with profits from his cable televi sion systems and other businesses of his Wehco Media group. He added that he had not discussed the subject with Gannett.
The prospect of being a junior partner in a joint operating arrangement is something Gannett "would definitely not prefer," said Shiela Gibbons, a Gannett spokesman.
But if Gannett is to make a profit in Little Rock, that may be the only way. In 1986, The Gazette's circulation exceeded The Democrat's by 45,000 daily, and by 14,000 on Sunday, the Audit Bureau of Circulations reports.
Though circulation has grown at both papers, The Gazette's average weekday circulation of 134,000 is barely ahead of The Democrat's, at 132,000, and The Democrat outsells The Gazette 236,000 to 222,000 on Sunday, which is the most important day of the week for advertising.
And everyone agrees that The Democrat now has the greater share of advertising.
In a frantic effort to increase Sunday sales last year, The Gazette offered home delivery on Sunday for $6.50 a year, or 12.5 cents a Sunday. The Democrat of fers free classified ads to readers selling baby car riages, cars and such. The Gazette followed suit. But none of it worked very well.
In May, Gannett brought Moe Hick ey, a former pub lisher of The De troit News, out of retirement to run The Gazette. Mr. Hickey stopped giving away clas sifed ads, raised the price of the Sunday paper, and said he was "taking the long hard road back to selling advertising for what it's worth."
Such moves could reduce what analysts estimate is a $5 million annual deficit at The Gazette, but it could also open the door for The Democrat to widen its lead.
In Detroit, Mr. Hickey helped guide The News to a J.O.A. with The Free Press, and his experience in that regard has not gone unnoticed in Little Rock. He declined comment on the prospects of a J.O.A. there.
 
A Glut of Newsprint
 In a newspaper landscape nearly barren of advertising and rife with competitors, there is one sweet spring of relief: the low, low price of newsprint. If the newspaper publishing business is bad, the newsprint business is terrible -- at least for the manufacturers.
"This may be the worst time since World War II," said George B. Adler, a forest-products analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
In January, many newsprint producers tried to raise the price to $710 a metric ton, but had to roll back the official price to $685. And the decline in advertising combined with a glut of newsprint has prompted further discounts of up to 23 percent.
As a result, newsprint is selling below what it cost in 1987. Indeed, with the inflation factor removed, newsprint is trading at levels equivalent to those before 1970. Mr. Adler said that prices could go even lower.
For newspapers, especially the big chains that can buy in great volume, such prices offer the windfall of a decline in one of their larger annual costs. For instance, John Morton, an newspaper analyst at Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington, said 17.1 percent of Knight-Ridder Inc.'s total operating expense in 1990 was spent on newsprint, compared with 19.3 percent in 1989. With advertising down, he said, Knight-Ridder will need less newsprint this year, and it will cost even less because demand is so slack.
Newsprint companies are in a terrible bind. When newsprint demand was at its peak in the late 1980's, the companies committed millions of dollars to build new mills that would increase production. But demand has declined steadly since 1989. The American Newspaper Publishers Association reported that newsprint consumption in the United States dropped more than 8 percent for the first four months of this year, compared with 1990 levels.
 
Furloughs vs. Layoffs
 The Philadelphia Inquirer and Newsday have started offering voluntary unpaid leaves as a way to cut labor costs without layoffs.
At both newspapers, the programs have been available only to employees not covered by labor contracts that included specific manning levels, like those for pressmen. In general, the programs have been limited to news, advertising, clerical and other employees whose absence would not require overtime or a replacement.
"It's a hell of a lot better than layoffs," said James M. Naughton, managing editor of The Inquirer, which is owned by Knight-Ridder Inc..
Early this year, The Inquirer and its sister publication, The Philadelphia Daily News, notified the 1,500 eligible employees that they could take up to six months of unpaid leave. They would not be guaranteed of receiving the same jobs upon their return, but they would retain such benefits as insurance during the leave.
"You don't need to have a good cause, so long as we can afford to let you go," Mr. Naughton said, describing the paper's policy. Thus far, about 34 employees have taken advantage of the offer, which is ongoing.
Newsday, which is owned by the Times Mirror Company, has offered unpaid leaves of up to three months to about 2,900 of its 3,900 employees at both its Long Island and New York City operations, provided they get the approval of their supervisors.
Newsday is also allowing employees to extend their weekends this summer by taking Fridays and Mondays off, without pay of course.
Chiara Coletti, a Newsday spokesman, said 111 employees have exercised the option, including 30 from the news staff, who have tended to take extended leaves.
Advertising employees, she said, favored the long weekend.

HEADLINE: Strike Aims to Bleed Cameroon's Economy to Force President's Fall

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: DOUALA, Cameroon

 BODY:
The shuttered boutiques along Douala's broad boulevards and the empty berths of its port seem poised for a long holiday.
There are no taxis and few cars in the streets. Except for small clusters of people trudging along the roadside in the blistering sun, little stirs. 
 The commercial life of this once-thriving city has largely stopped since an anti-Government coalition called a general strike in late June. Opposition leaders talk of Douala as a "ghost city," and of this Central African nation of 11 million people as a "dead country."
The aim of the strikers is to bleed the economy slowly, and to keep the Government of Paul Biya, Cameroon's President for the last nine years, off balance. The opposition seems to sense some vulnerability in the Government and is hoping to bring about a change.
"What we aim to do is to bring down Biya," said Alexander Taku, a spokesman for a coalition of 24 political parties. Most of the parties gained legal status only within the last six months.
"Our strategy has been to make it impossible for the Government to pay the salaries of the civil servants," said Mr. Taku, an American-trained political scientist, noting that the Government was losing revenue from the closings of shops and other businesses.
Opposition leaders say they will not end the strike unless Mr. Biya convenes a national conference of political groups at which accusations of abuses under Mr. Biya's autocratic rule would be aired. Mr. Biya has repeatedly rejected calls for such a conference.
What makes the opposition's quest for change so hard-hitting is that this port is a conduit not only for Cameroon, but for the trade of landlocked countries like Chad and the Central African Republic.
While the strike in Cameroon is ambitious, it has its accommodating side. The clampdown on business activity extends from Monday to Friday, with weekends set aside to allow people to shop and run errands.
 
Only the Capital Is Spared
 "There are a lot of people suffering, but no one's starving because of the strike -- at least not yet," an African diplomat here said. So far, only Yaounde, Cameroon's capital and administrative center, and the region surrounding it have been spared the effects of the strike. Diplomats say at least seven of Cameroon's 10 provinces have been effectively shut down.
James Onibiono, an entrepreneur in Douala who is also a member of the ruling party's Central Committee, said, "I had expected the strike would last for one or two days and maybe stop, but there seems to be no limit to it."
One reason the strike has been so effective, Mr. Onibiono and other business leaders say, is that protesters seem to have targeted prominent enterprises. Mr. Onibiono's eight-story headquarters has been attacked twice and extensively damaged since the strike began.
"Instead of attacking the leaders of the ruling party," Mr. Onibiono complained, the opposition "is attacking everybody."
Abodel Karimou, editor in chief of The Gazette, a weekly newspaper in Douala, said that while there is scattered support for the strike, "most people are simply afraid," and are staying away from their jobs because of the threat of retribution.
Opposition leaders say the Government has been brutal in quelling peaceful protests, with at least 40 people killed in demonstrations in recent months. Government officials say that figure is highly inflated.
Cameroon is one of several African countries -- ranging from Mauritania, Mali and the Ivory Coast to Zaire and Tanzania -- where opposition movements have challenged single-party or military regimes since the beginning of the year.
Mr. Biya has generally been cautious in yielding to any demands for greater political freedom. But he has retreated in recent months from his once-adamant opposition to multiparty politics.
In April he announced that legislative elections would be held before the end of the year and that a new prime minister would be appointed. He also promised to call a special session of the National Assembly to draft revisions in the Constitution and a new election code, and pledged an amnesty for political prisoners.
The opposition gives Mr. Biya little credit for those developments, saying that he acted out of political necessity.
But some citizens express apprehension about the tactics of the opposition leaders. "It's one thing to want to get rid of Biya," said a schoolteacher here, "but it doesn't make sense to ruin the economy in trying to do so."
During the first half of the 1980's, oil brought Cameroon an average annual growth rate of 7 percent, the highest on the continent. Oil also brought skyscrapers to this muggy port, a fast rail link inland to Yaounde, and, for the first time, television.
Cameroon became black Africa's No. 3 oil exporter, after Nigeria and Angola. But the boom years ended abruptly in 1986. As world prices for major export commodities like oil, cocoa, coffee and cotton tumbled, export earnings were halved.
Mr. Biya has taken tentative steps to resuscitate the economy in recent months, including cuts in the salaries and benefits of civil servants to reduce Government spending.
Government officials say they plan to announce other austerity measures recommended by the International Monetary Fund. But the general strike has offset any gains expected from the economic program.
"In the short term, the opposition has got the upper hand, and Biya seems on his way out," a student of Cameroon politics said. "In the long run, though, we're sinking further and further into economic chaos."

HEADLINE: Japan May Delay Buying U.S. Military Planes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 4

 BODY:
In what may be the start of a new dispute between Tokyo and Washington over military technology, Japanese officials say they may be forced to delay or cancel plans to buy a fleet of American-made surveillance aircraft.
The purchase of the Airborne Early Warning and Control System, or Awacs, planes has drawn considerable political attention on Capitol Hill -- for reasons of trade as much as national security. Earlier this year, 70 Representatives and Senators pressed the Bush Administration to get Japan to buy a large fleet of the aircraft, which would cost billions of dollars. 
 In the past, Japan has said it was willing to buy four planes in a package estimated at about $1 billion. But they now say the price of the aircraft has soared because the Boeing Company has begun to close its Awacs production line in the absence of new orders.
 
Underlying Political Issues
 "It now looks as if it will cost far, far more than anyone expected," a senior official of Japan's Defense Agency said last week, after several newspapers here reported that the plans would be delayed or shelved. "So we are reconsidering the whole program."
An American official familiar with the negotiations said it was "now 50-50" whether Japan would buy the four planes.
While Japanese officials are trying to discuss the Awacs purchase in purely economic terms, some political issues underlie the debate.
The aircraft are a crucial element in American plans to get Japan to assume a greater responsibility for patrolling its air space and sea lanes. But there is some question about how quickly Japan plans to fulfill its commitment to patrol sea lanes up to 1,000 miles from its borders.
So far, the country's ability to project power beyond its shores has been sharply limited by interpretations of its Constitution, which was written by the United States and was intended to check the kind of expansionism that led Japan into World War II. Those same interpretations have meant that Japan has no aircraft carriers or bombers; both are considered offensive weapons.
 
Bitterness Lingers Over FSX
 In 1981, the Japanese Government committed itself to defending its surrounding sea and air lanes, and the Defense Agency used that as the basis for a huge increase in the Japanese military budget. Now Japan's self-defense role is made more urgent by the reduction of the United States military presence in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.
Some Japanese, however, have urged a slower pace, saying that the delicate issue of Japanese military power is getting increasing attention in Asia from the continuing discussions in Parliament over whether the Japanese military can -- or should -- participate in international peace-keeping forces.
The Awacs purchase is also being discussed just as the Bush Administration and the Japanese Government are trying to move past the bitterness generated by the last big Japanese acquisition of military aircraft technology from the United States. Two years ago, plans to license Japan to build the FSX, a new fighter plan based on the F-16, touched off months of arguments in Congress over whether America was "giving away" critical technology that Japan would later turn to commercial purposes.
After President Bush interceded, an agreement was worked out that gave a larger role in the production of the aircraft to the General Dynamics Corporation, the maker of the F-16. But over the last two years the cost of the FSX has doubled, in part because the Japanese must themselves develop crucial components that the United States refused to transfer.
The Awacs, however, is a different kind of deal. Unlike the FSX, the Awacs would be imported from the United States, not made in Japan. In the past, the Japanese have ordered no Awacs, though they do fly 13 of the E2-C Hawkeye short-range radar aircraft made by the Grumman Corporation.
 
Congressional Pressure
 In a letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d earlier this year, members of Congress insisted that to cover "the vast area Japan has agreed to defend requires betwen 12 and 14 Awacs planes and at least 20 tankers."
That figure, however, appeared rooted more in trade considerations than in security concerns. "What we have been talking about is four -- no more," said a Japanese official.
Now, even those four are imperiled. Boeing is delivering the last of its Awacs orders, to Britain. Although there has been talk of additional purchases by the United States and Saudi Arabia, there have been no new orders in years. Boeing says it has begun to pack away equipment and gradually close its production line. As a result, the price of restarting the line to build the Japanese aircraft has increased greatly.
 
Japanese Budget Deadline Near
 Over the last two weeks, as Japan's end-of-August budget deadlines near, there have been frantic efforts to save the project, including attempts to get Boeing to lower the price.
"We think we could solve it if the Americans and the Saudis also ordered planes," the Japanese official involved in the controversy said.
One option would be to delay the purchase, but that might result in making the warning aircraft even more expensive later on. Another would be to buy a stripped-down version of the Awacs, or to find another surveillance aircraft. But none of the others are as capable as the Awacs, Japanese officials say.
The final decision seems likely to be made by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and his Cabinet. In the past, Mr. Kaifu has been inclined to give in eventually to American pressure, even at considerable economic cost to Japan, as he did when Japan contributed $13 billion to the Persian Gulf war effort.
But with growing impatience here over American trade demands, and an election for the leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party approaching, Mr. Kaifu's intervention on behalf of American aircraft makers may be subdued.

HEADLINE: Cabinet Backs Shamir on Peace Talks

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Cabinet gave resounding approval today to his conditional agreement to attend a Middle East peace conference under American and Soviet auspices.
Sixteen Cabinet ministers backed the the agreement that the Prime Minister reached on Thursday with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, but three ministers led by Housing Minister Ariel Sharon voted against Mr. Shamir. 
 The Israeli radio reported that the four-hour session was marked by personal argument between the Prime Minister and Mr. Sharon, both members of the Likud party. The hard-line Housing Minister accused his leader of having "fixed" the outcome with Mr. Baker before they met. Mr. Shamir responded by charging his rival with being motivated by lust for power.
 
Sharon Sees 'Big Lie'
 Interviewed after the session, Mr. Sharon denounced the Government for placing trust in an apparent change of heart by President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, who in his meeting with Mr. Baker reversed Syria's rigid stand against negotiations with Israel.
He called Mr. Assad a "tyrant like Saddam Hussein" and termed his assent to the conference "a big lie."
Science Minister Yuval Neeman and Minister Without Portfolio Rehavam Zeevi, who represent small parties that reject any compromise with the Arabs living in the occupied territories, also voted against the Prime Minister.
In giving his approval to Mr. Baker, Mr. Shamir said Israel would attend only if the Palestinian representatives at the conference were not members of the Palestine Liberation Organization or residents of East Jerusalem, which Israel has annexed. When they met with Mr. Baker on Friday, Palestinian leaders made participation contingent on American guarantees that would in effect nullify Israel's restrictions.
 
P.L.O. Believed Ready
 Despite this apparently irreconcilable difference, Palestinians interviewed today in East Jerusalem expressed a belief that the P.L.O. had decided to accept a formula discussed with the United States that would permit Palestinian participation.
[In Tunis, a spokesman for the P.L.O. said that the Palestinians were "ready to attend" the session and that no obstacle was "big enough" to keep them away.]
"The Palestinians have to choose between another Camp David or trying to improve the conditions while accepting the present peace process," said Radwan Abu Ayyash, a journalist considered a possible representative for the Palestinians at negotiations. "I think they have chosen the second option."
Mr. Assad's agreement to take part in the peace process without exacting a solution to the Palestinian question has awakened angry memories of what the Palestinians view as their betrayal by President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt. In 1978, he concluded a separate peace with Israel at the American Presidential retreat at Camp David.
Mr. Abu Ayyash, speaking in the office of his Arab Media Center, said that he believed that the people of the occupied territories placed little faith in the possibility of a positive outcome, but that intellectuals believed that Palestinians could not afford not to take part.
The Palestinians said the P.L.O. leadership would adhere to its position that no one could interfere in its independent right to choose its conference delegates. But without directly conceding the point, the Palestinians conveyed the view that the P.L.O. would not choose representatives who would fall under Israel's veto. They made clear, however, that such a compromise must not be construed as a concession to Israel's claim that its annexation of East Jerusalem is irreversible.
"To give up on Jerusalem would be not only a national sin but a religious, historical and spiritual sin," Mr. Abu Ayyash said. "Jerusalem is a rose that everybody has a right to smell, but nobody can pick it for himself."
On Friday, after three Palestinian leaders spent four hours in difficult discussions with Mr. Baker, they and other Palestinians in East Jerusalem concentrated their arguments on their right to choose their representatives. Today, , they appeared to shelve that issue, focusing their discussions on a demand that Israeli settlement in the occupied territories must stop no later than the beginning of a peace conference, which is sought for October.
"They rob the land under my feet," said Hanna Siniora, editor of the newspaper Al Fajr, who is considered a spokesman for moderate nationalists.
Mr. Siniora, who just returned from a visit to the United States, said a halt to settlement was more vital than the issue of who represented the Palestinians. "If this is not provided, there is no use going to the conference table," he said. "The Israelis will continue to delay until in 10 years there is nothing left to negotiate about."
The leaders interviewed expressed pessimism on the outcome of negotiations because, they said, they were facing not only Israeli intransigence but also a lack of support from Arab nations. They spoke critically of Mr. Assad's agreement to meet with Israel without exacting conditions favorable to the Palestinian cause as a price.
The Palestinians acknowledged that the P.L.O.'s support for Iraq in the Persian Gulf war was the critical factor in its lowered standing and placed a low ceiling on their expectations from the peace process. But only Mr. Siniora went so far as to call the organization's stand a "big mistake."
Prof. Saeb Erakat, a political scientist at An Najah University in Nablus and a participant in earlier talks with Mr. Baker, said, "We may not have the power to get the solution that we want, but we have the power to prevent a solution that we don't want."
Professor Erakat hinted at an increase in violence resulting from Palestinian frustration. Speaking of what he called Mr. Shamir's "economic war" against the Arabs of the occupied territories, he said: "He thinks Palestinians will carry their bags and leave. Actually, in such a war, if you had a knife factory, you might as well build another branch."
Violence against the Palestinian leaders taking part in the negotiations with the United States was threatened by the Islamic Holy War organization in the Gaza Strip in a leaflet distributed today on Gaza's streets. They threatened Faisal al-Husseini, who led the negotiators with Mr. Baker, and his colleagues, Hanan Ashrawi and Zakaria al-Agha, with assassination.
Mr. Abu Ayyash said the threat must be taken seriously. Islamic Holy War is regarded as responsible for much violence against Arab moderates or those suspected of collaboration with Israel.

HEADLINE: Japan's New Finance Official Plots an Independent Course

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 4

 BODY:
When Tadao Chino won a scholarship to study economics at Stanford University during Japan's dark postwar years, he leapt at the chance. "The United States was the model of success that Japan had to learn from," he recalled.
Now Mr. Chino, who is 57 years old, takes a far different view of the country he once idolized. He is the newly appointed Vice Minister of Finance for international affairs, which makes him the top financial policy maker for the world's largest creditor nation, and he promises to chart a course that is defiantly independent from the United States. 
 In an interview last week in his large, sparsely furnished office, Mr. Chino indicated that Japan would become even more assertive in pushing its financial objectives, whether in the World Bank, among the Group of Seven industrial democracies or in trade negotiations with the United States.
Mr. Chino, a genial yet cautious man who is 57 years old, is at the head of a generation of Japanese that has reshaped Japan's international financial policy, much as the Ministry of International Trade and Industry developed and implemented Japan's now-famous industrial strategy.
These financial experts seek to insure that the tens of billions of dollars in capital Japan sends abroad every year -- to buy everything from United States Treasury bonds to Hollywood movie studios -- contribute to the Government's policy goals and strengthen Japan's economy.
In perhaps his most significant comment, Mr. Chino said Japan wanted to transform its substantial foreign aid into a magnet for private capital. Japan will increasingly use its aid, he said, as seed money to attract Japanese manufacturers or other industrial concerns with an attractive investment environment.
 
Ambitious Program
 It is an ambitious program that could encourage more developing countries to adopt economic policies similar to Japan's, in which the Government works closely with industry to increase exports under the aegis of large corporate groupings.
"This represents new thinking," said Mr. Chino. "We are fully committed to this change."
In the interview, Mr. Chino outlined a range of other issues on which Japan intended to exert its considerable financial influence, among them the following:
*He insisted that the keiretsu, Japan's groupings of industrial companies, had many positive features and that Japan was unlikely to bend to American demands that they be changed. Mr. Chino disputed assertions by United States trade negotiators that the keiretsu exclude foreign competition and engage in unfair practices.
*He said he would fight the United States' policy of forgiving some of the debt of friendly countries, like Poland and Egypt. "This is quite an aggravation," he said. "I intend to be stubborn on this, which I think will be-
 *He said he would fight the United States' policy of forgiving some of the debt of friendly countries, like Poland and Egypt. "This is quite an aggravation," he said. "I intend to be stubborn on this, which I think will become a major historical point."
*He said the Soviet Union would receive no financial aid from Japan until it clarified the relationship between the central Government and the republics, reformed its economy, returned a group of northern islands seized from Japan in the waning days of World War II, and reduced its military presence in Asia. Until those conditions are met, he said, Japan will offer only technical advice.
*He said that while Japan would contribute aid to Eastern Europe, it was more interested in Asian countries. Japanese companies have established dominant positions in East Asia, turning the region into a low-cost manufacturing base that is an integral part of Japan's industrial strategy.
In the Japanese system, the Finance Minister is a political appointee who tends to address immediate issues and problems, like legislation, strategies in trade negotiations and responses to crises like the war in the Persian Gulf.
The vice minister, the highest career post in the ministry, tends to be more intimately involved in shaping long-range policy and putting it into effect. After 31 years at the Finance Ministry in various posts in which he helped formulate international policy and fleshed out strategies, Mr. Chino can now put his personal stamp on Japan's financial course.
 
Strong-Willed Predecessor
 Though direct in expressing his views, Mr. Chino is in some ways regarded as less independent than his strong-willed predecessor, Makoto Utsumi. Mr. Utsumi was an urbane, French-speaking bureaucrat with an un-Japanese gift for sharp-tongued repartee. He also did not hesitate to overrule his staff when he felt strongly or to demonstrate flexibility in negotiations, both rare traits in Japan.
By contrast, Mr. Chino is known as more of a traditional consensus-builder. He is said by Finance Ministry officials and others who know him to be steady and cautious, but less inclined to improvise.
Mr. Chino's policies could have a big impact on Japan's role in the world, enhancing its commercial influence while encouraging developing countries to adopt Japan's system of industrial development through a close partnership of government and the private sector.
 
Impact of Policy Change
 Although it may take years to see the changes, Mr. Chino's aim of using Japan's aid to attract private investment could both increase the competitiveness of Japanese industry and extend Japan's influence abroad. Japan's trade surplus is soaring this year after shrinking for three years, which should lift Japan's already high level of foreign investment. That capital will be in strong demand in a world that is starved for funds.
Japan's huge capital outflows are a loose end that the Finance Ministry wants to tie and channel more carefully. That means that countries whose policies Japan prefers stand to gain not just from government-to-government assistance, but from billions of dollars in investment from Japan's industrial groups in the form of real estate developments, manufacturing plants and large purchases of stocks and bonds.
"The purpose of recycling is to stimulate and assist private capital flows," Mr. Chino said, referring to the process of Japan's investing its huge trade surpluses abroad. This is one reason Mr. Chino said he felt so strongly that the United States' policy on debt forgiveness for developing countries was misguided.
"If you let countries avoid paying their debts, that will damage their credibility in the financial markets and make it difficult to attract private capital," he said. He added that forgiveness also tended to discourage countries that shoulder their debt burdens, and pushes them to seek debt forgiveness rather than financial discipline.
"That kind of forgiveness is a serious moral hazard for those who are being responsible," Mr. Chino said.
 
Seeking Less Regulation
 In one area at least, Mr. Chino advocated less change rather than more. In Japan's current stock market scandal, there have been demands that the Finance Ministry end its paternalistic system of regulating the financial markets. Instead, some are pushing for an independent agency, similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Chino was polite but firm in rejecting this notion. He argued for a policy change away from Government efforts to build the financial markets at all costs and toward making the markets more equitable and open, particularly to foreigners.
But he said people should not forget Japan's special history and the fact that the current system has worked well for most of the postwar era. It all came down, he said, to whether Japan wanted a market like the United States', where it is easy to get into the securities business but where there are many regulators, or one that is difficult to enter but where regulators cooperate with brokerage houses to keep order.
"I don't like a society that requires so many people to watch everything," Mr. Chino said. "I like a more cooperative society with a smaller number of regulators."

HEADLINE: New Curb On Banks Expected

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Restrictions on bank loans for real estate projects, which were removed in 1982, are likely to be reimposed, a number of senators and the head of the nation's bank insurance fund say. The curbs would be added even as commercial real estate values continue to decline, more banks totter near insolvency and once-wealthy developers face bankruptcy.
Members of the Senate Banking Committee decided on Friday to give regulators nine more months to devise new restrictions on real estate lending, after which Congress is likely to be asked to put the rules into law. The House had already passed similar legislation. 
In a little-noticed amendment to the banking-overhaul bill that was approved on Friday by the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, proposed reimposing the strict loan-to-value lending rules that were lifted when the Garn-St Germain Act was passed in 1982, deregulating banks.
 
Wirth-Garn Compromise
 On Friday, Senator Wirth and Senator Jake Garn of Utah, the ranking Republican on the committee, struck the compromise that grants Government regulators the nine months to come up with the new restrictions on real estate lending by banks. Congress then began its summer recess, leaving the Senate vote on the bank-overhaul bill until after the lawmakers return in the fall.
The restrictions in Senator Wirth's amendment will likely become part of the law if interagency regulators from the Comptroller of the Currency's office, as well as from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Treasury Department, are unable to agree on new lending guidelines within the nine months.
The Wirth amendment dictates that bank loans backed by commercial real estate cannot exceed 80 percent of the value of that real estate. In instances where the commercial property backing the loan is only partly developed, the lending limit would be 70 percent. For undeveloped land, the loan limit would be 65 percent of the appraised value.
 
Bar to Repeating Mistakes
 Some banking executives and members of Congress, and L. William Seidman, who is chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, say that adopting many of the previous regulations, perhaps with some refinements, will help prevent banks from repeating the lending mistakes they made in the 1980's.
The restrictions are also intended to force developers to contribute more of their own money to projects that are mostly financed by insured bank funds, thereby making the developers take more of the risk from their projects.
Yet the White House and many top legislators and regulators -- as well as most bankers -- oppose reviving the strict regulations on real estate lending, saying it is akin to locking the barn door after the horses have escaped. Rather, they say, what is needed is more intense and consistent oversight by regulators.
In 1982, the Garn-St Germain Act lifted the restrictions that limited what percentage of a real estate project's value banks could lend against and on what kinds of property they could lend. Now many people say that this deregulatory step gave the banks a freedom that worsened the lending mistakes they were making with real estate clients.
In the late 1980's, banks often lent developers 100 percent of their acquisition and construction costs, plus additional amounts for developer fees. Restrictions on loans for undeveloped land were lifted, as were provisions governing how much money developers were required to contribute to projects.
 
'Big Fees Up Front'
 As property values soared, this kind of lending often paid off handsomely. "The banks got caught up in a booming market," said Cheryl Swaim, a banking analyst with Oppenheimer & Company, a Wall Street brokerage. "Commercial real estate loans, when they work, are very profitable, because you get big fees up front and you get higher interest rates on them than on other commercial loans."
With the recession and the recent decline of property values, many real estate projects are now insolvent, with little prospect of finding buyers or lenders willing to refinance their mortgages.
If Congress restores the lending restrictions, the effects would probably not be immediately noticeable, real estate executives said. Banks have already sharply reduced their lending for commercial and residential property development, and tighter restrictions on loan amounts would hardly affect lending patterns. Eventually, however, the rules would probably reduce the flow of bank funds to property development, and because of this, real estate industry representatives are expected to lobby against new restrictions.
 
Strict Regulations Backed
 Mr. Seidman said recently that the bulk of loans that got most major banks in deep trouble were exactly the kind of construction and development loans that had been prohibited before deregulation. He is an advocate of reimposing the regulations because he says bank examiners have trouble enforcing regulatory guidelines that are not ironclad.
"We looked at Firstrepublic Bank, the largest loss to the Government ever in Texas, and of the roughly 77 loans that broke the bank, 75 of them would have been illegal prior to 1982," Mr. Seidman said. "That is true for almost all of the big banks, and it was certainly true in the Bank of New England."
The failure of Firstrepublic is expected to cost the Government at least $2.9 billion, and the rescue of the Bank of New England is seen costing at least $2.5 billion.
 
Separate Units Opposed
 John G. Medlin Jr., chairman and chief executive of the First Wachovia Bank, which is based in Winston-Salem, N.C., said he favored reimposing the restrictions as an alternative to forcing banks to separate into core bank units allowed to make a few kinds of loans and other units that do not use insured funds to do the most risky commercial lending.
If the rules are put in place, banks would still be able to use insured deposits to make real estate loans. "I'd prefer to have some of these restrictions rather than go to the sort of core-bank changes that are now being talked about," Mr. Medlin said.
Robert C. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency and the nation's chief bank regulator, contends that regulatory guidelines are needed for the future but said he did not want Congress to set restrictions because regulators would lose all flexibility.
"The kinds of things that we are thinking about are the loan-to-value ratios that would apply, the circumstances under which you make these loans, construction loans without permanent financing in place and raw-land development loans," Mr. Clarke said.
His office, with the Treasury and the F.D.I.C., has formed a group to put together new lending guidelines.
In their competitive dash to capture fat fees and high interest rates in the 1980's, many banks continually lowered their standards, failed to perform standard reviews of the financial condition of their borrowers and often simply lent hundreds of millions based on project studies and cash-flow projections that later proved to be extremely optimistic. Many risky construction loans were made with no provisions for how they would be refinanced.
Now, with scores of developers seeking to renegotiate their huge debts, it has become clear to what extent many banks lent large amounts of money with only cursory reviews.
"The belief that the borrower had a lot of equity made the banks somewhat lax," said a top executive at one of the nation's biggest banks who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "If you think you have a customer with a $300 million net worth and he has some accounting problems, you might not let that worry you because you figure it's a problem of a couple of million dollars at best. The big thing that people missed was not understanding the volatility of real estate values."
 
No Thorough Kalikow Audit
 In the case of Peter S. Kalikow, the New York City developer who is trying to revise the terms of more than $1 billion in debt, some banks lent him hundreds of millions of dollars for specific projects, but never performed a thorough audit of his financial records and those of his company, H. J. Kalikow & Company.
According to a preliminary report recently prepared by Ernst & Young, the accounting firm hired by the Kalikow lenders, H. J. Kalikow has no accounts-payable system in place; maintains one bank account for several projects and commingles tens of millions of dollars borrowed for completely unrelated projects; has not yet designed an annual budget for its operating companies; does not regularly reconcile intercompany financial reports; holds cashed checks in various places and has a scant record of checks, and has not yet closed the general ledger for the fiscal year ended December 1990.
And in the widely watched renegotiation of Donald J. Trump's debt and the revamping of his empire, it became clear that none of the banks that lent him a total of about $2 billion had ever audited him. Instead, those lenders often based their loans on Mr. Trump's own appraised value of his buildings.
 
Rise in Aggressive Competition
 What led the banks to do business in this fashion? One major change that made lending much more competitive in the 1980's was that deregulation brought into commercial real estate lending thousands of savings and loan institutions, which began to aggressively chase developers with cheap, Government-insured funds.
That, in turn, contributed to the savings industry debacle. In addition to the saving and loans, banks had to compete with insurance companies, which also moved to capture more real estate lending and now have their own problems with many of these loans, and foreign banks, which were increasing their presence in the United States.
A confluence of all these factors, plus the deregulation of interest rates, caused banks to pursue real estate lending aggressively and also to lose sight of fundamental underwriting standards.

HEADLINE: 3d Sales-Tax Budget Is Voted in Hartford; Shutdown Is Averted

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The General Assembly moved to end Connecticut's five-week-old fiscal crisis tonight by adopting, for the third time, a budget based on an expanded sales tax, ending yet another attempt by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. to win an income tax.
With a shutdown of state government threatened if a temporary spending measure expired at midnight without a budget in place, the House of Representatives gave final approval to the sales-tax plan in a 77-to-70 vote at 11:25 P.M. 
 Fifteen minutes later, Governor Weicker said he would not close down state services but would study the Legislature's budget carefully this week before deciding whether to sign it.
Criticizing the Legislature's failure to act until so near the deadline, he said, "I will not permit this late action by the General Assembly to force the people of this state, or the Governor, into any action more motivated by the clock than by principles of economics and the law."
The Senate had earlier passed the budget by a 19-to-17 margin after determining that there were not enough votes for the income-tax plan.
"Every conceivable way to try to bring about consensus has been tried," said the Senate President pro tem, John B. Larson, referring to the summit meetings, caucuses, lobbying and private talks that have filled the draining weeks since the state began the fiscal year without a budget on July 1.
 
Two Previous Vetoes
 "But consensus," he continued, "still comes down around a conventional budget, a budget whose salient point is that it does not include an income tax."
The spending-and-tax plan approved tonight is the third put together by a coalition of moderate Democrats and Republicans that precariously balances a budget by applying Connecticut's 8 percent sales tax to more goods and services. It would raise $740 million in new taxes and fees, about $300 million less than other plans.
Mr. Weicker vetoed the two earlier budgets on May 31 and July 1. The second veto left the state with no budget as the new fiscal year began and led to a partial shutdown of state government and the furlough of 20,000 employees for three days.
That shutdown ended when the Governor allowed a temporary spending measure adopted by the General Assembly to take effect without his signature. The state continued operating on temporary spending measures.
Governor Weicker said he vetoed the first two no-income-tax budgets because they failed to reduce the state's high sales and business taxes and were not properly balanced. But he had no success with his alternative, an income tax that would provide the revenue to both balance the budget and cut other taxes. On May 24, and again on July 2, the Senate rejected income-tax plans.
After five weeks without a budget, the General Assembly met today to debate proposals that differed only in details from those defeated or vetoed earlier. Mr. Weicker's personal lobbying and public appeals had produced no change in his opponents' positions.
The income tax failed again today because of opposition in the Senate from not only Republicans, but also the top Democrats, Mr. Larson of East Hartford and the majority leader, Cornelius P. O'Leary of Windsor Locks.
Today's vote was proving a perverse success for Mr. Weicker, Connecticut's first independent governor in more a century.
Taking office as a governor without a party, he appealed to the General Assembly for a bipartisan effort to solve the state's fiscal problems. But when Democrats and Republicans did put aside their long-standing differences, it was to block his income tax and produce the budgets allowing the state to continue its reliance on the sales tax.
The no-income-tax budget approved by the Assembly tonight applies the sales tax for the first time to goods and services from haircuts to dry cleaning to extended warranties, and exemptions are being repealed for such things as nonprescription drugs.
 
State Services Maintained
 After the budget was passed, Mr. Weicker issued an executive order maintaining state services through the five-day period the Constitution allows him for reviewing emergency acts like the budget passed tonight.
He said that the latest temporary spending measure had been for just one week, expiring at midnight tonight, but that its appropriations were for a two-week period, allowing him to extend the measure.
"There'll be no shutdown," he said. "No lockout, or layoffs, or furloughs, or call it what you will."
Governor Weicker said he would review the budget line by line to see whether it met his four requirements: that it pay off the state's deficit, help business, not be based on financial gimmicks, and not rely too much on bonding.
"This has nothing to do with income tax or non-income tax," he said. "It has everything to do with whether it's balanced and it works for Connecticut."
Going strictly by those requirements, the Governor would have little choice but to veto the bill, since it makes no payments on the deficit, does not cut business taxes, uses several financial gimmicks and adds to the state's borrowing.
But the changed circumstances for the Governor were just as clearly indicated by his decision to keep government going while carefully examining the bill, rather than to issue an almost immediate veto and shut down the state, as he did on July 2.
The state's fiscal condition worsened under the temporary spending measures, which added $17 million each week to the state's billion-dollar deficit.
To make up for the increased deficit and the extra cost of borrowing during that period, the coalition budget calls for an additional $88 million in bonding and extends the sales tax more broadly than before, eliminating the exemption for adult clothing and sharply cutting that for children's clothing.
It also would force Mr. Weicker to deal with a $20 million in personnel cuts, most likely in layoffs, while counting on $327 million in union concessions that Mr. Weicker won this spring by promising no layoffs in the next year. And it provides the barest surplus for the fiscal year: $400,000.
The budget passed by the Assembly achieves a remarkable goal: the total $7.627 billion appropriated for the general fund, a transportation fund and other costs is $53 million less than Connecticut spent in the last fiscal year. Then again, last year's spending exceeded the state's 1990-91 budget by $632 million, or 9 percent.

HEADLINE: 30-Year-Old Film Is a Surprise Hit In Its 4th Re-Release

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 4

 BODY:
She may not match the form-changing cyborg of "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" for pure evil, but Cruella DeVil, the villain of Disney's 30-year-old "101 Dalmatians," is proving to be an astonishingly strong box-office draw this summer.
"101 Dalmatians" is, in fact, the biggest surprise hit of the season for Hollywood. Executives at the Walt Disney Company had expected it to do well in this, its fourth re-release since its original run in 1961. But no one in the industry expected it to gross $41.8 million at the box office in its first 24 days, through this weekend. 
 At that pace it stands to take in at least $50 million and perhaps as much as $60 million by the end of the summer, a level that only a handful of first-run, live-action films will reach during that period. If the film does more than $54 million, it will surpass Disney's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" to become the biggest animated hit ever, based on cumulative box-office grosses over the years, adjusted for inflation.
"It's enormously pleasing to all of us who have worked in animation to see that quality still has that kind of popularity and value 30 years down the road," said Roy E. Disney, the nephew of the company's founder and still one of the guiding spirits of Disney's animation division.
 
Little Family Entertainment
 Industry executives and analysts attributed the film's popularity in part to the endearing story of the two Dalmatians, Pongo and Perdita, who brave fearsome odds to save their puppies from being made into fur coats by the wicked Cruella.
But the film is also benefiting from what many parents, now deep into the summer vacation, would undoubtedly consider a dearth of family entertainment.
"It's the only thing out there that's really for the family audience," said Philip Garfinkle of Entertainment Data Inc., which tracks box-office results. " 'Problem Child 2' or 'Terminator' or 'Robin Hood' are not the same as a G-rated picture."
The success of "101 Dalmations" is also the latest evidence of the immense profitability in Disney's library of animated classics, profitability that is especially noticeable when huge production budgets have made it difficult for studios, including Disney, to make money on their current movies.
The production costs of "101 Dalmatians" have long since been recouped. With the exception of advertising costs and the costs of making more than 1,800 new prints -- a total that analysts said was probably at least $5 million -- virtually all of Disney's income on the movie this summer is profit.
 
A $20 Million Profit
 Studios typically keep about half the box-office gross, with the rest going to theater owners. At $50 million in box-office gross, Disney could cover its costs and still have a $20 million profit. In contrast, the studio's live-action summer release, "The Rocketeer," cost at least $35 million to make and probably at least $10 million more to market and distribute.
To break even, "The Rocketeer" would have to do $90 million at the domestic box office, a level it is highly unlikely to attain (through this weekend it had done $42.3 million). "The Rocketeer" is likely to be profitable in the long run for Disney after counting foreign box-office and home-video sales.
Disney can also look forward to the home-video release of "101 Dalmatians." Studio executives said no date had been set, but Disney typically releases its classics on video within a year after their re-release in theaters. And the company is also benefiting from a surge in demand for Pongo and Perdita stuffed animals, T-shirts, lunch boxes and other merchandise linked to the film.
"All of us knew it is one of the all-time favorite animated movies, and we all expected it to perform very well," said Richard Cook, the president of Disney's movie distribution operation. "But I don't think any of us expected it to do this kind of business."
Mr. Cook said that with each release, classic animated films appeal not just to a new generation of children but also to their parents and in this case to some grandparents lured back by the memory of having seen the film themselves as children and parents. "Dalmatians," he said, is also drawing people who come without children, what he called "the dating crowd."
 
The Return of Animation
 If nothing else, the movie's strong showing will cement the belief throughout Hollywood that animation's time has come again. Disney and other studios have been expanding their animation production in recent years, both for television and movies. This month Warner Brothers will release "Rover Dangerfield," in which Rodney Dangerfield will supply the voice for the animated canine hero. Disney plans to release a new animated musical version of "Beauty and the Beast" at Thanksgiving.
After its original run in 1961, "101 Dalmatians" was released in 1969, 1979 and 1985. Going into this summer, its cumulative box-office total, adjusted for inflation, was $89.7 million, Disney said.
That put it in sixth place on the list of all-time animated hits, behind "Snow White" ($143.6 million), "The Jungle Book" ($130 million), "Bambi" ($109.9 million), "Cinderella" ($95.5 million) and "Lady and the Tramp" ($93 million). This weekend, "101 Dalmatians" passed "Jungle Book" to go into second place.
The largest single release of an animated movie was "The Little Mermaid," from Disney, which grossed $84 million in its original run two years ago.

HEADLINE: GOLF;
In Golf, Integration Is More Than 9-Iron Away

BYLINE: By JAIME DIAZ

 BODY:
The sociological shock surrounding last year's P.G.A. Championship at Shoal Creek carried more force than any off-course event in golf's history, but even that impact hasn't shaken the game from its inherently leisurely pace.
As golf has settled back into its own tempo, the true significance of the protests that forced the country club outside Birmingham, Ala., to accept a black member has become difficult to measure. While the sanctuary of privilege that all-white private clubs long enjoyed has come under more critical scrutiny than ever before, minority groups, and particularly black people, are still far outside golf's mainstream. 
 On the eve of this year's P.G.A. Championship, which begins Thursday at Crooked Stick Golf Club in Carmel, Ind., the changes made since last year's event are still in the eye of the beholder.
Those who say Shoal Creek irrevocably changed the face of the game point to the way this country's four major golf organizations -- the United States Golf Association, the Professional Golfers' Association of America, the PGA Tour and the Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour -- all drafted new policies requiring the private clubs that play host to their tournaments to move decisively toward integrating their memberships.
In addition, the Augusta National Golf Club, the home of the Masters, independently admitted its first black member.
"I think that on balance the golf world has surprised me with how aggressively they have gone after change since Shoal Creek," David Fay, executive director of the U.S.G.A., said recently. "Some might say we are not doing it quick enough, but I think there is proof across the board that important changes are continuing to be made."
Others contend that the only changes brought on by Shoal Creek were forced by financial expediency, and that next to nothing has been done to motivate the true integration of the game at the nearly 6,000 private clubs in the United States that have no intention of holding major professional tournaments. About three quarters of these clubs do not have a black member. Moreover, critics say, golf's leadership has done little to integrate the business and administration of the game.
"There has been a beginning, but I think it has all been token," said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which focused national attention on Shoal Creek by threatening to picket last year's P.G.A. Championship. "What hasn't been done has given affirmation to the critics who said golf's leaders responded only because of economic pressure. There was no moral impetus, no repentance of our sins."
Those sins were symbolized last July in the words of Shoal Creek's founder, Hall Thompson, when he told a Birmingham newspaper reporter that "we don't discriminate in every other area except the blacks." Suddenly, what had been tacitly accepted for generations had been too bluntly stated in too visible an arena to be ignored.
The S.C.L.C.'s subsequent threat to picket the P.G.A. Championship unless Shoal Creek took in a black member led some corporate sponsors to withdraw their advertising from the telecast of the tournament. With its golden egg under siege, golf's leadership responded posthaste.
Louis Willie, a prominent black Birmingham businessman, was admitted as an honorary member at Shoal Creek. The PGA Tour drew up a firm anti-discrimination policy for its host clubs to follow, as did the P.G.A. of America and the U.S.G.A. Although the PGA Tour's policy did not stipulate that every host club had to have minority members, it stipulated that each club had to demonstrate an ongoing commitment to non-exclusionary membership.
"There wasn't any point in kidding around," said Tim Finchem, deputy commissioner of the PGA Tour. "If a club didn't want to take steps, we wanted to know up front because sooner or later it was going to be a black eye for them and for us."
Since then, 11 private clubs have dropped out as hosts of national championship tournaments or tour events rather than adopt more inclusive membership practices. The clubs that withdrew are: Butler National (Centel Western Open), Cypress Point Golf Club (AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am), Old Warson Country Club (Southwestern Bell Senior Classic), Skokie Country Club (Ameritech Senior Open), Amarillo Country Club (Ben Hogan Amarillo Open), the Golf Club of Louisiana (Ben Hogan Baton Rouge Open), St. Louis Country Club (1992 United States Women's Amateur), Chicago Golf Club (1993 Walker Cup), Annandale Golf Club (1993 United States Women's Amateur), Merion Golf Club (1994 Women's Open) and Aronimink Golf Club (1993 P.G.A. Championship).
Conversely, most of the host clubs on the PGA Tour, the Senior PGA Tour and the L.P.G.A. Tour that did not have minority membership at the time of Shoal Creek have since admitted at least one black, most recently the Colonial Country Club, site of the Southwestern Bell Colonial, and Castle Pines Golf Club, site of The International.
Of the 123 courses used by the three major tours in 1991, 43 had no black members before Shoal Creek (55 of the 123 are either public or resort courses). Although neither the PGA Tour or the L.P.G.A. Tour would supply any information, telephone checks with the clubs showed that only about 10 clubs now have either no minority members or refuse to comment on the subject.
Meanwhile, future United States Open sites like Baltusrol in 1993, Oakmont in 1994 and Oakland Hills in 1996 recently admitted blacks. Shinnecock Hills, the proposed site of the 1995 United States Open, has yet to admit its first black, though club officials have said they are committed to doing so.
While golf leaders have had a strong lever in the integration of private clubs that want to hold tour events and championship tournaments, there is no such inducement for the vast majority of private clubs in the country. On the contrary, the Constitution guarantees clubs the right of free association, making most forms of discrimination legal.
According to a recent survey in The Chicago Tribune, only 10 of the 74 clubs in the Chicago area have black members. The Detroit Free Press found only 11 of 38 private clubs in the Detroit area with black members. When The New York Times recently surveyed 39 private clubs in Westchester County, 11 said they had black members, while 15 clubs did not respond to the survey.
Similar ratios have been found elsewhere in the country, which leaves even Lowery resigned to the idea that the integration of America's private clubs will be slow.
"It's not going to be easy for any of these clubs to find a whole lot of black people who are willing to put up the kind of money needed," he said. "We aren't talking about integrating a hot dog lunch counter. Golf is an elitest, expensive type of thing. You aren't going to see any mad rush at any level."
 
'A Trend Is Percolating'
 But the change is coming. Even Bill Colley, general counsel for the National Club Association, an organization that advocates the right of clubs to discriminate in their membership practices, admits that.
"I would say there is a trend that is percolating in which clubs are reviewing their admission procedures and admitting more blacks and minorities," he said. "The reasons can be economic, the stigma from the community, or the feeling that it's time to catch up with reality and get into today's mainstream. Just the idea that the things that were done 20 and 30 years ago doesn't apply socially in today's environment."
Lowery is more concerned with the integration of golf's administration and business than he is with the integration of clubs. None of the four major golf organizations has a black in a management capacity. Only the P.G.A. of America has a black in a high-ranking advisory capacity, while the PGA Tour recently hired a black for its on-site promotions staff. Only 25 of some 20,000 P.G.A. club pros are black.
"They've asked the clubs to do what they themselves have not done, which is to desegregate their boards and staff," Lowery said. "The symbolism of black staff, as much as its actual worth, is extremely important. It makes the entire game more accessible to blacks."
But according to Finchem and Fay, integration in golf is difficult to achieve on both a participant and a business level.
"That's what we are trying to get a handle on for the next four or five years," Finchem said. "We are making some progress in that regard, but the first thing we found out is it's not easy."
They agree that promoting golf participation among young members of minority groups is difficult because access to courses is often a problem, as is the lack of role models in the game.
Jim Thorpe and Calvin Peete are the only blacks who regularly play on the PGA Tour, and National Golf Foundation statistics indicate that blacks make up only 3 percent of the nation's golfers, and that about only 1 in 50 blacks play golf. There is one example of promise in this regard: On July 28, 15-year-old Eldrick Woods, who is black, became the youngest winner ever of the United States Junior Amateur.
Because relatively few black people grow up around golf, blacks are rarely among the candidates for jobs where a lifelong background in the game is highly desirable.
"Minorities don't appear in that area because they are not playing the game," Finchem said. "So what we are faced with is growing people with internship programs and recruiting programs in entry-level positions."
Fay, who said the U.S.G.A. is aggressively seeking a black to sit on the association's excecutive committee by next year, agreed.
"Right now, the pool is not there," Fay said. "When Branch Rickey brought Jackie Robinson in, once the floodgate was opened, then you had the Negro leagues to provide more talent. In golf, it's more difficult to get black participants."
"I don't buy that," Lowery said. "We have blacks in space travel, and everywhere else. They haven't asked me to recommend anybody, and I know several people they could involve. And so do they. They just haven't been willing to commit."
 
'We'll Find Ways'
 Lowery is skeptical that the momentum of Shoal Creek will continue without pressure from civil-rights groups.
"Right now the song seems ended, and I don't know if the melody lingers on," he said. "The integration of golf may not be the highest-priority item for us, but we are not going to let it die. We'll find ways to keep their feet to the fire."
In the meantime, the game is likely to change as it always has, gradually.
"Americans like to move fast, but nature doesn't operate that way," said Willie, still Shoal Creek's only black member. "It doesn't discourage me that the progress is slow. But it is encouraging to me that clubs have opened which had not had their consciousness raised to this extent before.
"I believe this issue will fade as an outstanding social barrier to blacks in the future. I am encouraged by what has happened since last year."

HEADLINE: If Bush Offers Good Target, Democrats' Aim Is Shaky

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Congressional Democrats agree that President Bush could be vulnerable on domestic policy matters. But they cannot agree on how to capitalize on that vulnerability or just how potent such an approach might be.
By the time Congress left town this weekend for its August recess, leaders in both the House and the Senate had spent weeks trying to muscle through bills on transportation, abortion rights, crime, civil rights and unemployment, all of which President Bush has threatened to veto. 
 Democratic strategists and lawmakers are convinced that this is potentially strong campaign ammunition. The lawmakers have delivered dozens of floor speeches criticizing the President on racial issues, unemployment and even drought relief. They are trying to paint Mr. Bush as a President with a one-word answer to every domestic problem: no.
"The President has acknowledged his interest in foreign affairs," Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said in an interview last week, "and his disinterest in domestic affairs is now obvious to all Americans."
 
Criticism From Gephardt
 At a news conference on Friday, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, said: "Up until now, the President has found a lot of emergencies, aid to the Kurds, aid to many different countries around the world. But he can't quite bring himself to see that there's an emergency here in the United States with people who are out of work, who've exhausted their unemployment benefits and are having trouble taking care of their families."
The coordinated Congressional attack has clearly hit its mark. In a response in a Friday news conference, the President said Americans should "not listen to the charges by frantic Democrats trying to say we don't have a domestic policy.
"And I am not going to lose interest in world peace, and I don't think the American people want me to."
But Democrats remain divided about whether forcing vetoes that Congress cannot override is a good political strategy for a sometimes disorganized caucus of lawmakers who have a wide variety of priorities and, as yet, no compelling Presidential candidate to take on the President directly.
In short, the Democrats have figured out just how to call George Bush's bluff, but they cannot agree on the message or the messenger. "They have themselves over a barrel," Eddie Mahe, a Republican campaign consultant, said. "They cannot come to any consensus in any real way."
Mr. Mahe, like Republican partisans in Congress and in the Bush Administration, is gleeful about the Democrats' problem. On Friday, Mr. Bush met with House Republicans to assure them that he was prepared to work with them to promote the Republican party's domestic agenda.
That agenda is likely to repackage issues like home ownership for the poor, education and preventive health care espoused by such Cabinet members as Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services; Lamar Alexander, the Secretary of Education, and Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
"There are ideas on the table that change the way government interacts," said Rich Bond, a Republican strategist with ties to the White House. "What's wrong with that idea?"
Republican strategists inside Congress and out expect the President to redefine the nation's domestic agenda to fit his own definitions, continue to veto what he does not like and blame Congress for stalemates.
And Republicans are gearing up to dispute the Democrats' contention that the President has no domestic policy.
"It's the only strategy they have," Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Commmittee, said of the Democrats. "In politics, you go to your strong suit, even if the highest card happens to be the seven of spades."
But for all their boasting that the White House has a domestic agenda, Republicans are aware of the polls that show how vulnerable the President may be on domestic policy. A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted June 3-6 found that while 68 percent of those questioned said they approved of the President's handling of foreign policy, 48 percent disapproved of his handling of the economy and only 41 percent approved. The telephone poll of 1,424 adults had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Even more recently, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 1,004 registered voters conducted July 26-29, showed 74 percent approved of the way Mr. Bush has handled foreign policy, while 52 percent disapproved of his handling of the economy. Thirty-eight percent said they approved of his handling of the economy. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Yet, with precious few Presidential candidates on the horizon to articulate Mr. Bush's perceived weaknesses, the Democrats are essentially stymied.
"We have had an inability to create an awareness of our policy," Mr. Mitchell said. "Obviously, we're not doing it as effectively and as well as we could, but it is very hard to compete with the President for access to the attention of the American people."
Mr. Bush has shrugged off such challenges with a series of veto threats -- at least 10 made during the 102d Congress. Since he took office in 1989, Mr. Bush has vetoed 21 pieces of legislation. None of the vetoes has been overriden by Congress.
"I think vetoes are a dangerous strategy for him," said Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst, "except he has enough credentials in foreign and defense policy not to have to worry about the losses he is likely to absorb if he vetoes domestic issues."
Mr. Phillips, like other Republicans, says Democrats are not well equipped to take on the President. "They have an instinct for the capillaries, not the jugular," he said.
Part of the Democrats' problem is that they do not adhere to a single political discipline. This was demonstrated again last week, when two strong-willed committee chairmen, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois and Representative Robert A. Roe of New Jersey, argued to a standoff over the gas tax as part of the transportation bill.
"If the Democratic Party were in Europe, it would be five distinct parties," said Representative Joe Moakley of Maasachusetts, the chairman of the Rules Committee, where the gas-tax negotiations fell apart. "We have an awful big umbrella covering an awful lot of different people."
Mr. Rostenkowski is no fan of forcing vetoes to make a political point. Democrats, he said, should be expending more energy negotiating legislative differences so that Congress can produce a bill the President would sign.
"The problem with Democrats is we promise more than we can deliver, and then we don't deliver on the promises we make, and people view us as irresponsible," Mr. Rostenkowski said.
No one knows those weaknesses better than George Bush. "Clearly, Bush is playing a political game where he's trying to use Congress as his foil," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic consultant. "A good Presidential campaign by the Democrats will take an awful lot of the pressure off of Congress.
Democratic leaders are counting on the White House to do some of their dirty work for them. "We don't think they run a domestic policy effort at the White House," said Paul Tully, the political director of the Democratic National Committee. "We think they run a continuing election campaign."

HEADLINE: A Range War of Words On Grazing in the West

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOULDER, Utah

 BODY:
Tired and sore from tending the cattle, hauling water and mending fences, Arthur Lyman, a fifth-generation cowman, bristles at the signs and stickers placed along the road that declare: "Welfare rancher."
"It really burns my hide," said Mr. Lyman, a 40-year-old rancher in the Escalante River Valley, who works a second job. "I work like a danged fool from sunrise to dark. And I'm still pretty much in a poverty situation." 
 But Mr. Lyman and other ranchers who use public lands pay a grazing fee that is only a fraction of what it costs cattlemen who lease private land. Critics of the fee programs for Government land, including Representative Mike Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, say the programs amount to a subsidy that costs taxpayers millions of dollars and harms the public land by encouraging too much grazing.
"It's a sweetheart deal that ought to end," said Mr. Synar, who has led an effort in Congress to increase the fees sharply.
 
What Is the Land For?
 The debate is about more than fees. It has raised deep questions about the very purpose of public land: Should it be used to foster economic interests, as it has in parts of the West for generations? Or should it exist to be admired but be relatively untouched, even if some people go broke?
It is a debate as old as the saga of cattle barons and range wars of the late 1800's, when the powerful ran roughshod over rivals and some ranchers controlled as much as a million acres of public land.
The central issue is the condition of the land. Environmentalists have asserted that public tracts are being ruined by livestock who eat away the vegetation and pollute streams with their wastes.
"The damage has been quite severe," said Nancy Green of the Wilderness Society. "It will take decades to restore some of these areas, at a cost of many millions of dollars."
 
'In the Right Direction'
 But the cattle industry, as well as officials of the Bureau of Land Management, say the public land is in relatively good condition and is improving with time.
"You can find trouble spots here and there," said Sy Jamison, head of the bureau, "but over all, the trends are in the right direction." He said 14 percent of public land was considered to be in poor condition. In the 1930's, he said, about 36 percent was judged to be in that condition.
Mr. Synar's measure, which has passed the House as part of the Interior Department's budget, would increase grazing fees to $8.70 from $1.97 for each "animal unit month," or, the vegetation consumed in a month by one cow and her calf, or by one horse, or by five sheep.
A portion of the increased fees would go toward restoring range lands, especially the lush areas near streams. Currently, the fees are used to pay for the Interior Department's maintenance of range lands and they fall slightly short of covering the costs.
The Senate has yet to act on the department's budget.
 
Ruin for Many Ranchers?
 Mr. Jamison has estimated that such an increase would drive out of business more than 90 percent of the ranchers using public land. About 8 percent of western ranchers, or 31,000 people, use public land, and they produce 3 percent of the nation's beef. But the cattle industry says the figure for full-grown beef animals is misleadingly low, because many calves born on public land are sent to feed lots in the Midwest and elsewhere to be fattened.
Mr. Jamison said it was just not true that huge sums of public money subsidize the grazing. He said that in 1990 cattlemen paid $1.81 per animal unit month to graze their herds on land managed by the bureau, amounting to a subsidy of 2 cents per animal unit month. Moreover, he said, 40 percent of the bureau's cost to maintain public land has nothing to do with cattle grazing.
Mr. Lyman owns about 300 head of cattle that he grazes in the canyons and jagged ridges of the Utah mountains. "It makes no difference to the big old United States if this ranch goes under and goes to sagebrush," he said. "But this is my way of life."
Mr. Lyman and other ranchers say it is unfair to compare fees for public and private pastures. Private land is much more lush, they say, so cattle can be fattened more quickly, and landlords provide fencing and water.
Indeed, one study concluded that ranchers who use public land pay more because of the costs of maintenance, water development and transportion to and from grazing areas.
The study, conducted by Darwin Nielson, a Utah State University professor and a member of the National Cattlemen's Association grazing fee task force, found that a rancher pays $14.26 an animal unit month to operate on public land, as against $10.41 on private land.
A rancher like Mr. Lyman typically will truck his cattle to public range lands on Oct. 15. The cattle will graze on the range until April, when most of the cows have given birth. After the rancher loads the cattle and trucks them back to his own land, the animals are sold to a cattle buyer and eventually go to, say, a Kansas or California pasture or a Midwestern feed lot to be further fattened for slaughter.
Cattle have been grazing on public land in the West for many decades. Throughout the 19th century, they were allowed to roam free and free of charge. In the 1930's, Congress enacted legislation setting aside specific tracts of range land for grazing at a fee.
Ranchers say environmental groups are actually pushing for an end to livestock grazing on public lands, not just a reduction. They point to the slogan of the environmental group Earth First: "Cow free by '93."
Ranchers blame environmental extremists for scattered acts of vandalism and violence on ranches in the West. A year ago, 24 cows and calves were shot to death on Mr. Lyman's ranch. Not long before the killings, Mr. Lyman found a sign placed on his ranch that read: "Stop Destructive Welfare Ranching."
"It's really been a scary thing," said Mr. Lyman. "I used to let my 16-year-old, Chad, ride the range all day, like my dad let me when I was a boy. I can't do that anymore."
Sheriff Than Cooper of Garfield County sought to cool tempers. "I told them, now you can't go shoot somebody just because you want to," he said. "And I think most of the ranchers understood that."
The major environmental groups say they abhor violence and threats. "We're not opposed to grazing, per se," said David Alberswerth of the National Wildlife Federation, "but we think the burden of proof should be on the livestock industry to show why they deserve to stay on public lands."
The dispute has spilled over into entertainment and advertising. Cattle interests have mounted a protest against the broadcast on the Public Broadcasting Service of "The New Range Wars," a documentary on the grazing debate produced by the Audubon Society. Earlier this summer, the Ford Motor Company canceled its advertising shortly before the program was to be shown on the Turner Broadcasting System network. (In New York, the PBS broadcast is scheduled for 8 P.M. Aug. 12 on Channel 13.)
Ranchers argue that increasing numbers of tourists and hikers on public land cause more damage than their livestock.
Some of the ranchers in the Escalante River Valley, for example, say they can no longer drive their herds to pasture in the traditional manner because tourists get out of cars to take pictures and try to pet the animals. As a result, more ranchers now truck their stock to pasture.
Indeed, those who oppose grazing say that ranchers' political power is ebbing as they are outnumbered by environmentalists and others who wish to see the land preserved.
In their book, "Sacred Cows at the Public Trough," Nancy and Denzel Ferguson write: "For every person grazing livestock on public lands, there are about 195 who read Outdoor Life. Add the millions of other hunters, fishermen, sightseers, birdwatchers, members of conservation organizations and just plain citizens who care about natural resources, and you have an imposing constituency."
The public mood is changing, even in the West, where the cattle industry has held sway since the region was settled. Many ranchers say they worry that their children will not be able to carry on the tradition of running cattle.
"This ranch has been in the family for 200 years," said Louise Liston, a rancher in Garfield County. "We've scraped and struggled and fought to survive. But we've stayed because we love it. We love the land. And this is where our roots are. It is very hard to leave your roots."

HEADLINE: Bush's Domestic Record Is Assailed by Mitchell

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The Senate Democratic leader challenged President Bush today on issues from civil rights to unemployment compensation to health care, and said Congress should pass bills it believed in even if Mr. Bush vetoed them.
The leader, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, said it was not true, as Mr. Bush said at a news conference on Friday, that the Democrats in Congress were "frustratingly negative on everything." 
 "The facts are clearly the opposite," Mr. Mitchell said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press." He went on to say: "The President's strategy is very clearly a negative veto strategy. He has very little in the way of a domestic program of his own, and I think what you'll see is a political plan over the next year and a half, which will be for the President simply to veto whatever the Congress does and then to run against Congress."
 
Aggressive Domestic Agenda
 Roger Porter, assistant to the President for domestic policy, appeared on the same program and insisted: "The President has an aggressive domestic agenda of bills that he has sent to the Congress. He has submitted for them major legislation dealing with education, with banking reform, with crime, with energy, and now we're waiting for Congress to take action on them."
Mr. Mitchell said the breakdown of discussions on civil rights legislation between Mr. Bush and Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, meant it was now time for Democrats to get behind Mr. Danforth's legislation and pass it with a veto-proof majority if Mr. Danforth can bring enough Republicans along with him. Sixty-seven senators are needed to override a veto when all senators vote; there are 57 Democrats in the Senate.
Mr. Mitchell said he did not believe there was any chance of cooperation with Mr. Bush on civil rights. "It's very clear the President wants an issue, not a bill," he said. "It's the first time a President has used the racial issue in this manner in modern times."
But Mr. Porter insisted that Mr. Bush wanted a civil rights bill. He said Mr. Danforth's proposal would "undermine the President's educational program." The Danforth proposal would prohibit employers from imposing standards not related to job performance if they have a discriminatory effect.
He said Mr. Bush "believes very strongly that it is important that employers inquire as to whether people have dropped out of school and how well they have done in school."
Mr. Mitchell said Congress would pass legislation dealing with health care and health insurance costs next year. Mr. Porter said he did not know when Mr. Bush would make his own proposal on those issues.
Mr. Mitchell also urged President Bush to sign the unemployment compensation bill passed Friday and to allow the extended benefits it provides to reach Americans who have been out of work for more than half a year.
Renewing the Democratic charge that Mr. Bush is more interested in foreign affairs than domestic ones and quicker to aid Kurds, Turks or Israelis than Americans, Mr. Mitchell said: "We don't think that aid ought to only go to people outside this country. We think when Americans need help, they should get it."

HEADLINE: As Many Democrats Seek a Shift, One Hopeful Clings to Liberalism

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Aug. 4

 BODY:
They have watched the Republicans turn "liberal" into an insult. They have been told, again and again, that their national party is out of touch, enfeebled, doomed to fail unless it changes. They are heading into a Presidential campaign that is widely expected to be their fourth straight defeat.
It is not surprising then that many of the Democratic faithful are ripe for Senator Tom Harkin, the rough-edged, true-believing Iowan testing the waters for a Presidential campaign. 
 "We Democrats have nothing to be ashamed of," he shouted on a recent golden New Hampshire afternoon, resurrecting memories of Roosevelt, Truman and Humphrey while his partisan audience cheered him on.
On issue after issue, Mr. Harkin declared, "We weren't wrong; we were right."
 
Message of True Belief
 Wiry and angry, punching the air with evangelical passion, Mr. Harkin offers his beleaguered party a potent mix of old-time Democratic religion, prairie populism and group therapy. There is no need to surrender to the Republicans, he says, no need to "walk a little bit more and talk a little bit more like Republicans."
Democrats need only believe in themselves again, he says, and get off their knees. But amid the cheers there are some private doubts among Democrats: This may be good psychology, but is it good politics?
A coal miner's son who boasts that he grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, Mr. Harkin sneers at much of the conventional wisdom in politics these days. While Democratic centrists fret about toughening the party's image on national security, Mr. Harkin says he has absolutely no regrets about his vote against the use of force in the Persian Gulf.
While many of the party's thinkers search for a new economics, Mr. Harkin calls for Democratic fundamentals: a major new program to rebuild the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Asked how he would pay for it, he shoots back, "When Ronald Reagan came in and said he was going to increase defense spending, cut taxes and balance the budget, did you ask him how?"
In 1990, Mr. Harkin's voting record made him one of the 15 most liberal members of the Senate, according to the annual ranking by The National Journal, a Washington publication.
The Republicans cast him as one more "in a long line of very liberal Democrats who are out of the mainstream of American public opinion," in the words of Charles Black, a top adviser to the Republican National Committee. "I describe him as George McGovern with hair," he added.
 
Still an Exploratory Stage
 There is always an audience among party activists for the traditional organ music of the Democratic Party; Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, for example, placed second in the Iowa Presidential caucuses in 1988 with a plea for "a government that cares."
Mr. Harkin, who combines his Democratic orthodoxy with a full-throated attack on the Republicans, has drawn a particularly strong response from organized labor.
"Win, lose or draw, he speaks our language," said Bill Holayter, director of the legislative and political action department for the machinists' union. "He's got a Hubert Humphrey-type message that speaks to people's needs and desires."
The party may be particularly open to his appeal in the summer of 1991; when so many Democrats seem to be shrinking from a challenge to Mr. Bush, Mr. Harkin gets points with party officials for simply being out on the stump.
"There is a premium to the guys who show the guts to get out there," said Phil Angelides, chairman of the California Democratic Party.
Mr. Harkin is still in the exploratory phase of a candidacy, but says he is "moving toward a positive decision" and will announce his intentions around Labor Day.
Other Democrats, notably the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of centrists and conservatives, assert that the party's repeated losses of Presidential races indicate the need for fundamental change in its message and a new appeal to the middle class.
"He's right that we shouldn't be more like the Republicans, but if he thinks the public hasn't formed some distinctly bad impressions of the party's message in the last several elections, he's missing something," said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, an offshoot of the leadership council.
"We would say it behooves the Democrats to offer something other than a recycling of the old politics in 1992 if you want to make a credible bid for the White House," Mr. Marshall added.
Mr. Harkin, who is 51 years old, said in an interview that he had thought about the Presidency much of his life but only began considering a 1992 candidacy last fall, after he was elected to his second term in the Senate. He says he is convinced that the Democrats can win the White House if they stand proudly for their traditional values -- he draws an analogy with "new Coke" and "classic Coke" -- and hit the Republicans hard.
"I do believe that Democrats down deep inside feel they got cheated in 1988," he says. "They got cheated because our candidate and our campaign didn't fight back, cheated because Bush played dirty and should not have been President of the United States."
Mr. Harkin touts the benefits of a base west of the Mississippi. "There's a Western strategy out there that no one's talking about," he says. "It's going to take someone from out there who understands that populism."
There is little dispute about Mr. Harkin's skills on the stump, much appreciated in a party whose last nominee, Michael S. Dukakis, rarely approached the foothills of oratorical passion.
Mr. Harkin has that constant edge of anger that puts the power in populism, railing against "George Herbert Walker Bush" and "J. Danforth Quayle." He chips away at the Republicans' proud record of job creation, telling of a couple in Iowa -- the husband lost a $14-an-hour job, replaced it with a $7-an-hour job, saw his wife forced to work at a $4-an-hour job -- a family working harder and losing ground.
 
Homefront Problems Cited
 "The issue, George Herbert Walker Bush, is not jobs," Mr. Harkin declares. "Hell, slaves had jobs. What we want in this country are decent, well-paying, secure jobs."
Like other Democrats, he hammers away with accusations that Mr. Bush is neglecting the homefront. While Mr. Bush was flying off to Moscow for the summit meeting, Mr. Harkin was at a health clinic for women and infants, talking about nutrition and breast-feeding.
At a Democratic picnic in New Hampshire, Mr. Harkin held aloft a suitcase emblazoned with stickers for recent Presidential destinations around the world. "I say, George Herbert Walker Bush, unpack your suitcase, stay here in America a little bit longer," he said.
Mr. Harkin was vague on his programmatic intentions. For example, he said he would not raise taxes for his major new infrastructure program, saying only, "The money's there, if we have the guts to invest it where it ought to be invested." How big a program is he calling for? "Big time," he says, "nothing small potatoes here."
But at the moment, in the summer of 1991, Mr. Harkin's appeal to the Democratic faithful has more to do with passion than programs. Jacket off, sleeves rolled up, leaning into the microphone, finding his cadence, he carries the crowd with him: "When Franklin Roosevelt initiated Social Security and the Republicans all voted against it, we were right.
"When Harry Truman brought the boys back from Europe and said, 'we're going to send them to school, we're going to build houses for them,' Republicans said, 'no, we can't afford it.' We were right."

HEADLINE: Con Ed Is Told To Shift Goal To Efficiency

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
For close to 20 years, the clean, cheap power generated by Canada's dams has been the solution whenever New York's utilities have looked for more electricity. Now, pressure is mounting on the state and the Consolidated Edison Company to put their long-term investments into something even cleaner and possibly cheaper: conservation.
 Mayor David N. Dinkins plans to ask New York State today to delay signing a new contract that would provide Con Ed with large amounts of hydroelectricity from Canada from 1995 to 2016. His administration says that the $6.1 billion that the contract would cost Con Ed would be better spent on subsidies to businesses and homeowners to adopt a variety of energy-saving devices. Investing in conservation and buying electricity from small independent generators, city officials say, would be cheaper and possibly more secure. 
Con Edison is already planning to spend $4.1 billion over the next 17 years on conservation programs intended to save 26 percent of its current generating capacity, a savings of five times as much power as the hydroelectric contract would bring. But as New York State approaches a deadline to complete the Canadian contract, utility officials say they are not sure they can rely on conservation to achieve more than they have already planned.
 Rejecting new hydroelectric purchases in favor of more conservation would be a huge change in the state's energy policy.
 While utilities around the country have recently moved heavily into promoting energy efficiency rather than new construction, and while the New York Public Service Commission has made it financially attractive for utilities here to do the same, the real decisions have not confronted Con Ed yet. The utility began the 1990's with surplus capacity and has not thus far used increased efficiency as a substitute for pouring concrete or signing new contracts with suppliers.
 Howard F. Squadron, the city's Commissioner of Telecommunications and Energy, described the city's argument in an interview as "part of an overall turn in the road," in which the way electricity is used has become as important as the way it is generated.
 
How Much 'Enlightened Energy'
 But the company has a marked reluctance to rely on more demand-side management, as efficiency is known in the industry, than it has already planned for in its current campaign, called Enlightened Energy.
 The company plans to spend $73 million on promoting conservation this year, which is equal to about 10 percent of its capital budget, and $4.2 billion between now and 2008.
 "The issue on Enlightened Energy is how much more you can get," said John E. Deegan Jr., senior vice president of the company.
 Among other goals, Con Ed already plans to subsidize or otherwise encourage the replacement of 89 percent of the commercial and industrial lighting in its 660-square-mile service territory, along with 64 percent of the commercial electric air conditioners and 60 percent of the residential refrigerators.
 
Like an Extra Indian Point
 By 2008 Enlightened Energy is supposed to reduce the summer peak load by 2,425 megawatts and winter load by 955 megawatts. (The summer effect is higher because Con Ed has focused its efforts on summer demand, which is higher, and its steps to make air conditioners more efficient and switch some air conditioners to steam or gas power do nothing to affect winter demand.)
 Stated differently, conservation by 2008 will give Con Edison as much electricity in winter as another Indian Point nuclear plant would. In summer, it would be like having another Indian Point plus another Astoria complex.
 These gains are far larger than anything Con Ed has tried before, and utility experts outside the company are not certain they are possible.
 "They probably won't get everything they want to get, but they'll get a good chunk of it," said William J. Balet, the executive director of the New York Power Pool, a utility consortium that helps plan power supplies and arrange power transfers between utilities. It may be 10 years, he said, before it is clear how much power is available through conservation.
 Con Edison has gone after efficiency improvements in part because it can make a big profit that way. In addition to selling high-efficiency light bulbs at subsidized rates, it is offering businesses subsidies if they will replace motors, air conditioners and lights with equipment that does the same work for less power. The initial response has been good from businesses and nearly overwhelming from residences, where 106,000 customers have taken up the utility on its offer to sell cut-rate bulbs that use only 25 percent of the electricity used by regular ones.
 On the commercial side, Con Ed is helping big buildings in Manhattan pay for installing air-conditioning equipment run by steam or natural gas, both of which are in surplus in summer.
 Although Con Ed loses money on each bulb it sells, it can recover its expenses through electric rates, both for the subsidies it pays and for the lost profits on power it no longer sells. And if it passes certain milestones in energy conservation, it is allowed to earn a higher rate of return on the money its shareholders have invested in the electric system.
 The State Power Authority is nearing the December deadline to decide whether to give final approval to the contract to import 1,000 megawatts from Hydro Quebec. In the past, the utility, which is owned by the province, has supplied up to 10 percent of the state's electricity in normal years.
 A spokesman for Mr. Squadron said that Mr. Dinkins would send a letter today to Richard F. Flynn, the chairman of the Power Authority, seeking a delay in the deadline for approving the contract, to leave time for more analysis of economic and environmental issues.
 
Electricity Market Changed
 Negotiations began in the late 1980's and a preliminary version was signed in 1989. Since then, the electricity market has changed substantially, with conservation measures and independent producers put into direct competition with traditional generators.
 While the cumulative goal of Enlightened Energy is huge, the proposed Hydro Quebec contract would also represent a large chunk of electricity for the state, more than the Indian Point 2 reactor provides. At 1,000 megawatts, it could be the largest block of energy added in the state in this decade.
 Under the contract, the New York Power Authority would sell 200 megawatts to its government customers in southeastern New York, including the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Port Authority and the New York City Housing Authority; 482 megawatts to Con Ed, 218 megawatts to the Long Island Lighting Company, and 100 megawatts to Orange and Rockland Utilities. The Public Service Commission began hearings last week on Con Ed's request for a rate increase, and the role of the proposed contract may come up in testimony this week.
 The agreement would run for 21 years, beginning in May 1995. Con Ed's cost would be $6.1 billion.
 
New Savings Estimates
 Mr. Flynn, the chairman of the Power Authority, once predicted that the contract would save New Yorkers $1 billion. But a spokesman for the authority said last week that with changes since the signing in 1989, that savings estimate was no longer valid, although the savings would still be substantial.
 The city bases its calculations on the costs and savings for Con Ed, assuming that the findings will hold true for the whole contract. The city estimates that one kilowatt of electricity -- the amount needed to keep 10 100-watt light bulbs burning -- will cost $3,551 through the 21 years of the contract with Hydro Quebec, and $721 through energy savings.
 Con Edison calculates the cost differently and reaches a different result, with the energy from Hydro Quebec coming out cheaper. But Con Ed does not dispute the city's method.
 Last Thursday, the New York State Energy Office, Public Service Commission and Department of Environmental Conservation jointly released a draft of their New York State Energy Master Plan, which said that a new contract with Hydro Quebec could raise rates slightly.
 
Debate on Which Plan Is Cleaner
 But shunning the contract, the report said, would increase use of coal, natural gas and imported oil, along with emissions of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, nitrogen oxide, which contributes to smog, and carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming.
 City officials, on the other hand, argue that increased reliance on conservation and independent power producers could be used to sidestep the nagging environmental questions about new dams in northern Quebec, at a price lower than what the Canadian power would cost.
 Environmental groups have been fighting against the contract. The contract is not tied to any particular project, but would lead Hydro Quebec to build new dams near Hudson Bay to generate the power, flooding the hunting grounds of the Cree Indians.
 New York first seriously sought hydroelectric power from Canada after the oil shock of 1973-74, and again after the oil shortage of 1979. In recent years as much as 40 percent of the state's electricity has come from oil, far higher than the national average. But last year, electricity came in almost equal parts from oil, coal, natural gas, hydroelectricity and nuclear reactors. Natural gas use seems poised to increase in coming years, with new pipelines and new constraints on utilities under the Clean Air Act. Nuclear power will not expand in this decade. Hydroelectricity depends in part on rainfall; this year, New York took very little from Canada because of a drought there.
 Reflecting the changed nature of the utility business, in an interview last week at his office at Con Edison, Mr. Deegan spoke at length about conservation and purchases from other electricity producers. The company began to assemble land on the Hudson River more than a decade ago to build a new generating station of its own some day, but neither Mr. Deegan nor a longtime spokesman for the company, Daniel Walden, could remember at first where the land was. It is in Red Hook.
 Con Ed's newest plant, the Indian Point 2 reactor, went into commercial operation 17 years ago this month.

Note Rate Raised to 8.80% By Ford's Associates Unit

 BODY:
The Associates Corporation of North America, a Dallas-based unit of the Ford Motor Company, increased the interest rate on its $300 million seven-year note issue yesterday to 8.80 percent from 8.75 percent, according to Morgan Stanley & Company, the lead underwriter. Based on the pricing last week, the yield has been increased to 8.829 percent.
The move came because Moody's Investors Service recently placed the debt of Associates under review because of the company's aggressive acquisition policy. Recently Associates said it was purchasing $900 million in assets from the Chase Manhattan Leasing Company. 
 Also, yesterday, Ford Capital B.V., another Ford unit, issued $400 million of noncallable guaranteed notes through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The 9 percent notes, which mature Aug. 15, 1998, were priced at 99.571 to yield 9.084 percent, or 118 basis points over Treasury notes of similar maturity. A rating of A2 is expected from Moody's. Ford Motor guarantees the notes.

Filthy Rich With a New York Cocaine Connection

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic

 BODY:
Almost as if embarrassed by the conspicuous prosperity, an army lieutenant smiles as he speaks of the riches of this city, where sumptuous villas with satellite dishes appear suddenly amid open plains of verdant farmland in a country where per capita income is less than $900 a year.
"San Francisco is the richest place in the republic, not just now, but always," the officer said. "We produce the most rice, the most coffee and the most cocoa. Just ask anyone here and they'll boast about how often they travel to New York -- not to stay there, but just to visit." 
 It is true that these crops, nourished in dark, well-irrigated soils, stoked the growth of this once-sleepy town, now a city of about 300,000, two hours north of Santo Domingo.
But once the ice is broken, most people readily tell visitors that the sprawling new neighborhoods, with their spacious, high-walled, brightly painted homes with two- and three-car garages, are the creation of "Dominican-Yorks," the daring youngsters who make their way to New York where small fortunes are said to be waiting to be made in the local and international drug trades.
 
New Money 'From Over There'
 Elsewhere in this country of seven million people, where virtually everyone has a relative or close friend living in the United States, the term Dominican-York can simply mean anyone who has lived in New York, usually laboring long hours to support a family back home. But in this city the inference is invariably to drug traffickers.
"We have lots of honest people who have earned good livings in farming and commerce, but all of this new money is from over there," said Julio Antonio Gonzeles Burell, who owns the local radio station, H-102 FM. "All of our nouveaux riches earned their money in drugs in New York."
Last month, Dominican police seized a cargo of more than 700 pounds of cocaine on the outskirts of town, where the police say a group of Dominican-Yorks had apparently betrayed their Colombian partners, robbing them of a shipment they themselves were ultimately forced to abandon.
If the drug seizure was spectacular, residents say it was also atypical. Most Dominican-Yorks, they say, lead quiet, almost staid, lives when at home, housing their families in luxury and going out little at night -- for fear, some say, of being assassinated, even though no one could remember the last murder in the city.
Asked why this city was considered a relatively safe haven, a man who identified himself as a Dominican-York and who gave his name only as Pedro, reached under the seat of his fancily stenciled pickup truck for a 9-millimeter pistol and answered with a grin, "Because everyone here has one of these."
Fineta Camilo Fernandez, a local journalist, said, "We are the most corrupt town in the whole country, but generally we have very little crime here."
While the abundance of Dominicans living in the United States has had a profound effect on this island nation's culture, introducing fancy discos, New York fashions and American-inspired argot into the smallest hamlet, it appears that many of those who have gone to work in the drug business have deliberately avoided bringing the most disturbing aspects of their New York way of life home with them. "The unwritten code says that the things they go to do in New York -- violence and drugs -- are O.K. over there, but are not permitted at home," said Wilfredo Lozano, a Dominican sociologist.
Others who have studied the behavior of the Dominican-Yorks say that typically the youngsters, sons of modest families, are sponsored in the drug business in New York by people already living there.
 
Victims of the Violence
 Leading a spartan life in small rented apartments, the workers pursue two- or three-year assignments that can vary from running drugs to performing hits ordered by their superiors. When their debt to a sponsor is paid and they feel they have earned enough money to build a home, most are said to return home.
Sometimes, however, the emigrants fall victim to the violence of New York. San Franciscans say that a man in his early 20's was shot recently before he could return home, but that he had already left enough money for his family to buy a home.
With the remainder, an elaborate funeral was conducted in which the dead man's coffin was escorted in a limousine followed by a band, which played his favorite music as the procession stopped at several popular restaurants where he was toasted before his burial.
"I sell 90 percent of my homes to these people," said Amado Then, who owns a construction company that has thrived on building houses costing three million pesos, or $250,000, paid for with Dominican-York money. "They don't sell the drugs here. They do their business over there and come home to live in peace."
Asked if anyone had tried to stop the growth of the community, Mr. Then said, "They say there is an agreement on sharing information on money flows between the Dominican Republic and the U.S., but up till now that doesn't seem to have stopped anyone."
What does seem to have stopped, or at least slowed, the boom is the economic slowdown in the United States, particularly in New York, and what San Franciscans speculate must be that city's improved law enforcement measures against their traffickers.
"There is a recession and a crackdown in New York, and a lot of killings of our people over there," Mr. Gonzeles said, "All these things have been bad for business. When things in New York begin to fall apart, you can immediately feel our economy falling apart too."

Allocating Funds For New Therapy

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
HEALTH insurers say they badly need clearer guidelines for allocating the billions of dollars that pay for expensive new medical technology. No one knows exactly how much is at stake, but Government economists estimate that new procedures are adding at least $12 billion annually to national medical spending.
"There is a glut of new technology, and our ability to assess it and determine the appropriate uses has not kept pace with our ability to produce it," said John L. Cova, director of medical technology assessment with the Health Insurance Association of America, an insurers' trade group in Washington. "We are attempting to play catch-up ball." 
Insurers do not usually pay for treatments with experimental drugs, instruments or procedures, holding back until they have been approved as safe and effective. Manufacturers finance research if a new product is involved, and doctors, hospitals and universities contribute time and money. The Government also contributes, but Federal research grants have not kept up with the explosion of new therapies. And in an era of publicized medical "miracles," patients often demand unproven treatments.
When insurers balk, the patients may go to court. A Federal district judge in Alexandria, Va., ruled last year that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Virginia had to pay for a bone marrow transplant for a breast cancer patient, even though the National Cancer Institute says the procedure's effectiveness has not been proved. The judge said the Blue Cross contract had failed to detail its criteria for refusing payment.
That can be difficult. "From the point of view of science, there is no sharp boundary between what is and is not experimental," said Dr. John E. Wennberg who heads a medical evaluation center at the Dartmouth Medical School. The Public Health Service is taking up the problem.
"Where is the great divide between experimental on one side and the cutting edge or state of the art on the other?" asked Dr. Thomas W. Holohan, director of the Office of Health Technology Assessment in the Federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. Insurers, Government officials and spokesmen for doctors, lawyers, educators, ethicists and drug and device makers will seek answers at a conference in November. "There is no real consensus," he said.
Employers and insurers are especially concerned. Dr. John Burns, vice president for health management with Honeywell Inc., which makes electronic control systems, said he had asked Dr. William Vaughan, an authority on bone marrow transplants at the University of Nebraska, for advice on the issue.
"We need a major public dialogue," said Susan Gleeson, executive director of quality assessment at the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association in Chicago. Blue Cross recently pledged $36 million for a large-scale study of autologous bone marrow transplants -- the removal and later reinsertion of bone marrow -- in breast cancer patients after high doses of chemotherapy, which is toxic to blood cells. The National Cancer Institute will analyze the results. It has approved bone marrow transplants for some cancers like leukemia but not for breast cancer.
Most marrow transplants cost at least $100,000, but Ms. Gleeson said a study at Duke University showed that patients could spend 19 days in the hospital instead of the usual 43 days, reducing costs to $75,000.
Doctors note that expensive new procedures often burst on the scene, only to be discarded later. "We spend a lot of money for new applications and shortly find out that this may not be the best place to spend it," said Dr. Robert E. McAfee, a surgeon in Portland, Me., who is vice chairman of the American Medical Association's board of trustees.
He said some surgeons used expensive lasers, for example, when electric cutting might work just as well. "Our system encourages overcapacity," Dr. McAfee added. "A good part of the research comes from the private sector. One has to be careful not to allow any special interest of the funder to interfere with the impartial assessment of a new technique."
Unlike drugs and devices, medical procedures like surgery do not come under Food and Drug Administration rules. "Even the definition of whether something is research or not is left almost entirely to the discretion of the surgeon," said Arthur L. Caplan, director of the University of Minnesota biomedical ethics center.
Dr. Wennberg and a group of Dartmouth and Harvard scientists have been working with the American Urological Association, a physician specialty group, to develop tests for a variety of treatments currently used for prostate hyperplasia, one of the most common surgical procedures. He said they were seeking Federal money and help from insurers for full-scale clinical trials. Having doctors and researchers as sponsors, Dr. Wennberg said, "provides a scientific umbrella to deal with the complexities and any conflicts of interest."

Rivals in Travel Industry Encouraged by Joint Drive

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
IN the spring, battered by war and recession, leading hotels, airlines, car-rental companies and other travel-related businesses joined forces for the first time, setting aside traditional rivalries to promote travel.
Now, encouraged by the campaign's results, top executives of these companies are working to hold this coalition together. 
 A total of 61 marketers contributed about $7 million toward a print and broadcast ad campaign produced by FCB/Leber Katz Partners, New York. The membership of Go USA! The Travel Coalition, as the organization is called, includes usually fierce competitors like the Hilton, Holiday Inn and Marriott hotel chains; American, Delta and United airlines; Hertz, Avis and Budget car-renters; American Express and Visa U.S.A. charge-card companies, and the Walt Disney and Universal Studios theme-park operators.
"It was amazing that all these companies pulled together to try and get travel jump-started for the spring and summer," J. W. (Bill) Marriott Jr., chairman of the Marriott Corporation and head of the coalition, said in a telephone interview. "And I think we ought to keep it together."
The coalition's campaign, which carried the theme "Travel moves people," was aimed primarily at business travelers who were citing the war and/or the recession as reasons to cancel or postpone traveling for business within the United States.
One print ad had the headline "You can't shake hands with a fax," while a radio commercial promoted "the special feeling that comes only from being there."
The coalition united "competitors who literally never talked to one another," said Laurel Cutler, vice chairman of FCB/Leber Katz, which also handles Marriott's advertising, "to do a job they never could have done on their own." She expects the members to keep the coalition intact, "and when it is appropriate to do something together," she added, "they will."
Though "it is awfully hard" to measure the effectiveness of the campaign, Mr. Marriott says he believes it did "reasonably well." "Occupancy in our hotels is better than it was a year ago," he said, "and we are starting to see some pretty good improvements in some parts of the country."
"It helped, but I don't think it was a total answer," Mr. Marriott continued. "The recession was stronger than we thought it would be."
The coalition sponsored two surveys to gauge the impact of the campaign. One, conducted by the Wirthlin Group, showed that 53 percent of the traveling public and 67 percent of frequent business travelers were aware of the campaign, which ended its run in May.
That survey also found that 20 percent of the traveling public and 17 percent of frequent business travelers specifically noted the coalition by name -- very high figures, Wirthlin says, given the campaign's duration.
As the campaign concluded, coalition members decided to spend about $500,000 to expand the reach of their message to business travelers overseas. A newspaper ad was produced showing Andrew Jackson's face on a $20 bill surrounded by faces from other countries' currencies. The headline: "Face to face is the best way to do business in the U.S."
"We always thought that 'Go USA!' had the potential to mean 'Go to the USA!' " said David Curtis, executive vice president and creative director at FCB/Leber Katz.
Enticing more international visitors here is a project that Mr. Marriott cited as an example of what the coalition might do in the future.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines Worldwide; Gold Advances in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined on world currency markets yesterday, falling sharply against the German mark.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose 60 cents, settling at $356.20 an ounce. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $356.35 an ounce, up 15 cents from Friday. 
 The dollar was under pressure worldwide, but a wave of technical selling was prompted by a drop in the dollar below 1.73 German marks.
In New York, the dollar lost nearly 3 pfennigs, settling at 1.7168 marks, down from 1.7415, and traders expected further declines.
"The fundamental impetus for the decline is the interest rate differential," said John McCarthy, chief dealer at Algemene Bank Nederland. The consensus is that the United States has room to lower interest rates, while the Germans are not only expected to hold rates steady but also possibly raise them.
Separately, the United States credit markets have been rallying, pushing bond prices higher while interest rates decline. That also has a negative effect on the dollar by making dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors.
"It looks like the dollar will continue to drop since there is nothing on the horizon to alter its course," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the financial advisory firm IDEA.
But the market is ignoring two factors that have the potential to support the dollar -- the continuing scandal in Japanese securities industry and the political turmoil in Yugoslavia, Mr. McCarthy said. Both have the potential to attract dollar buyers on the theory that the dollar is a haven in times of world distress.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 137.30 yen, down 0.23 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted lower at 136.55 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 136.65 yen, down from 137.20 on Friday.
The British pound was quoted at $1.7095, up from $1.6945 late on Friday. In New York, it cost $1.7110 to buy a pound, up from $1.6890 on Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late rates, included: 1.4960 Swiss francs, down from 1.5147; 5.8410 French francs, down from 5.9210; 1,283.68 Italian lire, down from 1,301.50, and 1.1495 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1505.

HEADLINE: Taxpayer Role Sought In Bailing Out Banks

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Buried in the debate over bank reform is a struggle involving Congress, the White House and the Federal Reserve over whether taxpayers should be given a permanent role in paying for future bank bailouts.
Congress has never granted any agency a blank check to spend taxpayer money in private-sector bailouts; a special law has financed each rescue. But in a strange twist to a reform movement intended to shield taxpayers, the House and Senate Banking Committees would change the rules so that taxpayers henceforth absorb some of the cost of rescuing commercial banks.
 
Softened Senate Bill
 The original bills were much tougher on taxpayers than the version that emerged on Friday from the Senate Banking Committee -- a version negotiated by Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, that preserves taxpayers' responsibility in principle, but in practice might drain away little public money. A consensus appears to be emerging in Congress for the mild Senate version. But whatever the actual language, the Fed and the White House have said in recent days that they will go along with a Congressional desire to recognize a taxpayer role.
The goal in Congress is to discipline the Fed, reflecting wide discontent with the Fed's practice of propping up failing banks. By forcing the Fed to draw on public funds when it lends to some weak banks, Congress hopes the central bank will become more reluctant to make loans from its "discount window" -- especially if they extend the life of a dying bank, adding to a bailout's cost.
"The Fed would be forced to think twice about making the no-brainer kinds of loans it is now making," said Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
The House and Senate panels would alter a practice that has existed since the 1930's: having the banking industry alone bear the cost of bailouts through premiums paid to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Fed, after lending money to banks that later collapsed, has always gone to the F.D.I.C. for reimbursement.
Now, the House Banking Committee, in a bill approved in June, and the Senate committee's milder provision, adopted on Friday, would require the Federal Reserve to justify lending to some banks in danger of failing and to draw on taxpayer funds if the loans exceeded certain limits set by Congress.
The Fed endorsed the tougher House version before the Senate acted on Friday. The Fed governors have not considered the Senate version, a spokesman said yesterday. A White House official yesterday praised the Senate version, mostly because the Senate dealt more to the White House's liking with the separate issue of rescuing big banks.
"We think 'too big to fail' rescues should be done, but only in extraordinary cases of risk to the economy," said Robert R. Glauber, a Treasury under secretary. "The Senate bill provides the necessary hurdles."
The American Bankers Association, representing the nation's 12,000 commercial banks, did not pick between House and Senate versions, but is lobbying for the principle that taxpayers, as well as the banking industry, must pay the cost of failures.
The association's support for a taxpayer role is understandable: Its insurance fund is nearly gone and the premiums paid by the nation's banks have tripled in recent years, to 23 cents for each $100 of deposits.
 
Study of Practices
 A House Banking Committee study, released in June, spotlighted the Fed's lending practices. The report found that over the last six years, the Fed had made loans to more than 300 banks that ultimately failed. The Fed has not challenged this. The resulting extra losses from extending the lives of dying banks were less than $2 billion over five years, said L. William Seidman, the F.D.I.C. chairman.
If Congress does, in fact, approve legislation that restricts Fed lending, the depositors most likely to be affected are those with uninsured funds -- more than $100,000 a depositor -- in a failing bank.
The Fed, by keeping a weak bank afloat, gives depositors time to transfer uninsured funds to healthy banks. If a weak bank was closed more quickly, people might not have time to do this.
Allowing deposits to migrate can make a bailout more costly. When the bank does fail or is merged, the F.D.I.C. has lost the opportunity to draw on uninsured deposits to help reimburse insured depositors or subsidize the merger.
"The principle on which most of the people in Congress are operating is to try to prevent us from covering depositors over $100,000," Mr. Seidman said.
 
Limits on Lending
 The House bill, in a key provison, limits to five days the period of time that the Federal Reserve can make loans to a bank whose capital, or available cash, falls below 2 percent of its outstanding loans. Any lending beyond five days would not be eligible for reimbursement. And the Fed could not collect collateral from the bank to assure F.D.I.C. reimbursement.
Instead, the money would have to come from the Fed's reserves. If it was lost, the Federal Reserve would have less to give the Treasury to help pay Government expenses, in effect putting more of a burden on taxpayers.
The House bill also permits the Treasury to rule whether a given bank's sudden failure would damage the financial system or a regional economy. Such a designation -- known as "too big to fail" -- would, when reported to Congress, enable the Fed to lend money to the bank to keep it going until a buyer could be found or the bank could be closed in some orderly fashion. The recent bailout of the Bank of New England is this sort of case. But under the House bill, the money would have to come from the Fed's pocket.
 
Compromise Is Accepted
 The original Senate version would have imposed even tougher restrictions, requiring the Fed to lend from its own pocket to any "significantly undercapitalized" bank, whatever the period of time. But on Friday, the committee accepted a compromise pushed by Senator Gramm.
If a loan of, say, $10 million to an undercapitalized bank goes beyond the five-day limit or some other specified period, and the money is lost in a failure, the Fed would have to pay from its own pocket only the lost interest, say $400,000, but not the principal, as in the House version. The F.D.I.C. would repay the principal.
The Gramm compromise also changed the too-big-to-fail provision, requiring more public debate than the House version. Under the Senate provision, not only the Treasury, but also the President and five of the Fed's seven governors, must decide that a bank is too big to fail. Only then can the Treasury advance to the Fed the money to keep the bank temporarily alive. But the payout would not come from the taxpayers' pocket; the Treasury would eventually recover the outlay through a special assessment on commercial banks.
 
Champions of Restrictions
 The Congressional goal of restricting the Fed is set forth most passionately by Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee, and Senator Riegle. This camp argues that the Fed too frequently tries to prolong the lives of banks that are clearly doomed and, as Mr. Gonzalez puts it, is "cavalier" in failing to report its lending practices to Congress.
Still, Senator Riegle's committee accepted a compromise put forth on Friday by Senator Gramm that assigned most of the bailout expense to the F.D.I.C. while preserving the principle of Fed accountability.
"We never intended that the taxpayer should play a role; it is an unfortunate byproduct of an attempt to change the Fed's incentives," said Patrick Lawler, chief economist for the Senate Banking Committee. "We think we now have something that deals with incentives, without putting any appreciable burden on the taxpayer."
Although the Fed is not publicly fighting the Congressional effort, the restrictions run counter to the Fed's view of its role as an independent supplier of emergency funds.
"I don't know that we are jumping up and down with joy, but we can understand what they are trying to do and we can live with it," John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor, said last week. "But my own view is that the lack of any discretionary flexibility is a mistake. One of the principal reasons for the Fed's existence is to provide emergency liquidity."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Little Changed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Treasury note and bond prices were little changed yesterday as dealers and investors were plotting strategies for the flurry of Treasury auctions that start today.
"With no economic news of import, the market is preoccupied with gauging demand for the Treasury auctions," said one Treasury note trader. 
 In the days and hours before the 1 P.M. auctions, securities dealers survey their clients to determine what level of interest rates would attract investors. The dealers' goal is to buy the securities at the lowest possible price, but not submit bids so low that the securities are awarded to other firms.
In advance of today's $14 billion sale of three-year Treasury notes, dealers offered the issue in the wholesale market with a yield of about 7.01 percent, down from 7.03 percent late Friday. For the 10-year notes to be sold tomorrow the yield is a full percentage point higher at about 8.02 percent, down from 8.03 percent late Friday.
 
Long-Term Treasury Bonds
 Among long-term Treasury bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue due in 2021 rose1/4 point yesterday, and closed with an offered price of 98 30/32, to yield 8.22 percent. Late last week, the bellwether Treasury bond yield was 8.24 percent. On Thursday, the Treasury auctioned $12 billion of new 30-year bonds.
In the short-term market, the Federal Reserve did not make any move to signal a push to reduce short-term rates, as some traders were hoping. But even in the absence of a visible Fed move, expectations of lower rates were enough that rates fell slightly at yesterday's regular auction of Treasury bills.
The new three-month bills sold at an average rate of 5.51 percent, down from 5.58 percent last week, while six-month bills were 5.59 percent, down from 5.69 percent.
Prior to this week's offering of $750 million of New York City bonds to be handled by Merrill Lynch & Company, securities dealers tentatively set interest rates ranging from about 7.60 percent for bonds due in 1995 to 7.90 percent in 2000, 8 percent in 2003 and 8.20 percent or slightly less in 2012. The official interest rates and prices for the bonds are expected tomorrow.
Yields on the city's bonds are much lower than March of this year, when bonds due in 20 years and longer were trading around 8.60 percent. Since yields for long-term bonds have fallen only about a quarter of a percentage point in that period, New York City bonds have improved relative to the rest of the market.
Jeffrey B. Augustine, portfolio manager at the Colonial New York Tax-Exempt Trust, said the strength in New York City bonds was due to "the fact that despite fiscal siege, they did meet the deadline for presenting a plan for a balanced budget." In additon, he noted that the supply of bonds issues by all local governments and authorities in New York State had fallen sharply. Since local buyers of a high tax state like New York absorb the vast majority of local government issues, changes in the supply of securities can cause significant changes in prices.
Mr. Augustine noted that data compiled by The Bond Buyer, a trade paper covering municipal finance, show that the volume of bonds by New York governments and authorities fell to only $434 million in July from $2.2 billion in February.
 
New York City Financing
 The city's financing also includes taxable bonds, meaning that bond interest payments are subject to Federal income tax. For taxable bonds due in 10 years, securities dealers said yesterday that the yield could be about 2.40 percentage points greater than 10-year Treasury securities, or slightly less than 10.5 percent based on yesterday's market conditions.
For New York investors who want bonds with interest payments exempt from state, city, and Federal income tax, but prefer higher-quality securities than offered by New York City, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority is expected to offer $370 million of new bonds later this week. Underwriters led by Dean Witter Reynolds expect to announce interest rates on the bonds Thursday. Because interest and principal on the Triborough bonds will be insured by the Municipal Bond Insurance Association, they will be rated triple A and carry much lower yields than New York City bonds. Other triple A rated, M.B.I.A. insured bonds due in about 13 years have been traded recently at about 6.85 percent, or about 1.15 percentage points lower than the yield expected for New York City bonds of similar maturity.
The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority plans to sell another $245 million of uninsured bonds about 30 days after this week's sale.
Following are results of yesterday's auctions of new Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Our Towns

BYLINE: By Wayne King

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J.

 BODY:
The flock is always sparse on a weekday, but the Rev. Michael Doyle believes that Mass is a wonderful way to start the day. So he says the Mass and has communion at Sacred Heart even though there are only two of the devout there to share it.
Carmella Labato, who has lived only a block or so away from the church for 77 years, is one of them -- the other is the church secretary -- and Mrs. Labato leads the prayer. She prays for the 230 children who attend the parish school, for everyone in her family, for Father Doyle and everyone in the church, many of whom she names, for all the cars parked around the church that they be protected from vandals, and for two bills pending in Trenton, one to reduce everyone's sewer bills and the other to allow the church to create a credit union. 
 "Amen," says Father Doyle.
"Carmella says a wonderful prayer," he observes. "She prays for absolutely everything."
Indeed, there is much to pray for in South Camden, the poorest, grittiest of neighborhoods in what is conceded to be the poorest and grittiest city in New Jersey, huddled on the banks of the Delaware in the Philadelphia shadows.
It is by most standards a depressing neighborhood, dominated by a huge scrap-metal yard and a sewage-treatment plant and a trash incinerator that seem to symbolize its fall from grace as a bustling blue-collar economic power a half-century and more ago. Its shipyard is long gone, and more recently Campbell Soup and RCA also fled for more promising climes.
So South Camden, in decline for years, now has almost nothing left. Its streets are bleak and shabby, lined with boarded-up homes, snaggletoothed and burned out, empty warehouses and vacant lots choked by weeds.
But Father Doyle somehow sees beauty in it. "It's panther beauty," he says in his soft Irish burr.
Panther beauty?
"Yes," he says. "Beauty you don't want to mess with."
At 56 years old, an Irish priest who left the little town of Longford to come to America 23 years ago and landed in Camden, Father Doyle is the spiritual engine driving a small renaissance in decaying South Camden.
Last week, Heart of Camden Inc., which is Sacred Heart's own neighborhood housing authority, completed renovation of the 48th house it has reclaimed from the rubble in the past five years, with the help of prison inmates, Sacred Heart's own parishioners, volunteers from suburban churches and anyone else who can swing a hammer or lay a brick.
The church is also the driving force behind a citywide effort by a coalition of churches to protect poor neighborhoods from continued proliferation of unwanted projects like the county trash incinerator, a state prison and the huge sewage-treatment plant that loom across a vacant lot from Sacred Heart.
The coalition blocked a second prison and successfully lobbied for a bill in the legislature that would allow compensation to residents who live near the treatment plant.
"Carmella has been praying for that one for three years," observed Father Doyle. It now awaits Gov. Jim Florio's signature. Mrs. Labato is now praying for legislation the coalition is pressing that would allow the 18 member churches to create credit unions to serve the poor who now cannot get loans or even cash their meager checks.
Besides the abandoned houses it is renovating, the church acquired a vacant lot from the city for a neighborhood garden. Father Doyle admits he simply put a fence around it first and then set about negotiating a lease.
"Well, you know, if we hadn't fenced it," says the good father, who denies any larcenous intent, "it would have just been filled up with people dumping their trash."
Though fenced, the garden, in the middle of blocks of squalor, is recently acquired and yet to be planted by the people. The soil, like the neighborhood, is depleted, and Father Doyle says it must be fertilized and renewed before it is properly planted in the spring.
But even so, there is life already, rough grass and weeds pushing through. "The life always comes through," says Father Doyle, who says he finds that alone sustaining. "That's the beauty."

HEADLINE: B.C.C.I.'s Best Customer Is Also Its Worst Customer

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KARACHI, Pakistan, Aug. 5

 BODY:
At the heart of the scandals surrounding the Bank of Credit and Commerce International are three Pakistani brothers, the Gokals, whose tangled finances, soured loans and powerful political connections here are subjecting their powerful but publicity-shy family to unwanted attention from investigators from around the world.
The Gokal brothers, through a collection of shipping companies known as the Gulf Group, were the bank's largest customer -- as well as principal bad debtor, according to auditors who have reviewed B.C.C.I.'s records for the Bank of England, Britain's central bank and top banking regulator. 
 Investigators say the Gokals may owe B.C.C.I. more than $700 million and that loans to the brothers and their companies were made through false documents and surreptitious money transfers involving nearly 750 B.C.C.I. accounts.
False documents and sour loans dominated the books of B.C.C.I., regulators and auditors say. But the story of the Gokals provides one answer to the question many regulators have asked: Where did all the money go? B.C.C.I. is insolvent by at least $5 billion, auditors say, a staggering amount for a bank that had reported assets of $20 billion.
 
Bankruptcy Is Reported
 The European-based shipping empire created by the three brothers -- Abbas, Murtaza and Mustafa, who left Pakistan together nearly 30 years ago -- is now said to be on the verge of collapse.
Shipping industry publications in Europe have reported that a Luxembourg-based holding company for the Gokals, Gulf International Holdings, filed in Luxembourg for protection from its creditors in early July, just as bank regulators in seven nations seized B.C.C.I.'s operations in more than 60 countries and accused it of widespread fraud.
Pakistani businessmen acquainted with the Gokals suggest that much of the explanation for the collapse of B.C.C.I. may lie in a secretive financial alliance struck years ago between the brothers and the bank's Pakistani founder, Aga Hassan Abedi.
The partnership extends back to at least 1976, when one of the Gokal brothers tried -- and failed -- to buy a small New York City bank, with the backing of Mr. Abedi's bank.
The extended Gokal family, which numbers in the hundreds, remains something of a financial dynasty in Karachi, the Pakistani port city that is the nation's financial capital.
The Gokals have refused to comment on their connections to the bank or on the condition of their shipping business. "They are very private men, and they don't like to see their names in the newspapers," said a London spokesman for the brothers.
Mr. Abedi, who is ailing after two heart attacks and a heart transplant, has declined interview requests from foreign journalists.
In brief interviews with Pakistani reporters, Mr. Abedi, who remains a visionary hero to many of his countrymen despite the scandal surrounding the bank, has said that the troubles that brought down B.C.C.I. began only after he left the bank in 1988.
 
First Stop: Iraq
 The saga of the Gokal brothers begins in the early 1960's, when the young Pakistanis, seeing the limitations of Pakistan's economy, joined with an uncle to set up a trading company in Iraq.
Family members interviewed in Pakistan said the trading company was successful, but the brothers were forced to leave Iraq after the 1968 revolution that brought the Baath Party to power and led eventually to the installation of President Saddam Hussein. The uncle was reported to have been executed in Iraq.
The brothers fled to Europe, where they began a shipping business that transported dry cargos, including grain and cement from the subcontinent of Asia to Europe and the Middle East.
With the assistance of large loans from B.C.C.I., the business grew into a shipping empire that rivaled any in the world, with more than 150 vessels in its fleet by the mid-1970's.
It was in 1976 that Abbas Gokal traveled to New York and sought permission from banking authorities in New York State to purchase a small bank, Chelsea National, with the assistance of B.C.C.I.
In a telephone interview today from New York, John G. Heimann, who had been the state's banking superintendent and is now an executive with Merrill Lynch & Company, said he recalled an "awfully strange" meeting with Mr. Gokal.
"Mr. Gokal was in the shipping business, and he made no pretense of having any experience in banking," Mr. Heimann said. "He indicated he would be heavily relying for advice, counsel and guidance on B.C.C.I."
Mr. Heimann said he had turned down the application because of Mr. Gokal's admitted lack of banking experience and because of concern that B.C.C.I., with its many operations scattered around the world, lacked a "primary regulator" responsible for assuring its adherence to international banking practices.
 
A Potential Front Man?
 Mr. Heimann said he now suspects that Mr. Gokal may not have wanted the bank for himself but was instead acting as a front for B.C.C.I., which went on to take control of other American banks including one in New York. That bank became part of First American Bankshares Inc. of Washington, which the Federal Reserve Board says B.C.C.I. purchased by lending money to a group of Middle East investors who were "front men" for B.C.C.I.
"As I look back now and learn that B.C.C.I. had an extraordinary relationship with the Gokals, it just gives rise to the speculation that he was buying it for B.C.C.I., but I didn't know that at the time," Mr. Heimann said.
Pakistani businessmen said that some of the rapid growth at B.C.C.I. and at the Gokals' shipping enterprises could be explained through their mutual ties to the Government of Pakistan -- specifically, to the nation's former leader, Gen. Zia ul-Haq.
"If you look closely you could find that Zia helped the Gokals, the Gokals helped Abedi and the bank, and Abedi and the bank helped Zia's Government," said a shipping executive in Karachi.
In the early 1980's, Mustafa Gokal was appointed by General Zia as his chief shipping adviser, a role that gave Mr. Gokal expansive powers over Pakistan's merchant shipping industry.
 
Zia Intervenes
 According to news reports in Pakistan, it was Mr. Abedi who introduced Mustafa Gokal to General Zia and recommended Mr. Gokal for the shipping post.
Mr. Gokal's tenure as shipping adviser would later come under intense scrutiny by a parliamentary committee investigating corruption in General Zia's martial-law Government.
According to the committee's investigators, General Zia intervened in 1981 and 1982 to provide a shipping company owned by Mr. Gokal with a $75 million Government contract to transport Australian wheat, even though there had been a far lower bid on the job.
News reports at the time said that Mr. Gokal denied any impropriety in the awarding of the contract, and he was never charged with any crime. General Zia was killed in a 1988 plane crash.
The general and Mr. Abedi were close, and General Zia was considered a good friend of the bank. His son once worked as a B.C.C.I. executive in the Persian Gulf emirate of Dubai.
 
Sapped by Diversification
 Karachi shipping officials say the Gokals' troubles had begun when the brothers diversified in the late 1980's into oil, foreign exchange and other riskier markets.
"They were considered good shippers, among the very best," said a Karachi shipping agent. "They should have stayed in shipping."
As the Gokals' losses grew in the late 1980's, so too grew their debt to B.C.C.I., which was at the same time coming under scrutiny by regulators and other investigators who suspected that the bank was dealing with drug smugglers and arms dealers.

HEADLINE: BAGHHAD REVEALS IT HAD PLUTONIUM OF WEAPONS GRADE

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Iraq has disclosed that its scientists were secretly able to extract a small amount of plutonium, suitable for making an atomic bomb, from spent fuel at a nuclear installation whose operations came under international safeguards, United Nations officials said today.
Officials said the disclosure was troubling new evidence that Iraq's efforts to produce a nuclear weapon were significantly more extensive than previously known, even given Baghdad's piecemeal acknowledgements to United Nations monitors since the Persian Gulf war. 
 The latest disclosure and a separate new admission by Iraq that it had deliberately misled United Nations inspectors about a secret biological weapons program raise new doubts about Baghdad's willingness to forswear weapons of mass destruction.
 
Meeting on Sanctions
 Further, the disclosure about the plutonium extraction calls into question the effectiveness of international efforts to monitor ostensibly peaceful nuclear programs to prevent the spread of nuclear arms.
The disclosures came as the Security Council was meeting today on whether to lift the sanctions imposed against Iraq, a move that Baghdad insists is vital to its reconstruction. Officials said such a step was unlikely now in light of the new information.
Robert L. Gallucci, the deputy chairman of the United Nations commission charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said that the Iraqis in recent days acknowledged extracting three grams of plutonium from spent fuel in a small research reactor at Tuwaitha, an industrial town outside Baghdad. He said that the amount was far short of the quantity needed to produce a nuclear weapon and that Baghdad denied it was meant for a bomb.
 
'A Very Serious Matter'
 Mr. Gallucci said, however, that the disclosure clearly confirmed that Iraq had been able to obtain nuclear-weapons-grade material in a laboratory that had been under United Nations scrutiny even before the gulf war. He said the plutonium extraction had begun before the war.
"This is a very serious matter," Mr. Gallucci said. "The facility was under safeguards, but the activity was not reported. It is of concern whenever practice that should be safeguarded is done outside of safeguards."
Mr. Gallucci also said United Nations inspectors now in Iraq were looking for electronic triggers necessary to detonate a nuclear bomb. Baghdad has not declared any of the devices, but is believed to have acquired them.
After the war, Iraq, which as a signer of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty had already committed itself to international safeguards and inspections, at first denied having any programs to process uranium. But in recent months, as it has sought to have United Nations trade sanctions lifted, Iraq has disclosed three secret uranium processing programs. Today's disclosure about the plutonium is the fourth program that could have been meant to develop a nuclear bomb.
Even before today's new information, the United States had criticized Iraq's disclosures as inadequate, saying they concealed the true extent of its weapons programs. Washington has not ruled out new military attacks to finally destroy them, although it has had trouble achieving a consensus among its gulf war allies over any new use of force.
Paul L. Leventhal, president of th Nuclear Control Institute in Washington, said today's revelation was the clearest and strongest to date that Iraq was on the track toward developing a nuclear bomb.
"This represents fair warning," he said.
Since its defeat in the gulf war, Iraq has been required under the United Nations cease-fire resolution to list all types, amounts and locations of chemical and biological weapons, as well as all material that could be used in making nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. In April, Iraq informed the United Nations that a substantial arsenal of chemical and ballistic weapons survived the war, but it denied having nuclear arms, nuclear-weapons-grade materials or biological weapons.
Mr. Leventhal said the acknowledgement of a plutonium-processing program was significant because, though it is extracted by a procedure "messier" than trying to build a bomb from enriched uranium, it also is one that is easier to conceal.
"In some ways plutonium is the preferable material because you don't need as much of it for a bomb," he said.
Mr. Leventhal said about eight kilograms of plutonium -- which can be chemically separated from spent fuel from a research or production reactor -- are needed to make an imploding nuclear device, compared with about 25 kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
"Presumably they're processing their own spent fuel," he said, which means Iraq could easily keep such a program hidden from international inspectors.
Mr. Gallucci said Iraq, as required under the nonproliferation treaty, had told the International Atomic Energy Agency about the reactor at Tuwaitha, which is just southeast of Baghdad. But it had operated the plutonium separation clandestinely.
Other officials said that Tuwaitha was one of the sites on the United Nations inspection team's list and that the Iraqis had probably decided to acknowledge operating the secret plutonium program there rather than have the inspectors learn this on their own.
Most experts agree that unless Iraq could greatly expand and improve its uranium-separation capacity, its production of uranium-fueled weapons is years away.
Plutonium has certain advantages over uranium as a bomb fuel. It is denser than uranium, and less of it is needed to achieve "critical mass," the weight above which a chain nuclear reaction begins.
 
Process Would Take Years
 But the amount of plutonium that can be produced by treating the spent wastes of an ordinary nuclear power reactor is limited by the size and capacity of the reactor, the rate at which it is kept running and other factors. If Iraq has only purified three grams of the silvery, white metal, its production rate is presumably so low that it would take years to make one bomb.
United Nations officials said Baghdad also has admitted that it falsely stated that a plant at Salman Pak near the capital was used for food analysis when in fact it was used for biological weapons research. The Iraqis said they had withheld the information until now "because it would have been misconstrued by the world at large."
The admissions were both made within the last several days to the 28-member Special Commission team that arrived in Iraq on Friday to check the country's claims that it does not possess biological warfare capability.
 
'Fairly Horrific Facts'
 The British representative to the Security Council, Sir David Hannay, described the new revelations as "fairly horrific facts" that once again brought suspicion on Baghdad.
"The vast majority of the council has taken the view that there's no justification for changes in the sanctions regime," Sir David told reporters as he left the council meeting today.
The Iraqi report -- delivered as the first step toward the compulsory destruction of its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons sites -- said it had nearly 10,000 nerve-gas warheads, 1,000 tons of nerve and mustard gas, nearly 1,500 chemical weapons bombs and shells, 52 Scud missiles and 30 chemical and conventional warheads.
The United States challenged Iraq's claims as understated, saying American intelligence reports showed that Iraq was researching and developing biological weapons at a number of sites, including the Salman Pak plant, 22 miles southeast of Baghdad.
 
Secretary General Reports
 The United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, told Security Council members today that Iraq had informed the inspection team late last week that it had carried out biological research for defensive military purposes at Salman Pak. The Iraqis said the research began in 1986 and ended in August 1990, at which time all the nerve agents were destroyed.
"The Iraqi Government had previously notified the Special Commission that the purpose of the Salman Pak facility was the inspection and analysis of foods and liquids for human consumption, and for identifying chemical and biological contamination by laboratory diagnosis," Mr. Perez de Cuellar told Security Council members during the meeting.

HEADLINE: For Israel, Navigator Of Finance

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The Israeli economy is at a crossroads, and the man chosen to lead it out of the socialist wilderness is a well-connected economist who favors hard money, open trade and free markets.
After about 20 years in the United States, Jacob Frenkel, 48 years old, is returning to Israel on Aug. 15 to become head of Israel's central bank and the Government's top economic adviser -- the "compass and conscience," as one former governor of the Bank of Israel put it, of the country's economic policy. 
 Mr. Frenkel, who is now chief economist at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, spent most of his academic career in a redoubt of laissez-faire thinking, the University of Chicago economics department.
But Mr. Frenkel is no ideologue. He points fondly to a giant bust in his office of John Maynard Keynes, the groundbreaking British economist who was an opponent of laissez-faire thinking and the patron saint of government interventionists. And he prides himself on being a pragmatist.
 
Little Growth, Much Inflation
 The appointment of a respected professional with no apparent political ties is widely seen as a sign that Israel's politically gridlocked Government is still committed, even if with mixed feelings, to economic restructuring.
Although Israel has thriving private enterprises, its welfare state swallow up nearly half the nation's gross national product. The Government controls a big chunk of industry. And Israel's labor market, dominated by big union federations, is hamstrung by restrictive practices. The result: too little growth and too much inflation in the last couple of decades.
In early July, a fact-finding mission from the International Monetary Fund complained that the Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was not moving fast enough with its reform program. The mission also raised concerns about "a major risk" of inflation and too much government largess.
Mr. Frenkel made it clear that he shared these concerns. "Between the I.M.F. team and Israeli economists," he said, "there is complete agreement on the key principles."
 
Some Changes Under Way
 At the moment, the I.M.F. team said, the Israeli economy is growing briskly. Some reforms, especially freeing up financial markets, eliminating Government subsidies and lowering import barriers, are under way.
"Things are moving in the right direction, said Michael Bruno, Mr. Frenkel's tough-minded predecessor. "Too slowly, but there is an improvement, nonetheless."
What makes economic change a burning issue these days is that Israel must create hundreds of thousands of new jobs to make room for the flood of new Soviet emigres -- as many as one million. If the economy cannot absorb the emigres, more than 200,000 of whom have already arrived, the nation risks losing a vital human resource that could fuel future economic growth.
Recently, unemployment has reached almost 10 percent and, more likely than not, will head even higher. Israelis worry that, without radical reforms, job growth will be so sluggish that more Soviet Jews will be discouraged from coming or that young Israelis will leave.
 
A Lot of Influence'
 In Mr. Frenkel's view, making Israel more attractive to foreign investors, selling state-run companies and loosening labor-market restrictions deserve top priority as a way to encourage job growth in private enterprise. To be avoided: establishing big new state job programs that create deficits and, ultimately, higher inflation.
Mr. Frenkel's views are likely to command a wide audience, people involved in Israeli economic policy say.
"He'll bring a lot of influence to the job; his opinion will be very much respected," said Herbert Stein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Richard M. Nixon.
"He's an economist who's sat at the bedsides of sick economies all over the world," said Richard T. McCormack, former Under Secretary of the Treasury. "The I.M.F. is the doctor to sick economies. He knows what works, what doesn't."
Because Israel expects the refugees to arrive within a few years, it intends to borrow much of the money it will need abroad. To improve the loan terms, Israel is seeking $10 billion in loan guarantees from the United States.
 
U.S. Treasury to Back Debt
 Under such guarantees, the United States Treasury would promise to repay creditors if Israel were to default on its debt. The guarantees would pry open global capital markets.
"It would be seen as a vote of confidence in Israel's capacity to manage its debt," Mr. Frenkel said.
Helena Hessel, an analyst at Standard & Poor's, said Israel has never floated bonds on international capital markets other than below-market-rate bonds sold primarily to supporters of Israel.
At this juncture, Mr. Frenkel's popularity among the movers and shakers making policy in many countries is likely to be a major asset.
"Jacob knows everybody," said Stanley Fischer, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a longtime adviser to the Israelis. "That is very important for Israel. They're really trying to get back into the international community."
 
To Face a Major Test
 Mr. Frenkel indicates that he will make maintaining the gains of Israel's 1985 battle against hyperinflation a priority. Inflation, once over 500 percent, has been running 15 to 20 percent.
He will face a major test within weeks of his arrival. The Finance Minister will present the 1992 budget to the Cabinet in September. Mr. Frenkel said that he will fight to hold the line on spending and to gain a commitment now to lower deficits in the future.
"Jacob talks, he's easy, he appears flexible," said Rudiger Dornbusch, who has known Mr. Frenkel since the two were students at the University of Chicago. "But don't arm-wrestle him."
Born in Tel Aviv, Mr. Frenkel worked his way through college cutting and polishing diamonds. As a University of Chicago graduate student, his sharp insights in international economics so impressed his professors, including Milton Friedman, that he was invited to join the faculty in 1970.
 
Big Cut in Salary
 Seemingly tireless, Mr. Frenkel proceeded to write, collaborate on or edit more than 200 scholarly papers, 15 books and a number of journals.
When Mr. Frenkel was about to go to the International Monetary Fund in 1987, Mr. Friedman advised him not to. "I said he could do more good by making contributions to scientific work than by becoming a bureaucrat," he said. "Of course, Jacob has been enormously productive there." He credits Mr. Frenkel for revitalizing the I.M.F.'s research department.
Plunging into Israeli politics will cost Mr. Frenkel more than the chance to publish more scholarly papers. His take-home pay will be the equivalent of less than $30,000 a year, compared with his $150,000 salary at the I.M.F. His wife, Niza, will have to disrupt her career as a cancer researcher.
But Mr. Frenkel said he felt "extremely privileged."
"There's a lot to be done," he said. "But we're not talking about mission impossible."

HEADLINE: Can't Count on Numbers;
The Elaborate Effort to Adjust the Census By Using Statistics Adds Up to Ambiguity

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Most experts agree that the 1990 census failed to ferret out about four million to five million Americans, a disproportionate number of them probably black, Hispanic or Asian. Most also agree that the Census Bureau's statistical fix would better reflect the nation's total population.
But they are deeply divided on the critical question of whether the adjustment would provide more accurate -- and fairer -- counts for individual cities and Congressional districts. 
 Judging the case for adjustment to be "inconclusive and unconvincing," Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher declined on July 15 to "abandon a 200-year-old tradition of how we actually count people." But Mr. Mosbacher's words will certainly not be the last on an issue that mixes race and money with a dollop of partisan politics.
New York City is challenging his decision in Federal court, and parallel suits have been filed in Georgia and Illinois. But unfortunately, the experts on whom the plaintiffs and the Commerce Department will be calling for support will not be able to lean too heavily on science.
For while statisticians had high hopes for straightforward answers as to whether the adjustment would be an improvement, they have instead found disappointingly ambiguous results, because of the sheer complexity of the adjustment process. What began as an attempt to clear the air has further clouded it.
David Freedman, a statistician at the University of California at Berkeley, said the Census Bureau did a better job in the actual 1990 census than anyone might reasonably have expected. In just one year, the bureau hired and trained about 500,000 temporary employees -- more than the work force of the General Motors Corporation. And by independent analysis based on birth, death and immigration records, just 2 percent of the population escaped the bureau's dragnet -- half the rate of undercount that marred the 1950 census, a particularly inaccurate count.
But for some purposes, a good job may not be good enough. According to the Census Bureau's own demographic analysis, the percentage undercount of blacks has been three to four times as large as nonblacks in the last three censuses. And it has been widely assumed that the effects of the undercount have been magnified in big cities, where nonwhites represent a larger fraction of the population and the practical problems of finding residents are greatest.
That is why a slew of cities and states filed suit a decade ago to block the use of the 1980 census, and why, in 1989, the Bush Administration agreed to the elaborate post-census survey to create a "dual system estimator" of the true population in 1990.
 
Counting Fish, Counting People
 Statisticians explain their approach to correcting the census by the analogy of counting fish in a pond. There may be no practical way of enumerating the fish without draining the pond. But census takers could catch, say, 100 fish, tag them and throw them back alive. Then they could go fishing once again. If one-third of the fish caught the second time around had tags, it would be reasonable to infer that a total of 300 fish actually lived in the pond.
With the 1990 census, statisticians essentially went fishing a second time, sending surveyors to do a careful recount in 5,000 randomly selected census blocks with a total population of about 400,000. They then matched every individual with the original census data to estimate how many people had been missed, as well as how many people had been counted more than once.
For example, in a block with an original count of 1,000, they might have discovered 50 people who had not previously been found, along with 10 who had been counted twice. The net undercount of 40 represents a 4 percent undercount.
Had the focus of the recount been to re-estimate the total population, that might have been the end of the story. If, on average, there had been an undercount of 4 percent in the 5,000 sample blocks, one would infer that the undercount averaged 4 percent in the census blocks not surveyed. But a major concern -- indeed, the assumption driving the survey effort -- was that the undercount was not uniform among groups or geographic areas.
 
1,400 Pigeonholes
 That explains the next step in the process. Every person in the 5,000 blocks was classified according to race, sex, age, ethnicity, whether he or she lived in a central city, suburb or other area and whether the person owned a residence or rented. Each person was then assigned to one of 1,392 categories according to these characteristics, with each category containing at most a few thousand people. Then, an undercount was estimated for each of the defined groups.
One category, for example, consisted of white Hispanic women age 10 to 19 who lived in rental housing in central cities in Middle Atlantic states. The original census in the 5,000-block sample may have counted 200 in this group, while the post-census survey may have found 202. The undercount for this category would thus be 1 percent. Another category -- say, black men ages 20 to 29 in owner-occupied housing in Middle Atlantic region suburbs -- might have an estimated undercount of 3 percent.
Similar calculations for each of the 1,392 categories allow an estimate of the undercount for any geographic area simply by reassembling the pieces in the correct proportions. Newark, with its heavy representation of black men, showed an undercount of 6.7 percent. By contrast, Saratoga County, N.Y., which is largely rural, actually showed an overcount of 0.7 percent.
These new estimates of population are just that: estimates. If a different set of 5,000 census blocks had been randomly selected, the results would have been different. And in an effort to refine the process, the Census Bureau used a variety of statistical techniques to "smooth" the estimated undercounts.
 
Accurate Enough for Some
 Smoothing tends to narrow the range of results. For example, with the smoothing method finally selected, Newark's undercount comes down to 3.8 percent, while Saratoga's overcount erodes to 0.2 percent.
Does the tortuous process, from re-sampling the census to smoothing the raw estimates of the undercount, really improve the quality of the census?
The results certainly pass an initial test. The nation's total estimated population came out 5.2 million larger than the original enumeration, right on the target identified with records of vital statistics. As expected, the estimated black undercount was 4.8 percent, three times the rate for nonblacks. And the undercount rate for men was substantially higher than for women.
That, augmented by evidence from a number of internal studies, was good enough for a committee of senior Census Bureau professionals who voted 7 to 2 to adjust the census. And it was good enough for Barbara Bryant, the Census Bureau director appointed by President Bush. "While far from a perfect procedure," Ms. Bryant wrote, it "will on average increase the accuracy of the 1990 census."
 
Why No Definitive Answer?
 But a panel of outside experts advising the Census Bureau split evenly on the question. And Michael Darby, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs who happens to be an economist with expertise in statistics, came down strongly against adjustment.
While the overall adjusted count may well be more accurate, he wrote, the Census Bureau's own analysis suggests that it is less accurate on the issue of where the undercounted people live -- the issue that matters for purposes of apportionment. The adjusted estimate of the fraction of the population living in 28 states, he reckoned, was probably a step backward from the census itself.
Why aren't some experts satisfied? The problems are not the mechanics of the post-enumeration survey, or the re-match. Ken Wachter, a member of the advisory panel who teaches statistics at the University of California, said the "census did itself proud in bringing this off." But each step in the estimation process, he argues, introduced potential sources of error. And in the end, the sample proved too small to erase the uncertainty linked to the sampling process.
One unanticipated complication, Mr. Wachter says, is that a major source of differences stemmed from overcounting rather than undercounting -- reporting people twice or reporting people who were not there in the first place. But the survey was intended to find systematic differences in the way various categories were undercounted, not in ferreting out random errors in the original count.
 
Adjusting the Adjustment
 A more fundamental complication is the role of smoothing, the mathematical manipulation of the initial estimates of the undercount. The point of smoothing is to prevent a few large errors from muddying what would otherwise be a clear result. But there are a wide variety of defensible choices in smoothing techniques. And Peter Bounpane, an assistant director of the census, confirms that "if you change the smoothing procedure you get very different results."
The census received financing to survey 400,000 people -- half the sampling size the big-city plaintiffs initially wanted. Was Washington pennywise?
John Tukey of Princeton, one of America's most distinguished mathematicians and a member of the advisory panel who favored adjustment, doubts that the larger survey would have made much difference. The larger the sample, he notes, the smaller the uncertainty inherent in sampling: Catching 50 fish rather than 10 the second time around would give you a more reliable estimate of the total number of fish in the pond.
But the maximum possible gain from a larger survey would have been modest -- probably too modest to overcome the critics' objections. And in any case, Mr. Tukey says, the measurement errors introduced in trying to manage a larger survey would probably have offset the sampling gains.
 
Less Effect Than Expected
 One consolation to those who labored to no definitive end, Mr. Darby suggests, is that the practical impact of the adjustment decision is smaller than anticipated. Using the adjusted population figures would move just two Congressional seats, with Arizona and California gaining at the expense of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
Many states, including New York, that expected to win billions in Federal money with the adjustment would be virtually unaffected because the potential gains in some communities are offset by losses in others. And many big cities, including New York City, have only modest stakes in adjustment because their piece of a total aid pie set aside for cities would increase very little.
The real costs, many experts fear, will be the intangible ones. Adjusting the count by a complicated statistical technique that everyone agrees is flawed would feed the resentment of people already suspicious of Government's means and motives. On the other hand, failing to adjust a census that undercounts blacks and Hispanics would alienate minorities.
Heads you lose, tails you lose.

HEADLINE: Let Unemployment Benefits Run Out

BYLINE: By E. Clay Shaw Jr.; E. Clay Shaw Jr., Republican of Florida, is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If the Democrats had their way, the nation would have a new system of increased benefits for unemployed workers. Though President Bush is expected to kill the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act that Congress approved last week, the Democratic leadership has already promised to push similar legislation when Congress returns in September. The debate, in short, is just beginning, but almost no one, least of all elected officials, is willing to be identified with the strong case against these benefit increases.
The U.S. has a basic unemployment system in which qualified workers receive 26 weeks of benefits averaging about $160 a week. If unemployment in a state is very high -- between 9 and 12 percent -- then workers in that state who use up their benefits can qualify for an additional 13 weeks. In 1975 and 1982, the two most recent recessions, Congress added another tier of temporary benefits, which generally extend the payments for a year or longer. 
 Though we seem to be at the end of a recession, the Democrats have proposed a revamped unemployment system that would provide millions of workers with benefits for 20 weeks beyond the basic 26 weeks. While both parties agree that the U.S. should provide unemployment benefits and that we should give additional benefits in high unemployment states, the agreement ends there.
The Democrats, for whom labor has been a major constituency, want more benefits for more people. The image of unemployment portrayed by the Democrats is of a worker laid off by declines in his industry, spending every day looking for a job, running out of money.
Many Republicans want basic coverage and additional coverage under truly difficult circumstances as well. But unlike the Democrats, we realize that the U.S. economy is dynamic; capitalism is creative destruction. Between 1970 and 1988, for example, the primary metal industries lost half a million workers, or 40 percent of their workforce. Over the same period, the number of employees in business services increased by nearly four million people. Despite the loss of millions of jobs and types of jobs, employment rose from 58 percent to 62.6 percent of the adult population.
Of course, everyone agrees that a representative government must help citizens victimized by the inevitable processes of capitalism. But how much help? Is 26 weeks enough? Should the nation, as the Democrats have argued, provide 46 weeks of benefits to some workers? Will their jobs return at the end of 46 weeks?
Someone must pay the bill. And under today's unemployment system, we tax productive industries and productive workers to provide benefits for less productive workers in struggling industries. Our unemployment system must try to balance market realities with compassion.
The recession has not pushed employment to the point where emergency measures are necessary. The current system will provide $25 billion in benefits this year, up from $18 billion last year; 10.7 million workers will receive benefits, up from 8.1 million last year; workers in nine states will receive up to 13 weeks of extended benefits, up from four states last year; 160,000 workers will receive extended benefits, up from 40,000 last year.
Moreover, all recessions are not equal. In 1982, the last time Congress voted for emergency benefits, unemployment was at 10 percent and had been above 7 percent for 31 consecutive months. Today unemployment is 6.8 percent and has exceeded 7 percent only once in the last 31 months. When Congress last ended emergency benefits in 1985, unemployment was at 7.2 percent -- higher than the rate at which Democrats would begin such aid today.
We have a reasonably effective system of unemployment benefits. We had a mild recession and the system responded properly. Congress would enact emergency benefits if there were an emergency, but the numbers tell us there is not. We should continue to support the existing unemployment insurance, which balances benefits against costs.

HEADLINE: Protecting Employee Privacy Too Far

 BODY:
Employer intrusions into employees' private lives have provoked wide, healthy reaction. Now it's the reaction that risks going too far.
Some states, most recently New Jersey, have outlawed company rules against smoking at home, without disturbing a smoke-free workplace or anyone's right to charge higher health insurance rates for extra health risks. Other states have moved to protect personal life style choices that don't affect job performance. 
 Now New York's Legislature has passed a bill prohibiting discrimination against workers for "legal activities" off the job. This time, however, the worker protection sweeps broadly across long-disputed labor-management terrain. Gov. Mario Cuomo, who vetoed a similar bill last year, is prudently calling for further fine-tuning.
As in other states, New York's life style battle is a blend of ideals and economics. Companies meddle in their workers' off-the-job activities chiefly because measures like incentives to lose weight or quit smoking tend to reduce costs. The American Civil Liberties Union proclaims the liberty of working Americans -- in agreement with organized labor and cigarette makers.
New York's Assembly and Senate have approved a bill giving workers and the State Attorney General the right to sue employers who refuse to hire or promote people because of engagement "in a legal activity during non-working hours." Supporters say this insulates workers from unreasonable discipline for things like overeating or riding motorcycles that might be motivated by concern for health -- or merely the boss's whim.
Business groups and the State Newspaper Publishers Association lobby against it. They argue that companies must retain leverage over some after-hours activities, like moonlighting for a competitor or marching in a demonstration against a company's product.
The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Frank Barbaro and Senator James Lack, has an exception to protect an employer's "legitimate conflict of interest policy" but only to the extent that those policies safeguard "trade secrets, proprietary information" or undefined "other proprietary interests." That's too narrow an exception for a broad and still novel right.
Proponents of these privacy measures are pressing the right questions. They don't contend that smoking is a civil right. They simply ask by what authority employers extend their supervision into the living room or kitchen. Employers, too, may argue their side.
Further clarification of the New York bill is in order before the Governor acts. Properly defined, life style laws can protect the legitimate interests of the worker and respect those of the boss.

HEADLINE: Can't Count on Numbers;
The Elaborate Effort to Adjust the Census By Using Statistics Adds Up to Ambiguity

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Most experts agree that the 1990 census failed to ferret out about four million to five million Americans, a disproportionate number of them probably black, Hispanic or Asian. Most also agree that the Census Bureau's statistical fix would better reflect the nation's total population.
But they are deeply divided on the critical question of whether the adjustment would provide more accurate -- and fairer -- counts for individual cities and Congressional districts. 
 Judging the case for adjustment to be "inconclusive and unconvincing," Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher declined on July 15 to "abandon a 200-year-old tradition of how we actually count people." But Mr. Mosbacher's words will certainly not be the last on an issue that mixes race and money with a dollop of partisan politics.
New York City is challenging his decision in Federal court, and parallel suits have been filed in Georgia and Illinois. But unfortunately, the experts on whom the plaintiffs and the Commerce Department will be calling for support will not be able to lean too heavily on science.
For while statisticians had high hopes for straightforward answers as to whether the adjustment would be an improvement, they have instead found disappointingly ambiguous results, because of the sheer complexity of the adjustment process. What began as an attempt to clear the air has further clouded it.

HEADLINE: Soichiro Honda, Auto Innovator, Is Dead at 84

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 5 S

 BODY:
Soichiro Honda, a rebellious auto mechanic who defied the Japanese Government and built one of the world's biggest and most innovative auto companies from the ruins of World War II, died today. He was 84 years old.
 Mr. Honda, who appeared to be in vigorous health until he was hospitalized recently, died of liver failure, a spokesman for Honda Motor Company said. 

 
Maverick Who Became Symbol
 The son of a blacksmith, Mr. Honda left a small Japanese village in 1922 to
seek his fortune in Japan's capital and ultimately became a symbol of Japan's remarkable postwar industrial rise. But he was hardly typical of his generation. A fiery maverick who spoke his mind, he was always something of an outsider in his own country, his success spawning as much jealousy in Toyota City as it did in Detroit.
 Following the strategy Mr. Honda laid out, Honda Motor was the first Japanese auto company to build factories in its main market, the United States. This year Honda is expected to become the third-largest producer of passenger cars in America, displacing Chrysler.
 
Conquering U.S. Market
 Indeed it was in America, not Japan, that the balding engineer with a broad smile and a razor-sharp temper found his greatest success. Taking on an American industry that seemed invincible, in the 1970's he won over a generation of young drivers who were drawn to the fuel efficiency and low emissions of his company's CVCC engines.
 It was a generation that Detroit's Big Three never really won back. Honda's
two biggest sellers, the Civic and the Accord, emerged as the basic family cars for millions of Americans, and in recent years the company has pushed into the luxury-car market. Toyota and Nissan, which once thought his American auto plant ideas were foolhardy, soon followed.
 The story about how Mr. Honda infuriated the bureaucrats of Japan's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry, who ordered him to keep making motorcycles because they had drawn up plans for Japan to have only a handful of auto makers, has become one of the most oft-repeated legends of the Japanese industry. He drew a lesson from it: Government officials, Mr. Honda said a few years ago, "tend to become an obstacle when you try to do something new."
 Indeed, Mr. Honda reveled in his David-vs.-Goliath approach to auto making, and in his later years he delighted in offering stinging critiques of corporate Japan and the way it controls the lives of its workers.
 Always the maverick, he bristled at the most frequently offered explanation of Japan's industrial success: that its population is able to sublimate individual needs to those of the group.
 "Each individual should work for himself -- that's important," he said in a rare interview several years ago. "People will not sacrifice themselves for the company. They come to work at the company to enjoy themselves."
 Whether that credo still applies today is an arguable point. Since he retired in 1973, saying that Honda should be run by young Japanese, not aging executives, Honda Motor has become a huge and far less personal company. Its headquarters tower in Tokyo is now a place of considerable corporate intrigue, though it is still a hotbed of innovation. Only last week the company announced a new, highly fuel-efficient engine, using an approach that Detroit's auto manufacturers have largely dismissed as unworkable.
Mr. Honda's interest in cars and racing was so intense that even in his last days he liked to wander Honda's research labs, inspecting the work of new engineers and seeking explanations for things he did not like.
 
Learning From Defeats
 "He hated to lose," Shoichiro Irimajiri, who ran Honda's American manufacturing operations through the 1980's and today is the head of the company's research and production, said in an interview today. "But he always
made us learn something from losing."
 Soichiro Honda was born in 1906 in a village just outside Hamamatsu, in Shizuoka Prefecture, a place known today largely for its giant Honda factory. His father, Gihei, was a blacksmith who fixed bicycles on the side, and Mr. Honda's recollections of his youth mostly centered on the family's poverty. Five of his eight brothers and sisters died in childhood.
 Even as a child Mr. Honda was fascinated with the sound and smell of motors, and he would often travel with his grandfather to see a rice-polishing mill, one of the few motor-driven devices in his remote town. He went to school for only 10 years, and at age 15 struck out for Tokyo, eager to become a mechanic. He quickly got a job at an auto shop, only to discover that his only responsibility was babysitting. But the next year a tremendous earthquake destroyed Tokyo and Mr. Honda got his break: he filled in for mechanics who left their jobs to rebuild their homes.
 Eventually he returned to Hamamatsu to open a branch of the auto shop and quickly became something of a delinquent. He spent much of his time in the company of geisha, and once when he was drunk he went off the side of a bridge
with several geisha riding in his car. Fortunately, everyone survived that incident.
 
Formal Education Scorned
 In the mid-1930's, Mr. Honda became a race-car driver. He almost died in a crash that left him with a permanent scar. Later in the '30's he married and settled down, but could not sit still for book learning at a technological high school. He never received a diploma, which he said was "worth less than a movie ticket."
 During World War II Mr. Honda's company, which he was then running, built engines for aircraft and for the Imperial Navy. After the war he sold it to the company that would become his nemesis, Toyota, and spent the year brewing his own alcohol.
 But soon he found opportunity in the wreckage of the war. Obtaining some military surplus engines, he attached them to bicycles and sold them to people who desperately needed transportation to farm areas to ward off starvation. From that emerged the motorcycle, and soon Honda's own engines.
Soon Mr. Honda's first popular model, the Dream, covered the Japanese
islands. Impatient with anything but engineering, he brought in Takeo Fujisawa, a businessman, who obtained the company's financing and became Mr. Honda's closest partner.
 
From Motorcycles to Cars
 His motorcycle business prospered: one of Honda's factories became the biggest in the world. But the engineer's mind was on a car. In 1957, he came up with one, called the N360, and fended off the bureaucrats who thought he should merge his company into other, stronger automakers. He refused.
 The car project created a generation of Honda disciples, many of whom are running the company today. Few have forgotten their awe and fear of Mr. Honda. In the mid-1960's, Mr. Irimajiri designed a new piston for a Grand Prix race car, "Theoretically it should have worked," Mr. Irimajiri said ruefully today. It burned out in mid-race.
 Mr. Honda ordered the engine reconstructed and soon found the culprit. "I hate college graduates," he told Mr. Irimajiri. "They only use their heads." Under questioning, Mr. Irimajiri conceded that he had not sought the advice of
the old mechanics with less book learning and more experience. On the founder's orders he then walked through the tooling shops, bowing and apologizing profusely. "I looked behind me," Mr. Irimajiri recalled today, "and he was following my every step."
 But Mr. Honda never used his reliance on experience to stifle innovation. The true test came with the CVCC.
 The engine used a startling new design, one that burned a leaner mix of gasoline and passed emissions tests -- the main barrier to the American market -- without using a catalytic converter. Until then Japanese makers had slavishly followed Detroit. But the new Honda Civics captured the low end of the market, and gave Honda, which has never been as popular with Japanese auto buyers as with Americans, the wedge it needed.
 
New Plant in U.S.
 Mr. Honda retired the next year, 1973, and watched from the sidelines as his successors built a sprawling factory in Ohio.
 To other Japanese automakers, it was a proposition that seemed to make little
economic sense at the time. But quickly such "transplants" became linchpin of Japan's trade strategy with the United States, a response to Detroit's efforts to limit the import of cars from Japan. It was successful beyond anything envisioned by the Big Three, or by the unions, which have not been successful at organizing workers at the plants.
 Honda is still enmeshed in the political debate over whether it is truly an "American" or "Japanese" auto company. Mr. Honda's vision of building a totally independent company in the United States, one that designs and makes and markets its cars without much oversight from Tokyo, has not yet been fulfilled. But the American-made Accord became the first "foreign" car to take the title as the best-selling model in the United States, and Honda has begun importing some of its American-made cars to Japan.
 Mr. Honda spent his retirement administering the Honda Foundation, a private group that promotes new uses of technology. He lectured regularly on management. "The worst kind of president is a person who eats in fancy restaurants, smoking a fat cigar and thinking well of himself while employees work in a dirty factory with their hands dirty,"' he said. "If you're like a god, people will respect you, but they won't come close."
 Two years ago he received a long overdue acknowledgement from his American competitors. He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame, taking a place next to Henry Ford, Alfred Sloan of General Motors and Karl Benz, the builder of the Mercedes-Benz. His last trip to the United States came earlier this year, when he visited Honda's new test track in Nevada and was driven in his company's first commercial sports car, the $70,000 NSX, in many ways the most advanced car Honda has ever built.
 "At the end of the day," Mr. Irimajiri said, "he looked around and said, 'I love it here.' And he wouldn't leave."
 Mr. Honda is survived by his wife, Sachi, two daughters and a son. Funeral services will be private, but Honda officials said the company would hold a memorial service at a later date.

HEADLINE: Booming Orlando Becomes a Magnet for Prosperity and the Ills It Conceals

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla.

 BODY:
It may be just an illusion, but there are times when this city, the adopted hometown of Mickey Mouse and Shamu the whale, seems to be enchanted. Take Orlando's Naval Training Center, a big base of 17,000 people that until the end of June was on a list to be closed. At the last minute, when things looked bleakest, a Federal panel stepped in and spared the base.
 Then, while other big airlines were going bankrupt, United Airlines announced it would nearly triple the number of its flights to Orlando's fast-growing international airport and perhaps build a $1 billion jet maintenance center there. 
Orlando, or the big, four-county area of Central Florida that many people think of as Orlando, is leading a charmed life. After Walt Disney World opened 20 years ago in Lake Buena Vista, about 18 miles south of downtown Orlando, other theme parks quickly followed: Sea World, Universal Studios and dozens of smaller attractions like the Elvis Presley Museum and Xanadu, Home of the Future.
 
Magnet for Corporations
 The parks draw hordes of tourists, 14 million last year alone. While Disney has made no secret of its intention to keep as many of them as possible on its own 28,000 acres, the spin-off business, what local merchants call the D.A.D. or day after Disney, spreads the good fortune over a wide area.
 Improvements at the airport designed to serve the tourists have also provided convenient connections for corporations, which are flocking here. A 4 percent county tax on hotel rooms generated so much money in the last decade that it paid for the construction of the 350,000-square-foot Orange County Convention/Civic Center, half of the Orlando Arena, and a portion of the renovation of the Citrus Bowl. Convention business, virtually non-existent in the early 1980's, is now nearly a $1-billion-a-year industry.
 True, not everyone shares in the prosperity. Underneath the glitter of the theme parks and the tidy streets of downtown is a medium-sized city with typical urban problems of homelessness, drug addiction and runaway traffic congestion, the latter a troublesome byproduct of growth.
 The Orlando area's population has soared to more than one million, and business keeps expanding in spite of the economic slowdown. There are 78,000 hotel and motel rooms here, including the new 891-room Peabody Hotel, where ducks waddle to a marble pool in the lobby every day, just as they do in the original Peabody in Memphis. The state Government is helping to build a rail line that will float on magnets. The city did not get a major league baseball team, but it does have a team in the National Basketball Association, the Orlando Magic.
 The aura of fantasy and unreality created by the theme parks shimmers like a rainbow over the area, Florida's only major inland city. And even though attendance at many parks is down because of the recession, this magic kingdom is still growing.
 Consider a proposal by a group of Soviet and Alaskan businessmen who want to build a theme restaurant and exhibition center called Perestroika Palace. And not far from Disney, the magician Doug Henning and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, former guru to the Beatles, plan to build a 450-acre theme park filled with magic illusions and wild rides called Maharishi Veda Land -- Veda being what Mr. Henning says is the Sanskrit word for knowledge.
 
A 'Heavenly Garden'
 "One of the themes of our park is man's harmony with nature," said Mr. Henning, who traveled around the world nine times before deciding to build the first Veda Land in Central Florida. "We feel that in Orlando we can build the most magical heavenly garden."
 But when familiar urban problems occur against a backdrop of fantasy (some traffic signs in Lake Buena Vista are adorned with mouse ears), they create striking images.
 Orlando carefully waters the grounds at its landmark Lake Eola park every night, which not only makes a good impression on tourists but keeps the homeless from sleeping there. Labor pools have sprung up over the city to recruit and place cheap day laborers, and in the busy season they take homeless people to work at Walt Disney World and the other parks.
 "There's a perception that Orlando isn't a real city, but it is," said Homero Leon Jr., a lawyer at Greater Orlando Area Legal Services.
 
Dashed Expectations
 Mervyn J. Cordner, an assistant at the legal services office, visits the city's homeless shelters daily, often coming back with tales of how image clashes with reality.
 Mr. Cordner recently saw a 28-year-old Hispanic woman from New Hampshire who had read about Orlando and decided to make a life there. She and her two children drove down and rented a mobile home on Orange Blossom Trail. It did not take long before she had exhausted her savings, been evicted from the mobile home and entered a shelter where she and her children were sleeping on mats on the floor.
 "People give up all their possessions and come here with expectations that are never met," Mr. Cordner said. "It makes them sick."
 Officials say they understand the clash between image and reality. "People do come here with expectations of streets of gold," said Bill Frederick, Mayor for the last 11 years.
 Orlando's 165,000 residents know precisely how the streets are paved and how the city runs. Orlando is expanding so fast that it has outgrown its 34-year-old City Hall and had to build a $33 million, copper-domed building three times as large right next door.
 Orlando itself continues to annex small bits of Orange County, but the bulk of the area's one million residents live in unincorporated areas of Orange, Osceola, Seminole and Lake counties.
 
Business and Pleasure
 This is a strange mix of vacation resort and contemporary office complex, a world where visitors far outnumber permanent residents and business often mixes with pleasure. The strip of Interstate 4 between Disney World and downtown Orlando has become a field of themes: billboards along the way advertise Sea World, Universal Studios, King Henry's Feast, Fun 'N Wheels and the Queen of the Universe Shrine.
 "All of us who were born and raised in Central Florida feel we've had just about enough of theme parks," Mayor Frederick said. While tourism is important to Orlando's economy, he went on, international commerce and convention businesses are growing, too. "Disney and the others tend to eclipse what we really are about," he said.
 But the prospect of pulling in even a fragment of the 14 million annual visitors who come to Orlando makes entrepreneurs of all types glow with anticipation. Disney, the largest and most energetic of the parks, continues to churn out ideas for its 28,000 acres, and occasionally that growth causes problems. Last year, Federal environmental officials ordered Disney to stop using a wetlands sewage treatment area that was producing too many nutrients.
 Right now, welding sparks fly late into the night on the Magic Kingdom's Splash Mountain, a log flume ride that is expected to draw large crowds when it opens next year.
 By the end of the decade, Disney also will open a fourth theme park, joining the Magic Kingdom, Epcot and the Disney-M-G-M Studios. Word in Orlando is that the attraction will feature animals, perhaps from the sea. Disney officials will not disclose their plans.
 
Work, School, Fun
 Disney is also getting ready to begin construction on a new town of 20,000 residents called Celebration that will pioneer ways of combining work, school and fun. But environmentalists have met with Disney officials to express their concerns about company plans to possibly build in areas it had promised to keep open.
 Universal Studios is also still hot here. In May, it opened a $40 million ride based on the film "Back to the Future" in which tourists ride a flight simulator inside a seven-story domed theater for a trip back to the Ice Age.
 The most unusual projects coming to Orlando are the Perestroika Palace and Veda Land. Perestroika Palace was first planned as part of Universal Studios, but the deal fell through, and now the developers, a consortium of Alaskan businessmen and entrepreneurs from the Soviet Union's Russian Republic, want to build the 30-acre attraction on their own. It is to have a restaurant, theater and meeting hall designed in the style of St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow.
 Veda Land, as planned, will give as many as 2.8 million visitors a year a transcendental experience of grand magic illusions in a setting as serene as an Infiniti automobile commercial. Situated on 450 acres of hardwood hammock and swamp near Walt Disney World, Veda Land will feature more than 30 major attractions, including a building that appears to levitate above water. The total cost of the park and a 500-room hotel is $1 billion.
 Mr. Henning has been a disciple of the Maharishi since 1976 and now lives in Vlodrop in the Netherlands, the world headquarters of the transcendental meditation movement. He said the park would not try to proselytize any aspect of religion or transcendental meditation.
 Mr. Henning said contracts should be signed in three months and Veda Land could open in 1993.
 
SOME VISIONS WERE ONLY MIRAGES
 With Gatorland, Flea World, the Elvis Presley Museum and Xanadu, Home of the Future, along with several religious mega-shrines and the better-known attractions of Walt Disney World, Sea World and Universal Studios, Orlando already has an excess of excess. But there has also been a long list of failed projects whose hope was exceeded by hype. These famous would-have-beens include:
 *Little England, a grandiose recreation of an ancient British village, meticulously recreated in the hardwood hammock of Kissimmee. Started in the early 1980's by Louis Cartier, a millionaire British grocer, the project went bust before it ever opened.
 *Hurricane World, described as a glorified wind tunnel that could transport tourists into the eye of a storm. Proposed but never started.
 *Bible World, a panoramic journey into Christendom. Never started.
 *Western Fun World, a Wild West theme. Project abandoned in the mid-1970's.
 *Winter Wonderlando, skiing in Central Florida. Great name. Lousy concept. Never started.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Federal Gold, Census Rainbow

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THE nation's governors and mayors are sure that some five million Americans slipped through the census net in 1990. And they know that about $60 billion in Federal aid -- $236 per person in 1989 -- is linked to population. That, in part, explains why New York City and dozens of other localities are demanding that the census be adjusted to compensate for the undercount.
It will not be easy to convince a Federal court to second-guess the Bush Administration's decision to stick with the initial count. But even if the cities prevail, suggests Michael Murray, an economist at Bates College in Maine, the plaintiffs will be disappointed: There simply is no pot of gold at the end of the legal rainbow. 
 More people ought to mean more money, he acknowledges in an analysis released by the Commerce Department. But since Congress does not have the cash to enrich the total aid pot, only the localities whose numbers were adjusted by more than the average stand to gain. And in any event, winning the census readjustment game is not all it has been cracked up to be because allocations are not proportional to population size. Mr. Murray estimates that, all told, just $2 out of every $1,000 in population-linked aid would change hands.
The failure of the census to locate 2 percent of the population, roughly a third of whom are minorities living in cities, is widely acknowledged. And under legal pressure from states and cities, the Bush Administration agreed in 1989 to finance an elaborate post-census survey of 165,000 households that could be used to adjust the 1990 count.
Barbara Bryant, the director of the Census Bureau, thinks the statistically based adjustment is closer to the truth than the census itself, and recommended that it be used. But on the advice of his own staff Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher balked, setting the stage for what could be a protracted court battle in which both sides rely heavily on technical arguments.
The size of four Congressional delegations is at stake: Arizona and California would take seats from Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But for most states, cities and counties, the Federal case is mostly about money. And here, Mr. Murray thinks there is less to the debate than meets the eye.
The adjustments would, indeed, increase the estimated population of every state, as well as every city over 200,000. But with the exception of Medicaid, the flow of cash from Washington would not increase automatically. The only localities likely to benefit would be ones with census adjustments exceeding the 2.1 percent average.
The big potential winners would be Western states (in particular, Arizona, California, New Mexico), Sun Belt cities (including Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, Memphis, Miami, San Diego) and the District of Columbia. New York City's population gain (3 percent) is medium potatoes. And there would be some surprising losers: New York State (1.7 percent), New Jersey (1.4), Illinois (1.4), Cleveland (1.4), Philadelphia (1.3).
Winning, moreover, might not mean much, for much of the Federal cash is apportioned by formulas as Byzantine as the political bargains that hatched them. In one highway aid program, for example, money is divided according to a weighted average of a state's surface area, its urban, suburban and rural populations, and the mileage of its rural mail routes.
States may, however, opt for a different formula -- one that counts just urban and rural population. And once each state has chosen the formula that gives it the biggest slice, each share is rescaled to add up to 100 percent. Is that all clear?
Mr. Murray estimates that a total of $83 per undercounted person in winning communities would shift pockets if the census were adjusted. But some changes would offset others. On average, communities benefiting from the adjustment would gain just $56 for each miscounted individual. By this reckoning, New York City might expect to pick up some $10 million annually -- a nice piece of change, surely, but hardly enough to dent the city's budget for filling potholes.
For Robert Rifkind, an attorney at Cravath, Swaine & Moore who represents cities and states seeking adjustment, that is not quite the end of the money story. The biggest stakes in census adjustment, he argues, are within states. Higher population figures would mean more state aid to urban localities -- and in sums far exceeding the reshuffle of Federal grants.
Perhaps more important, adjustment would tilt the balance of political power toward urban legislators and toward the concerns of blacks and the Hispanic population, whose rate of undercount is three times as high as non-blacks. And "money," said Mr. Rifkind, "tends to follow power."

HEADLINE: Home Resales Up in Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON. Aug. 6

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes posted double-digit gains in 20 states in the second quarter as the housing industry emerged from the recession, a real estate trade group said today.
But as demand rose, so did prices, which advanced in nearly 80 percent of the 119 cities in the National Association of Realtors' survey. Prices had dropped in 40 percent of the cities in the first quarter. 
 Over all, the realtors said, 34 states and the District of Columbia recorded sales gains, raising the national rate by 3.5 percent over April-June 1990, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.82 million units. The sales rate was also 12.1 percent above that of the first quarter.
The survey, which covered sales of single-family detached homes, town houses, condominiums and cooperatives, showed that sales in the Northeast shot up 6.3 percent, to an annual rate of 680,000 units. Still, only four of the nine states in the region recorded gains, led by a 11.6 percent jump in New Jersey.
All 16 Southern states recorded sales increases, including 13 with jumps of more than 10 percent, the realtors said.
Delaware, in the realtors' southern region, had a 30.2 percent sales rise; Louisiana, 29.1 percent; Mississippi, 26.4 percent; Alabama, 24.7 percent, and Tennessee, 19.2.
Hawaii was at the bottom of the list with a 43.7 percent drop. Next was Oregon, where sales were down 16.4 percent; Washington, down 10.2 percent; Pennsylvania, 9.4 percent, and Nebraska, 7.8 percent.
The national median price of a used home rose 4.7 percent from the second quarter of 1990, to $101,100, according to the realtors' survey. The median price means half of the homes sold for more and half for less.

HEADLINE: U.S. Posts Rise In Productivity

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The productivity of American workers rose at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the spring, the biggest advance in almost three years, the Government reported today.
The Commerce Department said the strong advance in productivity from April through June followed dismal showings in the two previous quarters when the country was mired in recession. Productivity, defined as output per hours worked, fell at a rate of eight- tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter and showed no improvement in the first quarter. 
 Analysts said the improvement in the April-June quarter was an indication of a rebounding economy. The Government had earlier reported that the nation's total output of goods and services, or the gross national product, rose at an annual rate of four-tenths of 1 percent in the April-June quarter after falling in the two previous quarters.
The 1.9 percent rise in productivity in the spring stemmed from a 1.3 percent increase in non-farm output and a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent in the number of hours worked. The 1.9 percent increase was the biggest jump since a 2.7 percent rise in the third quarter of 1988.
For 1990, productivity fell by six-tenths of 1 percent, the Labor Department said today, revising an earlier estimate that put the drop at an even larger nine-tenths of 1 percent.

World's No. 1 Guessing Game Is Coming This Fall

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Floating around the United Nations Secretariat is an agenda for the 46th General Assembly, which begins here on Sept. 17. A modest document by United Nations standards, it manages nevertheless to include some 30 pages of listings, day by day and hour by hour, of ceremonies, meetings and consultations meant to involve every member nation by the time the Assembly ends in mid-December.
But nowhere in it is there any mention of what will be the most popular topic of the session: the selection of a new Secretary General. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the 71-year-old incumbent, will complete his second five-year term on Dec. 31., and he has indicated he has no desire for another term. 
 United Nations officials hope to have the next Secretary General elected by the end of the session so he or she can have a staff in place by Jan. 1.
The selection of a successor to Mr. Perez de Cuellar, a Peruvian, has taken on particular significance in light of recent world events. The easing of worldwide tensions and the new spirit of cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union could mean a new, more powerful role in international affairs for the world organization, diplomats here say.
 
The 2 Front-Runners
 Recent events have prompted even critics of the United Nations to see it in a new light. One of them, the Heritage Foundation, said in a recent report, "The U.N.'s international prominence is the highest it has been in years."
The permanent members of the Security Council, who control the final selection of candidates for Secretary General, are said to be looking for a more charismatic leader to take the helm of a reinvigorated United Nations.
The summit meeting of the industrial powers in London last month called for a tougher, activist United Nations, ready to intervene in world trouble spots. The Bush Administration has taken no position so far on the United Nations post, but is known to see it as a key factor in what President Bush calls the new world order.
The two prime candidates at the moment, diplomats say, are Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, who served as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for 12 years and more recently was the Secretary General's personal representative for humanitarian relief in Iraq, and Boutros Ghali, Egypt's Deputy Prime Minister for foreign relations, who was closely associated with the Camp David peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
Prince Sadruddin was born in Paris in 1933, lives in Geneva and carries an Iranian passport. He is a Harvard graduate who has spent his entire professional life in international affairs. He received more votes than Mr. Perez de Cuellar in the 1981 election for Secretary General, but was vetoed by the Soviet Union, presumably because he was favored by the United States and was known for his commitment to free-market economies.
Mr. Ghali, who was Egypt's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs from 1977 until earlier this year, is President Hosni Mubarak's candidate and appears to have support from a number of European countries.
A professor of international law at Cairo University, Mr. Ghali was brought into political life by Anwar el-Sadat, Egypt's President until his assassination in 1981. Mr. Mubarak has reportedly asked President Bush to support Mr. Ghali. Prince Bandar, Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to Washington, is said to have called Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to express his Government's support for the Ghali nomination.
Both Prince Sadruddin and Mr. Ghali have been campaigning for the job; the Prince discreetly, Mr. Ghali openly. Old United Nations hands say Prince Sadruddin has been campaigning for the post for 20 years. Aside from his vast experience in international and specifically United Nations affairs, one of his chief assets is a close relationship with President Bush. The Bushes have stayed at Prince Sadruddin's home in Geneva and at his horse farm in Middleburg, Va.
 
4 From Black Africa
 Prince Sadruddin's Western leanings are said to antagonize conservative Muslim leaders. His closeness to the United States is expected to hurt his chances in parts of the world where anti-Americanism persists.
Mr. Ghali's chances could be hampered by age -- he is 69 -- and by the fact that he is not from sub-Saharan Africa. There has never been a Secretary General from sub-Saharan Africa, and nations there assert that it is their turn.
Among the African candidates are Bernard T. G. Chidzero of Zimbabwe, Kenneth Dadzie of Ghana, Lieut. Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and Olara Otunnu of Uganda.
Mr. Chidzero, an economist, is Finance Minister of Zimbabwe and spent years as a United Nations civil servant. Mr. Dadzie is secretary general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and has held posts in Ghana's foreign service and at the United Nations.
General Obasanjo took power in Nigeria in a 1975 coup, then stepped down after democratic elections were held in 1979. Mr. Otunnu studied at Oxford and Harvard and once had his own law practice in New York City. He served as Uganda's representative at the United Nations in the Government that overthrew Idi Amin.
 
3 Europeans
 The only woman currently considered a serious candidate is Gro Harlem Brundtland, now Prime Minister of Norway for the third time, and head of the Norwegian Labor Party for the past decade.
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister, and Margaret Thatcher, the former Prime Minister of Britain, have also been advanced as candidates, but, diplomats say, mostly by the press.
The next Secretary General will be expected to have managerial skills to match the diplomatic prowess that is required. The United Nations has long been considered to be a bloated, inefficient bureaucracy.
Leading member nations, led by the United States, have made it clear that the new Secretary General will be expected to clean house and reorganize the United Nations into a leaner, more responsive organization.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines After Fed Acts to Trim Interest Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed lower yesterday as the Federal Reserve took steps to push interest rates downward.
The Fed added reserves to the nation's banking system, a move that makes it cheaper for banks to borrow money. The step was seen as a signal by the central bank that it wanted lower interest rates to stop the economy from slipping back into recession. 
 Analysts said the Fed had reduced its target for the Federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans to 5.5 percent from 5.75 percent. When the funds rate declines, other interest rates often follow.
Since the dollar is supported by higher rates, news that the Fed had relaxed its stance hurt the currency.
"As long as the economy flutters and the Fed needs to ease monetary policy, the dollar will suffer in the short run," said Ronald H. Holzer, chief foreign exchange dealer with Harris Trust and Company in Chicago.
Analysts said the Fed was forced to move to reduce interest rates after a surprisingly weak unemployment report last week and other data that have cast doubt on the economic recovery.
The British pound gained against the dollar. Sterling rose to $1.7145 in New York, from $1.7110 late Monday, and to $1.7125 in London, from $1.7095.
The dollar also weakened against the Japanese yen amid reports that the Finance Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, under pressure to resign over Japan's stock scandal, has decided to step down.
In the stock scandal, Japan's leading brokerages compensated well-heeled clients approximately $1.3 billion for losses, angering small investors. The scandal involves 17 brokerages.
John McCarthy, chief dealer with Algemene Bank Nederland, said the reports pushed the yen higher against the dollar and the German mark.
The dollar fell sharply to 135.50 yen in New York, from 136.65 late Monday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell 0.62 yen, to 136.68, and in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 135.60 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.7085 German marks, down from 1.71675; 1.4930 Swiss francs, down from 1.4960; 5.8125 French francs, down from 5.8410; 1,279.00 Italian lire, down from 1,283.675, and 1.14825 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14945.
Gold edged higher in New York, picking up 50 cents and closing at $356.70 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $357.20, up 85 cents.

HEADLINE: Bank Funds And C.D.'s Fall in Week

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on short-term securities, both money market funds and certificates of deposit, moved down significantly during the last week, continuing their recent downtrend.
Rates will probably drop ven lower, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest-rate publication based in North Palm Beach, Fla. 
 "Banks came to the realization this week that there is no quick fix for the economy," Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday. "This thinking is dragging savings yields downward even faster than in recent weeks. The numbers are bound to get lower, especially on short-term certificates of deposits."
Sharply lower yields on three-month Treasury bills had an important impact, closing at 5.42 percent yesterday, compared with 5.51 percent Monday.
Among the major banks in the New York area, the largest change in the return on money-market accounts was reported by Citibank, down 25 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Also, both Citibank and the Bank of Tokyo in New York reduced their yields on three- and six-month certificates of deposit by 20 basis points, a sharp reduction.
The average six-month certificate of deposit among major New York area banks was down 6 basis points, to 5.53 percent, while the average on three-month certificates was down 7 basis points, to 5.34 percent. Money market accounts at these banks dropped 5 basis points, to 5.07 percent, on average.
The decline at savings institutions was 2 basis points in all three categories, taking the money market accounts on average down to 5.52 percent, three-month certificates to 5.70 percent, and six-month certificates to 5.98 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Aug.7,1991. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: Marketing Deal by Vitro And Corning

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
In an indication of the quickening pace of economic integration between the United States and Mexico, Corning Inc. and Vitro S.A., Mexico's giant glass manufacturer, agreed yesterday to market their housewares together around the world.
Pending final negotiations and approvals by the directors and the governments, the partnership would create jointly owned companies in each country with combined annual sales of more than $800 million. 
 The transaction was valued at nearly $300 million, including a cash payment by Vitro to Corning of more than $130 million.
Officials of the two companies insisted that the prospect of a North American Free Trade Agreement had been only one of several incentives. But it appeared to have been an important one.
For Vitro -- which seized more than a quarter of the United States glass container market with its acquisition of the Anchor Glass Container Corporation in 1989 for about $900 million, including $460 million in debt -- the alliance is a powerful shield against the new competition that free trade is expected to unleash in Mexico's glass and housewares industries.
The joint venture follows a familiar pattern at Corning, which has moved into areas like optical fibers and television glass through deals with conglomerates from Germany to Japan. But by its timing, analysts said Corning's accord with Vitro could hardly be more propitious.
After years of failed efforts by the company to force products like its Corning Ware and Pyrex through protectionist barriers along the Rio Grande, Corning gets with this deal a strong foothold in Mexico when consumer buying power is on the rise and tariffs are on the wane.
Perhaps most important, analysts say, the two companies will merge product lines that have been struggling to grow in recent years but appear quite complementary. To the Corning Ware and Visions cookware, Pyrex bakeware, Revere Ware and Corelle dinnerware of its American partner, Vitro will add its Crisa glassware and stemware, Termocrisa and Fortecrisa dinnerware and Cien and Kristaluxus crystal ware.
"The consumer-products division has unquestionably been Corning's sore spot over the last couple of years," said Jonathan Goldfarb, who follows the conglomerate for Merrill Lynch Research. "There is a reasonable chance that with this combination, the new company is going to make strategic sense."
Corning stock rose $1.50 yesterday, to $65.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Officials of the two companies said their distribution networks for housewares would probably be only the first thing they would share.
Down the road, a Vitro official suggested, the two companies might get together to sell products like Corning's fiber optics technologies to Mexicans, who are abused by what they are certain is some of the worst telephone service in the world. A Corning official, on the other hand, said he thought the fiber-optics division would be able to market its products in Mexico without any help.
Amid the increasing number of Mexican-American joint ventures that have taken place since Mexico began knocking down trade and investment barriers in 1988, the letter of agreement signed yesterday formalizes at least one of the largest. But more than its scale, the accord is distinguished by its balance.
The deal differs from the one last month that joined the two countries' biggest retailers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Cifra, S.A., in a plan to open warehouse-style stores in Mexico.
"What distinguishes this joint venture from the others is that it goes both ways and encompasses true globalization," Julio Escamez, the president of Vitro-Crisa, the group's glassware division, said from the company headquarters in Monterrey, Mexico. "We both needed to broaden our product lines."
Corning's chairman, James R. Houghton, said in a telephone interview that he expected the deal to be completed by the end of the year. He and Richard Dulude, Corning's vice chairman for consumer products, recalled that the company had sought a way into Mexico for years. Until two years ago, they were daunted by Mexican tariffs on housewares of 100 percent. But the continued drop of tariffs now at 20 percent is just part of the attraction, Mr. Dulude said.
"Whether the Mexican market opens or not, the standard of living is going to increase and the consumer housewares business is going to increase as well," he said. "Someone is going to take advantage of that."

HEADLINE: FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;
Yields Cut as Demand Rises For New York City Bonds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Strong demand yesterday for a $749.5 million issue of New York City bonds led securities dealers to reduce bond yields by about a tenth of a percentage point from the levels proposed earlier in the week.
Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch late yesterday set yields for $705.9 million of tax-exempt bonds ranging from 6.40 percent for bonds due in 1993 to 7.70 percent in 1998, 7.80 percent in 2002 and 8.10 percent in 2012 through 2021. 
 The financing also included $43.6 million of taxable bonds, whose interest payments are subject to Federal income tax but exempt from state and city income tax. Yields were set at 9.78 percent for bonds due in 1996 and 109.90 percent in 2010 and 2011.
Non-interest-bearing zero-coupon bonds were offered with a top yield of 7.80 percent for tax-exempt bonds due in 2001 and 10.36 percent for taxable bonds due in the same year.
An official at Merrill Lynch, said the bond sale had benefited from an intensive effort by city officials to make telephone calls and personal visits with major investors at insurance companies and mutual funds.
"There was much more broad-based institutional business than earlier sales," he said. Yesterday's move by the Federal Reserve to reduce short-term interest rates "didn't hurt," he added, although it was clear even before the Fed's move that the interest rates on the city bonds would be reduced.
Analysts noted that in the last few months a very light supply of new bond issues from local governments and authorities in New York State, plus the city's progress in creating a plan for a balanced budget, had allowed interest rates on New York City bonds to decline sharply from March.
The 8.10 percent yield for long-term city bonds offered yesterday was well below the 8.60 percent yield at which similar bonds traded in the late winter. During the same period, other bond yields have declined by about three-tenths of a percentage point.
The next city bond sale is a $950 million financing planned for October, with proceeds to be used for defeasing outstanding bonds that are backed by insurance companies or commercial bank letters of credit. By defeasing those bonds, a process where payment of interest and principal will come from a pool of Treasury securities rather than from the city, the city will be able to issue more bonds in the future backed by insurance companies or bank letters of credit. Those institutions are unwilling to provide backing for more city bonds at present because it would result in too great a concentration of risk to one borrower.
By December, the city plans to take advantage of the renewed willingness of bond insurance firms and banks to back its debt by issuing variable-rate bonds. Those bonds, on which interest rates could be adjusted as often as daily, generally require backing by banks, but can be sold with interest rates as low as 2 percent or 3 percent, according to Michael W. Geffrard, deputy executive director in the city's Office of Economic Development.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Zeroing In on Oil Far Below the Sea

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
Three discoveries this spring of large oil and gas deposits miles beneath the surface of the Gulf of Mexico marked a triumph for one of the newest advances in exploration technology: the precise, three-dimensional mapping of rock layers under the ocean floor.
The latest exploration techniques, combined with new methods of drilling in deep water, promise to substantially expand the nation's oil resources and lower production costs. The Gulf of Mexico discoveries buttressed 1989 estimates by the United States Geological Survey and the Minerals Management Service that the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico could eventually yield nearly as much oil as the estimated 10 billion barrels of Prudhoe Bay in Alaska. 
 The technique, known as seismic analysis, was once a clumsy art of bouncing sound waves off rock layers miles below the earth's crust, then recording the speed of the echoes' return to the surface. Now, elaborate electronic measuring devices and high-speed supercomputers are able to render three-dimensional maps and pictures of geological formations 8,000 feet below a sea floor, itself under more than a mile of water.
During the last five years, seismic analysis has been transformed into a booming multibillion-dollar business. The move into deep-water regions, including the Mississippi Canyon area southeast of New Orleans, the site of the three new fields, was hastened in the late 1980's by advances that have lowered exploration and development costs and improved drillers' chances for direct hits.
Drilling platforms tethered to the seabed by steel cables have the potential to extend drilling and production to depths of 7,000 feet of water before the end of the decade. Most platforms are now supported by towers, some taller than Chicago's 1,454-foot Sears Tower, that allow drilling in water no deeper than 1,350 feet.
The new discoveries in the gulf were in water as deep as 4,300 feet, in the case of an Exxon find. The current depth record for oil production is held by a Conoco platform in 1,750 feet of water that began producing oil and gas in 1989.
The placing of wells drilled from these tethered platforms has been sharply improved by clearer mapping of geological formations, thanks to three-dimensional seismic measurements, which are more precise over water than on land. Supercomputers now process huge amounts of seismic data at faster speeds and lower costs than ever before.
"Three-D seismic is not a magic bullet, but it is playing a major role in the deep-water gulf," said Paul R. Leibman, oil analyst at Petrie Parkman & Company, an investment banking firm in Denver. "The industry is simply dealing with much better data."
The biggest of the oil and gas discoveries, by a partnership of Shell Oil and B. P. Exploration in 3,100 feet of water 130 miles southeast of New Orleans, has some industry experts estimating that it could prove to be the gulf's largest ever, the equivalent of more than 700 million barrels of oil.
Shell Oil was cautious, describing the find as "potentially significant." But the company added that the discovery might be larger than another site found in 1989 that is likely to yield more than 220 million barrels of oil. Soon after Shell's announcement this spring, Exxon and a Conoco-Oryx Energy partnership told of their own discoveries.
 
Making a Gamble Safer
 A deep-water drilling effort can cost as much as the $1.3 billion, more than half for the platform, that Shell has budgeted to develop its 1989 find. The Shell platform is scheduled to produce oil at a new record depth of 2,860 feet of water beginning in 1993.
The new seismic exploration technique has increased the willingness of oil companies to make such huge wagers. "This has had a powerful effect on oil-drilling economics," said Suzanne L. Cook, an oilfield services analyst at Merrill Lynch. "You can explore with seismic and save the costs of drilling in the wrong spot."
Scoring a hit with one of every six wells drilled with the aid of 3-D seismic studies now is considered a good average, compared with one of every ten wells in 1980, when this technique was rarely used, she said. Each deep-water platform can drill as many as 20 wells. With the promise of a quicker payoff, oil companies have decided it makes sense to raise their capital spending on the new exploration techniques despite the unpredictability of oil prices.
Mrs. Cook estimated that demand for seismic services, to record and analyze data from around the globe, will more than double, to $6.3 billion, in 1995, from $2.6 billion this year.
 
Helping an Aging Field
 Most of the work is focused on aging oilfields. Production in an aging and once-prolific field off the coast of Louisiana, Bay Marchand, more than doubled last year after Chevron obtained 3-D seismic data of the area from Western Atlas International. Bay Marchand has been the most productive field in the gulf, with more than 500 million barrels of oil pumped since the 1940's.
As oil executives gain more confidence in 3-D seismic mapping, more companies have begun using the technique to explore for huge new fields. Many companies have to rely more on outside help since they slashed their own research staffs when oil prices plunged in 1986. They are now, in effect, leasing the latest in computer-related analytical tools and expertise from a handful of oilfield service companies.
These companies, Western Atlas, Schlumberger, Halliburton and Landmark Graphics among others, have poured millions into developing new products and services in a bruising but so far profitable battle.
 
Four New Ships
 Western Atlas, the leader in acquiring seismic data, is gambling $130 million on four new ships that it expects to lease to oil prospectors at monthly rates as high as $2 million. The company now operates 30 ships around the world that are equipped to scan rock layers eight miles below the sea floor.
"We're at the stage where it takes big investments to get big multiples" in new business, said Neal P. Cramer, president of Western Geophysical, the seismic services unit of Western Atlas. Its capital budget for the 1992 fiscal year, which begins Thursday, is up 70 percent, to $204 million.
The dominance of Western Atlas, based in Houston, in collecting seismic data on land and sea has made it the fastest-growing unit of Litton Industries. Sales are expected to reach $1.1 billion for the fiscal year that ended July 31, up from $750 million in 1988. Litton has owned 70 percent of Western Atlas since the company was formed in a 1987 merger. Dresser Industries owns 30 percent.
Western Atlas is betting that more oil companies will buy 3-D seismic maps of regions in the gulf where those companies are considering bids for offshore leases from the Government.
Landmark Graphics, the leading supplier of computer software for transforming seismic surveys into three-dimensional color images, posted $89.9 million in revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, up from $68.7 million in the 1990 fiscal year.
Oil experts have long seen promise in unexplored rock formations lying beneath at least 3,000 feet of water, and more than 100 miles south of the coast stretching from Louisiana to Florida.
The sloping, undersea terrain holds the sort of thick sand layers that often contain oil. Yet these reserves had been difficult to find with older seismic studies that portrayed the seabed in one two-dimensional slice at a time. The sands are below wide salt layers that distort the sound-reflection measurements at the heart of seismic pictures.
New methods that generate far more data yield a clearer view of oil deposits below the salt layers.
A ship trolling at about 4 miles an hour fires dozens of submerged air guns in a timed sequence. The reflections of each signal change speed each time they pass through a different rock layer beneath the seabed; the more dense the material, the slower the echo.
In the most advanced Western Geophysical system, these sound reflections, or echoes, are captured thousands of times a second by 7,700 very sensitive fiber-optic recorders positioned behind the ship in each of two three-mile-long cables that flank the air guns.
The staggering numbers of measurements contribute to sharper readings of rock layers just as a CAT scanner helps physicians see into a patient's body. Computers on the ship record the signals on magnetic tape that is later processed by supercomputers at Western Geophysical's data center in Houston.
The seismic portrait is then analyzed by the oil companies, who compare it with information stored over the years from rock samples taken from wells drilled in the region.

Diagram: "A New Way of Exploring for Oil"
 Seismic technology now makes it easier to find oil reserves by mapping rock formations under the seabed.
 In the most advanced system, signals from eight rows of seven air guns are bounced off the rock formations and collected in thousands of receivers, known as hydrophones, attached to three-mile-long cables running on each side of the air guns.
 The data are gathered by a computer that creates a detailed map of the geology under the seabed. (Source: Western Atlas International) (pg. D7)

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Article Raises New Concern About Family Media's Fate

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
FAMILY MEDIA, the New York publisher whose magazines include Health and Discover, has been in precarious financial condition for well over a year. And now its fate has been clouded further by the publication of an article in Advertising Age that portrays the company as urgently trying to sell its titles to other publishers and nearing bankruptcy.
The article, on the trade weekly's front page this week, has once again stirred concerns within the advertising and media communities. In January, speculation about the survival of the company, which has about 200 employees, grew when it closed one magazine, Savvy Woman, and put its six others up for sale. But when no sales were forthcoming, the speculation died down -- until now. 
 "They seemed to be slogging along," Roberta Garfinkle, vice president and director of print media at McCann-Erickson, New York, said in an interview yesterday. "Then it all started up again with a vengeance."
"This really adds fuel to the fire," Ms. Garfinkle said of the article. "I don't see how they can survive this."
What becomes of Family Media is of intense interest to advertising and media executives. If it goes out of business, it will underscore the severity of the magazine ad slump, now in its second year and threatening to become the worst in decades.
"It really addresses what has gone on during the recession," said Bob Zach, senior vice president and media director of Chiat/Day/Mojo, New York. If leading magazines are doing so badly, he added, "what happens to the tertiary titles that a Family Media represents is that they dry up and go out of business."
Repeated requests over the last two days to talk to Robert E. Riordan, Family Media's chairman, or Bruce Barnet, its president, were answered yesterday by Leslie Jay, a company spokeswoman. She said that Mr. Riordan would not be available until today.
Family Media employees, who asked not to be identified, said the company had scheduled staff meetings for this morning at its offices in Manhattan. Some employees said their colleagues were packing their belongings. Others said they had been told not to continue work on coming issues.
Family Media's titles, in addition to Health and Discover, are Golf Illustrated, Homeowner, 1,001 Home Ideas and World Tennis, which is being renamed Tennis Illustrated. They generally face fierce competition from magazines published by larger, better-financed companies.
"If they had books that were strong books, primary books in their categories, perhaps the company, if scaled back, could survive," Ms. Garfinkle said.
The Advertising Age article paints a portrait of a publisher forced to offer its magazines for sale, in a market in which media properties are selling for far less than they did five years ago, to meet a debt load estimated at $60 million to $70 million.
Executives at Veronis, Suhler & Associates, the investment banking firm that Advertising Age named as having been retained by Family Media, did not return telephone calls made over the last two days.
During the 80's, Mr. Riordan, a longtime magazine industry executive who specialized in circulation, was lionized as a "Mr. Fix-It" of magazines. He bought troubled titles -- like Discover, which he purchased from Time Inc. -- improved their circulation and financial operations, then sold them or used the profits they generated to acquire more properties (as well as a yacht he rechristened after Savvy, the women's business magazine he later closed).
Mr. Riordan's greatest success came with The Ladies' Home Journal, which he purchased in 1982 from Charter for an estimated $8 million and sold to Meredith four years later for $92 million.
Industry executives trace the start of Family Media's problems to 1988, when the company spent lavishly to introduce two women's fashion titles, Taxi and Model. They were closed two years later after losing millions of dollars. And by that time, the ad recession was in full force.

HEADLINE: To Counter Tax Cynics, Florio's Party Tries Ads

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Amid indications that their $750 million property-tax rebate program is not winning as many friends as they had hoped going into the fall elections, New Jersey Democrats announced today a statewide radio advertising campaign to promote the program.
Some 2.2 million homestead rebate checks began going out last week, and while most recipients welcome the money -- up to $500 -- many are complaining that it does little to counter the record $2.8 billion tax increase that Gov. Jim Florio pushed through the Legislature last year. 
Nick Theodorakis, who remembers when his was the only hot-dog cart on the Morristown green and can now count four, was one of those unimpressed with his rebate check.
 
'No Business and No Money'
 He said that the $430 rebate he received was "better than nothing" but that it would not let him keep his home in Morristown. His property taxes are now $5,000, he said, and he plans to sell the house and become a renter.
"New Jersey is very expensive," he said. "There's no business and no money, and a lot of people are losing their homes and moving."
Ralph Antorello of Carteret, a safety officer with a utility company, put it this way in Union when asked about the Governor's rebates: "I think the rebate program stinks, and I think he stinks."
"I'm paying far more than I used to in taxes and getting back $191," he said. "If he thinks he's buying my vote with the rebate, then that's just ridiculous. I wouldn't vote for Florio if he was running against Mikhail Gorbachev."
To counter such sentiments, Democrats announced a radio advertising campaign featuring a Maplewood woman -- a Democratic committeewoman, they acknowledged -- expressing her pleasure over a $500 rebate, which she says will help with a grandchild on the way.
 
Legislative Control at Stake
 The Democratic advertising campaign comes on the heels of a Republican direct-mail and radio advertising effort begun last week to attack the rebates, the keystone of Democratic efforts to retain control of the Legislature next November.
Although there are no polling data yet to gauge the impact, random interviews with people on the street suggest that the rebates have done little to assuage voter anger over increases in both the state sales and income taxes.
Michelle Sellin, manager of a Bachrach Photographers studio in Morristown, said that she and her husband had just received a $100 rebate check and that "it didn't do anything."
"We're paying a lot more, especially for schools, than we got back," she said.
Ann Connor of Morris, a shopper, said that while she believed Mr. Florio was "trying to do the right thing" with the rebates, "it doesn't amount to a hill of beans."
Hoping to capitalize on such sentiments, New Jersey Republicans, in their radio and mail campaign, labeled the rebate checks "another Florio ripoff."
Brochures featuring a likeness of the Governor and the caption "In Florio We Trust?" on the envelope were mailed to 300,000 taxpayers across the state, timed to arrive just before the first rebate checks. Radio commercials accused the Governor of "making a very big deal over a very small rebate."
The property-tax rebate checks to some two million homeowners and renters in the state will total about $750 million, but Democrats say other tax relief will flow from the state's assumption of county welfare costs, new aid to public schools and ceilings on local spending.
Mr. Florio has repeatedly maintained that once the benefits of the $2.8 billion tax increase begin to be known, his popularity will rebound.
All 80 seats in the Assembly and all 40 in the Senate are at stake in November, and the record tax increase is the major issue. Democrats are banking heavily on the rebates to protect their majority in both houses.
The Governor personally delivered the first rebate checks to four New Jersey families last week, and on Saturday he took an hour of prime time on WWOR-TV in Secaucus to promote his new budget and the tax rebates.
The address was largely ignored, however. The station reported that only about 70,000 households, 1 percent of the potential market, tuned in. That was fewer even than the 112,000 who watched Prince Charles of Britain discuss architecture on a rival station.
Indeed, there were some citizens who knew nothing of the rebates, but were well aware of economic problems.
 
Squeezed by High Costs
 Teddy Koniarelis, behind the counter at the Hamburger Depot in Morristown, said he was unaware of the program but was highly aware of being squeezed by the cost of health and car insurance, despite a widely publicized program by Governor Florio to cut the auto insurance rate.
"I've got to have a car to get to work, so I paid my auto insurance," he said, "but I can't pay both, so I had to drop my health insurance. I couldn't do anything else. Everything is just too expensive."
With voter discontent high and the Republicans doing all they can to capitalize on it, Steve DeMicco, executive director of the Democratic State Committee, today played for reporters a new radio commercial in which a woman identified only as "Mrs. Romano of Maplewood" attacks Republicans for "sending out political junk mail making fun" of the rebates.
"I'm sick of politics," she says in the commercial praising the rebate program.
Pressed by reporters about Mrs. Romano's own political views, Mr. DeMicco conceded that she was a Democratic committeewoman.

HEADLINE: Heeding the Painful Signal of Insufficient Credit

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The last time Alan Greenspan spoke publicly about the economy, in mid-July, the Federal Reserve Board chairman optimistically reported that the recession appeared to be over, with a "solid economic recovery" on the horizon. The central bank's move yesterday to lower short- term interest rates suggests that some of the optimism has faded.
"The Fed took out an insurance policy that the recovery will continue," said Robert Barbera, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Hutton, expressing a sentiment that some Fed officials seem to share. 
 The bit of news that finally prompted the Fed's policy makers to push down interest rates for the first time since April 30 came on Friday, when the Labor Department reported that jobs continued to disappear in July. Until last week, the Fed had been sticking to a wait-and-see policy, not wanting to lower rates another notch for fear that this might result in too strong a recovery and a rise in the inflation rate.
But in the wake of Friday's weaker-than-expected job report, a weekend of telephone consultation produced what appears to have been a consensus among the Fed's policy makers to reduce the Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for loans. The rate went to 5 1/2 percent yesterday from 5 3/4 percent.
 
Two Other Factors
 The ingredients for this decision, however, went beyond the poor employment numbers -- 51,000 jobs lost in July, mostly from layoffs -- and the desire for some insurance that a recovery will in fact materialize. Two other elements also played a role: the nation's low annual inflation rate -- less than 3 percent as measured by the Consumer Price Index -- and, above all, weak recent growth in the nation's money supply.
The alarming money supply numbers were a painful signal that the nation's banks and other lenders continued to hold back on credit. In turn, this lack of sufficient financing for new construction, for home and car purchases and for other activities has held back the economy, in the view of Fed officials and other economists.
"Any one of these four elements is not likely to be a strong enough reason to lower rates, but if you take all of them together, a stronger case can be made," said Roger Guffey, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.
Mr. Guffey has been among the policy makers most reluctant to lower rates, on the ground that too rapid a recovery might bring higher inflation. But his statement yesterday appeared to reflect a common concern among the Fed's policy makers that the recovery might be in danger. These policy makers are Mr. Greenspan, the four other sitting Fed governors and the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks.
 
Exercising Power
 The Fed exercises its power over rates mostly through its control of the funds rate, which is a rough proxy for what banks pay for much of the money they take in and then lend out for things like car loans, home equity loans, construction financing and consumer credit. When the funds rate comes down, as it did yesterday, lenders in effect pay less for funds. As a result, the spread widens between what lenders pay for money and what they charge for loans.
This bigger profit should encourage banks to make more loans, and since new lending helps to increase the amount of money circulating in the economy, money supply should grow. But that has not happened, although the Fed has pushed the funds rate down in quarter-point steps from more than 7 percent in December.
Quite the contrary, in recent weeks, the Fed's favorite measure of money supply -- M2, a combination of currency and various forms of savings -- has fallen from a 3 percent annual growth rate to a disconcertingly small 2.7 percent. That is barely above what the Fed considers its lowest acceptable growth target: 2.5 percent a year.
 
Uniting Opinion
 More than any other development, weak money supply growth seems to unite Fed policy makers, tending to convince both the inflation-fighters and those more concerned about insuring the recovery of the need to lower interest rates.
Lyle Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Fed governor, explained the thinking this way: "You start with the recognition that this recovery, at best, will be a weak one; that is a widely held view, shared by the Fed. In the context of weak economic growth, you tend to listen harder to what M2 is telling you: that the credit crunch remains a severe problem."
The action yesterday came just two weeks before the Fed policy makers gather in Washington for one of their periodic meetings. That raised the question of why the Fed did not wait until after the meeting to lower the funds rate. One explanation, offered by economists outside the Fed, was that the latest developments were alarming enough to lower rates quickly.
Another explanation, offered by some Fed officials, was that the Fed sought to act in advance of the Treasury's auction this week of billions of dollars in new securities. If the rate cut had been postponed until next week, after the auction, the timing would have been close enough to the policy makers' meeting to wait until afterward before taking any action. And waiting until late August might indeed have been a hardship for the economy.

HEADLINE: Easing by Fed Helps Dow Rise 38.24

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Lifted mainly by news of an easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board, stock prices rose sharply yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average landing just 8 points short of its record close two months ago. Some other indexes reached record levels.
The Dow rose by 38.24, or 1.3 percent, to 3,027.28. Trading was moderately heavy at 174.6 million shares. Advancing issues outpaced decliners by 1095 to 502. The stock exchange reported that 121 companies made new highs, while just 9 fell to new lows. 
 Indexes of large stocks soared to new highs, reflecting the broad strength of the advance. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.56, to 390.62, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index climbed 2.72, to 213.71. Both indexes ended the day less than a point over their previous records, set April 17.
In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index of smaller and more volatile stocks rose 2.59, to 505.20, with the Amex composite up 0.17, to 366.88.
In the morning, stocks drifted lower with many investors standing on the sidelines using the quarterly refunding as an excuse not to participate actively. Trading was choppy and investors showed little enthusiasm until the Fed added money to the banking system.
This was a major reason behind the market's rally yesterday including moderately higher bond prices that gave much needed support to the stock market.
According to Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trades by institutional investors, there were six sell programs and two sell programs yesterday, totaling nearly two hours. The six buy programs took up 82 minutes and during that time the Dow added 37.78 points, while the two sell programs ran a combined 28 minutes, with the Dow adding 11.64 points during that time.
Rao Chalasani, chief investment stategist for Kemper Securities Group in Chicago, said besides the Fed easing yesterday, the first leg of the Government quarterly refunding, the auction of three-year notes, went well and that added market support.
Among the most actively traded issues by volume was Philip Morris Companies, with 3.76 million shares traded. The stock rose 2 5/8 to close at 71 1/2.
Time Warner stock jumped 3 points higher in trading yesterday after completion of a rights offering that raised $2.76 billion. The stock closed at 88.
Motorola rose by 1 3/8, to 66 5/8. Lior Bregman, Oppenheimer analyst, recommended the stock on news that the company has developed a new cellular telephone weighing less than a half pound.
The First American Bank Corporation of Kalamazoo, Mich., saw its stock rise 1 point, to 30 1/2. It plans to buy the Champion Federal Savings and Loan Association of Bloomington pending approval of regulators.
Commodore International, a computer maker, saw its stock fall 1 3/8, to 11 7/8, after the company reported lower fourth-quarter earnings that were below Wall Street estimates.
Imcera Group Inc., a chemical company, rose 1 3/8, to 110 1/4, after reporting a 76 percent increase in its 1991 earnings.

FEDERAL RESERVE MOVES TO REDUCE SHORT-TERM RATES

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve pushed short-term interest rates down a notch yesterday, a move that analysts said was needed to stimulate the economy, which is making only a sluggish recovery from the recession.
By continuing to reduce interest rates -- a process the Federal Reserve started in mid-1989, when the economy began sliding into recession -- officials of the nation's central bank hope to encourage consumers and businesses to spend and borrow more money. 
 With inflation widely expected to remain below 4 percent, analysts said the Federal Reserve's primary concern now was to make sure that the economy grows more rapidly in coming months. By lowering the Federal funds rate, a closely watched rate for overnight bank loans, the Federal Reserve set the stage for declines in other interest rates, including home mortgages, other consumer loans and yields on certificates of deposit.
 
'An Insurance Policy'
 "This was an insurance policy taken by the Fed to help prevent the economy from sliding back into recession," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. Many economists said the pressure to cut short-term interest rates was increased by last Friday's announcement of a decline of 51,000 workers on payrolls of large companies during July.
The move suggested that some of the optimism expressed by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, in mid-July, that a "solid economic recovery" appeared to be on the horizon, had faded. [Page D8.]
"The inflation picture looks awfully good, and that gives the Fed more confidence that it can ease," said Donald Fine, chief market strategist for Chase Securities Inc., an affiliate of the Chase Manhattan Bank.
 
Decline in Yields Cited
 He noted that a modest decline in yields on 30-year Treasury bonds yesterday, to 8.17 percent from 8.22 percent on Monday, was a sign that investors also believed that there was little chance that inflation would rise.
Stock traders also responded enthusiastically to the easing of interest rates, bidding prices up. The Dow Jones industrial average rose by 38.24 points, or 1.3 percent, to 3,027.28, landing only eight points short of its record close two months ago. [Page D1.]
Yesterday's action by the Federal Reserve was a technical one that reduced some short-term interest rates only a quarter of a percentage point, but its effects will ripple throughout the financial system.
The central bank temporarily bought Treasury securities, supplying enough credit to the banking system so that the rate for overnight loans between banks in the Federal funds market fell to 5 1/2 percent from the 5 3/4 percent rate that has prevailed since late April. Since June 1989, the Federal Reserve has pushed the overnight loan rate down from 9 3/4 percent.
Because the overnight bank loan rate is a benchmark for other short-term rates, the Federal Reserve's action will soon be felt in broad segments of the economy. Banks, for example, will soon reduce the rates they pay to consumers on certificates of deposit, a move that would encourage consumers to spend money, rather than keep it invested at low interest rates.
 
Banks Slow on Rate Cuts
 As the interest rates paid by banks fall, the banks will eventually lower the rates they charge for loans, including the prime lending rate to which many other rates are pegged. Banks, many of which are saddled with bad real estate loans made in the late 1980's, have been slower than normal to reduce the prime rate, which is now at 8 1/2 percent.
"I doubt that this latest Fed move will be enough to cause the banks to reduce the prime, but it is a step in that direction," said Mr. Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover.
Interest rates on home mortgages will also come down to the extent that long-term interest rates continue to decline. Since July 26, Treasury bond yields have fallen nearly two-tenths of a percentage point, to their lowest levels since May. But mortgage rates remain well above the 9 percent level that economists say could be needed to stimulate an increase in the building and buying of homes.
Many analysts expect that the Federal Reserve may continue to push interest rates lower in coming weeks to guarantee that the economy does not falter. "With inflation falling to 3 1/2 percent, we are going to see a lot more Fed moves to lower rates before this is over," said Stephen D. Slifer, executive vice president at Lehman Brothers Inc., a securities firm that is a subsidiary of the American Express Company.
But bankers contended that lower interest rates alone might not be enough to encourage the increase in lending that is needed for a more robust economy. Bankers who asked not to be identified because of their need to keep good relations with regulators said they would be more able to issue new loans if bank examinations were less harsh and banks were given more time to solve the problems caused by bad real estate loans.
Although the Federal Reserve made no announcement or formal statement about easing its monetary policy when it temporarily bought Treasury securities at 11.30 A.M., it sent a clear signal to the financial markets.
Within minutes, interest rates on Treasury bills fell by a tenth of a percentage point and bond prices, which go up when yields go down, rallied by half a percentage point.
New York City was among the immediate beneficiaries of the Federal Reserve's move. It was able to reduce interest rates on $750 million of bonds by about a tenth of a percentage point, to 8.10 percent from 8.2 percent, for long-term bonds. The city was planning to reduce rates before the Federal Reserve's action, but securities dealers readily admitted that the central bank's move increased demand for the bonds.
California also benefited, as it cut interest rates to 4.75 percent from 4.85 percent on $2.1 billion of notes due next June. The notes were part of a $4.1 billion short-term financing by the state. Notes are shorter term than bonds, and typically carry lower yields as a result.
 
Below Expected Yield
 The Treasury was another immediate beneficary of the Federal Reserve's action, as it sold $14 billion of new three-year notes at an average yield of 6.92 percent, well below the yield of about 7 percent traders expected. A cut of a tenth of a percentage point in the note yield is equal to an annual savings of about $14 million for the Government.
In advance of today's auction of $12 billion of 10-year Treasury notes, the issue was trading among large institions on a when-issued basis with a yield of 7.95 percent, down from 8.02 percent. The 30-year Treasury bonds to be sold tomorrow were trading at about 8.15 percent, down from 8.21 percent, while the existing 8 1/8 percent Treasury bonds due in 2021 were offered at 99 17/32, or $9,953.13 per $1,000 bond, to yield 8.17 percent, up 19/32, or $5.94 per bond, from a day earlier, when the yield was 8.24 percent.
The modest decline in note and bond yields did not seem to disturb many investors. "Some people will be worried about buying into the market near the top of a rally," said Robert P. Andres, an owner of the Martindale Andres & Godshalkan investment advisory firm. "But I think inflation is going to stay down as the economy grows slowly, and eventually you will see a 7 1/2 percent bond yield."
 
Further Drops Predicted
 Leslie W. Finnemore, a portfolio manager at Colonial U.S. Government Trust, a mutual fund, noted that bond yields "remain attractive relative to inflation, and that the fundamentals of a weak economy and low inflation point to futher declines in yields."
The only people complaining about the Federal Reserve's move were securities firms in the Treasury market because their job of finding buyers for the new Treasury securities was made more difficult by the sudden decline in yields.
The dealers would have preferred the drop in rates to come after the auctions for Treasury notes and bonds were completed, when it would result in large, quick profits for buyers of the securities and the dealers who held them in inventory.
Following are results of yesterday's auction of three-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: Many Call, But Few Cancel After Cruise Ship's Sinking

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Travel agents said yesterday that they had received many telephone calls from worried customers after the sinking of a Greek cruise ship off South Africa, but that few had canceled their bookings.
The cause of the sinking of the Oceanos in the Indian Ocean on Sunday is under investigation, and several agents and cruise industry officials said they were hoping it was an accident. 
 Many noted that the industry was only just recovering from the 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro, an Italian cruise liner, by Palestinian terrorists, and from a recession that continues to bedevil most of the travel industry.
The Persian Gulf war briefly curtailed cruises to Europe and the Mediterranean earlier this year, but cruise lines scrambled to add more trips to the Caribbean, Alaska and Mexico, and stepped up advertising and promotion.
The strategy appears to have worked: The 860,000 cruise passengers during the first quarter of this year was a 14.2 percent increase over the corresponding period in 1990, according to Chris O'Neill, a spokesman for the Cruise Lines International Association. The association predicts a record 4 million passengers in 1991, up from 3.7 million last year.
"The whole cruise industry was affected for a couple of years by the Achille Lauro, because people were afraid," said Lou Garcia, whose Manhatan public relations firm represents the Epirotiki Lines, the Greek company that owns the Oceanos.
Mr. Garcia said Epirotiki received only "a couple" of cancellations yesterday and some bookings.
Bob Biege, who owns Admiral of the Fleet Cruise Center in Milwaukee, said his agency had calls but no cancellations. "It's nothing like after the Achille Lauro, when we got a lot of the 'tell me about the security' inquiries," he said.
Agents said that this time, most customers seemed to be making a distinction between an act of nature and an act of terrorism.
"An act of terrorism suggests a pattern of behavior, but this was apparently a fluke accident in high seas," said Jill Wall, co-owner with her husband of Vacations at Sea in New Orleans. "But that doesn't mean I'm not very disappointed at the crew's response, or lack thereof."
Other travel agents also criticized Yiannis Avranas, the captain of the Oceanos, who passengers said left his sinking ship before most of them were rescued. All 571 people aboard were saved, but questions remain about the seaworthiness of the 7,500-ton vessel.
"Try to picture a Norweigan captain leaving the ship early," Mr. Biege said. "The whole country would revolt. He'd have been tarred and feathered."
Mr. Garcia defended Captain Avranas. "I think he's been unduly maligned without a fair hearing," he said. "He wasn't running away. After he ordered the ship to be abandoned, he got into a helicopter to supervise the rescue operation."
Still, the sinking of the Oceanos is likely to increase demands for even greater safety regulations for foreign cruise ships that carry mostly Americans. All but two of about 115 cruise ships that operate in the United States are registered in foreign nations. Two years ago, the National Transportation Safety Board warned that many of those ships had serious safety deficiencies.
But Jack Estes, the president of the International Council of Cruise Lines, said yesterday that the safety board "is way off the mark."
"The safety standards of the foreign-flag cruise ships operating under the regulations of the International Maritime Organization, which all of them do," he said, "are as good and in many cases better than the U.S. standards."
 
Avoiding Epirotiki
 Even before the Oceanos sinking, some travel agents said they avoided Epirotiki Lines.
"Epirotiki is used to dealing more with Europeans, who aren't as demanding as Americans," said Steve Snider, a sales agent for Cruises Only in Portland, Ore.
But Americans account for about 40 percent of the passengers on the Mediterranean cruises of Epirotiki, Mr. Garcia said. "We're a major company with nine ships, not just one that went down and now we're out of business," he said.

HEADLINE: Seidman Resigning Banks Job

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
More than a year after the White House tried very publicly to remove him from office, L. William Seidman, the nation's senior bank regulator and a forcefully independent official, today announced his resignation.
The departure of Mr. Seidman promises a dramatic change in the way Washington supervises the banking and savings and loan industries at a pivotal time. In both style and substance, he has dominated the regulatory scene in recent years as a strong presence in Congress and with an alternately warm and cold and then warm again relationship with the Administration since he was named chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1985. 
 The Bush Administration has extensively relied on his assessments of the health of the industry, his recommendations for healing the banks and their rapidly deteriorating insurance fund, and his skills to encourage more money from Congress to rescue banks and savings associations. For their part, the banks have found in him a powerful ally who early on rejected any efforts to reduce deposit insurance coverage. The debate that has already begun both over his successor and a reorganization of the regulatory system reflects the void he is expected to leave.
 
An End to Speculation
 In a four-sentence letter to President Bush today, Mr. Seidman, who is 70 years old, said he would step down on Oct. 16, at the end of his terms as chairman of both the F.D.I.C., which oversees the nation's banks, and the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency created in 1989 to manage the savings and loan bailout. His resignation, which had been expected for some time, lays to rest speculation he might seek to stay longer through reappointment or by taking advantage of an ambiguity in the law that some lawyers have read to extend his tenure through February 1993.
Mr. Seidman leaves a legacy as the senior banking regulator during one of the most tumultuous periods in the history of American finance, when the Government has committed hundreds of billions of dollars to two the banking and savings and loan crises, the ultimate depths of which are still unknown.
"I feel today as though somebody has removed a shot put from my gullet," he said in an interview today, in the characteristically blunt style that has become a hallmark of his six-year term at the F.D.I.C. "I'm now available for any kind of job that will pay a lot of money to do practically nothing."
President Bush has not decided who will succeed Mr. Seidman, although officials said William Taylor, the senior banking regulator at the Federal Reserve Board, was the leading candidate to head the F.D.I.C.
With the growing problems in the banking industry and the enormous workload facing the head of the savings and loan bailout, a consensus has emerged in Congress and the Administration that the jobs at the two agencies should be filled by two people.
"We'll try to find a successor as soon as possible," the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, told reporters. He added that Mr. Seidman had "done a good job in a very difficult time." A separate search for the newly created position of chief executive of the trust corporation has already been started by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
In an attempt to push Mr. Seidman out the door long before his term expired, President Bush said in May last year that he would name Mr. Taylor to succeed Mr. Seidman when Mr. Seidman stepped down. The announcement followed several disputes Mr. Seidman had had with Treasury officials and the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, over bank regulation. Mr. Seidman had indicated he would leave before the end of his term, but he never set a date.
Today, the White House and the Treasury Department declined to discuss Mr. Seidman's successor, sending a clear signal that President Bush is rethinking the appointment of Mr. Taylor and that the Administration may not be ready for another contentious confirmation proceeding this fall on top of the Senate hearings on the nominations of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court and Robert M. Gates to head the Central Intelligence Agency.
 
Questions on Rogue Bank
 In recent weeks, Mr. Taylor has come under sharp questioning in Congress for the Fed's handling of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and his apparently belated discovery, only this year, that for years the rogue bank secretly held ownership interests in several American banks.
Mr. Taylor, a career bank regulator who represented the United States in London last month when officials from around the world seized the banking company, is on vacation this week and could not be reached for comment.
"Given the B.C.C.I. scandal, any nominee who's been with the Fed will have to be checked out quite thoroughly, even someone with as top-notch a reputation as Bill Taylor," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn and a member of the House Banking Committee.
 
Delay Called Unimportant
 A senior Administration official involved in the selection process who insisted on not being identified said the President would likely stand by his earlier decision to appoint Mr. Taylor.
"I wouldn't read anything into the delay" in announcing a successor, the official said. "Seidman's announcement came on the same day that the President was going to Kennebunkport and it came without any forewarning."
Like Mr. Seidman, Mr. Taylor is widely regarded in the banking industry and is not likely to encounter serious opposition. But his confirmation hearing would provide an opportunity for lawmakers to examine how vigorously the Administration and the regulators have supervised B.C.C.I.
A few weeks ago, with Mr. Seidman's support, the Treasury Department began a search to find someone to take over the Government rescue of the savings and loan industry, which by some estimates could cost taxpayers $500 billion over 40 years. The Administration's search is widely seen as pre-emptive strike intended to prevent Congress from passing legislation that would drastically alter the way the Government is conducting the bailout, which was authorized by Congress in 1989.
The appointment of new heads of the insurance corporation and the trust corporation will come at the same time Congress is considering Administration requests totaling $150 billion to keep the fund that protects bank deposits afloat and continue the bailout of the savings industry. The House and Senate will also be debating legislation that could radically alter the landscape for banking, eliminating decades-old barriers that have restricted banks from expanding across state lines and into the securities and insurance businesses.
Under Mr. Seidman's leadership, the F.D.I.C. has grown to become one of the most powerful institutions in Washington, deciding the fate of hundreds of large and small banks around the nation, and doling out billions of dollars in contracts to manage the assets of failed banks and more than $600 million annually in legal fees. By some accounts, it has also run out of money and now threatens to become another large taxpayer burden.
 
Reward for Early Success
 Mr. Seidman's early successes in handling banks and his political popularity on Capitol Hill led Congress to give him the second post in 1989 as the senior regulator overseeing the bailout of the nation's savings and loans.
His tenure has also been punctuated by alternating close and distant relations with the Administration, which at some points has sought to rely upon him for political convenience and at other times has been frustrated by its inability to control his powerful assertions of independence.
"Seidman made his mark and will best be remembered for the fact that in the late 1980's, when others in the Administration swept the problems under the rug, he told the truth," Mr. Schumer said. "For that reason, he gained credibility and his integrity was impeccable."
Mr. Seidman's His influence in Congress remains strong. Both the House and the Senate banking committees recently adopted legislation that expands the authority of the F.D.I.C., moves described by one lawmaker as "a bouquet to Bill."
 
A Growth Agency
 When Mr. Seidman assumed his job as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1985, it was a backwater post overseeing an agency that handled a few dozen bank failures annually. It also ran an insurance fund that grew within two years to $18 billion, its greatest worth since its creation in 1934.
Before taking the F.D.I.C. job, he had been a senior economic adviser to President Gerald R. Ford, vice chairman of the Phelps Dodge Corporation, dean of the Business College of Arizona State University and a campaign adviser to former Gov. George Romney of Michigan.

HEADLINE: For Weicker, Today Is Day For Budget: Sign or Veto

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. announced today that he would sign or veto a budget without an income tax on Wednesday, and then spent the rest of the day gathering support for the veto his opponents in the legislature are expecting.
The legislators who put together the budget, which continues Connecticut's reliance on a sales tax, began a counterattack against the editorials and interest groups calling for a veto, pointing out that nearly all of the goods and services subject to the sales tax for the first time under their plan would also be taxed under proposals based on an income tax. 
 They also discussed for the first time the possibility of taking the question of an income tax to a public referendum if Mr. Weicker vetoes this budget, as he has two previous ones, and the legislature cannot override him.
 
Warning on Credit Rating
 "It's pretty clear at this point that if the Governor is going to continue to veto, and the legislature is going to continue to pass conventional budgets, then maybe the public should be given the chance to decide," said the State Senate president, John B. Larson, whose opposition to an income tax has blocked it in the Senate.
With Connecticut apparently headed for another deadlock that could leave it without money to operate, a bond-rating agency warned that its credit rating was threatened by its "continuing budget impasse and deteriorating financial condition."
The agency, Standard & Poor's, assigned a temporary SP1+ rating to $319 million of bond-anticipation notes and placed the rating on "credit watch," meaning that it was in danger of being revised downward. The agency also placed the state's AA rating on $3.7 billion of general-obligation bonds on a credit watch, saying those bonds could be downgraded to A because of the lack of a state budget.
 
Criticism From Budget Office

Governor Weicker's budget office has criticized the budget passed by the legislature not only for failing to cut the sales tax and business taxes, which he says is necessary to stimulate the economy, but also for failing to start repaying the state's accumulated deficit of $1.3 billion.
Connecticut is now the only state still without a budget. The state government has been kept going with temporary spending resolutions since the fiscal year began on July 1, and it is operating this week on the basis of an executive order issued by Governor Weicker on Sunday as the last temporary measure expired. Mr. Weicker, saying he would announce his decision at noon on Wednesday, spent the day meeting with business executives and economists today to get advice on whether to sign the budget and end the state's fiscal crisis, or veto it and fight on.
Through the afternoon his office distributed updates on the number of telephone calls being received (by day's end, 3,163 urging him to veto the budget, and 533 urging him to sign it) and samples of telegrams and faxes coming into the office.
Those calling for a veto ranged from retirees who may have to pay more under the state's high tax on dividends and interest, rather than less under an income tax, to the chief executives of businesses from the Stanley Works to People's Bank, as well as the League of Women Voters.
In addition, officials of state employee unions called a news conference to say again that the budget, known as Coalition III, would kill their offer to defer pay raises and make concessions in pension and health-insurance plans.
The unions agreed to the concessions, worth $327 million, in return for a pledge from Mr. Weicker not to lay off workers in this fiscal year. The budget sent to the Governor could require layoffs. "With Coalition III, the concessions deal is dead," said Robert Krzys, a spokesman for the unions.
 
'Came in Third'
 Mr. Weicker, when told of the referendum talk, said, "The guy who last suggested that came in third in the gubernatorial race." He was referring to Bruce A. Morrison, the Democrat in the race Mr. Weicker won last November, who had campaigned on a promise not to propose an income tax until the idea had been put to the voters.
"We're not going to run the state by referendum," Mr. Weicker said at the end of the day. "That comes every four years, and it's called an election."
Leaders of the coalition of Republicans and moderate Democrats that has put together, and passed, three budgets without an income tax were plainly irritated today by the barrage of calls for a third veto.
They complained that reporters, in scrutinizing their $7.6 billion budget and its new and higher taxes and fees, were not pointing out that income-tax plans would raise taxes even more, and in any case contained some of the same tax increases being criticized.
Under the most recent income-tax plan, for example, the sales tax would be applied for the first time to many new services, like house painting and other home repairs, just as in the coalition's budget. The income-tax plan, however, would cut the sales-tax rate to 6 percent from 8 percent.
Nearly all of the coalition members expected Mr. Weicker to veto their budget since it is essentially the same as two others he vetoed, one on July 1 and the other in May.
If the Governor does veto the budget, the House and the Senate will convene on Thursday and try to override it. If they fail, many legislators expect a shutdown of the state government because they have no plans to pass another temporary spending measure and they question Mr. Weicker's authority to keep the government going by executive order.
"We'll all test each other's powers," said Edward C. Krawiecki, the Republican minority leader in Albany, saying he would challenge the Governor's executive order if there is a veto and a vote to override it fails.

HEADLINE: Europeans Press for Yugoslav Settlement

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: THE HAGUE, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Fearful that Yugoslavia's violent ethnic conflict could reverberate well beyond its borders, foreign ministers of the European Community called today for wider international pressure to bring peace to the troubled Balkan nation.
At an emergency meeting here, the ministers called on the United States, the Soviet Union and the rest of Europe to back its mediaton efforts in Yugoslavia, while France and other community members urged that a Western European buffer force be sent to separate the warring Yugoslav factions. 
 France's Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, said the community was seeking "to sensitize the international community about the Yugoslav drama."
Officials say that if the Yugoslav fighting turns into all-out civil war, an exodus of tens of thousands of Yugoslavs to Italy, Germany or other nations could result. Some European officials fear that since many people of Hungarian and Albanian descent live in Yugoslavia, a full-scale war could spread to other nations as they seek to protect their minorities in Yugoslavia.
 
Criticism of Serbia
 In Zagreb, the Croatian capital, the factions agreed tonight to a cease-fire and the central Government ordered the combatants to disengage. But similar truces in recent weeks have not stuck, and Serbian militants still control large areas of Croatia.
The foreign ministers called the meeting in the Dutch capital today after community officials failed last weekend to arrange a truce in Yugoslavia, where 300 people have died in fighting since Croatia and Slovenia declared independence on June 25.
After that mission, community officials blamed Serbia for blocking a truce as guerrillas from that republic attacked parts of Croatia with the apparent aim of creating a greater Serbia. "It's not acceptable that internal or international borders be changed unilaterally by force," said Hans van den Broek, Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, who led the community's mediation efforts in Yugoslovia.
To step up international pressure on Yugoslavia's feuding republics to stop fighting, the community's foreign ministers said they would ask the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a 35-nation group that includes the United States, the Soviet Union, and almost all of Europe, to support the community's cease-fire efforts. A high-level meeting of that group is scheduled for Thursday in Prague.
 
Sanctions Considered
 The European Community's foreign ministers also asked the community's executive branch to look into imposing economic sanctions against Yugoslav republics that block a cease-fire and financially rewarding republics that cooperate in keeping the peace.
The Foreign Ministers backed the plans of France and Britain, which are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, to keep the Council informed about developments in Yugoslavia with a view to the Council's "taking such measures as may be deemed appropriate." A British official said the Security Council might explore ways to intervene if the fighting intensifies and threatens other nations.
Community officials said failure to agree on stronger action reflected recognition that the community had no magic formula and that a resolution was ultimately up to the Yugoslavs.
At today's meeting, Foreign Minister Dumas urged that Western European nations send a peacekeeping force to Yugoslavia. That idea is to be considered in London on Tuesday at a meeting of the Western European Union, a nine-nation European defense organization. British officials voiced reluctance about that proposal, noting that several Yugoslav factions oppose such a force and asserting that outside peace-keepers could quickly become targets so long as fighting is going on.
Serbian officials oppose a peace-keeping force because it could block their efforts to capture those parts of Croatia that have a Serbian majority.
For his part, Croatia's Foreign Minister, Zvonimir Separovic, said today in Zagreb that his republic opposed such a force because if it took up positions on the current line between Serbian and Croatian units it could result in the de facto loss of the large parts of Croatia captured by Serbs.

HEADLINE: U.S. Military Team to Advise Peru In War Against Drugs and Rebels

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The Bush Administration plans to send military trainers to Peru to help the Peruvian military deal with drug traffickers and guerrillas involved in producing and smuggling cocaine, senior State Department officials said today.
Administration officials said the dispatch of more than 50 advisers, including Green Berets and Navy personnel, reflected an emerging view that Lima was losing control of its Andean mountain provinces to the drug barons and to the rebels of the Maoist Shining Path movement, who protect the traffickers.
 
No Combat Role, U.S. Says
 The new aid program, which the Administration plans to make public once it works out the details with Lima, will mark a break from more than 20 years of limited contact between the United States and a Peruvian Army known for a dismal human-rights record. 
 Officials insisted that President Bush had no intention of sending the trainers anywhere near combat. But noting that 70 percent of the world's cocaine originates in Peru, Bernard W. Aronson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, said: "You can't have a serious counternarcotics program if you write off the largest cocaine producing state and if you won't help the Peruvians provide security for counternarcotics efforts. Peru desperately needs our help."
President Alberto Fujimori and his high command agreed last month to the outlines of a $34 million American military program for Peru that will include the training of two combat batallions, the creation of a river patrol force and the refurbishing of army helicopters and air force combat jets.
The program is also to include American supervision of a reform of the Peruvian military justice system and instruction led by Army lawyers aimed at improving the human-rights record of several Peruvian military units.
It is not known when the trainers are to leave, but their departure is expected within the next few months.
Human rights advocates, noting that Peru's army has the worst record of torture, disappearances and summary executions in the hemisphere, have been highly critical of the recent thaw between Washington and Lima.
Told of the military aid program, Juan E. Mendez, executive director of the human-rights group Americas Watch, said: "The United States is involving itself in a very dirty war. I think the Administration would do a lot better if it demanded reform first."
Melvyn Levitsky, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters, said the aid package was intended to increase the army's ability to improve security in the Upper Huallaga Valley, where the rebels serve as middlemen between the peasant coca growers and the traffickers by negotiating prices and collecting taxes for their own operations.
"Drug trafficking and Shining Path activities are inextricably tied together," he said. "You can't fight one without fighting the other."
Mr. Levitsky said another aim of the training program would be to increase the coordination between the Peruvian Army and the police in anti-narcotics efforts. The two army batallions are to be trained to defend the flanks of police units engaged in interdiction and eradication operations from rebel attacks.
Officials hope that increased cooperation between the army, the police and American trainers will reduce instances in which army units tip off drug dealers and protect clandestine airfields used for trafficking.
 
Similar Programs in Place
 Officials said the trainers would not remain permanently in Peru but would rotate for three to four months at a time. Each combat batallion would be assigned 25 trainers. An undetermined number of military personnel would be assigned to human rights training and to developing the river patrol force intended to intercept transportation of chemicals used to make cocaine.
The Administration already has similar military training programs in Bolivia and Colombia, but neither nation has as serious a guerrilla insurgency as Peru. Shining Path is the most violent and radical guerrilla group in Latin America, targeting health and other social workers as well as intimidating peasant villages. It has sometimes been compared to the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
Mr. Fujimori had rejected a previous proposal for military aid, but helped fashion the latest plan to include American financial assistance for Peruvian Army units to build roads and bridges and otherwise win the support of peasants in drug-cultivating areas.
The military aid accompanies a $60 million economic assistance package that is partly intended to encourage coca growers to switch the crops they farm. Coca growers have learned that the demand for cocaine in the United States makes their crop far more profitable to grow than others.
 
'This Is Not Vietnam'
 The Administration last week moved to release the military and economic assistance, which it had held up since last year, based on its determination that Lima was working to improve its human rights record. Three of four Congressional committees with jurisdiction over foreign policy and appropriations have put a hold on the money.
Several Congressional officials said the hold was temporary as members and the Administration worked out a number of points in the aid package.
The United States has increased its involvement in the war against Peruvian cocaine over the last four years. Since 1987, Drug Enforcement Administration officials and anti-drug officers under State Department contract have worked at an American-built base in the Upper Huallaga Valley advising the police on eradication and on maintaining copters and other equipment.
Over the last two years, American military advisers have been engaged in the training of police units that conduct operations in areas where guerrillas defend growing areas or are directly involved in trafficking themselves.
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey and chairman of the House subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs, predicted that Congress would lift the hold after the August recess because "in the final analysis, the United States has to get involved in Peru."
Sensitive to the charge of several members of Congress that its unfolding Peru policy will lead to ever greater levels of intervention, State Department officials insist that their policy goals are narrowly restricted to fighting drugs and human rights abuses.
They said that the American trainers would be restricted to bases outside combat zones and that the American personnel would not accompany Peruvian units into the field. "This is not Vietnam or even Central America," said a State Department official.
 
U.S. Focus on Rights
 Representative Gus Yatron, Democrat of Pennsylvania and chairman of the House subcommittee on Human Rights, said, "The Administration's decision to send military trainers to Peru represents an unwarranted escalation of United States military involvement in a country whose security forces have one of the worst human rights records in Latin America."
Administration officials insisted that an improvement of Peru's human rights performance was central to their anti-narcotics strategy. Richard Schifter, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, said the Administration went ahead with the project only after President Fujimori and military commanders made headway in purging violent officers and in reducing the number of people who have disappeared while held by the army.
Officials said that when Mr. Schifter traveled to Peru last month, he warned President Fujimori and the military that they could lose the war if they continued to mistreat the Inca peasantry.

HEADLINE: Late Starter in Medicaid, Arizona Shows the Way

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TUCSON, Ariz.

 BODY:
When Sandra Bejarano's 7-year-old son, Santiago, had headaches and a fever on a recent morning, she took him to their family doctor at an attractive midtown clinic. The doctor took a blood count, and though he suspected a routine viral infection, he had them return the next day for another test, just to make sure.
For most Americans, an ordinary medical encounter. And that is what was so exceptional: Ms. Bejarano, who is 28 and unemployed, and her two sons are patients in Arizona's version of Medicaid, the Federal-state medical program for poor people. 
 In much of the country, patients like Ms. Bejarano and her sons would be left to seek treatment in shoddy "Medicaid mills" or, at great public expense, in overcrowded emergency rooms. Disgusted with paltry reimbursement, many doctors even refuse to see Medicaid patients.
 
Sharing a Giant Manager
 In Arizona, things are different. Known for years as a contrary holdout, the only state without Medicaid, Arizona belatedly started a program in 1982 that has become a model.
As in other states, Medicaid here covers only the very poor, excluding many people who still cannot afford health insurance. But for those who are included, the program, unlike others, is run like a giant health maintenance organization. Every patient joins a "managed care" plan, a group of doctors and hospitals that receives a fixed monthly sum for each patient. Every patient has a personal doctor.
The medical care is mainstream. Patients are happy, doctors are happy and costs per patient are about 5 percent lower than in other states where the quality of care is often worse.
"It may save a little money, but more important, they are getting something worthwhile for what they are spending," said Gail Wilensky, head of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration in Washington. Her agency, which pays just over half of Medicaid bills here and nationwide, hopes to see much wider use of managed care.
Managed care also has a central place in proposals being considered in Washington to expand Medicaid greatly, making health insurance available to more of the 34 million Americans who now lack it. So far, several other states have experimented with H.M.O.'s or similar managed-care plans for a portion of their Medicaid clients, and some, including New York, hope to adopt them on a large scale. But Arizona's program is the only one entirely run on that basis.
Arizona has some advantages. Health maintenance organizations are well entrenched in the private sector, and doctors and patients are accustomed to them. And Arizona does not suffer the extremes of drug addiction, homelessness and AIDS that are battering health systems in some large cities.
But there are plenty of poor people -- poorly paid or unemployed workers in the dominant cities of Phoenix and Tucson, farmworkers and many other residents scattered throughout the vast countryside, from the cactus lands of the South to the canyon country of the North. The biggest complaint about the Medicaid program is that too few people are included.
"It's great," said Ms. Bejarano, who entered the program when she was pregnant with Santiago. She selected her health group, run by doctors at the University of Arizona, over competing plans with clinics nearer her southside home because, she said, she liked it better.
"These are people who formerly had very fragmented care, in county hospitals or wherever else they could find it," said Dr. Barry D. Weiss, Ms. Bejarano's primary doctor. "Now they have a doctor they can count on."
Ms. Bejarano says of Dr. Weiss, "He's my one and only." She sees him every six months for a routine checkup and brings her sons once a year and when they are sick. She pays a dollar a visit and nothing for children's checkups or for most prescriptions.
For a monthly fee prepaid by the state, the medical groups provide all care, including hospital and preventive services like immunizations. The fees average about $100 a month for younger patients and more than $250 for patients with high odds of serious illness.
The groups, in turn, pay fees to their doctors that average about 60 percent to 80 percent of what they receive from their private patients. The terms are attractive enough that more than half the state's doctors participate, and the proportion is rising.
"We are delighted with the program, especially when we hear our colleagues in other states talk about Medicaid," said Dr. Thomas F. Griffin, who runs a family practice in Douglas, on the Mexican border in southeastern Arizona.
 
Expensive, but Less So
 Because payments are preset, doctors have no incentive to provide unneeded services. At the same time, close monitoring by the state has deterred profiteering by scrimping on needed care.
Even after allowing for high administrative costs, net expenses per patient are about 5 percent lower than in conventional Medicaid programs, in which doctors are reimbursed for each service they perform, studies have found.
And from 1987 to 1989, the cost of medical services per patient in Arizona grew by only 9 percent, as against 17 percent in other states in similar circumstances, according to a new study for the Federal Government by Laguna Research Associates, a California consulting business.
"Yes, health care is expensive, but at least I can say with a straight face that this is the most cost-effective system in the country today," said Dr. Leonard J. Kirschner, director of the Arizona program. Still, the state's contribution now soaks up 11 percent of the state budget, and counties are required to contribute, too, provoking inevitable grumbling about rising costs.
 
Many Lack Care
 Long-term care of needy elderly and disabled people, offered by this program only since 1989, will soon account for more than one-third of the Medicaid budget, as it does in other states. But here, too, Arizona is taking a different tack. "Case managers" receive fixed fees to provide both medical and long-term care, and efforts are made to support patients at home or in community centers rather than nursing homes.
Ms. Bejarano and her children are among the 377,000 Arizonans enrolled in the medical plan, 10 percent of the state population, including 1 in 3 pregnant women. Reflecting the state's ethnic diversity and its large Mexican-American population, more than half the patients are Hispanic, black or American Indian, with care of the latter shared with the Indian Health Service.
Advocates for the poor say that the program is good as far as it goes, but that too many needy people are excluded.
Slightly surpassing the national standard set by Congress, the program serves pregnant women and infants in families with incomes up to 40 percent above the poverty line. Apart from pregnant women, most families cannot qualify if they have annual incomes more than 32 percent of the Federal poverty level, which is $11,140 for a family of three. The average cutoff around the country is 45 percent of the poverty line.
 
Helped by a Late Start
 Because of the stringent eligibility rules and a depressed economy, the proportion of Arizonans without health insurance approaches 20 percent, Dr. Kirschner said, above the 14 percent national average. One result, despite the expanding of Medicaid coverage of pregnant women, has been a worsening statewide record of prenatal care in the 1980's.
The pioneering Arizona program was born of an intense antipathy to Medicaid, which was created by Congress in the 1960's. In an example of the defiant, go-it-alone streak that runs through politics here, Arizonans preferred to avoid the Federal strings that accompany Federal dollars, and boasted of being the only state to forgo Medicaid. Indigent care was left to the counties, which performed anywhere from decently to dismally.
In the early 1980's local funds ran out, and Arizona decided at last to seek Federal aid. But legislators were determined to create their own model, and being last held an advantage: they could learn from other states' miserable experiences.
With a special Federal waiver, Arizona began the program as a "demonstration project" in 1982. Even its name was a political statement, a homage to fiscal conservatism: the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (A.H.C.C.C.S., pronounced "access").
 
The Payoff of Good Care
 Given only a few months to start up, and with management placed in the hands of a private company, the program was nearly stillborn. In 1984, amid a sandstorm of lawsuits, bankruptcies and fraud charges, state officials took over, and by all accounts the program now runs smoothly.
Grateful enthusiasm like Ms. Bejarano's is not unusual: surveys by the Flinn Foundation, a Phoenix philanthropy, have found high satisfaction among patients. Then, too, many doctors realized that with their payments fixed, providing good basic care pays off over time.
"When we have a child, it really behooves us to do a good job so the patient doesn't end up in the hospital," said Dr. Sant Singh Khalsa, a Tucson pediatrician in solo practice who sees many Medicaid patients.
Dr. Griffin, in Douglas, says he and his partners, as well as their patients, are already reaping benefits from the primary care that has become more widely available through the program.
 
Caring for an Entire Town
 Their single clinic serves nearly all the 25,000 residents, predominantly Mexican-American, of Douglas and the surrounding ranchland. With the nearby copper smelter shut down, jobs are scarce and so is private medical insurance. But about 30 percent of patients are enrolled in Medicaid, Dr. Griffin said, easing the task of preventive care.
In the last five years, Dr. Griffin said, the local rate of premature births has been cut in half. "The population we serve is not as sick as it was six years ago," he said.
The best and worst faces of the Arizona health system are reflected in the experience of Gary Tawney, a 31-year-old Tucson man. His job with a furniture maker offered no health benefits, and for the last several years he coped with serious asthma by taking what over-the-counter drugs he could afford. Then this year he became seriously ill with pericarditis, an inflammation of tissue around the heart.
Unable to pay monstrous hospital bills, he was quickly enrolled in the Medicaid program, which has seen him through his illness with quality care -- "Thank God," he says.
Visiting the University clinic recently, a portable intravenous line feeding antibiotics into his arm, he wondered about the future. "I hope I'll feel well enough to go back to work," he said. But once he makes more than $3,200 a year, he will rejoin the ranks of the uninsured.

Bad News About Concerts
The concert industry, like the economy at large, is suffering from a recession that is wreaking havoc on tours and threatening to bankrupt promoters. The Sister of Mercy tour featuring Public Enemy, Gang of Four and Warrior Soul was canceled on July 30 because of poor ticket sales, and the Whitney Houston, Club MTV (featuring Bev Bell Devoe and Tony Toni Tone) and Steve Winwood tours are all limping along, playing to less-than-capacity houses. 
 According to one leading promoter, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, recent tours by Stevie Nicks, Huey Lewis, the Moody Blues, the Doobie Brothers, Pat Benatar, Amy Grant and others have been disasters. "The promoters I've been speaking to say the situation is atrocious," said Jane Cohen, an editor at Performance Magazine, a concert and touring trade journal. "It's the worst period in memory."
One reason for the drop in business may be the high cost of concertgoing. Rising guarantees for artists have pushed ticket costs to around $50 a pair. Gas, parking and tolls may add another $10; hot dogs and beer another $15. The total for two can run as high as $95, and that's without so-called handling and convenience charges -- sometimes more than $5 a ticket -- tagged on by ticket services.
"The rap genre and dance music haven't created big draws," said John Scher, a major promoter in the New York City area. "And I think it's important that the experience of going to a concert has been so homogenized it's not much fun. Really, it's an outrageous experience: crowded, a cattle-car situation."
Another factor that may be alienating audiences is the spread of canned music, as bands try to live up to their MTV videos. The tours that are doing best this summer -- the Lollapalooza tour, featuring Jane's Addiction, Faith No More, Ice T, Living Colour and others, and the perennial Grateful Dead -- have made names for themselves as live bands.
"Generations of concertgoers who knew nothing but MTV," Mr. Scher said, "have gotten discerning enough to distinguish between artists who are principally visual and won't put on a good show and old-fashioned live bands with guitars, keyboards, bass and drums, all belting away."
 
Idiosyncratic Jazz
 Tim Berne, the saxophonist and composer, has written some of the most distinctive jazz to have been made in the 1980's. He has just released a brilliant new album, "Pace Yourself," and it, too, mines his idiosyncratic compositional sensibility. Mr. Berne's pieces are built with a narrative process that seldom involves repetition; they evolve, with section after section building to a whole; Mr. Berne isn't afraid to put a freely improvised interlude next to riffs or a tightly composed passage.
"I'm usually thinking in terms of horizontal line," said Mr. Berne. "I try to have beginnings and endings, but I try to avoid the quiet-to-intense-then-resolution curve that so many pieces use. Events are cumulative in my pieces. I try to use the material in a composed setting the way people may use chord changes. The written background or transitions are there to feed ideas for soloists or create a context that is there every time, and the way the musicians respond is up to them. It's a guarantee that I'll have my stamp on things."
In the late 1980's, Mr. Berne had a fling with jazz fame, recording several albums for Columbia Records. But he was dropped from the label and now records for a small European label, JMT, which is distributed by Polygram. Life is better now, he said. "With anybody else I couldn't record an album this long, or have a cover with wacky colors. I have a strong idea about design, and I get to have a lot of input into how the album appears. And with a small label the stuff stays in print. All the music on Columbia is gone, but the older records on JMT are still available, and they still sell."
 
The Explosion of Country
 Clint Black, the country singer who is to perform this Friday night in a sold-out show at Radio City Music Hall, is catching a surge of popularity in country music. Billboard's pop chart, which has a new, more accurate accounting system, has put country music in competition with pop for the first time, sending country albums into the top 10. The 29-year-old Mr. Black, who is one of country's biggest stars and something of a sex symbol, is feeling good.
"Country music is stronger than at any time that I've every seen," he said by telephone from Austin, Tex. "I always say that rap has helped country music. I think any music that is as extreme as rap and heavy metal tends to send people running. And they've come to country music. Everybody from a guy on a tractor on the farm to stockbrokers listens to my music. I've intentionally written lyrics aimed at the broadest possible group of people, and I'm not the only country writer who thinks this way."
Mr. Black has also taken advantage of the explosion in the popularity of country video. With his trademark black cowboy hat, he's etched an identity in a genre where the song is often more important than the singer.
"I suppose in any line or product a marketing specialist will have you do something that stands out," he said. "I like my videos consistent, so I wear the same black hat all the time. That's as far as I go when it comes to calculating an image. But I'll tell you, it works. I had a video out once before a single had come out, and a week after the video hit, I went out on the road and we filled up the clubs. It was standing room only, and it made me think that television is more widely watched than radio is listened to."

In Career Twilight, McNeil Wages Fight For Player Freedom

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Aug. 6

 BODY:
Free agency for National Football League players and a collective-bargaining agreement are nebulous notions to most players, especially at this time of year, when those who aren't sweltering on the practice field are sweating the roster cuts.
The labor issues have not drifted past Freeman McNeil, an 11-year veteran who is the Jets' career rushing leader and fourth among active running backs with 7,604 yards. That is why McNeil has a lawsuit pending against the league in which he is seeking free agency for himself and ostensibly for all N.F.L. players. The lawsuit, which was filed in April 1990, has survived several challenges by the league and is scheduled for trial in Minneapolis next February. 
 Sitting in a darkened office at the Jets' facility here after a morning practice today, McNeil spoke about why he decided to join with seven other players in an N.F.L. Players Association-sponsored lawsuit against the league. For McNeil, whose name is the first on the lawsuit, his decision was as simple as the meaning of his first name.
"It's about being able to make a choice on how you want your contract to be," McNeil said. "I think everyone has choices to do what they want to do to get to where they want to get to."
He arrived at his decison after 10 years of watching how other players are treated in the league. He said he was breaking away from a mentality that, he said, is instilled in athletes from high school and hurts them later.
 
'Told What to Do'
 "In high school and in college we're protected," he said. "Even when we get here there's some sort of protection. We're told what to do, where to go. What we relinquish, in an unconscious state, is our responsibility for ourselves. But we're not children."
N.F.L. careers are short, an average of under four years, so that players often don't get a chance to think about the issues surrounding the sport.
"It all happens so fast and at such a velocity that by the time you really get your thought processes going and it really sinks in, boom, you're out of it or you're at the tail end of your career," McNeil said.
McNeil is one of the latter. One of the ironies for McNeil is that if he wins the lawsuit, it probably won't benefit him. He is a 32-year-old running back, who will earn $900,000 this year and will back up Blair Thomas, the Jets' No. 1 pick last year, in a rotating backfield. In a free market, McNeil might not attract any attention.
 
Influenced by Strike
 McNeil said his actions were shaped by the 1987 players' strike. He struggled with the decision of whether to go out and eventually joined his striking teammates for solidarity reasons.
McNeil said that as he grew up in Carson, Calif., one of the lessons his mother taught him was that he should "always be a man." That meant he should take responsibility for the direction of his own life and for his actions. It is a lesson that runs counter to the way business is conducted in the N.F.L. between players and clubs, where players have no say in where they play. McNeil's suit addresses the basic conflict in that relationship.
"Players need the opportunity to be able to negotiate for themselves, the things that they need or they would like," he said, "in agreement with the club and within the structure of union, so that when they get out of this game they know that they have an opportunity to live a good life.
"Everything we need, we can negotiate in our contracts. It comes down to the club that picks you up or the club that you want to go to sitting down and negotiating fairly."
Team owners say that unrestricted free agency for players will wreck the economic stablity of the league and will throw off the competitive balance among the 28 teams because the teams that have the greater resources will be able to afford the best players.
McNeil said he hasn't had any problems negotiating contracts with the Jets under the current system. His stance on free agency and his part in the lawsuit have not damaged his relationship with Jet management or his own teammates.
Joe Browne, the N.F.L.'s vice president of communications and development, said the league isn't worried about McNeil's lawsuit bringing about unrestricted free agency.
"The worst-case scenerio is if management loses the McNeil case," Browne said. "But it doesn't mean the players would be granted total free agency, because that same District Court that is hearing the McNeil case ruled in two separate cases in the 70's, the Mackey case and the Jack Reynolds case, that professional sports leagues, in this case the N.F.L., are entitled to a system."
McNeil said it was unfortunate that a lawsuit may force the league into doing something that is long overdue but that it fits the pattern of progress.
"Look down through history," he said. "As things have happened, it's taken things like this for things to go forward. This is a phase where this sport is going forward. It happened in baseball and it happened in basketball."

HEADLINE: Educators Draw Outline For Nationwide Testing

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
For the first time, a group of high-level education policy-makers and classroom teachers has put together the working elements for a national examination system like that advocated by President Bush.
The group of 450 people, which met last week in Snowmass, Colo., agreed on the outlines of a nationwide testing system for students in elementary and high schools. The plan would allow regions to develop their own tests and grade them according to a national standard so that the results could be compared across the country. The New Standards Project, as the group is known, also produced dozens of sample questions for such a test. 
 Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, co-chairman of the Council on Standards and Testing, the national group that will recommend what kinds of tests and standards the country should adopt, said that he believed the project was on the right track. The project, a network of 16 states and six urban school districts, is just one of several groups now competing to design a test that could fit into President Bush's plan.
"I frankly view this group as being accurately focused on what is the kind of assessment and test we're going to use," he said. "You've got to stop short and say, our assessment has to reflect what an educated person should be. We should not just do it because it's cheap and easy to grade."
National testing is a revolutionary departure for American education, which has traditionally stressed local control. But the idea has steadily gained support as a way to force widespread education reforms and bring all American students up to clearly-defined high standards.
Critics worry, however, that national testing would dictate a rigid national curriculum, deprive teachers of initiative and discourage their creativity, and cut off opportunities for those who fail such tests, particularly poor and minority children.
Participants in the project say their work last week has helped convince them that they can surmount such problems, which have dogged all previous attempts to reform education by testing.
Rather than multiple-choice tests, for which teachers can drill students to produce the right answers almost by rote, this test would pose open-ended questions that would force students to think and would resemble the tasks they would need to perform once they leave school, said Lauren B. Resnick, a testing expert who is one of the leaders of the New Standards Project. (See box.)
The group has also made progress on a technical issue that many testing experts predicted would be impossible to resolve -- how to give regions the freedom to devise their own tests yet still compare the results nationally. Teachers at an earlier conference a few weeks ago found that they gave very similar grades on essays from other state tests, said Joan Simmons, a teacher in Craftsbury Common, Vt., who helped develop widely-praised tests in Vermont that could be a model for the national tests.
"From a teacher's point of view, I think this is a fine idea," Ms. Simmons said. "I think teachers better get to the forefront because we have to educate the people who will be designing this."
Next the project will try out the sample questions in the classroom. By spring, Ms. Resnick hopes to produce an entire sample test, along with a demonstration of how different tests could be compared with a national standard.
Although the group has begun to show what a national testing system might look like, other concerns remain. Many continue to worry that poor and minority children who fail will not get the help or money they need to pass.
"One of the worst things about American schooling now for poor and disadvantaged kids is that they are held to few and sometimes no standards at all," said Phyllis McClure of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "The thing that attracts me about this proposal is that it establishes a common, high standard for all kids. But how do you expect high standards of kids who go to the worst possible schools? There's got to be some kind of leverage to force the system to provide the resources that these kids need."
Others fear that the tests will be misused to decide who gets on the elite career track, as happens in Europe and Japan. Standardized tests now are used to track children, and have not improved educational achievement, according to several research studies by Lorrie Shepard, a professor of education at University of Colorado at Boulder.
Ms. Resnick and Marc Tucker, who also heads the project, both said that the system they have in mind would be used to insure that all students received the help they needed to meet standards, and that the standards would be clearly defined.
"For the first time, parents of poor and minority kids would be able to walk into school and say this curriculum does or does not look to me like it will get my kids to the kind of standard that wealthy and majority kids have been meeting for years," Mr. Tucker said. "Now the system tells them their kids are getting A's and B's and it's not till years later that they find out those A's and B's don't mean anything."

G.M. and Chrysler Are Raising Prices

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation, facing their worst sales slump in years will raise prices for their 1992 cars.
G.M., the nation's biggest auto maker, said prices for most of its 1992 model year passenger cars will on average cost 3.1 percent more than comparably equipped 1991 models. Chrysler said it would increase 1992 domestic car prices by an average of 1.4 percent. The companies said the price increases were necessary to keep pace with inflation and to meet a growing demand for extras like air bags and air-conditioning.

HEADLINE: A Jerky Start Toward '92

BYLINE: By James Reston; James Reston is former chief Washington correspondent and former executive editor of The New York Times.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In case you missed it and even if you're not ready for it, the Presidential campaign of 1992 has now begun. The first thing George Bush did after his summit meetings in London and Moscow was to call his political advisers to Camp David for a planning session on the coming campaign. This almost aroused the Democrats from their prolonged sleep, especially since the President is now blaming them for every disaster from the budget deficit to the recession.
Both parties have had a hard time. At home, they have had to deal with difficult economic, social and moral tangles, and abroad with the end of the cold war, collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe and renewed aggression in the gulf. So there is now a pause for reflection on the Bush record, which is not as good as the Republicans claim or as bad as the Democrats charge. 
 Both parties have talked endlessly in bits and pieces about everything, but have settled very little.
The President has had ideas about how to make democracy work in the Soviet Union and the Middle East, but very few thoughts about the problems of the cities or the Middle West. The Democrats have deplored the lack of leadership in the White House without producing a credible policy or challenger of their own.
There is something goofy about all this. Both parties agree we are living in a new and unusual world, but are conducting politics as usual. Even the President, who is supposed to set priorities, keeps talking more about order abroad than disorder at home. He celebrated the end of a war he forgot to end, brought the boys home and talks about sending them back to finish the job. He denounces Saddam Hussein for murderous efforts to dominate the Middle East, but tolerates Hafez al-Assad, a cleverer terrorist, who has the same objective.
Mr. Bush's appointments are as puzzling as his priorities. He talks about a unified America, but plays at racial politics. He insists he never even thought about race when he nominated Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, and even during the current silly season, nobody laughed. Mr. Bush asks everybody to forget about the Iran-contra scandals, but assured another bitter debate by appointing Robert Gates, the No. 2 man at the C.I.A. during that controversy, as Director of Central Intelligence.
The Democrats seem dazed by these opportunities. It's hard to think of a time when an opposition party had so many chances and made so little use of them. Every time the President stumbles, some prominent Democrat drops out of the race to oppose him in 1992, or the Governor of New York delivers another soliloquy on the virtues of patience and modesty, and the voters tell the pollsters that they're worried about the future but probably will re-elect Mr. Bush anyway. This supports the unpopular theory that responsible officials cannot be worse than the voters who put them in office in the first place.
The Administration invites Israel to give up "land for peace," but is not saying what Washington would do if Israel gave up land and got no peace. Would the U.S. guarantee the new borders or go to war to defend Israel? And would the Soviets join in a guarantee? Meanwhile, the Administration continues to help finance Israeli policies it does not like, and avoids other reasonable but awkward issues.
It would be interesting to know as early as possible about Vice President Quayle's future, if any. We are told Mr. Bush, who would be 72 at the end of a second term, will insist on the renomination of Mr. Quayle, which is mysterious and slightly presumptuous, for while the Presidential nominee has the right to recommend a running mate, the party has to decide and take responsibility for the decision.
So maybe it's too early to assume Mr. Bush's re-election, but not too early to debate the record of the last 10 years and what might be done to improve it in the last years of the century.

HEADLINE: A Look at the City;
Ox-Goring Time in New York

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
"The question is, what do we do to help the city avoid financial disaster?" Gov. Mario Cuomo crooned at the other end of the phone, as New York City stares down the cannon of budget deficits that could total $16 billion over the next four years.
But the Governor knows better than anyone that the real question is not WHAT should be done, but WHO will do it. 
 Will it be David Dinkins, the Mayor with the misfortune to be in City Hall after a decade of Reagan-Bush neglect of Federal aid to cities, the city's first black chief, who has lost the confidence of New York's establishment? Or will it be Mr. Cuomo and his state-led Financial Control Board, a mechanism favored by the city's financial establishment and despised by the Mayor as a symbolic usurpation of his power? Or will everyone simply watch the city's decline and wait for the next inhabitant of City Hall?
The "who" issue is about power, pride, ambition, race, credit and blame. Mr. Dinkins can cut through it all and take command by calling for the Control Board himself and helping to reshape its membership and actions.
The "what" issue is not very contentious. Virtually everyone agrees on the need for a long-term state-city plan with the following elements:
* A 25 percent cut, mainly by attrition, in the city's labor force, coupled with a sharp tightening of union work rules to prevent undue declines in services, plus elimination of non-essential activities, like financing radio stations.
* An economic development plan engaging the full range and talents of city leaders to keep business in the city and provide new jobs.
* Greater state assumption of particularly burdensome city expenses, such as Medicaid and education.
* Floating of new bonds by the Municipal Assistance Corporation, headed by Felix Rohatyn, to raise money.
* Deficit financing, now forbidden by law, to keep services up and ease the transition. New taxes will only drive residents out of the city, as will Draconian cuts in services.
Mr. Rohatyn, like most city financiers who see businesses and middle-class people on the verge of mass flight, believes the Control Board would spark just such a plan. He seems to want the board in operation at the earliest opportunity. "There's no magic in it," he says, "but it is the best way for the Mayor to put more responsibility on the state and strengthen his hand with the unions."
Mr. Cuomo suggests that board advocates are overrating its potential effectiveness, but that in any event "we're a couple of steps away from a decision" on it. The Mayor, he says, "has my full confidence." And because the Governor delights in spinning webs, he adds: "I'll have much more to say after Labor Day."
Mr. Dinkins argues that the board does not add materially to what he and Mr. Cuomo can and should do now, that it would shatter confidence in city government and send a racist message to blacks. He vows to go to war with anyone who hits him over the head with the board.
There is merit to the Mayor's points. And he is right to fight for his mandate. He is also right to gamble that the Governor and the white financial establishment will do whatever possible to avoid confrontation with him and the black community.
But he is wrong to think of the issue as racial; the board was created to deal with the plight of the city's first Jewish Mayor, Abe Beame. Mr. Dinkins is being stubborn in not acknowledging the board's value in bargaining with unions. He is also damaging his political base by trying to balance the budget mainly at the expense of blacks and Hispanics, his key voting bloc. Finally he is wrong to believe he can balance the budget in any event and escape the board. Not Mr. Dinkins, not any New York mayor at this time can avoid deficits and thus sidestep the board's legal mandate.
Mr. Dinkins would dazzle New Yorkers and set a model for city-state relations if he took the initiative and asked for the Control Board before it landed on his head. By moving now he might be able to add a few members of his choice and help shape board operations.
No one should hold the Mayor responsible for the economic mess he inherited. But few will forgive him for not doing everything he can now to put the city back on its feet.

HEADLINE: With Military Set to Thin Ranks, Blacks Fear They'll Be Hurt Most

SERIES: Military-Industrial Upheaval -- Fourth of five articles.

BYLINE: By LEE A. DANIELS

 BODY:
As the military goes through one of its biggest contractions since World War II, it seems clear to all who have studied the matter that American blacks will be among those who will suffer most.
This is basically because blacks make up a far higher percentage of the military population than of the general population, and, by virtually universal agreement, they have been given greater opportunity for advancement in the military than in civilian life. 
 So this period of national transition, while clearly difficult for everyone serving in the military, looms as much more difficult for blacks.
 
Making the Transition
 Some Government programs are already in place or are to be started next month dealing with the overall problem of helping people who are forced out of the military. But there is a significant concern among leaders of black groups and among others about whether the nation adequately understands the complexity of the transition or has adequate plans to cope with it.
Even so, no one is suggesting that special programs be created just to assist minorities.
Indeed, some prominent blacks, particularly in the military itself, believe that if it is in the best interests of the nation to cut the military sharply, then so be it; blacks should take their lumps along with everyone else and go ahead and reforge their own futures.
An equally strong countersentiment is welling up, however, in black civil rights groups and among some experts on social policy. This view holds that since the nation has relied heavily on young black males to make up the military -- they fought in greater proportionate numbers than whites in the Persian Gulf and Vietnam, for example -- it cannot or should not simply discharge them now and forget.
They argue, too, that blacks still encounter substantial discrimination in the private-sector workplace and will find it especially difficult to start new careers.
 
Exercising Restraint
 Still, Edwin Dorn, a specialist on military affairs for the Brookings Institution, a Washington research center, said the traditional civil rights groups and the Congressional Black Caucus had refrained from asking that blacks in the military be protected from cutbacks.
For one thing, he said, those groups have long favored spending less on the military. "In the past they've been in the forefront of those calling for a reduction of the military budget," Mr. Dorn said. "They can't very well turn around on a dime now and say, 'Don't cut so much.' "
Mr. Dorn also said these groups might think that whatever the short-term problems caused by the cutbacks, the black population would benefit in the long run if money formerly spent on the military was redirected toward social programs.
In February, President Bush, with Gen. Colin Powell by his side, hailed the armed services as the nation's "greatest equal-opportunity employer." General Powell, who is black, is Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
But if this greatest of employers is going to cut 500,000 jobs by 1995, as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney proposes, then much of the opportunity it presents could vanish.
The experts say that present indications are that the cuts will come most intensely in just those areas where blacks are heavily concentrated, like combat and logistics.
Col. Michael J. Shane, who as the new director of the Army's enlistment distribution center will have a crucial role in the cutbacks, told a recent conference that "at least 100,000 fewer blacks can be expected on active duty five years from now."
Of that prospect, Charles C. Moskos, a Northwestern University sociology professor and former Army officer who has written widely on the military, said in an interview: "I can only think: negative, negative, negative. This could cause great hardship to many black families and black communities, because blacks as a group are far more dependent on the military for employment than whites."
 
One General's Opinion
 Brig. Gen. Clara Adams-Ender, who has been in the Army 32 years, is head of the 40,000-member Nurse Corps and is president of a predominantly black organization of Army officers that studies racial issues in the military. She addresses the problem with a different emphasis.
In remarks not untypical of other blacks of various military rank who were interviewed for this article, she said that as blacks have benefited from the military, so must they share in whatever difficulties develop.
"Top command has done a very good job of getting the information out to the field," she said. "We just need to be sure that the information gets dispersed all the way down the ranks, so that if people aren't kept on, they're in the best position they can be to make the transition to civilian life."
 
Insuring Opportunity
A Warning About Business as Usual

Part of Professor Moskos's reason for feeling so pessimistic is that he sees the reverse side of President Bush's assertion: the military's record on equal opportunity looks so good, he says, because so much less opportunity exists elsewhere for blacks.
"In no other sector of society," Professor Moskos said, "do blacks have such broad opportunities to develop and exercise their abilities, and nowhere else will you see blacks so likely to be in positions of authority over whites."
Colonel Shane said that though the cutbacks will affect military personnel of all races, "blacks in uniform will be forced into a job market that is decidedly less friendly to them than to others."
"Work must begin now," he added, "to insure that once the welcome-home parades are over, those displaced by the downsizing can be absorbed into the civilian work force."
Clifford L. Alexander, Secretary of the Army under President Jimmy Carter, put it more bluntly. He said a substantial responsibility for the lasting impact of any layoffs rests with the hiring practices of white corporate leaders.
"If they provide opportunities in the form of jobs, the impact will be minimized," said Mr. Alexander, who is now a consultant. "If they continue 'business as usual,' the impact is going to be severe."
 
Love of the Military
Getting a Career And Pride, Too

Finding limited opportunity outside the military was certainly the experience in the late 1950's of General Adams-Ender after her sophomore year at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College. She found that enlisting was about the only way she could get money to complete her college education. "I intended to leave after two years," she said, "but I stayed because I enjoyed what I was doing and I felt positions of increasing responsibility were available to me."
Her words were echoed by Sgt. Maj. Tony L. Salter and Sgt. Mark Clifton, both stationed at Fort Dix, N.J. As sergeant major, Mr. Salter, a 29-year veteran, is the sprawling base's top-ranked noncommissioned officer. Sergeant Clifton, an eight-year veteran, won this year's Army-wide competition for drill sergeant of the year.
Both men enlisted after high school graduation and both speak with pride of finding, as Sergeant Major Salter put it, "the opportunity to do things with more responsibility earlier" than they believe they could have found in civilian life.
 
Limited Options
 Martin Binken, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, said most black high school graduates still did not have many options other than the military to gain the skills needed for good jobs.
Mr. Binken and others say that this broader military role as an agent of social reform -- for example, combating discrimination by strictly adhering to the principle of equal pay for equal rank -- has helped inculcate a sense of pride and determination in black military people.
Moreover, Dianne M. Penderhughes, a professor at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, contended that the regulations against discrimination that the military has adopted over the last 30 years are "the most coercive" in American society and are the fundamental reason many blacks in the military are able to express great pride in being black and yet also see themselves as military people who just happen to be black.
Don Miller, a senior vice president with Dow Jones & Company, who retired from the Army as a major in 1968 after a 21-year career, said: "Military service isn't for everyone, but it was the most wonderful thing in the world for me. It gave me a sense of purpose and self-esteem. It helps you determine your priorities, discipline your behavior to achieve those priorities, and manage people and tasks."
"I'm a retired regular Army officer first," Mr. Miller, said, "and then I am whatever else I am." Then he laughed. "Do you get the feeling I love the military?"
 
The Demographics
Populating The Military

Blacks make up 12 percent of the country's population and 14 percent of its 18- to 24-year-olds. But Pentagon statistics show that they account for 23 percent of the 2.2 million men and women on active duty: black men make up nearly 21 percent of the two million men in the military and black women nearly 31 percent of the 223,000 women.
They total 17 percent of the officers and enlisted personnel in the Navy, nearly 21 percent in the Marine Corps and nearly 18 percent in the Air Force.
But the most significant figures come from the Army, which with 730,000 members is by far the biggest branch; the Navy has 572,000 personnel on active duty; the Air Force has 526,000 and the Marines have about 200,000. Thirty-two percent of the Army's officers and enlisted personnel are blacks: 29 percent of the enlisted men and women, 35 percent of the noncommissioned officers and 11 percent of the officers.
Further, blacks re-enlist at rates nearly twice as high as that of whites and a higher proportion of black servicemen and women take advantage of the military's educational benefits than do their white counterparts.
Perhaps even more important than the statistics is the symbolic importance of the high leadership positions held by blacks in the military. Consider two of the top jobs. General Powell, of course, as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, in the last year or so has emerged as a significant figure to whites and blacks. Some have compared his importance as a symbol of racial progress to that of George Washington Carver, Marian Anderson or Jackie Robinson.
And the boss of the Army, Secretary John W. Shannon, is black. He is, incidentally, a retired lieutenant colonel, who was captain over Second Lieut. Colin Powell in a platoon in the 1950's.
 
Awaiting the Pain
For Recruits, A Closing Door

Janice H. Laurence, a senior scientist with the Human Resources Research Organization, a consulting firm in Alexandria, Va., said that not only would the layoffs disproportionately affect blacks now in the military, but also black enlistments.
The Pentagon is preparing for major cuts in recruiting. Plans call for 200,000 new recruits this year; by comparison, it took in 293,000 in the fiscal year 1989 and 232,000 in 1990. Since blacks both enlist and re-enlist in greater proportions than whites, Ms. Laurence said, "the numbers could produce a very bad impact."
Representative Beverly Byron, Democrat of Maryland, the chairman of a House subcommittee on military personnel, said, "It's too early to determine exactly what will happen as the draw-down unfolds." But she said of herself and her Congressional colleagues, "We'll be watching very carefully." "
General Powell has said on several occasions that the Pentagon must be sensitive to the reduction's impact on minorities. Other top military officials have held discussions with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and other groups on the issue.
 
One Group's Stand
 John J. Johnson, director of armed service and veterans affairs for the N.A.A.C.P., said the group has sought no special treatment for blacks as the military shrinks.
"We're in frequent contact with each other," Mr. Johnson said, referring to military officials. "They know our concerns are that blacks not bear a disporportionate share of the impact. They've been open and forthright with us, and we want to give them a chance to do their work as they see fit."
By the end of September, the Army plans to have 61 Transition Assistance Centers set up around the country to help personnel and their families with job counseling and such. Linda White, the civilian director of the Army's program, said the Army was also developing a list of businesses that have pledged to give special consideration to returning servicemen and women.
The precise impact of the military cutbacks on blacks is, of course, unknown. There have been no really adequate studies of the economic importance of blacks in the military to the black community as a whole. Moreover, many specific details of the reductions have yet to become clear.
Several black junior grade and noncommissioned officers said in interviews that the cutbacks were already apparent within the services. One sergeant, who asked to remain anonymous, said he had decided to leave. "The Army's no place to be now," he said. "They say they're downsizing by this much. But who can say if that's really going to be all?"
Secretary Shannon said: "I don't know how easy it will be for our black personnel who are discharged to assimilate into the private sector. But I promise you it will be hard for the private and public sector not to take them because we'll make sure that they know these are people who served their country admirably and have the attitudes and the skills to continue to do so."
But promises are often difficult to keep. Blacks participate in the military "more than in any other sector of society," Professor Penderhughes of the University of Illinois wrote in the annual report of the National Urban League. "The question that should be debated with the greatest intensity is when will we be able to share in the benefits of this economy at home?"

CORRECTION-DATE: August 9, 1991, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Wednesday about the military's plans for cutbacks, and the possible impact on black service members, misidentified John W. Shannon and referred incorrectly to his rank at retirement and his service with Gen. Colin Powell. Mr. Shannon is the Under Secretary of the Army; the Secretary is Michael P. W. Stone. Mr. Shannon retired from the Army as a colonel, not a lieutenant colonel. During the 1950's he served in the same brigade as General Powell, but not in the same unit of the brigade. The article also referred incorrectly to the Army service of Prof. Charles C. Moskos of Northwestern University. He was an enlisted man, not an officer.

Making Old Shopping Centers New

BYLINE: By Lettice Stuart

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS

 BODY:
WITH the decline in new construction, developers of shopping centers are putting a new emphasis on improving existing centers. The case of Maurin-Ogden Inc., Louisiana's largest developer and operator of shopping centers, suggests that the shopping center company's growth can continue, even when the development business is stagnant.
In the early to middle 1980's, Maurin-Ogden could not find prime sites to build new shopping centers fast enough. It had so many properties of its own that it declined to manage shopping centers owned by others.
Now the company is buying existing centers, and renovating and expanding them. It also manages more than six million square feet of commercial real estate for third parties, like banks, insurance companies and the Resolution Trust Corporation.
"We had to change the way we did business in order to survive," said Roger H. Ogden, the chief executive officer, from the company's headquarters in Mandeville, 25 miles north of New Orleans.
Mr. Ogden, who is vice president of the board of trustees of the International Council of Shopping Centers in New York, considers the company representative of how developers around the country are reorganizing for the 1990's.
Since reaching a high of 2,036 new centers built in 1986, shopping center construction has declined 50 percent; only 1,019 new centers were built in 1990. Contributing to this construction slowdown have been the national recession, the overbuilding resulting from the deregulation of financial institutions in the early 1980's, the overhaul of the nation's tax laws in 1986,making real estate a less attractive investment, and the tightness of real estate financing.
As new center construction drops off, however, the renovation and expansion of existing centers have relatively increased. According to the council, renovation and expansion contracts accounted for 24 percent of the total value of all shopping center construction contracts in 1990.
By contrast, renovation and expansion contracts averaged only 5 percent of total contract value during the 1960's, 9 percent during the 1970's and 17 percent during the 1980's. Council research indicates that investment in the renovation and expansion of existing centers will equal, and possibly exceed, investment in new development in the 1990's. 
Maurin-Ogden currently has more than $11 million of renovation and expansion projects under way. The expansion of the 300,000-square-foot Ambassador Row shopping center built by Maurin-Ogden 10 years ago in Lafayette, La., is typical of what the company is now doing.
The $3.5 million project includes construction of a new 54,000-square-foot Delchamps food store and the renovation of the existing 32,000-square-foot Delchamps store for a new tenant, a clothing store operated by Weiner Enterprises of Houston. The entire center will be freshened up with cosmetic renovations, said James E. Maurin, president of the company's development arm.
Maurin-Ogden is also renovating a 30-year-old shopping center in Alexandria, La. The company acquired a 50 percent interest in the 275,000-square-foot MacArthur Village five years ago. When the $3.5 million overhaul is completed next year, MacArthur Village will look brand new with a new facade, modern lighting, a renovated parking lot and many new tenants, Mr. Maurin said.
Maurin-Ogden has several other renovation and expansion projects under way and 10 more on the drawing boards, but the company is having difficulty getting financing for a development it is trying to get off the ground in Baton Rouge, La.
Mr. Maurin said the company had spent months trying to get a one-year construction loan to build a 70,000-square-foot center anchored by a 45,000-square-foot food store. The project is 85 percent preleased, and a life insurance company has agreed to make the permanent loan once the center is built.
The lack of construction financing is the main problem facing the shopping center industry at present, Mr. Maurin said. "Five years ago banks would have been standing in line for this loan," he added. "The deal would have been done in days."
Despite the lean times, Maurin-Ogden has managed to grow. The company owns 3.5 million square feet of retail space and manages an additional 6 million square feet of real estate, including office, apartment and warehouse space, in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Oklahoma.

Fed Rate Cut Not Yet Seen In Yields of Money Funds

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's move to nudge short-term interest rates lower on Tuesday has not yet been reflected in yields of most short-term money market funds, a spokesman for IBC/ Donoghue's Money Fund Report, which monitors the major funds, said yesterday.
Lower rates will eventually show up in the funds as their underlying securities reach maturity and are replaced with ones with lower yields. 
 "Our numbers will not show the excitement of the downtrend earlier this week for at least another week," said Walter S. Frank, chief economist at Donoghue's, in Holliston, Mass.
 
Tax-Exempt Assets Rise
 Donoghue's said total assets of tax-exempt money-market funds rose by $386 milliion, to $88 billion, in the reporting week that ended Monday.
The 30-day average simple yield on tax-free funds was up 9 basis points from the previous week, to 3.77 percent, and the 30-day compounded average yield was up 9 basis points, to 3.84 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The seven-day average simple yield for the tax-exempt funds was 4.04 percent, up 6 basis points from the previous week. The seven-day average compounded yield was also up about 6 points, to 4.12 percent.
For the 14th week in a row, the top-yielding tax-exempt fund was the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, of Milwaukee, distributed by Strong/Cornelison Capital Management Inc. It yielded 5.24 percent on a seven-day compounded basis.
 
Top New York Fund
 The top-yielding tax-exempt fund in New York for the week was the Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compounded return of 4.63 percent, up from 4.5 percent the previous week. The fund has been the top New York fund for many weeks.
For Connecticut investors, the Dreyfus Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund turned had the top seven-day compounded yield, 4.34 percent, up from 4.26.
The New Jersey yield leader was the Calvert Tax-Free Reserve New Jersey Fund, which yielded 5.01 percent in the week, down from 5.09.
 
Higher Taxable Assets
 Assets of the taxable funds rose by $2.65 billion, to $451.4 billion, in the reporting week that ended Tuesday.
The seven-day average yield for taxable funds dropped a basis point in the week, to 5.44 percent, and the seven-day compounded yield was unchanged, at 5.59 percent. The 30-day simple yield was unchanged at 5.46 percent, and the 30-day compounded yield was 5.61 percent, also unchanged. The average maturity rose by 3 days, to 56 days.
The Riverside Capital Money Market Fund of Columbus, Ohio, was the yield leader with a seven-day compounded return of 6.4 percent.
Nationwide, bank yields reported by The Bank Rate Monitor averaged 5.2 percent for money-market accounts and 5.76 for six-month certificates of deposit.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Rail Executive Chosen As Tenneco President

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Michael W. Walsh, the chairman and chief executive of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, will become the president of Tenneco Inc. on Oct. 1 and will later be named chief executive and chairman, Tenneco said yesterday.
Mr. Walsh, who is 49 years old, is a former United States Attorney for the Southern District of California and manager of worldwide operations at the Cummins Engine Company. He had no experience in railroads when he came to Union Pacific in 1986. Still, the railroad was able to increase its earnings to $560 million last year from $322 million in 1985, in part because Mr. Walsh compressed nine layers of management into three, cutting 800 managers. Mr. Walsh also instituted "town meetings" of the railroad's far-flung employees. 
 At Tenneco, the Houston-based conglomerate that includes natural gas pipelines, automotive parts, shipbuilding, packaging, chemicals and minerals, Mr. Walsh's biggest challenge may be the J. I. Case subsidiary, which makes farm equipment.
Ronald J. Barone, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company, said Case was likely to lose $300 million this year. "Returns have been sub-par for many years" at Case, he said, causing Tenneco's book value to decline to $27.68 a share this year, from $37.79 at the end of 1983.
"The stock's up big because a lot of money managers thought Ketelson had a bias, having come up through J. I. Case," said Mr. Barone, referring to James L. Ketelsen, Tenneco's current chairman and chief executive.
But Mr. Walsh, without those ties, would face the question of restructuring or selling Case "with an open mind," Mr. Barone said
Tenneco's shares jumped $3.25 yesterday, closing at $39.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr. Ketelson, 60, will retire as chairman and chief executive in nine months. At Union Pacific, Mr. Walsh will be succeeded by Richard K. Davidson, who is now the railroad's executive vice president for operations.
Mr. Walsh holds a bachelor's degree in economics from Stanford University and a law degree from the Yale Law School. In a telephone interview yesterday, the former public defender, United States Attorney and lawyer in private practice likened law to an addiction and described himself as "a recovering lawyer."
"I don't know that my career path is much of a prototype," he said. "I'm fundamentally interested in industrial businesses, the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. in a global world. Tenneco is one of the few industrial conglomerates, if you will, and I'm really interested in all their businesses."

HEADLINE: Talking Deals;
U.S. Trade Stance Draws Criticism

BYLINE: By Keith Bradsher

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
EVEN by the glacial standards of international trade negotiations, the current round of talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has moved slowly. With the 108-nation talks virtually at a stalemate, there is now a risk that partial agreements -- aimed at reducing international barriers for industries like investment banking -- may unravel.
The impasse has also prompted some Administration and private trade experts to question the United States' wisdom in insisting on the virtual elimination of trade-distorting agricultural subsidies as the key to any deal to liberalize international trade. 
 "We staked out territory that was neither salable nor achievable," said Ronald A. Cass, who was the vice chairman in 1989 and 1990 of the International Trade Commission, an independent Federal agency that analyzes the effects of trade and provides technical advice on negotiations.
"We should have had more modest targets on agriculture," said an Administration official who insisted on anonymity but who said some of his colleagues shared his views. He added that the United States' position was unlikely to change significantly now. Therefore, further clashes with the Europeans seem likely this autumn.
But the public position of the Administration and most economists remains that large-scale reductions in farm subsidies must be included to provide an incentive for less-developed countries to participate in the talks. Industrialized countries want poor countries to protect Western patents and copyrights and to lower their barriers to investment and financial services."Our problems in getting access for our financial institutions in other countries are far less with the U.K. and far more with Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil and Argentina," United States trade representative Carla A. Hills said recently. "And so if you want to keep those countries, the latter group, at the bargaining table, you have to deal with what is of interest to them -- and what is of interest to them is liberalization of agriculture."
Defenders and critics of the Administration acknowledge that the United States commitment to focus on agriculture was made by Mrs. Hills's predecessor, Clayton K. Yeutter, now chairman of the Republican National Committee.
Mr. Yeutter said that seeking extensive changes in world farm policies had been indispensable in winning Congress's support for the negotiations that began in 1986, and had remained the best approach in seeking concessions from the European Community. "If we had asked for half a loaf, we'd be nibbling at 5 percent of a loaf now," he said.
At a news conference last week in Hungary, Mrs. Hills expressed doubt that a deal could be reached this year, Reuters reported. Leaders of the seven leading industrial democracies pledged in London last month to make personal efforts to secure an agreement by the end of the year.
The dispute over the proper place of agriculture is mostly about political feasibility, although it also reflects some philosophical differences over the evolving nature of international trade.
Reducing Europe's agricultural subsidies and ending Japan's ban on imported rice are two ways to increase American food exports quickly. Both steps would provide a nearly immediate benefit to American farmers and to the United States trade balance. But the Administration official who insisted on anonymity said the pursuit of both goals disclosed an American focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term gains.
If the United States had limited its goals to the removal of barriers to international investment and the provision of financial services, it might have won new rules enabling American companies to set up subsidiaries wherever they perceived the potential to compete effectively against local businesses or to produce components cheaply.
Companies and countries increasingly specialize in a few stages of the production of a good or a service. More and more international trade consists of such components instead of commodities or finished goods.
New trade rules, Mr. Cass and other experts say, must call for laws in every country that encourage foreign investment and services, limit the unilateral imposition of import duties and protect foreign patents and copyrights.
But under Mrs. Hills, the Office of the United States Trade Representative has increasingly focused on trade in components.
Mr. Yeutter said that while the dispute over agriculture had been a large obstacle to an agreement for several years, agriculture policy had never been given greater priority than these other goals. "All of these issues received equal prominence," he said.

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS

 BODY:
As one of the first regions to confront weapons cutbacks and develop plans for dealing with them, the St. Louis area is emerging as a national laboratory for the post-cold-war economy.
For many individuals and companies, the rapid change has been bewildering and painful. But St. Louis has responded quickly with government and private efforts to help laid-off workers and further the diversification of the region's economy. 
 Few cities benefited more from the Pentagon's arms buildup during the 1980's than St. Louis, home to the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the nation's largest military contractor. And although it is still too early to say how the big cuts in military spending expected in coming years will affect the region in the long run, the damage so far appears to be less severe than many had expected and the area's economy generally more resilient.
The city's experience is being closely watched in Washington and in areas facing similar problems, like Long Island, Fort Worth, Southern California and eastern Connecticut.
The nation's urban and economic experts say the region has, thus far, done things right. It recognized quickly that it had to act fast and aggressively, seeking to bring in new companies or production operations from outside, placing advertisements elsewhere, making phone calls, training workers in entirely new fields, helping military contracting companies convert to civilian products, seeking Federal funds wherever it could find them.
McDonnell Douglas laid off more than 9,000 workers last year -- nearly a quarter of its local work force -- from its sprawling complex of production lines, research labs and office buildings. Hundreds of subcontractors and other Pentagon suppliers in the area felt the effects.
The crisis was worsened by the timing, as the nation was sinking into recession. Workers and companies found it harder to find new jobs and business opportunties, and the regional economy was jolted by layoffs in other industries, at a Chrysler Corporation plant, for example, and at the Monsanto Company.
The General Dynamics Corporation, the nation's second-largest military contractor, struck another blow recently when it announced that it would move its corporate headquarters from St. Louis to Falls Church, Va., to be closer to its chief customer -- the Pentagon. General Dynamics has no production plants in St. Louis, but the move will cost the city 300 executive and support jobs, not to mention a measure of pride.
These things were simply not supposed to happen in St. Louis. As Mark Serra, a 34-year-old plastics worker, put it: "I got a job at McDonnell Douglas two and a half years ago -- and I figured that was going to be the last job I'd ever have to look for." He is among those laid off, and has given up on finding a good job soon. Instead he has taken a part-time job and has returned to school to get a degree in electrical engineering. "I didn't expect this," he said.
For all the upheaval, though, the situation is not nearly as bad as many economists had first feared.
 
A Nice Surprise
Area Continues To Create Jobs
 "Over all, most people have been pleasantly surprised by how the economy has absorbed the shock so far," said Dennis G. Coleman, executive director of the St. Louis County Economic Council, which is spearheading the efforts by local government agencies to address the problem.
Unemployment in the region jumped from 4.9 percent in June 1990 to 7.3 percent in June of this year, reflecting not just the military-industry layoffs but the recession as well.
Although the rise was steep, it left the region's unemployment rate only slightly higher than the national average of 7 percent. Unemployment so far has not threatened to approach the double-digit rates St. Louis suffered during the recession of the early 1980's.
And the region actually got some good news in July when McDonnell Douglas agreed under pressure from local politicians to transfer some work for the Air Force's new C-17 transport plane from its plant in Long Beach, Calif., to St. Louis. The move could create 1,500 jobs and at the least will offset continuing employment declines expected in the combat-aircraft production known as Mac Air.
 
Housing Market Stable
 The region's housing market has remained relatively stable. Perhaps more important, the economy continues to create jobs, particularly in the service sector. Overall nonagricultural employment in the region last year averaged nearly 1.2 million, an increase from 1989 of nine-tenths of a percent, or 10,200 jobs, the Missouri Division of Employment Security said. The biggest gains have been in health care, reflecting St. Louis's growing role as a center of medical research.
For all the strains, the region has held up well so far, though officials said the worst might not yet be past. "Everything we hear from the Pentagon," Mr. Coleman said, "suggests that they are contemplating significant additional cuts over the next four to five years, and we have to anticipate that that is going to affect the local economy."
The region's cautious approach and continuing efforts to deal with the problem have led Federal officials to cite St. Louis as a model for other cities that want to minimize the economic pain accompanying the cutbacks.
 
Early Solutions
A Head Start Toward Diversity
 "A year ago St. Louis didn't think it had a problem," said Joseph Cartwright, an official with the Pentagon's Office of Economic Adjustment. "Since then the approach in St. Louis has been ideal as far as I can see in that they recognized that ultimately it is up to them to define what their problems are and what they can do about them."
In 1989, 84,688 people, or 3.4 percent of Missouri's work force, were employed in military contracting, most of them in the St. Louis area.
Among the major states, Missouri's dependence on military-related jobs ranked behind only Connecticut (4.7 percent), California (4.1 percent), Washington (3.9 percent) and Massachusetts and Maryland (3.7 percent each), according to the Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan research group in Washington.
St. Louis officials are trying to attract new companies and industries to the area, using everythng from advertising to personal calls from politicians. But the region had somewhat of a head start on its effort to diversify. The number of manufacturing jobs, not only in military contracting but also in autos, barge-building and other ailing industries, has been declining steadily, from 267,900 in 1973 to 223,000 last year, a 16.7 percent decline. Over the same period, the number of service jobs increased from 614,400 to 904,400, a jump of 47 percent. Nationwide, manufacturing jobs declined by 5.2 percent in the period while service sector jobs more than doubled.
"We can do without the defense jobs if we can keep building on the strengths and the diversity we have," said Russell Signorino, an economist with the Missouri Division of Employment Security.
But engineers laid off from warplane programs cannot simply don a stethoscope and become doctors. Skilled metal workers are unlikely to move easily into jobs as X-ray technicians. For many people the diversified economy has not been much help.
So far, St. Louis and its workers have done without help from the primary Federal program to aid communities facing significant cutbacks. Congress last year appropriated $200 million to be spent on economic adjustment around the country over three years. Of the $200 million, $150 million is for worker retraining, with the balance for local economic-diversification strategies.
But the $200 million was tied up in a bureaucratic dispute involving the Pentagon and the Labor and Commerce Departments until June. The economic aid received by St. Louis so far -- primarily a $3.4 million grant from the Labor Department for worker retraining and $150,000 from the Commerce Department for an economic diversification study -- came from the general budgets of those departments.
Some 17,000 McDonnell Douglas workers nationwide and 4,000 in St. Louis lost their jobs last summer. "I was not bitter," said one, Milt Stauss, who is 60 years old. "But I would have liked to work longer."
That first round of layoffs came after Congress and the Pentagon decided to phase out two of the company's biggest programs, the Air Force's F-15 Eagle fighter and the Marine Corps' AV-8B Harrier combat jet. McDonnell Douglas was also being rocked by losses in its California-based transport aircraft division, which builds the MD-80 and MD-11 commercial jetliners and the Air Force's C-17 transport plane.
 
Received 60-Day Notice
 Mr. Stauss was lucky in some ways. After 36 years with the company, working as an engineer on aircraft simulators and other products, he qualified for a sizable pension.
Moreover, the layoffs fell under Federal legislation requiring that workers get a 60-day notice before losing their jobs. In those 60 days, state and local government agencies were able to put into action plans they had been working on with the Federal Government for six months to cope with just such an eventuality. The Pentagon assigned Mr. Cartwright to help, and, working with McDonnell Douglas, officials set up seminars on resume writing and interviewing skills, organizing job fairs and offering stress counseling.
The 60-day notice appeared to work well in allowing a good percentage of employees to find new work before losing their paychecks: Of the more than 4,000 people who lost their jobs in that first round of layoffs at McDonnell Douglas last summer, only 1,500 registered for unemployment benefits, suggesting that most of them found new jobs quickly, Mr. Signorino said.
"They had time to find new jobs at a time when the local economy was still growing slightly," Mr. Signorino said.
It is not clear, however, what kinds of jobs those workers found, or how many of them moved out of the area.
Mr. Stauss, like hundreds of other workers, enrolled in the small-business training course, and went on to start a consulting company with a partner. He has some optimism about his chances of success but is also realistic enough to know that it is too soon to tell whether his new business will make it.
"I can't say whether we're a success or a failure yet," he said.
 
A Second Wave
Dropping the A-12 Brings More Pain
 In January, more bad news for the local military-related industry, even as the nation was poised for war.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney canceled the Navy's A-12 bomber program, saying McDonnell Douglas and its partner on the plane, General Dynamics, had gotten behind schedule and over budget at a time the nation could no longer afford to bail out contractors on troubled programs. Mac Air quickly laid off 5,000 workers in St. Louis, in addition to the 4,000 of the previous summer. Other cutbacks occurred as the year progressed.
Workers laid off in that second wave got fewer breaks. Because the dismissals were the result of a contract cancellation, they were not entitled to 60 days' notice. And by now the recession was tightening.
At present, nearly eight months after the layoffs, as many as 150 unemployed workers a day visit a center at the edge of the sprawling McDonnell Douglas complex set up by the Worker Re-entry Program, administered by St. Louis Community College and supported by government and corporate grants. People are at work there on resumes, making phone calls, signing up for classes, exchanging job leads or simply talking.
 
Better Deal at Chrysler
 For some there is good news. Carla Johns, an industrial engineer, was being congratulated recently for landing a job at an Indiana chemical company. Others stared blankly at computer screens, worried, they said, about being without health insurance or about strains on their marriages. Many expressed frustration and bitterness that local auto workers laid off recently when Chrysler closed down a plant receive nearly two years of pay under their union contract while the McDonnell Douglas workers were already nearing the end of their unemployment benefits after six months.
"If you have car makers that give their employees one, two, three years at 85 or 90 percent of their salaries, then I feel that McDonnell Douglas should have done the same thing," said Frank Hutson, who lost his job in the A-12 layoffs. "If McDonnell Douglas couldn't do it on their own, then the Government should have stepped in and helped."
That kind of frustration, economists and local officials said, is just one indication of how the A-12 workers have not done as well in finding new jobs as those people who were laid off last year.
"Some of them are close to the end of their unemployment benefits and they're beginning to grasp at things," said Jane Boyle, who runs the center. "Unless something turns around in the defense industry, I'm very worried."
Mr. Hutson was laid off after 24 years with McDonnell Douglas, first in personnel and later in designing composite parts for the A-12 program. He is wondering whether he will be able to send his daughter to college next year as he had planned. As the months have passed, he has broadened his job search and lowered his salary expectations, so far with no luck.
"I have to be flexible," he said.
 
Some Fallout
Small Businesses Are Vulnerable
 Part of any diversification effort is luring new industries and companies to the region. But it also means encouraging companies already in the region to develop new products.
McDonnell Douglas is not expected to add much to the diversification effort here. It diversified long ago into commercial-aircraft manufacturing, but most of the work is done in Long Beach and at other locations around the country. McDonnell Douglas recently ruled out building a new commercial jet in St. Louis, a program that might eventually have employed 8,000 workers.
Many economists think helping smaller military contractors is among the region's most pressing priorities. "We've got skillions of machine shops and other small businesses that are vulnerable to downturns in defense and other areas," Fredric Q. Raines, an economics professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said.
 
Products Are Coming
 Some companies in St. Louis have weaned themselves from the Pentagon. Survival Technologies Inc., for example, is the primary supplier of nerve-gas antidote kits to the military; only two years ago 70 percent of its sales were to the Pentagon. Seeing the slowdown coming, the company has developed new products, like an automatic syringe filled with an antidote for bee stings. In its fiscal year ending July 31, it expects 45 percent of its $50 million in sales to have come from commercial customers, despite a surge in Pentagon orders because of the Iraq war. Its manufacturing and research employment has gone from 85 people to 450.
But many of the smaller companies have few obvious opportunities for new markets. Venki Palamand runs the Martak Machine and Tool Company with his father. Martak is tiny as military contractors go. Its annual sales of $300,000 come primarily for spare parts for planes and helicopters. The company's military business has remained healthy so far, but Mr. Palamand said, "If the Government doesn't make the purchases for defense work, I don't know where I'm going to turn."
 
Some Ideas
More Money Is Being Sought
 Some members of Congress are pressing for more money to help the workers, communities and companies.
Representative Ted S. Weiss, a Manhattan Democrat, has called for 1 percent to 2 percent of the Pentagon budget -- roughly $2.9 billion to $5.8 billion -- to be set aside each year to finance adjustment programs. But generally there seems to be little enthusiasm in Congress for any programs that expensive. Most legislative proposals now have a much narrower focus. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut, seeks legislation that would allow smaller military suppliers to set aside earnings tax free each year for investments in new machinery or worker retraining.
Local government officials in St. Louis said it was too soon to know whether the funds available to them would be sufficient for the long haul. But so far, they said, the funds have been adequate. Moreover, Federal officials said, there has been no important demand from other communities and states for additional funds, though that could change as more military bases close and weapons plants scale further back.
"There's no backlog of requests at this point," said Robert N. Colombo, the director of dislocated-worker programs at the Labor Department.

Dollar Up in Light Trading; Gold Prices Post a Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted higher yesterday in light, uneventful trading mainly influenced by profit taking and technical factors. Gold was lower.
Gold slipped 10 cents on New York's Commodity Exchange, finishing at $356.60 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $356.65, 55 cents lower than Tuesday's late quote. 
 The dollar slipped in foreign trading but edged up in domestic dealings as traders consolidated their positions after a selloff on Tuesday brought about by the Federal Reserve's move to lower interest rates.
The dollar ended weakest against the German mark amid wide speculation that the Bundesbank would move next week to raise interest rates.
The Federal Reserve pushed short-term rates down a notch in an effort to reduce important consumer and business rates, with the hope of stimulating borrowing to help the economy.
 
Inflation Fear in Germany
 The German central bank, conversely, was widely expected to try to lift that nation's key 6.5 percent lending rate in an effort to control Germany's inflation rate.
The dollar is generally hurt by lower domestic rates and higher rates overseas because they make dollar-denominated investments less valuable.
"As long as the interest rate environment is fairly positive, the dollar will have a tough time rallying," said Ronald Holzer, chief currency dealer for the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell by 0.68 yen, to 136.00 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 135.80 yen, and in New York it also finished at 136.00 yen, up from 135.50 late Tuesday.
In London, the pound was unchanged at $1.7125, while in New York sterling fell to $1.7130, from $1.7145 on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's, were: 1.7105 German marks, up from 1.7085; 1.4985 Swiss francs, up from 1.4930; 5.8180 French francs, up from 5.8125; 1,280.00 Italian lire, up from 1,279.00, and 1.14705 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4825.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $357 an ounce from $357.75 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, it fell to $356.80, from $357.50 late Tuesday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold dropped $1.42, to $356.96.
Silver rose in New York, finishing up 1.4 cents an ounce, to $3.954, on the Commodity Exchange. It also rose in London, to $3.97, from $3.96 bid late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Lackluster Recovery Depicted in Fed Report

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
The United States so far has seen a "slow, uneven" recovery from the recession with economic prospects dimmed by weak retail sales, lackluster factory demand and rising layoffs of state and local government employees, the Federal Reserve said today.
The Fed's survey of business conditions in July, called the "beige book," painted a picture of a lackluster economic recovery, which the Bush Administration says began in the spring. 
 "According to contacts around the country, national economic conditions continue to improve but at a slow, uneven pace," the Fed report said. "The pickup in home sales in the spring has lost some momentum, and commercial real estate markets and nonresidential construction remain weak."
 
Follows Rate Reduction
 The Fed's generally downbeat review of the economy, prepared by the system's 12 regional banks, was released one day after the central bank pushed down the Federal funds rate. The rate, which banks charge each other on short-term loans, was reduced by a quarter percentage point, to 5.5 percent, to keep the economy from dipping back into recession.
The central bank's move, under pressure from the Bush Administration, touched off a rally on Wall Street Tuesday, but there was no follow-through today.
"We think this is a very good course; it should be helpful to recovery," Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said today.
Top policy makers at the Fed would have had access to the contents of the beige book when they acted Tuesday, although the document was not released until today.
 
Support for More Cuts
 The new survey will provide the basis for discussion by Fed policy makers when they meet on Aug. 20 and is likely to lend support to those who believe rates should be pushed down even more to spur economic demand.
The generally gloomy report was certain to increase fears of a possible double-dip recession, in which weak growth in the April-June quarter would be followed by future declines in the gross national product, as the economy slips back into recession.
The Fed survey found that retail sales, a critical element for any upturn, were actually declining in the New York, Cleveland and Richmond Federal Reserve districts in July, with many other regions reporting either flat sales or slight increases.
 
Some Layoffs Rising
 Some increase in activity was reported by American manufacturers, and widespread factory layoffs seemed to be easing off, the report said. However, the Fed also reported that layoffs were rising at state and local governments caught in budget binds, and among certain service industries. Last Friday, the Government reported that the economy had suffered a surprising loss of 51,000 jobs in July.
The beige book said that demand for business loans remained weak in most districts. In the farming sector, "hot dry weather threatens crops in several regions," it said.
Analysts said the release of today's report strengthened their belief that the central bank would move either later this month or in September to reduce interest rates further, and that banks would follow with reductions in consumer loan rates, including the prime lending rate.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Notes Sell Well At Auction

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Note and bond prices were little changed yesterday as the credit market readily digested a heavy supply of new issues, including $12 billion of 10-year Treasury notes and a flurry of corporate offerings totaling $1.43 billion.
The Treasury notes, the second leg of this week's three-part Treasury financing, totaling $38 billion, sold yesterday at an average yield of 7.94 percent. By late in the day, prices of Treasury notes had improved slightly and the yield on the new notes had fallen to 7.93 percent, down from 7.95 percent a day earlier and well below 8.13 percent a week ago. 
 In advance of today's $12 billion auction of 30-year Treasury bonds, dealers were trading the issue with a yield of about 8.15 percent. The outstanding 8 1/8 percent Treasury notes due in 2021 were offered at 99 12/32, down about 1/8 point, to yield 8.18 percent.
Securities dealers said the 10-year notes sold yesterday attracted good demand from a wide range of domestic investors, including many who had previously held money in lower-yielding securities with shorter maturities. Investors have become more willing to accept the risk of fluctuating prices that is inherent in longer-term issues because the Fed has pushed short-term interest rates down more than four percentage points in the last two years.
Japanese securities firms bid for only 10 to 15 percent of the 10-year issue, a level that would have been disastrous for the market a few years ago. But at a time when domestic demand is strong, the weak foreign participation caused little comment. Treasury data showed that during the first quarter of this year foreign investors increased their holdings of American bonds by only about $1 billion, a small fraction of the increases common in the late 1980's.
Among shorter-term issues, the three-year Treasury notes auctioned on Tuesday were trading yesterday with a yield of 6.90 percent, down from an average of 6.92 percent on Tuesday.
With interest rates on three-month Treasury bills down to 5.38 percent and 30-day commercial paper of good-quality companies at 5.60 percent, the loss of yield to investors in short-term securities has become acute.
 
Uneven Recovery Seen
 Expectations of low inflation a sluggish economic recovery and continued low short-term interest rates were reinforced yesterday when the Federal Reserve released a report of business conditions compiled by the 12 district Fed banks around the country during June and July. The report said the economy was recovering from recession at a slow and uneven pace.
Analysts at Ried, Thunberg & Company, an economic advisory firm, noted that the report probably encouraged the Fed to reduce short-term interest rates on Tuesday. While the report was optimistic that the economy would improve, it confirmed that current conditions were lackluster.
The recent decline in bond yields, plus reports from securities dealers that there was good investor demand for longer-term issues that were protected from early redemption, enticed several corporate treasurers to come to market with new securities. Yesterday's large new offerings of long-term issues included $400 million by Boeing, with a yield of 8.8 percent and a 2021 maturity, while a $300 million issue of the American Express Company was offered with a 8.65 percent yield and a 2001 maturity. A $250 million 40-year issue by the Mobil Corporation was offered at 8.72 percent. Other issues included $225 million by Pacific Bell, yielding 8.90 percent, to 2031; $150 million by Caterpillar at 9.43 percent, to 2011, and Dayton Hudson's $100 million, at 9.31 percent, to 2011.
Analysts also said that demand for Treasury issues and noncallable corporate bonds was good from investors who had been holding mortgage-backed securities. Although those securities yield roughly a percentage point more than 10-year Treasury notes, they do not have the potential for significant price increases if interest rates decline because of the risk that homeowners will refinance their mortgages, resulting in the prepayment of the mortgage-backed securities.
