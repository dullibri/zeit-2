HEADLINE: An Addition to the List of Tax Loopholes

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Day traders and speculators who quickly buy and sell futures contracts have been receiving more favorable tax treatment than those who trade stocks. 

 BODY:
As the White House and Congress wrangle over raising the debt ceiling and reducing the federal deficit, tax loopholes would seem to be an easy target for compromise.
President Obama has talked about eliminating breaks for partners at hedge funds and private equity firms - along with corporate jet owners, oil companies and others taking advantage of quirks in the tax codes.
Here's another little-known group of tax code beneficiaries that he might want to add to the list: day traders and speculators who buy and sell futures contracts.
For years, futures contracts, which are essentially bets on the price of commodities, stock indexes and the like, have received a more favorable tax treatment than stocks. A trader who buys and sells an oil contract in less than a year - even in a matter of minutes - pays no more than a 23 percent tax on the profits.
Compare that with the bill for flipping shares of Google, General Electric or even a diversified mutual fund in the same time period. Those short-term investment gains are treated like ordinary income, meaning the rate can run as high as 35 percent.
"There are so many ways to attack the logic of it," Warren E. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, said in an interview on Monday about of the futures tax break. "It doesn't make sense."
What does the tax loophole cost the federal government? Each year, the United States gives up roughly $2 billion in lost revenue, according to the Congressional Research Service, a federal agency.
That number may seem insignificant against the backdrop of the country's $55 trillion in federal, state and local government debt. But tax inequities like this start to add up when considered collectively. Based on data from the Office of Management and Budget, the United States could put another $20 billion in its coffers over 10 years if it taxed the investment gains of hedge funds and private equity executives as ordinary income. The so-called carried interest is treated like capital gains, which is taxed at a much lower rate. The corporate jet break amounts to about $2 billion to $3 billion in a decade.
Perhaps the tax break on futures contracts wouldn't be so irksome if it simply helped farmers protecting the value of their corn crops, airlines dealing with the rising cost of oil or even individuals hedging the risks in their portfolio.
But the biggest beneficiaries seem to be day traders and speculators. Long-term investors account for only 20 percent of the activity in the commodities future market, according to a report published last week by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the industry regulator.
When I called Robert Green, a tax specialist whose clients include traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the hub of commodities futures contracts, he seemed genuinely taken aback.
"I've been dreading getting a call like this," he said, apparently worried that any publicity of the tax break could put pressure on lawmakers to revisit the rule. "No one has shot something across the bow."
Still, he acknowledged that it would be hard for President Obama to justify lower tax rates "to benefit futures traders and commodities exchanges in his home state, while pushing hard to raise taxes on securities hedge fund managers - often in Connecticut and New York City."
The genesis of the tax break on futures goes back to 1981, when the government tried to close another tax loophole. At the time, some big investors were using the contracts to skirt taxes by creating what was called a straddle transaction, which allowed investors to roll over their profits into the next year. So a rule was written that forced traders to mark their positions to market and pay taxes on unrealized gains.
In an effort to appease the investment community, a break was offered by Dan Rostenkowski, a Democrat from Chicago who was then the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and later went to prison for corruption. In part, the break was meant to offset the risks associated with paying taxes on paper profits. He persuaded Congress that traders should pay a blended rate, paying 60 percent of the long-term capital gains rate and 40 percent of the ordinary income rate. Today, the combination amounts to about 23 percent, assuming the top tax bracket for ordinary income is 35 percent and the long-term capital gains rate is 15 percent.
The break has been on the chopping block in recent years. In his budget proposals for 2010 and 2011, President Obama recommended ending the special tax treatment for dealers of futures contracts, although not for all investors. But the plans lost momentum and neither was incorporated into the final budgets.
Eric J. Toder, an economist at the Tax Policy Center, a research organization, said that the tax break might have made sense a generation ago when the market was mainly investors protecting their long-term profits. But with speculators betting on short-term price movements, the loophole is just that - a loophole.
"It seemed like a reasonable compromise at the time to stop the straddle transactions," Mr. Toder said. "In retrospect, if the trading is so short term, it seems a little silly to give them preferential treatment."
The DealBook column on Tuesday, about a tax break for buyers and sellers of futures contracts, referred imprecisely to the United States' debt. "The country's $55 trillion debt load" cited in the column includes state and local government debt; that is not the amount of federal debt, which stands at about $14 trillion.

HEADLINE: The Magic Lever

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The world economy is a complex, unknowable organism. Most of us try to diversify our investments and balance risk and security to protect against the unexpected.
But a few years ago a group of bankers thought they had the magic tool to help them master financial trends and predict the future. Sophisticated risk assessment models would enable them to rewrite the rules and make more money.
Their arrogance was soon exposed. Along came the financial crisis. 
In the middle of the crisis another group emerged, believing it had the magic lever to alter the economy's trajectory. Democrats argued that through gigantic deficit spending, they could bring unemployment rates down sharply and produce a ''summer of recovery.''
The spending they began must have done some good to cushion the recession, but either through a failure of theory or a failure of implementation, their lever was not as powerful as they promised. Federal spending rose from 19.38 to 24.91 percent of gross domestic product, but the economy refused to rebound and the world is awash in oceans of debt.
Now a third group has emerged, also claiming that it has the magic lever to control the economy. Staunch Republicans argue that taxes are central to determining economic growth. Tax cuts, they argue, have huge positive benefits and tax increases have disastrous negative effects.
In the middle of the current budget negotiations, these Republicans argue that the tax increases the Democrats are proposing -- ending some deductions for the affluent, hitting oil and gas companies -- would be terrible for the economy. These unacceptable increases would be worse than the threat of national default, worse than a decade of gigantic deficits.
Not many Americans have this expansive view on the power of tax policy. According to the Gallup Organization, only 20 percent of Americans believe the budget deal should consist of spending cuts only. Even among Republicans, a plurality believes there should be a mixture of tax increases and spending cuts.
Yet the G.O.P. is now oriented around this 20 percent. It is willing to alienate 80 percent of voters and commit political suicide because of its faith in the power of tax policy.
These three groups -- bankers, Democratic Keynesians and staunch Republicans -- have one thing in common: They all believe they have identified the magic lever. They believe they can control their economic fate.
Some of us do not believe there is a magic lever. Deficit spending stimulates growth, but not by that much. Tax increases are bad, but they are not disastrous. We believe that there are a thousand factors that go into economic growth, and no single one is dispositive.
We look at the tax cuts of 2001 and do not see tremendous gains. We look at the tax increase of 1982 and do not see a ruinous disaster. We look at high deficit eras and low deficit eras and do not see an easy correlation between deficit spending and growth. On the contrary, if you look around the world there's a slight negative correlation between government size and prosperity.
We believe that if you rest everything on a single lever (Increase deficits! Cut taxes!), you give people a permission slip to be self-indulgent. They will spend or cut to their hearts' content and soon you'll be facing national bankruptcy. We believe that even if you are theoretically right, your policies will be distorted by human frailties and special interests.
The people in my group (you might call us conservatives) are more likely to embrace a low and steady approach to fiscal policy. Control debt. Control entitlements. Keep tax levels reasonable and the tax code simple. Work on the economic fundamentals: human capital, productivity, labor market flexibility, open trade, saving and investment. Don't believe you can use magic levers to manipulate growth month to month.
People in my camp form a silent majority. But we have been astonishingly passive during these budget negotiations. The tax cut brigades and the Medicare/Spending brigades are well organized. The people who believe in balance and the fundamentals sit piously on the sidelines.
The tragedy is that in Barack Obama and John Boehner we have leaders who would like to do something big. They seem to know that you need bipartisan cover if you want to really cut spending. They seem to know circumstances for deficit reduction will only get worse in the years ahead.
But they are bracketed on all sides -- by the tax cut and Medicare brigades, by the wonks hatching budget gimmicks that erode trust, by political hacks who don't want to lose their precious campaign issues: tax cuts forever, Medicare spending without limit.
Mostly, they are buffeted by the proud, by those who think they have a magic lever to control human destiny and who will not compromise it away. This is the oldest story known to man.

HEADLINE: Global Markets Tumble on Continued Worries Over Europe's Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Financial and energy companies took a beating on Wall Street on Monday as stocks in the United States followed global markets lower on concerns about the euro zone debt crisis.
Markets in the United States were in line with Asian and European stocks, which fell as investors remained overwhelmed by weak economic data, and European officials met in Brussels to discuss fiscal troubles in the euro zone.
After weeks of uncertainty related to bailouts for Greece, the Italian authorities moved to rein in short-selling on the Milan stock exchange as fears mounted that Italy could become the next victim of the sovereign debt crisis. 
''There is so much going on in the world that you almost need a scorecard to keep up,'' Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company, wrote in a research note.
''If Italy becomes more of a problem, then it could spiral out of control and cause the much-feared contagion that some have predicted,'' Mr. Giddis wrote. ''If that is the case, then a global economic slowdown will likely hit our shores here and take the legs out of an already wounded U.S. economy.''
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 151.44 points, or 1.20 percent, to 12,505.76. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 24.31 points, or 1.81 percent, to 1,319.49. The Nasdaq composite lost 57.19 points, or 2.00 percent, to 2,802.62.
Even after Monday's losses, however, the Nasdaq and the Dow still rose about 1 percent since July 1, while the S.& P. was slightly lower.
On the broader market in the United States, financial shares were down almost 3 percent, while energy and materials indexes were lower by more than 2 percent.
Brian M. Youngberg, an energy analyst for Edward Jones, said the dollar rise connected with the events in the euro zone was putting downward pressure on oil prices, which in turn was affecting energy stocks. ''Everything is revolving around Europe right now in some way,'' he said.
Citigroup fell 5.3 percent to $39.79; JPMorgan Chase declined 3.2 percent to $39.43, and Bank of America was down 3.27 percent at $10.35.
Google shares fell 0.89 percent to $527.28.
Alcoa was down 2.87 percent at $15.91; Caterpillar fell 2.04 percent to $108.16, and Boeing was down 2.29 percent at $73.35.
As risk aversion stepped up on Monday, United States Treasuries were trading higher. The euro fell to $1.4027 from $1.4204.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 28/32, to 101 23/32, and the yield fell to 2.92 percent, from 3.03 percent late Friday.
''Global issues are still outstanding,'' said Jason Arnold, a financial analyst with RBC Capital Markets. ''Markets were still digesting the jobs numbers from Friday, so I think that it is also a factor.'' Asian markets, in particular, reacted to the United States government report that just 18,000 jobs were added in June.
In Europe, the Milan Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent on Monday. The FTSE in London was down 1.03 percent, the CAC in Paris was down 2.71 percent and the DAX in Frankfurt was down 2.33 percent.
Another weight on sentiment was the report over the weekend that inflation in China had reached a three-year high.
''It is kind of like this cocktail of disappointing information and data,'' said Stephen Wood, chief market strategist for Russell Investments.
William J. Schultz, chief investment officer for McQueen, Ball & Associates, said that the debt ceiling talks and euro zone problems in particular ''put this tone'' to the market.
But he and other market analysts are pinning their hopes on the coming corporate reporting season for the second quarter.
''Those things are weighing, and now the hope is we are going to get earnings surprises on the positive side,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Sharing the Wealth and Living Large in a Tiny Chinese Village

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES; Jonathan Kaiman contributed research.

 BODY:
HUAXI, China -- Ask not why the citizens of this village of 2,000, a few hours by car northwest of Shanghai, have built a 74-story skyscraper next to their prim town square. Everybody in China knows the answer: it is another step in their plan to create the communist utopia envisioned by Mao.
The utopia part certainly seems plausible. Whether Mao would have approved is a bit more in doubt.
Huaxi's so-called New Village in the Sky -- at 1,076 feet, a bit taller than the Chrysler Building in Manhattan -- is getting finishing touches this summer in preparation for an October opening. Among other attractions, it will have a five-star hotel, a gold-leaf-embellished concert hall, an upscale shopping mall and what is billed as Asia's largest revolving restaurant. Also, it will have five life-size statues of a water buffalo, Huaxi's symbol, on every 12th floor or so. 
That this half-billion-dollar edifice is a good 40-minute drive from a city of any size is part of the plan. For though not many foreigners have heard of Huaxi, Chinese far and wide know it as the socialist collective that works -- the village where public ownership of the means of production has not just made everyone equal, but rich, too.
Two million tourists come annually to view the Huaxi marvel, no small number of them officials from other villages who yearn to know how Huaxi did it. The enormous skyscraper, topped with a gigantic gold sphere, will never win architectural awards. But it will add to Huaxi's allure, the village fathers confidently predict -- and soak up tourist money as well.
''We call it the three-increase building,'' said Wu Renbao, 84, the town's revered patriarch, meaning that it will increase Huaxi's acreage (by half), increase its work force (by 3,000) and, hardly least of all, increase its wealth.
If he is right, all 2,000 villagers will get a little richer. They all own a piece of the building -- just as they own the town's steel mill, textile factory, greenhouse complex, ocean shipping company and other ventures. That is Huaxi's carefully curated narrative: by rigidly adhering to socialism with Chinese characteristics, the citizens of this little village have created an oasis of prosperity and comfort that is the envy of the world.
When China effectively embraced capitalism in the 1980s, Huaxi was an agrarian hovel, reachable by dirt roads. Mr. Wu, then the local Communist Party secretary, seized on the new market freedoms to shift the Huaxi economy from farming to manufacturing and trade, but with a twist: the residents would throw their money into a collective pot and share in the take from whatever new businesses they bought.
''In the 30 years after the opening up, the system changed in many places,'' Mr. Wu's son, Wu Xie'en, said in a recent interview. ''Some chose private ownership, but we Huaxi people chose public ownership. The biggest benefit is that the people share the common prosperity.''
That Huaxi is prosperous seems undeniable. Here, the villagers get lavish annual stipends, live in spacious single-family homes instead of China's usual cramped apartments, drive imported cars, and get basic medical care, education and even an annual vacation free from the government. Lately they also get free helicopter rides, courtesy of a 100 million renminbi, or $15.5 million, fleet of helicopters and small jets the village is buying to attract still more sightseers.
Ge Xiufang, now 62, was a penniless peasant in a northern area of Jiangsu Province when her newly graduated son began looking for work in the early 1990s. ''He saw an ad in the paper calling for workers to come to Huaxi,'' she said. ''So we came here, and two years later, we became villagers.''
That was in 1993, before Huaxi took off. Ms. Ge was interviewed in her son's house, a two-story building with marble floors, overstuffed leather sofas, a large aquarium and a liquor cabinet dominated by an enormous bottle of expensive Scotch. Ms. Ge said she and her husband live in a sprawling town house a few blocks away and shuttle between homes in one of the family's three cars.
''We peasants, we didn't even have apartment buildings in those days,'' she said. ''We had no idea it would be this good.''
The elder Mr. Wu extols Huaxi's splendor -- and the Beijing government's wisdom and foresight -- in a lengthy lecture given each morning in an auditorium packed with hundreds of tourists. To hammer the message home, there follows a musical, a sort of Chinese opera with Disney characteristics and toe-tapping lyrics:
Where we live: garden, house, little Western-style mansion
What we eat: a food culture full of nutrition
What we wear: big brand names of fashion
and
Huaxi is rich in substance, politics and spirit
One American guest said, ''O.K., O.K,
Socialism is so good, we Americans want it, too!''
Yet what is branded as socialism looks from the outside a great deal like an old-fashioned capitalist corporation, apparently savvily managed, with 2,000 shareholders who live comfortably off their dividends. Indeed, Huaxi's affairs are run by a company, the Jiangsu Huaxi Group Corporation, reported to shelter 57 subsidiaries, including seven more holding companies. The town has interests in everything from extruded aluminum to traditional medicine to spun polyester cloth to real estate.
''We have too many investments to count,'' said the younger Mr. Wu, the chief executive of the enterprise, which is said on several Web sites to be managed by members of the Wu family. He said he spends his days worrying about investment bubbles, and sprinkles his conversation with references to business advice gleaned at the University of California, Berkeley, and from studies of General Electric's business model.
Mr. Wu's claims of success are hard to verify, because the conglomerate's revenue and earnings are not disclosed in an audited form. Published but unverified reports indicate that the corporation employs at least 25,000 people, many of whom live in the urban area of about 30,000 that exists outside Huaxi's cramped legal boundaries. A 2009 report in a state-run newspaper said annual revenue totaled 50 billion renminbi, about $7.7 billion at current exchange rates.
Village leaders have denied persistent reports that Huaxi benefits from substantial government subsidies like low-interest loans, although the younger Mr. Wu said in an interview that some of the village's ventures are financed by debt that amounts to as much as 60 percent of their value.
While each villager is required to work at a Huaxi business seven days a week, virtually all the manual labor is performed by what Marx might have called the proletariat: thousands of outside workers, many of them migrants, who receive better salaries and benefits than many workers elsewhere, but do not share in Huaxi's profits. For that, one needs a hukou, or residence permit -- and Huaxi hands those out with great care.
''This is called exploitation,'' said Fei-Ling Wang, a Georgia Tech professor who has studied Huaxi as part of research into Jiangsu Province villages. ''Because the outside workers, by law, cannot become a local resident. They cannot share the results of their works. And they are paid by wages, and if they lost their job, they are simply sent home.
''If all migrant workers are treated as full members of the community,'' Professor Wang said, ''then Huaxi wouldn't work.''
The two Wus allow that the village has yet been unable to shed capitalism, but they insist that Huaxi has moved to a higher level of socialism than China at large, and that utopia is a matter of time. ''Huaxi's development depends on capitalism and business,'' the elder Mr. Wu said. But ''capitalism is only a temporary stage. Eventually, we will build Chinese socialism with Chinese characteristics.''
To Huaxi's 2,000 shareholders, it may be a distinction without a difference as long as the profits keep rolling in. Mr. Wu says they will: in three decades, he insists, not one business venture has gone sour. To Huaxi's cautious villagers, he said, investing is ''like stepping on sea ice.''
Will a 74-story building in the middle of nowhere crack the ice? Not likely, the Wus say: why, just in the last year, one of the building's water buffalos has grown in value by 70 million renminbi, or about $10.7 million.
That would be the buffalo destined for the 74th floor. The one cast in solid gold.

A performance of song, dance and acrobats extolling the achievements of Huaxi, population 2,000, is put on every morning, for busloads of visitors. The local steel factory is Huaxi's largest enterprise and among its oldest. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY SIM CHI YIN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) MAPS: Two million tourists a year come to explore Huaxi.

HEADLINE: Drought Spreads Pain From Florida to Arizona

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON and KIRK JOHNSON; Kim Severson reported from Colquitt, Ga., and Kirk Johnson from Denver. Dan Frosch contributed reporting from Denver.

 BODY:
COLQUITT, Ga. -- The heat and the drought are so bad in this southwest corner of Georgia that hogs can barely eat. Corn, a lucrative crop with a notorious thirst, is burning up in fields. Cotton plants are too weak to punch through soil so dry it might as well be pavement.
Farmers with the money and equipment to irrigate are running wells dry in the unseasonably early and particularly brutal national drought that some say could rival the Dust Bowl days.
''It's horrible so far,'' said Mike Newberry, a Georgia farmer who is trying grow cotton, corn and peanuts on a thousand acres. ''There is no description for what we've been through since we started planting corn in March.'' 
The pain has spread across 14 states, from Florida, where severe water restrictions are in place, to Arizona, where ranchers could be forced to sell off entire herds of cattle because they simply cannot feed them.
In Texas, where the drought is the worst, virtually no part of the state has been untouched. City dwellers and ranchers have been tormented by excessive heat and high winds. In the Southwest, wildfires are chewing through millions of acres.
Last month, the United States Department of Agriculture designated all 254 counties in Texas natural disaster areas, qualifying them for varying levels of federal relief. More than 30 percent of the state's wheat fields might be lost, adding pressure to a crop in short supply globally.
Even if weather patterns shift and relief-giving rain comes, losses will surely head past $3 billion in Texas alone, state agricultural officials said.
Most troubling is that the drought, which could go down as one of the nation's worst, has come on extra hot and extra early. It has its roots in 2010 and continued through the winter. The five months from this February to June, for example, were so dry that they shattered a Texas record set in 1917, said Don Conlee, the acting state climatologist.
Oklahoma has had only 28 percent of its normal summer rainfall, and the heat has blasted past 90 degrees for a month.
''We've had a two- or three-week start on what is likely to be a disastrous summer,'' said Kevin Kloesel, director of the Oklahoma Climatological Survey.
The question, of course, becomes why. In a spring and summer in which weather news has been dominated by epic floods and tornadoes, it is hard to imagine that more than a quarter of the country is facing an equally daunting but very different kind of natural disaster.
From a meteorological standpoint, the answer is fairly simple. ''A strong La Nina shut off the southern pipeline of moisture,'' said David Miskus, who monitors drought for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The weather pattern called La Nina is an abnormal cooling of Pacific waters. It usually follows El Nino, which is an abnormal warming of those same waters.
Although a new forecast from the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center suggests that this dangerous weather pattern could revive in the fall, many in the parched regions find themselves in the unlikely position of hoping for a season of heavy tropical storms in the Southeast and drenching monsoons in the Southwest.
Climatologists say the great drought of 2011 is starting to look a lot like the one that hit the nation in the early to mid-1950s. That, too, dried a broad part of the southern tier of states into leather and remains a record breaker.
But this time, things are different in the drought belt. With states and towns short on cash and unemployment still high, the stress on the land and the people who rely on it for a living is being amplified by political and economic forces, state and local officials say. As a result, this drought is likely to have the cultural impact of the great 1930s drought, which hammered an already weakened nation.
''In the '30s, you had the Depression and everything that happened with that, and drought on top,'' said Donald A. Wilhite, director of the school of natural resources at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln and former director of the National Drought Mitigation Center. ''The combination of those two things was devastating.''
Although today's economy is not as bad, many Americans ground down by prolonged economic insecurity have little wiggle room to handle the effects of a prolonged drought. Government agencies are in the same boat.
''Because we overspent, the Legislature overspent, we've been cut back and then the drought comes along and we don't have the resources and federal government doesn't, and so we just tighten our belt and go on,'' said Donald Butler, the director of the Arizona Department of Agriculture.
The drought is having some odd effects, economically and otherwise.
''One of the biggest impacts of the drought is going to be the shrinking of the cattle herd in the United States,'' said Bruce A. Babcock, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University in Ames. And that will have a paradoxical but profound impact on the price of a steak.
Ranchers whose grass was killed by drought cannot afford to sustain cattle with hay or other feed, which is also climbing in price. Their response will most likely be to send animals to slaughter early. That glut of beef would lower prices temporarily.
But America's cattle supply will ultimately be lower at a time when the global supply is already low, potentially resulting in much higher prices in the future.
There are other problems. Fishing tournaments have been canceled in Florida and Mississippi, just two of the states where low water levels have kept recreational users from lakes and rivers. In Texas, some cities are experiencing blackouts because airborne deposits of salt and chemicals are building up on power lines, triggering surges that shut down the system. In times of normal weather, rain usually washes away the environmental buildup. Instead, power company crews in cities like Houston are being dispatched to spray electrical lines.
In this corner of Georgia, where temperatures have been over 100 and rainfall has been off by more than half, fish and wildlife officials are worried over the health of the shinyrayed pocketbook and the oval pigtoe mussels, both freshwater species on the endangered species list.
The mussels live in Spring Creek, which is dangerously low and borders Terry Pickle's 2,000-acre farm here. He pulls his irrigation from wells that tie into the water system of which Spring Creek is a part.
Whether nature or agriculture is to blame remains a debate in a state that for 20 years has been embroiled in a water war with Alabama and Florida. Meanwhile, Colquitt has allowed the state to drill a special well to pump water back into the creek to save the mussels from extinction.
Most farmers here are much more worried about the crops than the mussels. With cotton and corn prices high, they had high hopes for the season. But many have had to replant fields several times to get even one crop to survive. Others, like Mr. Pickle, have relied on irrigation so expensive that it threatens to eat into any profits.
The water is free, but the system used to get it from the ground runs on diesel fuel. His bill for May and June was an unheard of $88,442.
Thousands of small stories like that will all contribute to the ultimate financial impact of the drought, which will not be known until it is over. And no one knows when that will be.
The United States Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency has already provided over $75 million in assistance to ranchers nationwide, with most of it going to Florida, New Mexico and Texas. An additional $62 million in crop insurance indemnities have already been provided to help other producers.
Economists say that adding up the effects of drought is far more complicated than, say, those of a hurricane or tornado, which destroy structures that have set values. With drought, a shattered wheat or corn crop is a loss to one farmer, and it has a specific price tag. But all those individual losses punch a hole in the food supply and drive prices up. That is good news for a farmer who manages to get a crop in. The final net costs down the line are thus dispersed, and mostly passed along.
That means grocery shoppers will feel the effects of the drought at the dinner table, where the cost of staples like meat and bread will most likely rise, said Michael J. Roberts, an associate professor of agricultural and resource economics at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, N.C. ''The biggest losers are consumers,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Unions Say City Opera Offer Would Gut Chorus and Orchestra

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
A day before New York City Opera was to announce its first post-Lincoln Center season, the company's unions charged on Monday that the company had made proposals for a new contract that would gut the chorus and the orchestra, and turn the ''people's opera'' into a freelance outfit.
The unions released City Opera's terms, which call for ending guaranteed weeks of work and number of members, It would eliminate vacation pay, tenure, leaves and the current health insurance plans. In addition, instrument insurance -- an important perk paid for by American orchestras -- would stop. 
Choristers and orchestra players would be paid only by the rehearsal and performance. The proposals promise that members of the chorus and orchestra rosters would be given preference for future jobs.
''It's devastating,'' said Gail Kruvand, the chairwoman of the orchestra's negotiating committee. ''It essentially eliminates the orchestra as we know it.''
The union officials said it was too early to respond with proposals.
The company has long been living beyond its means. The general manager and artistic director, George Steel, and the board chairman, Charles Wall, have said major cuts are needed to reduce fixed costs, like those for the labor force. They decided to move the company from its longtime home, the David H. Koch Theater (formerly called the New York State Theater), as another way of saving money.
Company officials did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. However, a spokeswoman, Maggie McKeon, issued a statement saying: ''In light of a challenging economic climate, New York City Opera created and is executing a very difficult, but strategic new model that reverses a decadelong trend of debilitating deficits. As negotiations continue, New York City Opera will remain acting in good faith to find the best solution for everyone involved.''
Contracts for the orchestra and chorus expired in the spring, but the terms remain in effect. The unions, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians and the American Guild of Musical Artists, had said they expected City Opera to seek to dilute the contracts severely after the company announced in May that it was leaving Lincoln Center and cutting its budget to $13 million -- down from $31 million.
Local 802 represents the orchestra, and the guild represents the chorus, singers, stage managers and assistant directors.
''Steel's made it clear he wants to work the way he wants to work,'' said Alan S. Gordon, the guild's executive director. ''It's a way to have a contract without having a contract. It's complying with their legal obligation to bargain but having no real intent to employ a lot of people under this.''
The orchestra numbers 69 contracted members, but has 10 openings. Under the expired contract, members were guaranteed 22 weeks of work a year, with a base pay of $38,000.
This serves as a base for most of the players, who work other freelance jobs or teach. The 32 choristers are guaranteed 26 weeks of work and also earn under $40,000 a year.
Under the proposal, orchestra members would receive $345.05 per performance and $61.80 per rehearsal hour, higher than the typical freelance pay in New York. No limit would be placed on the length of a rehearsal. For choristers, the rates would be $230.20 and $32.28.
The proposals, according to the unions, call for the elimination of the need for orchestra approval to play anywhere but Lincoln Center and City Center. Instead of the health benefit plans, the company would make contributions based on an employee's earnings to a separate fund for the chorus and contribute to the Local 802 health insurance fund, the unions said.
On Tuesday, Mr. Steel plans to announce next season's program, although some details have emerged. The company will perform Verdi's ''Traviata'' and Rufus Wainwright's ''Prima Donna'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music; Mozart's ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' at the theater at John Jay College; and a Telemann opera at the Museo del Barrio. A news conference is planned for a Guggenheim Museum auditorium.
The unions have undertaken a public campaign denouncing the move and Mr. Steel's leadership. They promised to protest outside the museum before the news conference. Scores of prominent singers, directors and others in the opera world have also denounced the move out of Lincoln Center.

HEADLINE: The Long Pursuit of Justice in Lebanon: No matter what Hezbollah says, the men accused of Rafik Hariri's murder must be arrested

 BODY:
An international tribunal has called on Lebanon's government to arrest four suspects indicted in the 2005 car-bomb killing of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and 21 others. All four of the accused are members of Hezbollah, the militant Shiite movement whose cynical mix of politics and armed intimidation helped bring Prime Minister Najib Mikati to power. 
Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, vows the four will never be turned over for trial. Mr. Mikati has a legal duty to arrest them. He claims to be politically independent of Hezbollah. This is the perfect chance to prove it.
Carrying out these arrests will require extraordinary political courage. Failure to do so would cost Lebanon dearly, threatening its civil peace and leaving no doubt that the real powers in Lebanon are Hezbollah and its backers in Syria.
The reverberations of Mr. Hariri's murder have rocked Lebanon for the past six years, threatening its recovery from the disastrous 1975-1990 civil war. Mr. Hariri was a symbol of that recovery. Popular fury over his killing helped force out Syrian occupation troops. But the failure to bring his killers to justice has revived the bitter mistrust among Lebanon's main confessional groups -- Sunnis, Shiites, Christians and Druse -- opening the way for Hezbollah's alarming rise.
Other countries have important roles to play in urging Mr. Mikati to turn over the indicted suspects. That goes especially for members of the United Nations Security Council, whose authority stands behind the international tribunal. The United States, the European Union and Russia have issued helpful statements. Saudi Arabia and Egypt have spoken less emphatically. All need to raise their voices in the weeks ahead.
Lebanon has until early August to arrest the four men. If it does not, the international tribunal has the authority to try them in absentia. If convicted, they would become international outlaws, subject to future arrest and punishment. Any Lebanese government that continued to shelter them could be subjected to international sanctions, including suspensions of economic assistance. Lebanon should do its duty now, and arrest the four indicted suspects and turn them over to the tribunal.

HEADLINE: In New Jersey, Ally One Day, 'Punk' the Next

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com

 BODY:
TRENTON -- Stephen M. Sweeney, the State Senate president, is a brawny man with a pug's face, and a natty pink tie-and-suspender combo. He leans back in his leather chair as he considers my question:
You still want to punch out Gov. Chris Christie? 
The Democrat offers an almost sheepish smile. ''As vindictive as he was? As mean as he was? I acknowledge my response was over the top, but no apologies.''
I try another tack: You described the governor to the Star-Ledger columnist Tom Moran as a ''bully and a punk.'' (He also called the governor a male organ, though he used a more evocative term.)
Any regrets?
''Christie zeroed out Camden in the budget -- he's forcing 'em into bankruptcy,'' Mr. Sweeney says. ''He's taken hostages and he's shooting them. You wonder what he's doing.''
My wonderment extends beyond just the governor. The fascination of New Jersey politics is that nothing can be taken at face value, not the least the crafty politician who sits in front of me.
New Jersey is a high-income state, with a well-educated populace. But its politics are purely medieval. The mind wanders by way of analogy to early King John, minus the poisoning and defenestration of rivals.
County bosses rule fiefs with an unforgiving eye. Many politicians sit on multiple public, union and politically connected private payrolls -- Assembly Speaker Sheila Y. Oliver, a Democrat, works on the staff of the Essex County executive, Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr.
Alliances are Borgia-like: Slap a back one day, slip a shiv into the ribs the next.
Just two weeks ago, Mr. Sweeney and the governor cooed like well-fed lovebirds. Mr. Sweeney had gutted and cleaned the public unions, reducing health and pension benefits, and the governor could not say enough nice things about bipartisan comity. (In fairness -- a wuss word in New Jersey politics -- Mr. Sweeney championed paring benefits long ago.) Then Mr. Sweeney, aware that liberal Democrats wished to see his head affixed to a pike, donned a revolutionary tunic. He championed taxes on the rich, and money for schools and legal services.
The governor decided after careful deliberation to lay waste to Mr. Sweeney's proposed budget. He hacked at universities, income-tax credits and health coverage. He all but wiped out aid for some cities. Then he took off his smock, affixed his signature and pronounced himself done.
At which point Mr. Sweeney threatened to go upside the governor's head.
All of this would be entertaining in a Tony-Soprano-versus-the-Medici fashion, but the stakes are dire. The governor regularly insists that he can ''feel'' the economy picking up, but that's not evident. Revenue is climbing, but so is the unemployment rate. Job growth has slowed.
These blustering warriors are marching into the realm of real consequences. Camden, a shipwreck by the Delaware, already cut nearly half its police force.
Newark and Trenton are wounded, too, and the toll is not abstract. There were 311 violent crimes per 100,000 residents in New Jersey in 2009. In Camden, the rate was a startling 2,380 per 100,000. (Newark's City Council voted last week to require small restaurants to have armed security guards after 9 p.m.)
I took a drive last week past the tenements that lap almost to the door of the State Capitol and to a pleasant neighborhood on a hill. Two middle-aged contractors, lifelong Trenton residents, considered their city's plight.
''It's already bad, let's say that, O.K.?'' said Wally Lance.
His friend Clevester Blackstone nodded. ''It boils to this: In this state, poor cities don't exist.''
That invisibility is palpable, and made more acute by the silence of the putative leaders. Camden's mayor, Dana L. Redd, did not return calls asking about the governor's cuts.
Camden's mayor is a loyal soldier -- as is Mr. Sweeney -- in the army of the Democratic baron George E. Norcross III, a man who has made millions in insurance and health care. Mr. Norcross controls downstate votes and upstate pols, and enjoys friendly relations with the Republican governor.
To speak against the governor, therefore, could involve angering Mr. Norcross. And who needs that headache? State Senator Richard J. Codey, who has warred with many political barons, nods knowingly:
''I was born and raised over a funeral home. I became used to seeing unnatural deaths, which is excellent preparation for New Jersey politics.''

HEADLINE: A Tourism Office Falls Victim to Hard Times

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
SEATTLE -- An alluring billboard beckoned to motorists on a busy industrial corridor here this spring. It displayed just one image, a panoramic view of a valley and mountains and sunshine, and one word, ''Montana.''
Who paid for that advertisement? The State of Montana, naturally, out of money it designated for tourism marketing this year.
''They've done a great job, and they're incredibly visible,'' said Tom Norwalk, the president and chief executive of Seattle's Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''We're not doing that. We're going to be fortunate in the next six months to be able to maintain a Web site.''
Washington State has plenty of beauty of its own, of course, but it will not be paying for billboards featuring Puget Sound or Mount Rainier or the Space Needle anytime soon. This month, as a result of wide-ranging budget cuts passed this year by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, Washington became the only state in the nation with no statewide tourism office and no state money to promote itself to travelers. 
The cut has been attributed purely to having to make tough choices between financing programs like public education and paying for glossy marketing campaigns. But at a time when some struggling states are aggressively branding and rebranding themselves to expand tourism -- Michigan, hoping to offset images of manufacturing declines and Detroit's urban decay, increased funds for its ''Pure Michigan'' campaign to $25 million this year from $17 million in 2010 -- many tourism experts across the country believe Washington will soon regret what it is saving in the short term.
''Our lesson to Washington is that it's been 18 years since we went dark in 1993, and we still haven't gotten back to the national market share we had,'' said Al White, head of the Colorado Tourism Office, which lost all financing in 1993 and did not regain a steady revenue stream until 2000. ''It's really difficult to affect market share positively, but it's really easy to affect it negatively if you're not out there.''
The Washington State Tourism Office employed six people in its office in Olympia, the capital, and had a budget of $1.8 million before it closed on June 30. The budget had been $7 million the previous year and more than $10 million several years before that. The state has transferred much of the office's tangible property, including trade show booths, brochures and digital photo archives, to members of a tourism alliance formed this year with the goal of taking over statewide marketing coordination.
Tourism is the fourth-largest industry in Washington, and it has been on an upswing. Last year, visitor spending increased 7.4 percent over 2009, accounting for the second-best year on record, tourism experts say. The number of international visitors grew more than 30 percent, one of the fastest rates in the country.
But for all its natural beauty and Seattle's urban appeal, Washington also has inherent challenges. Many people, particularly international tourists, have a limited grasp of the geography of the Northwest. And then there is the state's name.
The name Washington was assigned by Congress in 1853, when the area was still a territory. Settlers seeking territorial status had requested that their new home be called Columbia, after the great river on its southern boundary. But some members of Congress were concerned that this would confuse the new territory with where they worked, the District of Columbia. Somehow, calling it Washington was seen as a better solution.
But a century and a half later, even though this Washington is on a different coast, has 10 times the population of the other one and is not known for political shenanigans, the name is still an issue. It can be hard just to know when to capitalize the word ''state'' if it appears after the word Washington. (Answer: it depends.)
These are just the kinds of things state tourism offices try to address. The current branding effort, put in place before the office shut down, features an abstract mountain and an evergreen tree and the phrase ''Washington, the State,'' wording that is intended to optimize Internet searches so they direct browsers to the state's tourism Web site.
Aside from identity issues, Washington also faces competition from ambitious tourism efforts surrounding it. Montana's campaign focuses on specific urban areas, Seattle, Minneapolis and Chicago among them, and has won awards for its creativity, including the wrapping of city buses with pastoral images of Big Sky Country.
British Columbia, next door in Canada (yes, the province was named for the river, which stretches from the Pacific Ocean through Washington across the Canadian border), will spend about $50 million on tourism this year. California will spend the same, relying mostly on fees paid by businesses in the travel and tourism industry.
''It's a shortsighted way of thinking,'' Cathy Keefe, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Travel Association, said of the cuts in Washington. ''You have to be constantly reinforcing the message. If you don't, people will forget about you. There's always going to be someone who's stepping in there to take over your market share.''
Ms. Keefe pointed to data showing that 27 of 47 states her group surveyed had either maintained or increased their tourism spending in the past year -- despite the lingering effects of the recession -- and that 12 had increased it by at least 10 percent.
In Washington, a range of tourism businesses quickly created the Washington Tourism Alliance in an effort to compensate for losing the state office. The nonprofit group includes big agencies like Seattle's Convention and Visitors Bureau and smaller operations like Indian-owned casinos and ski resorts. The alliance has just formed a board and is about to hire an interim director. Next year, it is to take control of the state tourism Web site, and its leaders say they hope eventually to create a revenue stream for the group similar to California's.
In the meantime, Montana hopes its marketing campaign, will keep the state, as those in tourism say, ''top of mind.''
''If you live in the greater Puget Sound area and you don't want to go to Montana by now, you haven't been paying attention,'' said Marsha Massey, executive director of the Washington State Tourism Office -- until it closed. ''Even I want to go to Montana.''
Projected 2011 Budgets for Tourism Promotion

COLORADO: $15 million
CONNECTICUT: $15 million*
MICHIGAN: $25.4 million
MONTANA: $13.9 million

HEADLINE: An Edge in Airfares

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
Europe's low-fare carriers may be best known in America for outrageous proposals to charge for bathroom access or offer stand-up seating, both ideas floated by Ryanair that were never adopted.
But travelers who have flown within Europe lately often took away a different impression -- that airline tickets were surprisingly inexpensive, especially compared with prices to fly within the United States.
A one-way ticket between Edinburgh and Dublin, for instance, can cost as little as $40. A one-way ticket from New York to Washington, about the same distance, starts at $65. Both prices, which vary depending on the travel date, include taxes and unavoidable fees, but not baggage and other optional charges. 
While it is tough to do a statistically rigorous comparison, especially since the European Union does not collect fare data for its 27 members, there is little doubt that ticket prices have fallen sharply within Europe, despite higher fuel costs, because of an explosion of competition from low-fare airlines like easyJet and Ryanair. Although Southwest Airlines and other carriers have put similar pressure on prices within the United States, anecdotal data suggests that it is still generally more expensive to fly between major cities in America than it is to fly between cities in Europe.
''Even after taxes, you see a better fare per mile in the European Union than you do in the United States,'' said Mark Milke, a director at the Fraser Institute, a public policy research group in Calgary, Alberta, who published a paper last year comparing the lowest fares available on a sample set of routes.
Using that data, Mr. Milke calculated that airline passengers traveling within a single country in Europe last year were paying about 11 cents a mile, including taxes and fees, or 14 cents a mile to fly between two European countries. In the United States, by contrast, passengers were paying about 23 cents a mile.
Since these figures were based on a limited number of case studies, results from a wider set of data would probably vary. In fact, the Air Transport Association, the airlines' trade group, calculates that domestic tickets in the United States cost about 16 cents a mile, excluding taxes, or at least 19 cents a mile with taxes (using the group's estimate that taxes add 20 percent to the price of a ticket).
Carlos Mestre, deputy head of the European Commission's transport unit, said the European Union did not collect data from airlines that would enable it to calculate a similar cost per mile. But based on information the commission has gathered, it has published numerous reports that say airfares have decreased significantly since the late 1990s, when the European Union began allowing airlines to fly freely among member countries.
''Prices have gone down quite dramatically,'' Mr. Mestre said, explaining that the rapid expansion of low-fare carriers has increased competition on many routes that were once dominated by a single national airline. The number of routes within Europe has also increased 140 percent from 1992 to 2010.
Low-fare airlines now carry more than a third of all passengers traveling within Europe, forcing older competitors to lower prices, especially on popular routes.
''In Europe, there has been an awful lot more competition in the last 10 years,'' said Brian Pearce, chief economist for the International Air Transport Association. ''That has led to a lot more choice for passengers as well as it being cheaper to travel.''
Mr. Pearce said European travelers had benefited from the fact that many large cities had multiple airports, allowing newer airlines access to these markets. That is not so much the case in the United States, where airlines like Southwest have fought to obtain scarce takeoff and landing slots in congested cities like New York.
European airlines also face more competition than their American counterparts from other forms of transportation, particularly Europe's robust rail network.
That competition is likely to increase in the coming years, since the European Commission recently announced an initiative to standardize the information on rail schedules and prices across member countries, making it easier for travelers to compare the cost of airlines versus the train between two cities. On some routes, ferries could be part of that comparison.
Steve Lott, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, said the shorter distances between cities in Europe was another factor influencing the competitive landscape.
''What type of model capitalizes on frequent short-distance flights?'' he said. ''Low-fare airlines.''
Those shorter distances also mean that driving is a viable option for many trips within Europe, especially now that border controls have been lifted, creating further competition for European carriers, Mr. Lott said.
Some analysts also note that Europe is going through a competitive phase that already took place in the United States after airline deregulation in the 1970s.
''They're earlier in a process the U.S. experienced a while ago,'' William S. Swelbar, a research engineer with the M.I.T. International Center for Air Transportation, said, noting that when adjusted for inflation, the average domestic fare in the United States has declined more than 50 percent since deregulation.
''We have a maturing market and maturing airlines,'' he said. ''As a result we're seeing prices go up.''
Others argue that regulatory policies in the United States favor established airlines, stifling competition and making it harder for new carriers to enter the market and succeed.
Mr. Milke is among those who say they believe that rules prohibiting foreign-owned airlines from operating in the United States -- for example, allowing Aer Lingus to fly passengers from Boston to Chicago -- keeps ticket prices higher than they would be if this restriction were dropped.
''Low fares are the result of the removal of barriers to competition,'' he said. ''With lower prices, people travel a lot more, and that creates jobs.''

HEADLINE: Union Chief Faults School Reform From 'On High'

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Amid one of the most contentious periods in recent memory for teachers' unions, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, Randi Weingarten, on Monday called for education reform that emanates from teachers and their communities, rather than from ''those who blame teachers for everything.''
''Let's refuse to be defined by people who are happy to lecture us about the state of public education -- but wouldn't last 10 minutes in a classroom,'' Ms. Weingarten told a crowd of about 2,000 here in kicking off the national conference held every two years by the union, which has 1.5 million members. 
In the past year, particularly in Wisconsin and New Jersey, governors and some state lawmakers have castigated teachers' unions and schools' performance while slashing budgets and pushing newer education strategies like charter schools and more rigorous teacher evaluation.
Ms. Weingarten, who has long opposed the cuts -- both budgetary and rhetorical -- made to teachers, told her audience that the current debate on education ''has been hijacked by a group of self-styled reformers'' from ''on high'' who want to blame educators' benefits and job security for states' notorious budget problems. Calling the union gathering ''an affirmation,'' she countered that change to the education system should instead come through greater community support for teachers themselves and recognition for the commitment to children they already demonstrate.
The speech, preceded by a youth chorus singing ''Money (That's What I Want)'' and ending with Dionne Warwick's ''Say a Little Prayer,'' was a formalization of the points Ms. Weingarten has made in editorials and on television as states' budget crises have landed at the schoolhouse door. It played well with union members like Dan Fray, an eighth-grade social studies teacher in Toledo, Ohio, where State Senate Bill 5 limited the collective-bargaining rights of 350,000 public workers earlier this year.
''We didn't become teachers for the pay or the benefits or the schedule, and no one's looking for a pat on the back for staying late to help kids,'' Mr. Fray said. ''But what's happened in Ohio and Indiana and Wisconsin and elsewhere is the vilification of the schoolteacher.''
Ms. Weingarten's speech followed impassioned comments from Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton, Democrat of the District of Columbia, who said, ''There is no way to be for our children and against teachers.''
Ms. Weingarten did offer conciliatory remarks, acknowledging the success of some charter schools while still expressing fear that they siphon talent and money from established school systems. She implored her members to avoid a ''circle the wagons'' approach to public skepticism of their value, saying that could cut teachers off from the communities with which they should connect more intimately.
The area in which teachers' economic and ideological concerns appeared to converge was longevity in the classroom. Ms. Weingarten criticized an environment that discourages people from making education a life's calling, noting that one-third of teachers leave after three years, and one-half leave after five. That is before they have a chance to reach their potential, she said -- and, some detractors would counter, the comfort of tenure that can breed complacency and underperformance.
''I'm not saying that teaching needs to be the only job someone holds in a society where people have multiple careers,'' Ms. Weingarten said. ''But unless we move teaching from a service project to a sustainable profession, it will exact a huge cost on our schools, our children's achievement and our progress as a nation.''
Ms. Weingarten did not address two notable subjects: the use of student test scores to evaluate teachers, and recent revelations of cheating among teachers in Atlanta and elsewhere to improve students' test scores, which are often tied to funding.
In an interview afterward, Ms. Weingarten condemned the Atlanta situation but pointed to the role of the local teachers' unions in helping uncover it. The cheating itself, she said, was a byproduct of when ''targets become more important than learning'' and of a teaching climate that in many areas has become ''intimidating, fearful and retaliatory.''
''A new reality is what we're fighting for,'' she had told her audience an hour earlier. ''One in which we improve the profession of teaching for teachers and outcomes for students.''

HEADLINE: All Hail the (Democratic) King

BYLINE: By AHMED CHARAI and JOSEPH BRAUDE.

 BODY:
Rabat, Morocco
IT isn't news anymore when an Arab ruler facing mass protests pledges sweeping reforms. But Morocco's July 1 constitutional referendum may be the most significant development in the Arab world all summer. For the first time since the Arab Spring began, a population broadly embraced its leader's reforms and scaled back antigovernment demonstrations. In the weeks before the referendum, over 100,000 people had taken to the streets; after the vote only about 10,000 did.
A sizable majority of Moroccans approved the new Constitution, which calls for King Mohammed VI to cede half his power to a prime minister appointed from the parliament's majority party and ensures the rights of women and non-Arabs, including the country's large Berber population. 
Morocco appears to have found a new model for political transition. If the constitutional experiment succeeds, the country will have the opportunity -- and responsibility -- to take on the regional leadership role that has traditionally been played by Egypt.
The major parliamentary opposition parties, including the main Islamist party, endorsed the Constitution. Those rejecting it, including a radical Islamist group which aims to overthrow the king and install a caliph, had the chance to make their cases on public radio and television. Some officials believe this new openness is serving as a force for moderation. ''The more the extremists go on TV, the more ridiculous they look,'' said Nawfel Raghay, who manages the country's broadcasting authority. ''We should have done this 20 years ago.''
The Constitution's power split provides a check against Islamists, if they were to win elections. In the event of an Islamist landslide, a new Shariah-minded prime minister would have the authority to appoint all senior civil servants and oversee domestic security. However, control over the army and foreign intelligence services would rest with the king. The monarch would also retain his traditional role as the country's highest religious authority -- meaning that he could block attempts to use mosques, the news media and religious education to impose chauvinist religious mores.
This novel arrangement also addresses the historic dilemma between values and interests the West has faced in its relationship with Morocco. The country has long been regarded as a constructive player in regional affairs, but its pro-Western authoritarian elite has a troubling human rights record and has constrained political and economic opportunity for the country's impoverished majority. The Constitution could allow the emergence of new elites and open up the political arena.
It is important for America and its allies that Morocco achieve this balance at a time when Egypt is not in a position to serve as a regional powerbroker. Under its former president, Hosni Mubarak, Egypt served as a bridge between Arab monarchies like Saudi Arabia and Arab dictatorships like Syria and Libya. But today, there is a new Arab political divide -- between autocracies and countries undergoing democratic transitions. Morocco, a transitioning government itself and a prospective member of the Saudi-led Gulf Cooperation Council, is uniquely positioned to bridge this divide.
Whereas Mr. Mubarak mediated between Israelis and Palestinians, the new Egyptian government has yet to form a coherent policy on that conflict, let alone earn the trust of both sides. Morocco, by contrast, has a history of doing so. Years before Egypt normalized diplomatic relations with Israel in 1980, the Moroccan king Hassan II was a liaison between Israel and its neighbors. The country's distance from Israel was not a serious disadvantage then, and it is even less so today in the era of instant communication and intercontinental strategic partnerships.
Morocco also has a deep historical bond with the Jewish people: the king protected 200,000 Moroccan Jews from the Nazis during World War II, and nearly one million Israelis have Moroccan roots -- including some senior political and military officials. Morocco can extract concessions from both parties to the conflict that Egypt never could.
The Moroccan constitutional model sets an obvious example for Jordan, whose king also claims some religious authority and remains relatively popular. For the more embattled Sunni kingdom of Bahrain, a similar pact of electoral power-sharing with the Shiite majority may be the only way, in the long run, for Bahrain's dynasty to survive.
Before the referendum, scores of protesters were wounded by the police, and one was killed. While this violence is deplorable, it is a far cry from that of Egypt, where hundreds died, let alone Libya and Syria, where state security forces have killed thousands.
There is great optimism in Morocco today. Millions have signaled their desire for freedom and opportunity within a constitutional framework. If parliament is vigilant in ensuring that the reforms are swiftly applied, Morocco can set an example for peaceful political transitions across the Arab world.

HEADLINE: Waiting for Trade Deals

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Republicans Boycott a Hearing on Trade'' (Business Day, July 1): 
Nearly $153 million a year in Northeast agriculture exports are being left on the table as we wait for Congress to act on the three pending trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama.
Family farmers belonging to the Farm Bureaus in Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont have joined together to urge Congress to pass these agreements quickly to help give our economy the kick it needs.
Without approval, the United States could lose nearly $2.3 billion a year in additional agriculture exports.
Passage also means ending the exorbitant tariffs placed on United States food products going into these countries: up to 160 percent in Colombia and 260 percent in Panama and as high as 500 percent in Korea. They receive nearly duty-free access to our markets.
Each day that goes by without new pacts provides more opportunity for competing countries to negotiate their own deals.

HEADLINE: Edging Toward Default

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH and ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
The small city of Central Falls, R.I., appears to be headed for a rare municipal bankruptcy filing, and state officials are rushing to keep its woes from overwhelming the struggling state.
The impoverished city, operating under a receiver for a year, has promised $80 million worth of retirement benefits to 214 police officers and firefighters, far more than it can afford. Those workers' pension fund will probably run out of money in October, giving Central Falls the distinction of becoming the second municipality in the United States to exhaust its pension fund, after Prichard, Ala.
''Time is running out,'' warns Robert G. Flanders, the state-appointed receiver, who recently closed the public library and a community center to save money. He has no power to cancel the city's contracts with workers, so instead he has begun approaching retired police officers and firefighters with what he describes as ''the Big Ask'': will they voluntarily accept smaller benefits in the name of saving Central Falls?
Some of the retirees are in their 90s, and Central Falls, like many American cities, has not placed its police and firefighters in Social Security. Many have no other benefits to fall back on. 
State lawmakers are trying to contain the damage, mindful that it would be a bad time for any state to seek help in Washington. Last month they rescinded an offer of state aid to Central Falls, just after Moody's downgraded the city's credit to ''possibility of default.''
But the state still has risks related to the woes of its municipalities, risks that have gone largely unnoticed because it is not as big as, say, Illinois and California. Several other Rhode Island cities are sinking under big debt burdens. Even Providence, the capital, risks running out of cash in September, according to its auditor, and if it scrapes by until October, it must then come up with $60 million for its own municipal pension plan.
Some analysts fear that a Central Falls bankruptcy, and a whiff of other problems out there, could scare nervous investors away from bonds issued by Rhode Island's other municipalities, perhaps setting off a chain reaction that could push the state itself to the brink. There is a precedent: the last American state to default on its bonds, Arkansas in 1933, got in over its head by trying to help struggling municipalities.
More recently, when local governments have veered toward bankruptcy -- Orange County, Calif., in 1994; Cleveland in 1978 -- neighboring municipalities have found it harder to sell their own debt. During the New York City fiscal crisis of 1975, New Jersey suddenly found its bonds harder to sell.
''That type of contagion is what you're trying to avoid,'' said James E. Spiotto, a bankruptcy specialist at the law firm Chapman & Cutler, who is not involved in Rhode Island's problems.
Rhode Island has an investment-grade credit rating, but it is in no position to bail out a string of teetering cities, or take over their shaky local pension funds the way the federal government does when some companies go bankrupt. The state treasurer, Gina M. Raimondo, says Rhode Island must first stabilize its own pension fund, which continues to require more and more cash each year, despite four overhauls since 2005 that were supposed to get the cost under control. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating. If the state turns out to have understated its commitments, it could deliver a new jolt to bond markets still nervous after two traumatic years.
Lawmakers in Rhode Island are trying to reassure investors. On July 1 they passed a law giving certain bonds, known as general obligations, legal priority over all other payments that municipalities must make, including retirement benefits. The measure, awaiting Gov. Lincoln Chafee's signature, also requires Rhode Island's cities, towns and districts to dedicate their general revenue to paying bondholders first, and to raise property taxes as much as necessary to make all payments to bondholders on time.
It gives less secure types of bonds priority, too, and makes local officials personally liable for any losses they cause by failing to comply with the new requirements.
When the city of Vallejo, Calif., declared bankruptcy in 2008, no one thought it would ripple out over the whole state. Partly that's because California has shock absorbers: laws on the books that assure bondholders they will be paid and a big, diverse state economy that could bail out a distressed city if need be.
Rhode Island is different. There are only 39 cities and towns in the state, so one troubled city cannot easily fade into the background. And there is not just one troubled city. Recent tests found one in four in some degree of distress.
A startling number have stumbled by trying to operate their own tiny pension funds for selected groups of workers, rather than participating in a state-run pension system for municipalities. There are 36 of these local pension funds, and 23 have been designated at risk, with Central Falls the most endangered. A legislative report found that eliminating all their shortfalls would cost more than the total statewide property tax levy.
In Central Falls, the receiver looked into whether the state-run pension system for municipalities could take over the local plan, but found that a radical restructuring would have to come first.
The city, just north of Providence, is small and poor, but over the years it has promised police officers and firefighters retirement benefits like those offered in big, rich states like California and New York. These uniformed workers can retire after just 20 years of service, receive free health care in retirement, and qualify for full disability pensions when only partly disabled.
Just over one square mile, Central Falls has a tightly packed population, filled mostly with immigrant families, that struggles on a median household income of less than $33,520 a year, according to the Census Bureau's 2005-9 American Community Survey. The typical single-family house, after a recent revaluation, is worth about $130,000. It is hard to see how anyone thought such an impoverished tax base could come up with an additional $80 million for retirement benefits. If the city were contributing the recommended amount to the plan each year, it would take 57 percent of local property tax revenue.
Daniel L. Beardsley Jr., executive director of the Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns, said it was not the city's idea. Other states limit what can be decided in collective bargaining, but Rhode Island's law says that for police and firefighters, ''wages, hours and any and all terms or conditions of employment'' are subject to negotiation.
''That means even the length of a mustache,'' said Mr. Beardsley, who over many years has represented Central Falls and other municipalities in contract negotiations. Talks broke down more often than not, he said, and then the same state law called for binding arbitration, which for many years was a clubby process that emphasized comparable benefits all across the state more than any city's ability to pay.
''It was a domino effect,'' he said, leaving Rhode Island with the nation's highest per capita spending for fire services and sixth-highest for policing. (The binding arbitration law does not apply to public workers other than police officers and firefighters in the state, although some want it extended to teachers.)
Central Falls is already spending about a fourth of its budget on employee benefits, and that will rise sharply when the pension fund is exhausted. Mike Andrews, president of the local firefighters' union, said about one in four of his men now qualified for retirement, but were afraid to retire, concerned that their pensions would be chopped in bankruptcy.
''We're always willing to come to the table and try to work something out,'' he said. ''We want to get this corrected as much as anyone, because if it doesn't get corrected, we suffer.''

To the Editor:
Re ''Thirst for Fairness May Have Helped Us Survive'' (Basics, July 5): Natalie Angier reports that a sense of fairness runs deep in our evolutionary history. So where is this sense of fairness in the public debate about the economic crisis? 
Fairness has something to do with equal sacrifice in hard times, and with pay that bears some relationship to work put in and social value created. Is the $10 million a year Ms. Angier mentions as the average salary of top executives -- a figure rising at 12 percent per year as the rest of America struggles with unemployment, stagnant wages and attacks on unions -- fair?
If there is a ''thirst for fairness'' in our genes, let's get it back into our discussion about policies.
Lawrence Blum
Cambridge, Mass.
To the Editor:
Research continues to show the importance of fairness in determining behavioral and emotional responses. It's the basis of not only a social contract, but a personal contract as well. Taking more than our share tends to result in a sense of guilt, along with social disapproval, unless we can convince ourselves (as we often do) that we somehow deserved more.
The commitment to justice arises out of the developing child's need to control short-term impulses in favor of longer-term benefits. If we didn't convince ourselves that virtue would be rewarded in the long run, few of us would be willing to delay gratification by taking a ''fair'' share rather than all we can get.

HEADLINE: Bank's Deal Means More Will Lose Their Homes

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of Bank of America's most distressed borrowers could be evicted and lose their homes more quickly as a result of a proposed settlement between the bank, which is the country's largest mortgage servicer, and investors in its troubled mortgage securities.
For struggling borrowers in better financial shape, the outcome could be more positive: the deal would include incentives for mortgage servicers to help homeowners who have fallen behind on their payments and whose homes are worth less than they borrowed.
''The goal is to reinstate as many borrowers in a modification that performs well,'' said Tony Meola, a servicing executive with Bank of America. ''It also is likely to lead to faster resolution in those unfortunate situations where foreclosure is inevitable. While not a desirable outcome, the recovery of the housing markets depends on moving through the foreclosure process as quickly and fairly as possible.''
While powerful investors stand to benefit from the $8.5 billion settlement over the bank's bundling of shoddy mortgages as securities, the fallout for the nearly 275,000 borrowers who took out those loans depends greatly on how deep they are in the foreclosure process and whether they earn enough money to dig themselves out. 
While no exact income qualification has been set as part of the agreement, which was announced last month, many servicers use a formula in which borrowers can qualify for a modification as long as the new monthly payment does not exceed 31 percent of their monthly gross income. For borrowers who are unemployed or lack the income to cover even reduced mortgage payments, foreclosure and eviction could be much more immediate.
With 1.3 million borrowers at risk of foreclosure, Bank of America has been overwhelmed by the surge in defaults, and the accord has raised hopes that this logjam will finally begin to ease. But skeptics say that previous arrangements, like another multibillion-dollar settlement by Bank of America in 2008, have barely made a dent in the problem.
''The mortgage servicers have repeatedly promised to do things and then not done them,'' said Michael S. Barr, a former assistant Treasury secretary who now teaches law at the University of Michigan. ''I think it's positive in general, but I don't expect it to be transformative of what we've witnessed from the mortgage servicers over the last four years.''
Matthew Weidner, a Florida lawyer who represents borrowers facing foreclosure, said he was skeptical of promises by the deal's architects that lower monthly payments would be easier to obtain.
''It's like giving aspirin to someone with cancer,'' he said of the proposed assistance. ''You had all the big players at the top of the pyramid negotiating but nobody was speaking for the homeowners who have far more at stake at the ground level.''
Still, for some of the homeowners now facing foreclosure who took out loans with Countrywide, the subprime specialist bought by Bank of America in 2008, the deal could bring a few quick improvements.
Under the terms of the agreement, Bank of America must now start transferring these borrowers to 10 smaller outside servicers, even without the deal being approved in court, which is not expected before November. The architects of the settlement say these subservicers will be far more efficient than Bank of America's giant payment processing operation.
For example, an analysis of data by RBS prepared as part of the settlement found that Bank of America provided fewer modifications as a percentage of unpaid principal than JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Litton and other servicers. In addition, borrowers defaulted again within six months in nearly one in five cases when modifications were made by Bank of America, a higher rate than other servicers that were studied.
Officials at Bank of America contend the company has made nearly 875,000 modifications since 2008, more than any other servicer.
Under the new proposal, subservicers will have to provide an answer to homeowner modification requests within 60 days of receiving paperwork, and will get up to 1.5 percent of the unpaid principal balance as an incentive fee for each successful permanent modification.
''We wanted smaller, high-touch servicers who would consider every modification option at once, not try this and that,'' said Kathy D. Patrick, a Houston lawyer who represented the 22 private investors in the settlement. ''Servicers get more in fees for successful modifications than for any other kind of workout, including foreclosure.''
The first homeowners should be transferred out of Bank of America by early fall, with each of the 10 subservicers taking up to 30,000 cases. Borrowers with mortgages 60 days past due who have been delinquent more than once in the last 12 months will receive priority in the switch, followed by homeowners who are 90 days past due but not in foreclosure.
Homeowners already in foreclosure or who have been declared bankrupt will go to the back of the line, although they will also eventually be transferred, Ms. Patrick said. More than 75 percent of the nearly 275,000 delinquent homeowners have not made a payment in more than 120 days or are already in foreclosure.
One unintended consequence of the problems at Bank of America and other large servicers is that many borrowers have managed to remain in their homes despite being in default, and without the income to qualify for a modification. At the time of foreclosure, the typical Bank of America borrower has not made a payment in 18 months.
What is more, according to the analysis of RBS data, it takes 30 months on average for a subprime borrower's property to move from foreclosure to a final sale with Bank of America, nearly a year longer than Wells Fargo, and 10 months longer than SPS, a smaller subservicer likely to be among the 10 selected to take over the former Countrywide loans.
''Countrywide made a lot of bad loans and borrowers with no money can't afford a modification,'' said Peter Swire, a former special assistant for housing policy in the Obama administration who helped oversee earlier federal efforts to promote modifications. He is now a professor at Ohio State University. ''One discouraging problem is that only a small fraction of Countrywide borrowers will likely qualify,'' Professor Swire said.
Delores Gosha hopes she will be one of the lucky ones.
It has been more than a year since she last made a mortgage payment to Bank of America, raising the risk that her bungalow in the Cleveland suburbs will end up in foreclosure. The bank, she says, has given varying answers as to whether she qualifies for a modification, telling her she did not at one point last week only to reverse course days later and say it was still under consideration. Ms. Gosha said she had had to deal with a multitude of representatives and submit the same documents over and over.
While a new servicer might not give her the answer she has been praying for, she said, at least she will get an answer.
''I've been up and down,'' said Ms. Gosha, who is a clerk at a Cleveland hospital. ''Can't somebody tell me something?''

HEADLINE: The Magic Lever

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The world economy is a complex, unknowable organism. Most of us try to diversify our investments and balance risk and security to protect against the unexpected.
But a few years ago a group of bankers thought they had the magic tool to help them master financial trends and predict the future. Sophisticated risk assessment models would enable them to rewrite the rules and make more money.
Their arrogance was soon exposed. Along came the financial crisis. 
In the middle of the crisis another group emerged, believing it had the magic lever to alter the economy's trajectory. Democrats argued that through gigantic deficit spending, they could bring unemployment rates down sharply and produce a ''summer of recovery.''
The spending they began must have done some good to cushion the recession, but either through a failure of theory or a failure of implementation, their lever was not as powerful as they promised. Federal spending rose from 19.38 to 24.91 percent of gross domestic product, but the economy refused to rebound and the world is awash in oceans of debt.
Now a third group has emerged, also claiming that it has the magic lever to control the economy. Staunch Republicans argue that taxes are central to determining economic growth. Tax cuts, they argue, have huge positive benefits and tax increases have disastrous negative effects.
In the middle of the current budget negotiations, these Republicans argue that the tax increases the Democrats are proposing -- ending some deductions for the affluent, hitting oil and gas companies -- would be terrible for the economy. These unacceptable increases would be worse than the threat of national default, worse than a decade of gigantic deficits.
Not many Americans have this expansive view on the power of tax policy. According to the Gallup Organization, only 20 percent of Americans believe the budget deal should consist of spending cuts only. Even among Republicans, a plurality believes there should be a mixture of tax increases and spending cuts.
Yet the G.O.P. is now oriented around this 20 percent. It is willing to alienate 80 percent of voters and commit political suicide because of its faith in the power of tax policy.
These three groups -- bankers, Democratic Keynesians and staunch Republicans -- have one thing in common: They all believe they have identified the magic lever. They believe they can control their economic fate.
Some of us do not believe there is a magic lever. Deficit spending stimulates growth, but not by that much. Tax increases are bad, but they are not disastrous. We believe that there are a thousand factors that go into economic growth, and no single one is dispositive.
We look at the tax cuts of 2001 and do not see tremendous gains. We look at the tax increase of 1982 and do not see a ruinous disaster. We look at high deficit eras and low deficit eras and do not see an easy correlation between deficit spending and growth. On the contrary, if you look around the world there's a slight negative correlation between government size and prosperity.
We believe that if you rest everything on a single lever (Increase deficits! Cut taxes!), you give people a permission slip to be self-indulgent. They will spend or cut to their hearts' content and soon you'll be facing national bankruptcy. We believe that even if you are theoretically right, your policies will be distorted by human frailties and special interests.
The people in my group (you might call us conservatives) are more likely to embrace a low and steady approach to fiscal policy. Control debt. Control entitlements. Keep tax levels reasonable and the tax code simple. Work on the economic fundamentals: human capital, productivity, labor market flexibility, open trade, saving and investment. Don't believe you can use magic levers to manipulate growth month to month.
People in my camp form a silent majority. But we have been astonishingly passive during these budget negotiations. The tax cut brigades and the Medicare/Spending brigades are well organized. The people who believe in balance and the fundamentals sit piously on the sidelines.
The tragedy is that in Barack Obama and John Boehner we have leaders who would like to do something big. They seem to know that you need bipartisan cover if you want to really cut spending. They seem to know circumstances for deficit reduction will only get worse in the years ahead.
But they are bracketed on all sides -- by the tax cut and Medicare brigades, by the wonks hatching budget gimmicks that erode trust, by political hacks who don't want to lose their precious campaign issues: tax cuts forever, Medicare spending without limit.
Mostly, they are buffeted by the proud, by those who think they have a magic lever to control human destiny and who will not compromise it away. This is the oldest story known to man.

HEADLINE: Obama Grasping Centrist Banner In Debt Impasse

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama made no apparent headway on Monday in his attempt to forge a crisis-averting budget deal, but he put on full display his effort to position himself as a pragmatic centrist willing to confront both parties and address intractable problems.
At a news conference preceding the latest round of debt-reduction talks with Republican and Democratic Congressional leaders, Mr. Obama said he would not accept a temporary agreement to kick the problem down the road a few weeks or months. 
He said that he was willing to take the heat from his own party to move beyond entrenched ideological positions and that Republicans should do the same. And he continued to insist on ''the biggest deal possible,'' saying that now is the best opportunity for the nation to address its long-term fiscal challenges.
Republicans dismissed his performance as political theater. But Mr. Obama's remarks appeared to be aimed at independent voters as well as at Congressional leaders, and stood in contrast to the Republican focus on the party's conservative base, both in the budget showdown and in presidential politics.
Mr. Obama's remarks were among the clearest expressions yet of a repositioning effort that has been under way since the midterm elections last November, when Republicans captured the House and made inroads in the Senate.
Seeking to shed the image of big-government liberal that Republicans used effectively against him last year, he has made or offered policy compromises on an array of issues and cast himself in the role of the adult referee for both parties' gamesmanship, or the parent of stubborn children.
''If we think it's hard now, imagine how these guys are going to be thinking six months from now in the middle of election season where they're all up,'' he said. ''It's not going to get easier. It's going to get harder. So we might as well do it now -- pull off the Band-Aid, eat our peas.''
He added, ''We keep on talking about this stuff, and we have these high-minded pronouncements about how we've got to get control of the deficit and how we owe it to our children and our grandchildren. Well, let's step up. Let's do it. I'm prepared to do it. I'm prepared to take on significant heat from my party to get something done. And I expect the other side should be willing to do the same thing.''
Mr. Obama did not shake Republicans' resolve to oppose any increases in taxes for wealthy Americans and businesses, as he proposes. ''Eat our peas?'' asked a mocking news release from the office of Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, placing the blaming for the impasse on Mr. Obama for demanding ''job crushing tax hikes.''
Mr. Obama used his news conference to counter Republicans' attacks suggesting that he wanted immediate tax increases. With the economy still weak and unemployment high, he said, tax increases should not take effect before 2013 and even then should affect only corporate jet owners, oil companies, millionaires -- including himself -- and billionaires. (Mr. Obama has long pressed for higher taxes on income starting at $250,000.)
Denying he had ''some grand ambition to create a bigger government,'' Mr. Obama said that in trying to solve the debt problem, ''if you don't have revenues, it means you are putting more of a burden on the people who can least afford it. And that's not fair. And I think the American people agree with me on that.''
Mr. Obama also called on resistant Democrats to compromise on ''trimming benefits'' for the entitlement programs, including Social Security, to ensure its solvency for future generations.
''I think the American people want to see something done,'' Mr. Obama said, echoing the stance of many independent and moderate voters reflected in polls and focus groups. ''They feel a sense of urgency, both about the breakdown in our political process and also about the situation in our economy.''
In a break with many presidential candidates who first appeal to their party's base to win the nomination, Mr. Obama from the earliest days of his 2008 campaign sought support from independent voters. Though liberals were attracted to him for his opposition to the Iraq war, Mr. Obama more broadly reached out to independents with his calls for bipartisanship and problem-solving; his campaign saw expanding the pool of primary and caucus voters as the only way to defeat the party establishment favorite, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Independents also powered Mr. Obama's victory over his Republican rival, Senator John McCain. But since Mr. Obama entered the White House, polls showed, many abandoned him as the economic downturn persisted, and he pursued an ambitious domestic agenda topped by an overhaul of the health insurance system.
By November's midterm elections, some national polls showed a majority of independents disapproved of his job performance, and winning them back has been central to the White House's political strategy.
This year, support among independents is up, though Mr. Obama still has a way to go to regain his former standing. A New York Times/CBS News poll in June gave Mr. Obama a 50 percent approval rating among independents, up five points from the start of the year, though a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in June had 50 percent of independents disapproving of the job he is doing.
''There was never a discussion of, 'Let's sit down and reposition ourselves.' There were discussions of returning to first principles and the things that motivated him to run,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior political strategist. ''This is what he talked about all through the 2008 campaign -- that we need to put solving problems ahead of scoring political points, and we have to think about not just the next election but the next generation.''
But David Winston, a Republican strategist for Mr. Boehner and other Republican leaders, said Mr. Obama was ''putting a poison pill'' into the debt talks by his insistence on higher revenue, and drawing clear lines between the parties that would benefit Republicans.
''We have two clearly different economic viewpoints,'' Mr. Winston said. ''And from the speaker's point of view, if you increase taxes you're going to contract the economy and that is going to lead to a job loss. And right now we can't do that.''

HEADLINE: Starbucks Reorganizes For Growth

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Starbucks said on Monday that it would realign its top management jobs to help advance its international growth.
The company said it would divide responsibilities for its business into three global regions: Asia, the Americas and a region containing Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Starbucks, the coffee giant, now has two units, the United States and international. 
Three company executives have been appointed to lead the new regions.
Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, said the change would help maximize its opportunities in growing markets like China, Brazil and India.
Starbucks, which is based in Seattle, has nearly 11,000 stores in North America and almost 6,000 elsewhere.
It had a major slump in the recession after changing consumer habits and a rapid overexpansion. It slowed growth, cut jobs, closed stores and reorganized. Sales in cafes have rebounded, and the company is expanding its overseas and consumer products businesses.
The United States still generates most of its revenue. Nearly three-fourths of the $10.7 billion Starbucks brought in during its most recent fiscal year was from the United States. But Mr. Schultz said international business eventually would produce at least half the company's revenue.
Starbucks is one of many consumer products companies looking overseas for growth as the middle class expands abroad. One of the biggest prizes in pure growth is China, Mr. Schultz said in an interview. Starbucks said it also planned to expand in India this fiscal year and in Vietnam the next year.
John Culver, who leads the company's international business, will be president of the China and Asia Pacific region.
Cliff Burrows, president of Starbucks United States, will head the Americas region, which encompasses the United States, Canada, Mexico and Central and South America.
Michelle Gass, president of Seattle's Best Coffee, was named president of Starbucks' Europe, Africa and Middle East region.
Other changes announced Monday include transferring responsibility for Seattle's Best to Jeff Hansberry, head of the company's global consumer products and food service business. Annie Young-Scrivner, global chief marketing officer, will also oversee its Tazo tea business.
Starbucks said it would continue to push its consumer products, such as Via instant coffee, under the new management structure.
The company said the transition would be complete by September.

HEADLINE: Best Hope For News Corp.

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GOLDFARB and ANTONY CURRIE

 BODY:
The best hope for shareholders of the News Corporation may be Tom Perkins, the renowned American venture capitalist. He is the closest thing to a truly independent director on the roster of Rupert Murdoch cronies. Mr. Perkins also has some relevant experience: he quit the board of Hewlett-Packard five years ago over a phone-hacking scandal. That makes him a prime candidate to lead the charge for a badly needed overhaul of governance at the News Corporation.
The company's shares have tumbled 14 percent over the last week, as phone hacking and other malfeasance at News of the World brought the abrupt shutdown of the tabloid and then raised the specter of the News Corporation losing its grip on British Sky Broadcasting, the British satellite TV group. Though shareholders bought in knowing that Mr. Murdoch called the shots, they are still entitled to expect independent directors to fight their corner. 
The company needs a fully independent inquiry into what happened, a critical assessment of its current businesses and strategy and an objective review of governance, among other things. Yet there isn't much nonpartisan thinking to be found on the company's board. Though nine of the 15 directors up for election last August met Nasdaq's standards for independence, they mostly don't really reflect the word's meaning.
Kenneth Cowley ran a News Corporation division for years and has served on the board for over three decades. Andrew Knight was chairman of News International, the division now under scrutiny, before becoming a director in 1994. John Thornton, now a professor in China, helped win business from Mr. Murdoch when he was president of Goldman Sachs. Few of the supposed independent directors lack a history with the News Corporation or its boss.
So the responsibility may fall on Mr. Perkins's shoulders. His own phone records were hacked when Patricia Dunn, then chairwoman of H.P., hired investigators to uncover board leaks. He resigned, later talking of ''the questionable ethics and the dubious legality'' of the methods used.
Mr. Perkins, a founder of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, also used the episode to rail against tick-the-box corporate governance, which he said was increasingly substituting for judgment. The mess at the News Corporation provides him a perfect opportunity to lead his fellow independent directors in practicing what he preached.
Maintaining Balance
Morgan Stanley should keep two at the top. John Mack is due to retire as chairman at the end of the year and the board may well grant the title to James Gorman, adding to his duties as chief executive. Combining the two roles is far more common in the United States than in Europe. But the directors should resist the temptation.
Mr. Gorman's rebuilding of the firm has been slowed by the uncertainty over regulatory reform and the economy's effect on earnings across the financial sector. He isn't without success. He notably saved $800 million of annual costs by persuading Mitsubishi UFJ to convert its preferred shares into common stock.
But Mr. Gorman is edging only slowly toward repairing and expanding fixed-income trading and the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney retail brokerage unit. Not only is it too soon to consider granting him another title, but making him chairman could prove a distraction from his day-to-day responsibilities.
A C.E.O. tending to those can leave the chairman to focus on monitoring top executives and shareholder interests. Chief executives should do the same, but there is an inherent conflict of interest in juggling the concerns of investors against personal ambitions. Appointing an independent lead director only partly offsets that.
Consider the fate of rivals like Bank of America, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, where having the same person serve as chairman and chief executive impeded the ability of the board and other executives to challenge decisions. Arguably, that also affected Morgan Stanley, which lost some $10 billion on a subprime mortgage trade, encouraged by the desire of Mr. Mack, who held both top jobs at the time, to ramp up risk.
Of course, splitting the roles is no panacea. It didn't prevent some European banks from getting into trouble. And a few banks with one man in both positions came through the crisis less financially scarred than others, for instance JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.
But Bank of America and Citigroup have wisely embraced the separation of powers. If the right people are put in the two jobs, it creates a more effective balance and better corporate governance. JEFFREY GOLDFARB and ANTONY CURRIE

HEADLINE: Another In the List Of Loopholes

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
As the White House and Congress wrangle over raising the debt ceiling and reducing the federal deficit, tax loopholes would seem to be an easy target for compromise.
President Obama has talked about eliminating breaks for partners at hedge funds and private equity firms - along with corporate jet owners, oil companies and others taking advantage of quirks in the tax codes.
Here's another little-known group of tax code beneficiaries that he might want to add to the list: day traders and speculators who buy and sell futures contracts. 
For years, futures contracts, which are essentially bets on the price of commodities, stock indexes and the like, have received a more favorable tax treatment than stocks. A trader who buys and sells an oil contract in less than a year - even in a matter of minutes - pays no more than a 23 percent tax on the profits.
Compare that with the bill for flipping shares of Google, General Electric or even a diversified mutual fund in the same time period. Those short-term investment gains are treated like ordinary income, meaning the rate can run as high as 35 percent.
''There are so many ways to attack the logic of it,'' Warren E. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, said in an interview on Monday about of the futures tax break. ''It doesn't make sense.''
What does the tax loophole cost the federal government? Each year, the United States gives up roughly $2 billion in lost revenue, according to the Congressional Research Service, a federal agency.
That number may seem insignificant against the backdrop of the country's $55 trillion state and local government debt, and federal debt which stands at about $14 trillion. But tax inequities like this start to add up when considered collectively. Based on data from the Office of Management and Budget, the United States could put another $20 billion in its coffers over 10 years if it taxed the investment gains of hedge funds and private equity executives as ordinary income. The so-called carried interest is treated like capital gains, which is taxed at a much lower rate. The corporate jet break amounts to about $2 billion to $3 billion in a decade.
Perhaps the tax break on futures contracts wouldn't be so irksome if it simply helped farmers protecting the value of their corn crops, airlines dealing with the rising cost of oil or even individuals hedging the risks in their portfolio.
But the biggest beneficiaries seem to be day traders and speculators. Long-term investors account for only 20 percent of the activity in the commodities future market, according to a report published last week by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the industry regulator.
When I called Robert Green, a tax specialist whose clients include traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the hub of commodities futures contracts, he seemed genuinely taken aback.
''I've been dreading getting a call like this,'' he said, apparently worried that any publicity of the tax break could put pressure on lawmakers to revisit the rule. ''No one has shot something across the bow.''
Still, he acknowledged that it would be hard for President Obama to justify lower tax rates ''to benefit futures traders and commodities exchanges in his home state, while pushing hard to raise taxes on securities hedge fund managers - often in Connecticut and New York City.''
The genesis of the tax break on futures goes back to 1981, when the government tried to close another tax loophole. At the time, some big investors were using the contracts to skirt taxes by creating what was called a straddle transaction, which allowed investors to roll over their profits into the next year. So a rule was written that forced traders to mark their positions to market and pay taxes on unrealized gains.
In an effort to appease the investment community, a break was offered by Dan Rostenkowski, a Democrat from Chicago who was then the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and later went to prison for corruption. In part, the break was meant to offset the risks associated with paying taxes on paper profits. He persuaded Congress that traders should pay a blended rate, paying 60 percent of the long-term capital gains rate and 40 percent of the ordinary income rate. Today, the combination amounts to about 23 percent, assuming the top tax bracket for ordinary income is 35 percent and the long-term capital gains rate is 15 percent.
The break has been on the chopping block in recent years. In his budget proposals for 2010 and 2011, President Obama recommended ending the special tax treatment for dealers of futures contracts, although not for all investors. But the plans lost momentum and neither was incorporated into the final budgets.
Eric J. Toder, an economist at the Tax Policy Center, a research organization, said that the tax break might have made sense a generation ago when the market was mainly investors protecting their long-term profits. But with speculators betting on short-term price movements, the loophole is just that - a loophole.
''It seemed like a reasonable compromise at the time to stop the straddle transactions,'' Mr. Toder said. ''In retrospect, if the trading is so short term, it seems a little silly to give them preferential treatment.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Military Leaders of U.S. and China Vow Closer Ties, but Bumps Remain

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The leaders of the Chinese and American militaries sought on Monday to cast aside decades of hostility between the two countries' armed services, pledging at a joint news conference here to pursue a ''great opportunity'' to create a shared vision of cooperation.
But neither indicated that his government was willing to alter positions on divisive issues, like Taiwan and the South China Sea, that have long hamstrung better relations. And the Chinese military chief, Gen. Chen Bingde, quickly voiced a string of complaints about American military policies that suggested their shared vision remained a distant dream. 
General Chen and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were midway through three days of talks, following up on a visit to Washington in May by General Chen, the chief of the People's Liberation Army general staff. Both men are under orders to improve the military relationship, one outcome of a summit in January between President Obama and President Hu Jintao of China.
Monday's news conference brought some evidence of progress toward that goal. The two sides agreed to hold counterpiracy maneuvers in the Gulf of Aden by year's end, to hold talks on operational safety in Hawaii and China, and to plan exercises in humanitarian relief for 2012. Such joint operations have been rare in recent years.
Admiral Mullen and General Chen also had warm words for each other. General Chen praised Admiral Mullen's ''tremendous efforts'' to improve military relations, adding that the unprecedented talks and exchanges of visits between the two sides this year send ''a very positive message to the international community of the shared commitment of the two militaries.''
Admiral Mullen said that the two sides ''can shrink from this great opportunity, or we can rise to meet it.''
''I believe I speak for General Chen when I say we both seek the latter,'' he added.
But there appeared to be little if any progress on the major issues that divide the two sides, something General Chen underscored in his remarks. In the 90-minute session, he complained about a recent trip to the United States by the Dalai Lama, whom the Chinese accuse of agitating for Tibetan independence, and about reconnaissance by American aircraft and ships off the Chinese coast. Among the main topics of Monday morning talks with Admiral Mullen, he said, was the attitude of unidentified American politicians toward China.
Three times, he raised complaints about recent American naval maneuvers in or near the South China Sea, including a joint exercise this week with the Australian and Japanese Navies and a late June exercise with the navy of the Philippines.
Admiral Mullen said the exercises were both small and long-scheduled. But General Chen was unsatisfied, noting that China had recently clashed with Vietnam and the Philippines over territorial claims in the region. ''At the least, I think this is bad timing,'' he said, adding later, ''it's not that difficult a thing to change a schedule.''
United States officials took similar offense in January, when China's air force elected to stage the much-ballyhooed first flight of its new stealth fighter jet on the day that Robert M. Gates, the defense secretary at the time, arrived for talks with senior Chinese leaders. The Chinese called it a coincidence.
Answering questions later, General Chen said that Chinese weapons experts were still conducting research and development on a new anti-ship missile system that experts have cast as a serious threat to American aircraft carriers patrolling the region. Adm. Robert Willard, who commands the United States Navy's Pacific fleet, said in December that the missile had reached initial operational capability, an important benchmark on the road to deployment.
Asked to explain the rapid expansion and modernization of China's military, General Chen quoted the former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who said China's Army would have to be patient until ordinary people's needs were met. Many of the improvements in the force were needed years ago but were deferred, he said.
He dismissed American concerns that the Chinese were deploying new and modern weapons to counter American forces, repeating China's standard explanation that the military is a defensive force. China's military technology is decades behind that of the Pentagon and will remain so, he said, and its spending is far behind that of the United States.
Indeed, he suggested, Americans should consider cutting their military budget. ''The United States is still recovering from the financial crisis, still has difficulties in its economy,'' he said. ''It would be a better thing if you did not spend so much money on the military and a little bit more in other areas, so as to play a very positive role, a very constructive role in world peace and stability.''

HEADLINE: Ideology Trumps Economics: Republicans' refusal to raise revenues is threatening the economy with a chaotic default

 BODY:
There is a huge gap in logic at the heart of the Republican intransigence on a debt-ceiling deal, and President Obama helped to illuminate it on Monday.
The party claims, as an article of faith, if not evidence, that the government's growing debt is the reason for persistent unemployment and economic stagnation. And yet Republicans are spurning the president's compromise offers to reduce that debt by trillions over the next decade because he is sensibly insisting that any deal include some increase in tax revenue.
''Where are they?'' Mr. Obama asked at his news conference. ''I mean, this is what they claim would be the single biggest boost to business certainty and confidence. So what's the holdup?'' 
The holdup, of course, is that Republicans are far more committed to the ideological goals of cutting government and taxes than they are committed to cutting the deficit. They rejected several compromise offers by the White House, even though any revenue increases would be far outweighed by spending cuts.
Republican rejectionism was on clear display Saturday night when John Boehner, the House speaker, was forced to abandon a plan he and the president had discussed to reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years.
The plan would have gone much too far in cutting discretionary spending and entitlements, taking too much money from the economy at a time when it desperately needs government investment. But it would have been better than the slashing and burning the Republicans have been demanding because it would have raised from $700 billion to $1 trillion in additional revenue beginning in 2013 by ending tax breaks and deductions for corporations and the rich, or by ending the Bush tax cuts for families making $250,000 or more.
The House Republican leader, Eric Cantor, insisted to Mr. Boehner that his members, shackled to antitax pledges, could not accept it, or anything similar. Now negotiators are trying to reach agreement on a deal to lower the deficit by $2 trillion or so over a decade. But the consequences for the economy and Americans' lives would be just as disastrous if all of those ''savings'' come out of essential government programs, with no additional revenue.
Mr. Boehner's refusal to push back against his party's ideologues is only feeding their worst impulses. Many House Republicans have gone even further than Mr. Cantor and have rejected any deal that raises the debt ceiling, whether it contains revenue increases or not.
Representative Michele Bachmann and Reince Priebus, the Republican national chairman, airily and irresponsibly insist that the government will find some other way to pay its bills. That's dangerous nonsense. And as the president forcefully noted, a default could propel interest rates skyward, throw millions more Americans out of work, and create another recession.
It was good to see Mr. Obama challenging the Republicans' illogic and pushing them to make a deal before it's too late. But we fear the sort of deal he is willing to consider, based overwhelmingly on spending cuts, could still consign the country to more years of economic stagnation.
The president spoke about the need to create an infrastructure bank, to maintain unemployment benefits, and to protect the elderly and the poor. But keeping those goals will be nearly impossible with a debt deal that cuts three times as much spending as it raises revenue. A balanced plan, like the one Senator Kent Conrad is circulating among Senate Democrats, would cut spending and raise revenue equally, and would make it possible to pay for programs that kick-start the economy.
Americans need to hear the hard economic truth that there is no way to both cut the deficit and revive the economy without finding additional sources of revenue. As the president himself said on Monday, ''If not now, when?''

HEADLINE: Debt Contagion Threatens Italy

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN and RACHEL DONADIO

 BODY:
Throughout Europe's debt crisis, Italy has largely managed to steer clear of the troubles that have engulfed its profligate Mediterranean neighbors.
But the contagion that started in the euro zone's smaller countries is suddenly moving to some of its largest. As Greece teeters on the brink of a default, the game has changed: Investors are taking aim at any country suffering from a combination of high debt, slow growth and political dysfunction -- and Italy has it all, in spades.
In recent days, Italy has become Europe's next weak link after Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, harmed in particular by a power struggle between Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his finance minister, Giulio Tremonti. The dispute threatens to turn the euro zone's third-largest economy, after Germany and France, into one of its biggest liabilities.
On Monday, the Italian government struggled to rein in the tensions, as fears rose that political paralysis could make it harder for Italy to embrace the austerity demanded by outsiders to reduce one of the highest debt levels in the world. European policy makers also sought to figure out how they would put out a bigger fire if Italy were to succumb. 
Those jitters hit stock markets on Monday not just in Italy, where the major index fell nearly 4 percent, but across much of Europe as well, with the markets in France and Germany off more than 2 percent each. The United States was affected, too, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down about 1.8 percent on European debt fears and worries about the showdown in Washington over raising the United States debt limit.
''Italy is too big to fail,'' said Moises Naim, a senior associate in the international economics program at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington. ''If Italy really gets hit by contagion because of political mismanagement, it would be a threat not only to the euro zone, but to the global economy.''
Political soap operas in Italy -- especially those featuring Mr. Berlusconi -- are nothing new. Nor do they usually matter much to financial markets, even after the debt crisis hit Europe. The widespread problems in Italy's economy, which has been sluggish for the better part of a decade, also rang few alarm bells.
What's more, Italy's banks are sound; they never speculated in a housing bubble. The current annual budget deficit is low, at about 4.6 percent of gross domestic product. And while Italy issues the largest amount of bonds of any euro zone country, Italians own about half the debt, making it less vulnerable to the follies of financial markets.
But with interest rates rising, Italy's economy is not growing fast enough to cover an accumulated debt load of 120 percent of gross domestic product, the second-highest in Europe, after Greece. The International Monetary Fund expects growth to pick up only slightly, to 1.3 percent in 2012.
In a sign of how quickly things have turned against the country, the stock market regulator imposed emergency rules on Monday against speculation after shares in Italian banks slumped for a fifth consecutive session. The cost of insuring Italy's sovereign debt against default surged to a record high, and the interest on its 10-year bond leaped to a record 5.67 percent.
While that is still well below what Greece pays, analysts say Italy will have serious problems if its borrowing costs exceed 6 percent.
''Italy is a banana republic that didn't depend so much on foreign capital in the past, but now it does, and markets are less forgiving,'' said Daniel Gros, the director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. ''Italy is in the danger zone; that is quite clear now.''
Italy tends to function best in crisis management mode, analysts say, and Mr. Berlusconi has begun to acknowledge the seriousness of the dangers facing the country after a phone conversation with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Sunday.
Today, Mr. Berlusconi ''understands the risks objectively because the situation is dramatic,'' said Stefano Folli, the chief political columnist for the financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore.
Mr. Folli and other analysts predicted that the Italian Parliament would rally and pass a 40 billion euro ($56 billion) austerity package that Mr. Tremonti had championed -- even if it turns out to be one of the last significant acts of a government running out of political capital.
Last week, Mr. Berlusconi prompted a sell-off in Italian bonds by suggesting that Mr. Tremonti, a longtime political rival and the sole guardian of fiscal prudence in Italy, could be elbowed out of government, imperiling the austerity package, the details of which still remain shrouded in confusion.
''He thinks he's a genius and everyone else is stupid,'' Mr. Berlusconi said of Mr. Tremonti in an interview published on Friday in La Repubblica, the center-left daily. ''He is the only minister who is not a team player,'' he added.
At the same time, Mr. Tremonti has other problems. Naples prosecutors are seeking the arrest of one of his close advisers, Marco Milanese, a member of Parliament who has been accused of accepting jewelry, cars and other luxury items from an Italian businessman.
Until the accusations were made public, Mr. Tremonti had been staying in an apartment owned by Mr. Milanese. He moved out soon after they surfaced.
Even if Parliament approves the austerity measures in the coming weeks, the scandal around Mr. Tremonti could grow.
''I don't think he can withstand this scandal -- it's becoming unsustainable,'' said Massimo Giannini, the business editor and deputy editor of La Repubblica. ''He has too many enemies inside the government.''
In Brussels on Monday, Mrs. Merkel said: ''I have firm confidence in the Italian government to approve exactly such a budget -- I spoke on the telephone with the Italian prime minister yesterday on precisely this issue -- and to signal that Italy feels a duty to consolidation and fighting debt.''
''The euro itself is stable,'' she added, ''but we have a problem in some countries.''
For Italy, the biggest worry right now is that its fate may rest as much in Athens, Brussels and Berlin as it does in Rome. Only a week ago, it looked as if Greece might be turning a corner on its problems, after the government managed to push through an austerity package and French and German banks worked on ways to help Greece avoid default.
But the plan by banks fell apart over the weekend, and policy makers are at an impasse on how to require contributions from private creditors as part of a second Greek bailout.
''Markets were getting more optimistic, and suddenly they're saying, 'My God, this is as bad as it ever was,' '' said Peter Westaway, the chief European economist at Nomura International and a former Bank of England official. ''Now, it looks as if Italy and Spain are going to be involved, too. And that makes the problem an order of magnitude more complicated for policy makers.''
Mr. Westaway cautioned against getting too negative about Italy. For one thing, the austerity being sought is nowhere near as crushing as what Greece is having to take on.
Still, if the crisis were to take hold in Italy, the problems for the euro union would dwarf all others to date. European banks have total claims and potential exposures of $998.7 billion to Italy, more than six times the $162.4 billion exposure they have to Greece, according to Barclays Capital. European banks have $774 billion of exposure to Spain and $532 billion of exposure to Ireland.
In the United States, banks are also more exposed to Italy than to any other euro zone country, to the tune of $269 billion, according to Barclays. American banks' next biggest exposure is to Spain, with total claims estimated at $179 billion.
But at the end of the day, ''If Italy goes, it's no longer a domino,'' said Mr. Gros, the analyst in Brussels. ''It's a brick.''

HEADLINE: Budget Talks Beginning To Take On a Testy Air

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even before they gathered around a long table in the Cabinet Room for another round of budget negotiations on Monday, President Obama and Republican leaders began taking shots at one another.
Mr. Obama declared at a news conference that he would not sign a ''stopgap'' measure to avert a federal default, and he challenged Republicans to ''eat our peas'' by supporting a large deficit-reduction deal. Speaker John A. Boehner countered that Republicans would not back a package with any tax increases, and said that even agreeing to an increase in the debt limit was a big concession.
Once the private meeting actually started, the fireworks subsided, Democratic and Republican officials briefed on the talks said, though if anything, the debate over specific policy choices served only to reinforce the chasm between the two sides. The officials described a cordial, though intense, debate in which Mr. Obama and the eight leaders from both parties delved deeply into the nitty-gritty. 
Mr. Obama, after restating his pitch for a far-reaching deal that could produce savings of $4 trillion or so over a decade, turned the floor over to the House majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia. Mr. Cantor, Democratic officials said, presented a Republican proposal for a more modest agreement that drew heavily on earlier negotiations steered by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Those talks had led to proposals for nearly $1.2 trillion in federal agency cuts, with $300 billion more coming from programs like agriculture subsidies and federal pension programs. More than $350 billion would also come from the federal Medicare and Medicaid health programs.
Much of that would come from Medicare, where Republicans proposed to squeeze $246 billion in savings by reductions in payments for home health care, as well as increasing co-payments for laboratory services. Democrats at the session rejected the Medicare proposal, saying they would not back reductions in benefits to obtain merely a mid-range budget agreement.
Based on the most aggressive estimates of cuts that might find bipartisan support, a senior Democratic official said, this Republican plan would produce savings of somewhat more than $1.5 trillion, well short of the $2.4 trillion that Republicans say is needed to justify an increase in the debt ceiling until February 2013.
And lacking any tax-related measures, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House minority whip, told the group he was not certain he could corral a single Democratic vote for the plan, officials said.
Mr. Hoyer's pessimism was telling, Democratic officials said, because he had played a key role in rounding up Democratic support for previous budget deals. It suggested that Democrats, too, were retrenching on their willingness to compromise on entitlements to produce a big agreement.
The president, officials said, argued that the Republican proposal did not add up arithmetically or politically. He told the leaders of both parties to return to their members and see if they could revive support for a larger deal, where the sacrifices would be even harder but the payoff, he contended, would be a historic remedy to the nation's perilous finances.
As these talks head into a critical phase, Mr. Obama has steadily increased the pressure on Congress, saying that Republicans and Democrats must both accept painful compromises to get a deal done. At his news conference, he said, ''If the basic proposition is 'it's my way or the highway,' we're probably not going to get something done because we've got divided government.''
In one sign of the high stakes, the president had a sharp exchange with Mr. Boehner over entitlement cuts. The speaker, seeking to show that Republicans are sharing in the sacrifice, told Mr. Obama that voting to cut these programs was not easy for Republicans, either.
''You guys already voted for them,'' the president said, referring to the Republican endorsement of a budget plan drafted by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, which contains deep cuts in Medicare.
''Excuse us for trying to lead,'' Mr. Boehner replied, according to a Republican account that was confirmed by Democrats.
Such exchanges are becoming more common in the negotiations, as they move from broad generalities to the fine details of budget items. In a meeting on Sunday night, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the Republican whip, raised his voice in rejecting added tax revenues, though officials said he immediately apologized.
Indeed, the tone of the meetings has generally remained polite, officials in both parties said, and Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner have gone out of their way to praise each other publicly in an effort to preserve good will. Until last weekend, when Mr. Boehner pulled back from a $4 billion deal because of resistance from his rank-and-file members, he and the president were discussing some radical ideas.
Mr. Boehner signaled he was open to $1 trillion in new revenues, though he insisted on reforming the tax code to offset the impact of allowing Bush-era tax cuts for high-income people to expire in 2013.
Mr. Obama agreed to consider a change in Medicare, which would have pushed up the eligibility requirement for recipients from the age of 65 to 67 by 2036 -- a concession that officials said was possible because of the greater availability of health insurance provided by the administration's health reform.
He also agreed to consider changing the cost-of-living index for calculating Social Security benefits, in a way that economists say could whittle down the payments over time, but put the program on firmer footing. A Democratic official insisted that any changes to Social Security would not threaten the system, which Mr. Obama viewed as the ''crown jewel of progressive government.''
The lawmakers appeared united on only one point, officials said: they agreed to act to prevent the United States from defaulting on its debt, which the Treasury Department said could happen as soon as Aug. 2, when the government's borrowing authority expires. To draft and pass legislation before that deadline, officials said, these meetings need to produce an agreement within two weeks.
With the participants agreeing to resume talks on Tuesday at 3:45 p.m., and every day after that until they reach a deal, it was not clear how long the deliberations could go without tempers flaring. Mr. Obama alluded to the ''Groundhog Day'' quality of the proceedings, when he joked to photographers at the beginning of the session, ''this is the same shot you had yesterday, except we're wearing ties today.''
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who was not wearing a tie on either day, supplied one of the rare moments of levity when she said that she had sent flowers to former President George W. Bush for his birthday.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Democrats Pressed to Retain Seat

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- California's 36th Congressional District has been in Democratic hands for more than a decade. It was never a district Democrats thought they might have to worry about after its longtime representative, Jane Harman, stepped down in February.
But instead, the race has turned into a surprisingly close, bitterly partisan contest, with a Los Angeles city councilwoman, Janice Hahn, a Democrat, fighting off a challenge from a Republican businessman, Craig Huey, in a runoff election on Tuesday. 
The contest is the first test here of a nonpartisan election system passed by voters last year in which the top two vote-getters in a primary face each other in a runoff, regardless of party, if no candidate wins a majority. Many had expected that both runoff candidates would be Democrats in a district that snakes down the city's western edge from Venice Beach to San Pedro.
But Ms. Hahn, once the heavy favorite, now appears to be in a tight race with Mr. Huey, according to polling done by both parties, as he continues the heavy spending that helped propel him into the runoff. Accordingly, in recent days, her campaign has employed help from big political guns: Bill Clinton recorded several automated calls for her, and the Obama for America organization has put together phone banks to help turn out Democratic voters.
''That Obama for America is organizing for them shows they're running scared,'' said Tyler Q. Houlton, a spokesman for the Republican National Congressional Committee.
Ms. Hahn began the campaign with a number of advantages: in addition to the 12 percentage-point Democratic edge in voter registration in the district, she hails from a Los Angeles political dynasty -- her brother is a former mayor; her father was a longtime county supervisor -- and she has managed to raise more than $1.3 million. President Obama won the district by 31 points in 2008.
But Mr. Huey has mined his own deep pockets to help make the race competitive. He has lent and contributed almost $900,000 to his campaign, which he has used to attack Ms. Hahn and the Democrats on economic issues.
''We've really stayed focused on the economy,'' Mr. Huey said. ''And voters see businesses closing up and down the street, and they're responding to that message.''
Ms. Hahn, whose mother died on Monday, was not available for comment.
The unease Democrats are feeling now reflects the unpredictability of special elections like these in which turnout is usually low. In May, Kathy Hochul won a special election in New York to capture a Congressional seat that had been in Republican hands for four decades. And in January 2010, Scott Brown, a Republican, won the Massachusetts Senate seat that had been held by Edward M. Kennedy since he was elected to succeed his brother, John, in 1962.
David Wasserman, an editor at Cook Political Report, said special elections often come down to turning out a party's base, which can give outsiders an advantage over establishment candidates.
''Independent voters these days are willing to do anything to send a message to Washington that they're upset about the established order,'' Mr. Wasserman said. ''That's why this race is closer than it ought to be.''
Democrats said they still expected Ms. Hahn to win Tuesday's vote.
''In the end, it will still be a Democrat winning a Democratic seat,'' said Jennifer Crider, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

HEADLINE: Do You Believe in Magic?

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: No, but I believe in antibiotics.

 BODY:
OK, David Brooks has what amounts to a reply. I don't want to get into a tit for tat. But I do want to take on the claim that believing that simple actions can bring big improvements in the economy amounts to belief in magic.
The key point here is the difference between raising the economy's long-run growth rate, which is very hard, and increasing demand when the economy is operating below potential, which isn't hard at all.
Look: under normal conditions, when interest rates are well above zero and there's room for conventional monetary policy to operate, we actually take it for granted that the Fed can produce dramatic acceleration of short-run growth. When Paul Volcker decided in 1982 that the economy had suffered enough, he loosened the reins -- and it was Morning in America. 
Now, of course,the Fed funds rate is already zero, so Bernanke can't just slash the rate. But the same logic through which looser monetary policy can produce a rapid economic turnaround now applies to fiscal expansion.
Stroking your chin and saying, well, I don't believe in magical solutions because experience shows that raising growth is hard sounds serious, but it's actually silly. It's like saying that it's really hard to extend the human lifespan, so it's foolish to believe that an infection can be quickly cured with a dose of antibiotics.
But haven't we tried a huge fiscal expansion? No, we haven't. The ratio of spending to GDP is up because GDP has fallen and safety net programs like unemployment insurance and Medicaid are covering more people -- that is, what we're looking at isn't stimulus, it's the consequences of the slump.
The point is that realizing that there's a lot you can do to reverse a short-term slump isn't magical thinking -- it's what basic macroeconomics, what we learned through hard thinking and hard experience, tells us. Rejecting all that may sound judicious, but it's actually an act of intellectual amnesia.

HEADLINE: River as Teacher

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A learning journey along the Hudson River forges links among disciplines and schools.

 BODY:
If my "mild" stroke (is there such a thing?) had not intervened, I would have been heading tonight to the banks of the Hudson River, on the campus of Marist College, to talk about energy technology and policy with participants in River Summer. This annual project aims to foster a multi-disciplinary approach to watershed issues at faculties at universities and colleges up and down the Hudson.
I hope you'll explore the River Summer blog, and I'd love it if you could cite other efforts to foster ways of learning and teaching that are built less around subjects -- limnology, political science -- and more around integrative concepts like a watershed. (Check out this YouTube video of a watershed in western North Carolina to see how such an approach can look.)
One thing that attracted me to academia was the potential to build networks -- both within a single school and among campuses focused on common issues -- for sharing new ways to learn and for building collaborative projects. The Environmental Consortium of more than 110 schools along the Hudson, which created this summer faculty experience (and is run out of Pace University, my academic home), is a model I could see extending globally.
Imagine if lessons learned along the Hudson in the second half of the 20th century, as the river moved from being an industrial corridor and sewer to scenic marvel and recreation hub, could facilitate leapfrogging along the Yangtze or Indus.
Imagine if the lessons learned as the mayor of Seoul, South Korea, built the support he needed to rip out clogged highways and restore a long-hidden urban stream could help officials in Yonkers, N.Y., keep up momentum as they liberate the Saw Mill River from its subterranean confines.
This approach is hardly restricted to higher education. One of the most powerful examples I've encountered is Trout in the Classroom (read my article describing students in Brooklyn and the trout fingerling they called Godzilla). Another is River of Words (my wife runs a local variant of this poetry-and-science learning experience).

HEADLINE: A Plague of Danglers

BYLINE: PHILIP B. CORBETT


HIGHLIGHT: The problem comes in many guises, but the basic formula is familiar. When a modifying phrase precedes the main clause of a sentence, the person or thing being described should come right after that phrase.

 BODY:
Notes from the newsroom on grammar, usage and style. (Some frequently asked questions are here.)
It's an old lament, but new examples abound: danglers are everywhere in our prose.
The problem comes in many guises, but the basic formula is familiar. When a modifying phrase precedes the main clause of a sentence, the person or thing being described should come right after that phrase. Otherwise, the modifier dangles, detached from its referent, creating awkwardness, confusion or even comedy.
Just a few recent cases, from an almost limitless supply (thanks to my colleague Ken Paul for spotting several):
Shortly after the show, he disappeared with Hilaria Thomas, his sparkling date, a black ponytail elastic still wrapped around his left ring finger. Like the wild raccoon that dawdled onto the stage during the excellent performance that night, we thought it advisable to let him wander off into the dark of Central Park.
It is not "we" being compared to the raccoon, but "him" (in this case, Alec Baldwin).
Unlike Mort Zuckerman, another real estate mogul who moved into the media business by acquiring The Atlantic, U.S. News & World Report and The Daily News in New York and aggressively embraced the platform it afforded, you won't see Mr. Kushner on "Meet the Press."
It is Mr. Kushner who is being compared to Mort Zuckerman, so that noun should come immediately after the modifying phrase. (In this case, the long and awkward appositive phrase describing Zuckerman adds to the confusion.)
By suspending the payments, the money could be used to pay other bills.
For those parsing at home, this is a dangling gerund; the participle form, "suspending," is used as a noun, the object of the preposition "by." But the rule is the same. The noun being referred to should come immediately after the modifying phrase. In this case, we could say, "By suspending the payments, the post office could use the money to pay other bills."
By changing their color from black to white, it can seem as if more police cars are on the streets.
Same problem. The modifying phrase dangles, with nothing to modify. Rephrase.
In the 2008 election, in particular, his popularity was overwhelming, winning with 78 percent of the vote.
Here the modifying participial phrase comes at the end rather than the beginning, but the problem is similar. "Winning" should modify "he," but there's no "he" to be found.
Four years ago, he and Ms. Brady married at Giorgio's on the North Shore of Long Island, after proposing to her at a hockey game.
Here, "proposing" refers only to "he," not to the compound "he and Ms. Brady." Simple fix: "... after he proposed to her at a hockey game."
In a Word
This week's grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.
It was once said of Ms. Sevigny, when she was 19, after Jay McInerney wrote a profile about her in The New Yorker, that she was the coolest girl in the world. Laurels of her part-nerdy, part-perverse sense of fashion have been bestowed at her ever since, prompting Bob Morris to ask, in The New York Times in 2000, "What is it about the young indie actress Chloe Sevigny that has turned the fashion world into a pack of dogs howling about her as if she were a full moon, or a lamb chop?''
Strange preposition choices made for an awkward sentence. "Laurels for" would be more natural, and "bestowed on."
Europe's debt crisis, as well as natural disasters and political uprisings, are prompting investors both big and small to seek out investments that promise to protect their portfolios in the event of economic Armageddon.
As we've noted before, phrases like "as well as," "coupled with" and "along with" are parenthetical and do not make the subject plural. Make it, "Europe's debt crisis ... is prompting investors."
So, even as Mr. Blagojevich (the fourth Illinois governor in recent memory to face prison) awaited his sentence, some here - including leaders of the deluge of reform efforts that had followed his arrest in late 2008 - say that, in the end, they are not convinced that Mr. Blagojevich's conviction will drastically change the pattern of corruption for which politicians in this state have become notorious.
With one insert in parentheses, another in dashes, and various other detours, this sentence is awfully hard to read.
Although the election is still far off and neither the PAN nor the PRD has chosen their candidates yet, the parties will have to work hard to dent Mr. Pena Nieto's popularity.
The singular verb "has chosen" is correct, but the pronoun and object should also be singular: neither party has chosen "its candidate" yet.
But defense lawyers argued that their clients either had not known that a section of the standpipe was missing or that they did not have the expertise to know the significance of the standpipe.
The two parts aren't parallel. Make it "that their clients either had not known ... or did not have the expertise to know."
In the meantime, several other states have legalized same-sex marriage, dinging California's reputation as a cultural trendsetter, something mentioned by several gay couples on Sunday.
No reason for the slang "dinging."
Her home was just feet from the levee, and she frantically shifted through her possessions Wednesday in advance of what she has taken to calling the "prairie tsunami.''
Presumably we wanted the idiomatic "sifted through"?
Mr. Weinhoeft estimated that about 25 of them are still being driven in New York City.
"About" is generally redundant with "estimate."
The trial and retrial of Ms. Knox, a 24-year-old from Seattle, has attracted international attention because of its lurid details and the differing portraits of the defendant, who was alternately described as a hard-working college student caught up in an arcane foreign justice system and a marijuana-smoking criminal.
Compound subjects ("trial and retrial") need a plural verb: "have attracted," not "has." (Also, make it "their" lurid details.)
In the last 15 months, three new drugs that extended the lives of prostate cancer patients have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and several other promising medicines are in clinical trials.
Without a comma after "Administration," the reader is left for a moment thinking that approval has also been granted by "several other promising ..."
Other officials in the parade included State Senator Thomas K. Duane and Assemblyman Daniel J. O'Donnell, both Manhattan Democrats; the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman; and Congresswoman Nydia M. Velazquez, whose district includes parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.
Our style is "Representative."
Federal health officials released on Tuesday their final selection of nine graphic warning labels to cover the top half of cigarette packages beginning next year, over the opposition of tobacco manufacturers.
If the time element can't go after the direct object (because the object is too long, as here), put it before the verb. Here's what the stylebook says:In fluid writing, the best place for the time element is after the verb - immediately after, if the verb has no direct object: The dean of Cordero University announced on Tuesday that undergraduates would be required to perform four hours of community service a week. But if there is a direct object, the object should immediately follow the verb, and the time element should ideally follow both: Mayor Leslie T. Baranek ordered the police on Tuesday to arrest jaywalkers.
When the direct object is long or cumbersome, the time element must come before the verb, though smoothness will usually suffer: Mayor Leslie T. Baranek on Tuesday ordered the police, already complaining of overwork and threatening a slowdown, to arrest jaywalkers.
After Deadline examines questions of grammar, usage and style encountered by writers and editors of The Times. It is adapted from a weekly newsroom critique overseen by Philip B. Corbett, the associate managing editor for standards, who is also in charge of The Times's style manual.

HEADLINE: Planning for Retirement While Helping Out the Children

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Add the need to worry about adult children to the list of financial unknowns, like longevity or the possibility of moving to a nursing home.

 BODY:
No wonder retirement planning is getting more complex. Many older Americans' sense of financial security remains rattled by the recession, and now many of them expect to have to help other family members financially, including adult children, after they retire.
Those are some findings of the SunAmerica Retirement Re-Set Study, a telephone survey conducted in April by Harris Interactive on behalf of SunAmerica Financial Group and Age Wave, which track aging trends. The survey questioned 1,001 people aged 55 and older about their views on retirement and financial security.
Half of those surveyed said they expected to have to balance their own retirement plans with the expectation of providing financial help to family members. And in turn, 70 percent of those who said they would have to help relatives indicated they would need to help adult children, specifically.
"The last few years have left a large chunk of the population in a tighter situation than they'd like to be in," says Ken Dychtwald, chief executive of Age Wave. "So if they need help making payments on a home, or have kids in college, people are turning to the bank of mom and dad."
The need to provide additional support can complicate one's retirement savings calculations, he says. Previously, the biggest wild cards in retirement savings were how long you might live and unanticipated health costs, like a nursing home. "That hasn't changed," he said. "But now you have to add to it the cost of having to help other members of your family."
In an initial version of the survey conducted 10 years ago, most people surveyed expected to retire at age 64, but this year's survey finds that expectation is age 69; people expect to work longer to replenish their nest eggs, and they also say they consider some work fulfilling. (That change is already showing up in employment data, the study notes: 16 percent of those over 65 are now employed, compared with less than 13 percent in 2001.)
Do you expect you will have to help other family members, like adult children, financially in retirement? How is that affecting your plans for retirement savings?

HEADLINE: A Half-Century Later, Student Artwork Sprouts Where 'Sociopaths' Roamed

BYLINE: DAVID W. DUNLAP


HIGHLIGHT: The scene along West 84th Street in Manhattan has changed in 50 years, with children's sculptures replacing the weapons of yore.

 BODY:
Fifty years ago, 84th Street, between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, beat out some pretty stiff competition to be designated the "worst block" in New York City - a "ghetto of sociopaths," in the words of the rector of a nearby Episcopal church who despaired that city officials would ever do anything to clean up the mess.
What propelled 84th Street past other contenders was a blockwide street brawl that erupted on July 5, 1961, involving about 400 combatants armed with knives and lye, which sent one man to the hospital after it was thrown in his face. Police officers' attempts to quell the disturbance by firing shots in the air were unavailing. Nine patrol cars had to be dispatched to break up the melee.
A visit to the block one day last week revealed a much different landscape. Granted: the measure of so complex an ecosystem as a city block cannot be taken in an hour. But for that hour, on that quiet block, it can be reported that most passers-by were mothers walking fearlessly with little children.
The real delight of the block was to be found at the east end, alongside Public School 9. There, five exuberant student artworks - all but one made from recycled plastic bottles or bags - ornament the otherwise forbidding institutional expanse. They all give delectable voice to the notion of blooming, which was the theme of the school's Art Night this year.
"Parents, students and any teachers that can be there - but particularly our art teachers - are on hand for Art Night to showcase the work of their kids," said Tara Maurice, who has children in the first grade and in pre-kindergarten. "We have fantastically talented art teachers at P.S. 9, and many parents that are architects and designers."
Ms. Maurice said a deliberate choice was made this year to use recycled materials as a significant element in the Art Night projects. Not only were lots of bottles and bags brought into the school, but the stands from last year's projects were reused. The community sculptures, as they are called, were under the supervision of Lilia Rivera, another parent.
"The actual sculpture happens during the Art Night event," Ms. Maurice said. "Although there is a plan - of course when you have that many hands on deck, things take their own path and directions, sometimes surprisingly. And that is the beauty of the event." Participants in Art Night get to sample international cuisine in a potluck dinner in which families bring dishes from their countries of origin.
The crew along 84th Street was much different 50 years ago, as described by McCandlish Phillips in The New York Times of July 7, 1961:Drunkenness. Unemployment. Gambling. Overcrowding. Prostitution. Homosexuality. Narcotics addiction. Despair. These are things that went into the making of a brawl on West 84th Street, in which 400 Negroes and Puerto Ricans battled Wednesday afternoon, fighting for they knew not what.
And these are the things that give the long block between Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues a sinister, brooding quality and make it look like a slice of the Bowery.
This is, clearly, more than a slum. A slum is good people in bad houses. But this, as one man put it yesterday, is a "ghetto of sociopaths."The man in question was the Rev. James A. Gusweller, rector of the Church of St. Matthew and St. Timothy at 26 West 84th Street, who had been shouting himself hoarse at city officials in his efforts to get some help.
When the government finally did respond, moved in part by the ugly episode of July 1961, it did just about the only thing it seemed to know how to do in those days: condemning the decrepit housing, razing it and erecting big public institutions on the vacant lots. Both P.S. 9 and the Louis D. Brandeis High School, across 84th Street, opened in 1965. But Mr. Phillips, writing on the fifth anniversary of the melee, said "they have not cured the problems of 'the worst block in the city.' "
When asked to reflect on those troubled times, which now seem so distant, Ms. Maurice noted that the school itself evolved year after year "as students change and new parents come in with ideas, passions and personalities." Given the way schools and cities change, Ms. Maurice said she was not startled to learn of the block's unsavory reputation a half century ago.
"It would surprise me more," she said, "to find out that the block we have now is the same block that existed 50 years ago."

HEADLINE: Playing the Odds to Land a Job

BYLINE: MATT FLEGENHEIMER


HIGHLIGHT: With 1,150 permanent jobs available, a casino set to open in late summer in Queens has received over 10,000 applications to date.

 BODY:
At the Resorts World Casino New York City, which is set to open in late summer, what are the odds of getting hired for a permanent position?
So far, no better than 1 in 8.
In a flagging economy, competition for jobs at the city's first casino is fierce: With 1,150 permanent positions available, the casino, at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens, has received more than 10,000 applications to date, according to its president, Michael Speller. More than 70 percent have come from Queens residents, he said, focusing on fields that include marketing, security and gambling. The construction created an additional 1,300 temporary jobs, the company said."When you look at the recent jobs report, the creation of jobs has been very difficult," Mr. Speller said. "But I think no matter what, there would be great enthusiasm. It's an entertainment facility."
The 1,150 permanent jobs represent almost a 50 percent increase from original targets of around 800. In particular, the company decided to add more positions in food and beverage service, Mr. Speller said.
Resorts World New York City will be the ninth video slot machine franchise to operate at a racetrack in New York State, but it is regarded as potentially the far most lucrative site.
While the company says the economy has played a role in the number of applications, its president says the appeal is much broader.
"This is the first casino in New York," he said. "It's very exciting for people."

HEADLINE: S.E.C. and Pension Systems to Examine Fletcher Fund

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Three Louisiana pension systems say a fund run by Alphonse Fletcher Jr., a prominent Wall Street investor, was unable to meet their requests to withdraw money. 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an inquiry into Fletcher Asset Management, a New York hedge fund run by Alphonse Fletcher Jr., a prominent Wall Street investor, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation.
News of the S.E.C. inquiry comes as three Louisiana public pension systems publicly raised questions about a Fletcher fund. The three pension systems said on Tuesday that they were hiring a team of experts to closely examine the Fletcher fund's financial records after it was unable to meet their requests to withdraw money from the fund earlier this year. 
Mr. Fletcher, 45, already drew headlines in February when he sued the Dakota apartment building on the West Side of Manhattan, accusing it and several of its board members of racial discrimination for denying his application to buy an apartment adjacent to his. 
The Dakota is fighting the lawsuit and said that it rejected Mr. Fletcher's application because it had serious concerns about his financial resources and suggested that his investment firm "may be seriously troubled."
Fletcher Asset Management says it has about $500 million under management. In 2008, it received about $100 million in investments from the Firefighters' Retirement System of Louisiana, the Municipal Employees' Retirement System of Louisiana and the New Orleans Firefighters' Pension and Relief Fund.
In March, two of the pension systems asked to withdraw some money from the Fletcher fund, called the FIA Leveraged Fund. The FIA fund offered the pension systems a minimum return of 12 percent a year, which it delivered, as verified by two large accounting firms.
The FIA fund invests in mostly small, lightly traded public companies. The public pension systems were allowed to earn a return in the range of 12 percent to 18 percent, they said in a statement. If the fund earned less than 12 percent, other investors, not the three pension systems, would absorb the losses. As a tradeoff, the pension systems' agreed to forgo any return above 18 percent.
Fletcher told the Louisiana pension systems that it could not meet the redemption request because a forced immediate sale of assets in the present market environment would probably result in the fund obtaining less than a fair price on the assets in the capital markets, according to the pension systems' statement.
So instead of redeeming the pension systems' interest with cash, Fletcher issued a promissory note equal to the amount of each pension system's redemption request. The note, which paid 5 percent annual interest, matures in two years, giving Fletcher that amount of time to return the cash. 
"The distribution of a promissory note in lieu of immediate cash has raised concerns with each of the system's respective boards," the pension systems said in their statement. "It gives rise to questions regarding the liquidity of the FIA fund and the accuracy of the financial statements issued by two renowned independent auditors." 
The pension systems' statement came after their dispute with the Fletcher fund was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Mr. Fletcher and his spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment. The person who disclosed the S.E.C. investigation did so on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it publicly.
The Louisiana pension systems said they had notified Fletcher that they were assembling a team of accountants and consultants to closely examine Fletcher's books and were considering retaining a forensic economist to assist in the examination. 
The pension systems said that so far Fletcher has fully cooperated with their preliminary inquiries. 
"However, if information is discovered that relates to FIA's solvency or if Fletcher's cooperation becomes less than forthcoming, then the retirement systems are poised to act quickly and decisively with any steps necessary to preserve the interests of the systems," the pension systems' statement said. 
"Much like President Reagan said during the era of detente: 'Trust, but verify,' " the statement said. 
Fletcher's problems are not limited to the S.E.C. and the Louisiana pensions. Last month, Seven Arts Pictures, a small independent film company, said Fletcher Asset Management had improperly terminated an agreement to invest at least $10 million in a joint moviemaking venture. Seven Arts said that it intended to seek "legal redress" from Fletcher, including at least $1.5 million in damages.

HEADLINE: In Mogadishu: A Lifeline For Somali Rape Victims

BYLINE: LISA SHANNON


HIGHLIGHT: Guest blogger Lisa Shannon writes about Sister Somalia, a new organization devoted to helping victims of gender-based violence in Somalia. 

 BODY:
"Why did you come here when no one else does?" The African Union communications director asked us over dinner at its compound in Mogadishu. Good question. We were warned against it, especially by war-zone regulars. It's been called the most dangerous city-or place-on earth. In fact, we had to delay our trip for two weeks due to multiple suicide bombings and riots inside the area controlled by Mogadishu's transitional government (TFG). So, why go? I gave the short answer, "We're supporting a local social entrepreneur in launching a sexual violence hotline."
But the real answer was more complicated. Somalia bothers me. The 1993 Black Hawk Down incident was tragic not only for the loss of United States servicemen, but because many experts credit this loss with a shift in American public sentiment and policy toward mass atrocity in Africa. In effect, we collectively flipped off our empathy switch, approaching African crises like Rwanda, Congo and Darfur as "Operation Not Worth It." But no country has been more written off than Somalia. And in Somalia, no group has been more written off than women.
When I initially inquired about helping women in Somalia a few years ago, Washington DC-based policy experts told me, "No one goes to Somalia." So I let it go. Then a few a months ago, I met Katy Grant, co-founder of Prism Partnerships, a non-profit that links donors with local social entrepreneurs in several African countries, including Somalia. The 38-year-old British mother of three had traveled to Somalia on humanitarian missions more than 40 times in five years, including during two pregnancies.
Katy was proof positive that working in a place most aid groups deemed too risky was, in fact, possible. The two of us traveled to Mogadishu earlier this week to help launch a new women's program with a local social entrepreneur. After leaving the African Union- secured area, we wove through the sun-bleached, sand-and-rubble strewn back alleys of Mogadishu's bombed-out Kilometer Four neighborhood. We reached the Elman Peace and Human Rights Center, where we were greeted by director Fartun Abdisalaan Adan. 
Fartun's husband was murdered in 1996 for his human rights work. She escaped to Canada to raise her three daughters, but in 2007, when her girls were old enough to live on their own, Fartun moved back to Mogadishu to continue Elman's work. "I still worry. My husband got killed." Fartun told me. "Every day I get home at night and am relieved, okay, today we are safe. But I take the risk."
Recently, survivors of gender violence have begun to flock to Fartun and the Elman Center for refuge, and to participate in group counseling sessions over tea and snacks. The women of Somalia-recently named one of the five worst places to be female-face multi-layered issues: The culture devalues women, with rigid structures of inequality including near universal female genital mutilation, domestic violence, and economic dependence. Add to that the chaos of conflict, forcing women to pack up and run from here to there and back again to avoid flying bullets, daily struggles to keep their children alive amid food shortages, no access to health care, soaring maternal mortality rates, and total breakdown of access to livelihoods and coping mechanisms, all in the face of rampant sexual violence.
And then there is Al-Shabab. The radical, militant Islamic group linked to Al-Qaeda rules 90% of central and south Somalia with utter impunity. Not only do they abduct and imprison through forced marriage, terrorize and gang rape. If women complain, they are often accused of adultery and speaking against the brotherhood, punishable by death. The execution methods of choice: Stoning or beheading.
In our meeting at Elman, the first woman to share was petite 17-year-old Amina (not her real name). Her best friend, Hawa, who lived next door, helped with childcare and cooking duties. Then a foreign Shabab came to Hawa's home and asked to marry her. Her father refused. They killed him. Shortly afterward, Amina was at home when she heard a commotion out front. She walked outside to find a group of Shabab higher-ups digging a hole. Amina watched as they dragged Hawa out of the house, shoved her in the hole, and slammed large rocks against Hawa's head. She died. They buried her in the hole. Then last month, a Shabab followed Amina home. He pushed her inside her own hut, followed by five more Shabab. The six gang raped Amina in front of her younger siblings. She sees her attackers every day, and is now afraid to leave the house, afraid to sleep, afraid to go to the bathroom at night for fear of another attack.
And yet Amina has left the house, empowered by assistance by and support from Sister Somalia, a new program developed by Fartun, in collaboration with Prism Partnerships and my new organization, A Thousand Sisters. Sister Somalia was developed to support female Somali victims of gender based violence, like Amina, or Nadifa, who was gang raped in front of her children and then arrested for making "false accusations against the government."
Sister Somalia offers the first sexual violence hotline in Mogadishu, which hopes to serve 300 women a year with counseling, medical services, business starter kits, and other assistance specific to a particular case. Amina's assistance package, for example, will additionally include an emergency grant to relocate with her family, away from her attackers. Each woman who walks through the door will also receive a letter from a "sister" abroad. We hope to raise $120,000 per year to make it happen. How is a broke activist like me planning to pull this off? Just like every stage of my journey with Congo, I don't know exactly. But I'm betting we can find at least 1,000 Americans who would welcome the opportunity to show up for women in Somalia, through writing a letter or giving at least $10 per month.
Yes, Mogadishu is scary. Our security detail offered us our perfunctory flak-jackets like he was passing out after-dinner mints. But sitting in a room with these women smiling sweetly, fanning themselves with the colorful cards and photos sent through our first batch of supporters, Somalia did not feel like I expected. We spent many months in anxiety-ridden discussions about security risks, engaged in "is it worth it?" debates about a 24-hour trip. Yet, Fartun chooses to face down death every single day. Amina, only 17 years old, crossed the frontlines of this war, alone, to talk with us. Every woman who spoke risked her life to do so, with the hope of help. As Katy pointed out in our many discussions, security may be the last frontier of equality: "Why do I deserve security, when another does not?" In hindsight, all my frantic measurements of risk seem self-congratulatory and, quite frankly, embarrassing. How could I have ever thought these women weren't worth it? 
In a place like Somalia, big picture solutions are scarce. Like in so many conflicts, women are caught between men with guns, shrouded in a culture of impunity, with no refuge. I asked the women what they would like to say to people around the world. They mumbled and echoed each other, quickly arriving at a single message. "We all have individual problems," their appointed spokeswoman said. "But we all want support. And for people to hear us."
Our visit was a first step. On our second day, Nadifa showed me her now sweat-worn letter that,since receiving it, she had kept tucked in her skirt, next to her belly, for comfort. As we said our goodbyes, I heard the women mumble between themselves and to us: Walala. Sister.
Lisa Shannon is author of the book A Thousand Sisters, and founder of Run for Congo Women and the new organization, A Thousand Sisters.

HEADLINE: Are We About to Repeat the Mistakes of 1937?

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: A tightening of monetary and fiscal policy in the belief that the Great Depression had run its course provides a cautionary tale, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Friday's jobs report clearly indicates that the economy remains weak, yet the pressure to reverse stimulus and begin tightening fiscal and monetary policy has become overwhelming.
The Federal Reserve has already ended its policy of quantitative easing, and many of its regional bank presidents are demanding higher interest rates to forestall inflation. Republicans and Democrats in Congress appear to agree that large spending cuts must accompany a rise in the debt limit, which will be hit on Aug. 2 if Congress doesn't act.
Some economists are getting very nervous. With the economy in a fragile state, it may not take much to bring on another recession. Even a small amount of fiscal or monetary tightening may be enough to do that.
It is starting to look like 1937 all over again. As the table below indicates, the economy made a significant recovery after hitting bottom in 1932, when real gross domestic product fell 13 percent. The contraction moderated considerably in 1933, and in 1934 growth was robust, with real G.D.P. rising 11 percent. Growth was also strong in 1935 and 1936, which brought the unemployment rate down more than half from its peak and relieved the devastating deflation that was at the root of the economy's problems.
By 1937, President Roosevelt and the Federal Reserve thought self-sustaining growth had been restored and began worrying about unwinding the fiscal and monetary stimulus, which they thought would become a drag on growth and a source of inflation. There was also a strong desire to return to normality, in both monetary and fiscal policy.

On the fiscal side, Roosevelt was under pressure from his Treasury secretary, Henry Morgenthau, to balance the budget. Like many conservatives today, Mr. Morgenthau worried obsessively about business confidence and was convinced that balancing the budget would be expansionary. In the words of the historian John Morton Blum, Mr. Morgenthau said he believed recovery "depended on the willingness of business to increase investments, and this in turn was a function of business confidence," adding, "In his view only a balanced budget could sustain that confidence."
Roosevelt ordered a very big cut in federal spending in early 1937, and it fell to $7.6 billion in 1937 and $6.8 billion in 1938 from $8.2 billion in 1936, a 17 percent reduction over two years.
At the same time, taxes increased sharply because of the introduction of the payroll tax. Federal revenues rose to $5.4 billion in 1937 and $6.7 billion in 1938, from $3.9 billion in 1936, an increase of 72 percent. As a consequence, the federal deficit fell from 5.5 percent of G.D.P. in 1936 to a mere 0.5 percent in 1938. The deficit was just $89 million in 1938.
At the same time, the Federal Reserve was alarmed by inflation rates that were high by historical standards, as well as by the large amount of reserves in the banking system, which could potentially fuel a further rise in inflation. Using powers recently granted by the Banking Act of 1935, the Fed doubled reserve requirements from August 1936 to May 1937. Higher reserve requirements restricted the amount of money banks could lend and caused them to tighten credit.
This combination of fiscal and monetary tightening - which conservatives advocate today - brought on a sharp recession beginning in May 1937 and ending in June 1938, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Real G.D.P. fell 3.4 percent in 1938, and the unemployment rate rose to 12.5 percent from 9.2 percent in 1937.
Economists are still debating the precise causes of the 1937-8 recession. While most say they believe that fiscal tightening is primarily to blame, some disagree. Perhaps it would have been positive if tightening was confined to the spending side of the budget, without the large increase in taxes. Maybe the fiscal contraction would have been benign if the Fed hadn't tightened monetary policy simultaneously.
Given President Obama's endorsement of large budget cuts, the only question now appears to be how much fiscal policy will tighten and how fast. If it is back-loaded and mainly involves cuts in transfer programs, the impact on growth may be modest. But if - as I suspect Republicans will demand - the spending cuts are front-loaded and involve reductions in government consumption and investment spending, the impact could be severe.
While it's unlikely that the Fed will repeat its error of 1936-7 and raise reserve requirements or the federal funds rate, it has already begun de facto tightening by moving from monetary stimulus to a more neutral stance. Moreover, with interest rates on Treasury bills hovering near zero, there is little it can do to stimulate growth on the monetary side.
While the odds of another recession are still low, they are increasing. Given the economy's fragility, policy makers need to be very careful, because it may take only a small misstep on either the monetary or fiscal side to tip the balance. The experience of 1937-38 should be a warning.

HEADLINE: How Realistic Are Wall Street Thrillers?

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Three new financial thrillers are all worth a read, but some are more realistic than others. Here is DealBook's take. 

 BODY:
A recent DealBook article examined Wall Street's fictional portrayal in three new financial thrillers: David T. Lender's "Bull Street," H.T. Narea's "The Fund" and Norb Vonnegut's "The Gods of Greenwich." All three books are worth a read, but the discerning Wall Street reader may find some more realistic than others. DealBook breaks down the relative merits of each:
BULL STREET
In brief: A young investment associate, Richard Blum, winds up in the middle of an insider trading ring that would make Raj Rajaratnam blush. Blum has to evade the regulators, find the real culprit and get the girl, all without rumpling his suit.
Best pep talk: "All I've heard is excuses. This isn't like you. Get primal. Think like these Wall Street guys, like a caveman who needs to win over a woman or he can't procreate. Put some oomph into it. You're on your own; nobody can do it for you."
Jargon alert: Tax-loss carryforwards
Least realistic moment: While being grilled by federal agents, Blum - who, like every other twenty-something on Wall Street, would sing like a bird - stands his ground, and accuses the agents of bluffing.
Fashion award: A man with "slicked-back hair, pocket square that matched his bold Hermes tie, English-striped shirt with white cuffs showing below his jacket sleeves."
Overall realism score: 4.5 Cartier gold stars
THE FUND
In brief: Kate Molares, an American defense intelligence operative, has to track down Nebibi, a nefarious Middle Eastern hedge fund manager who wants to bring the American financial system to its knees. (In fiction, apparently, we can't do that ourselves.) Set in Gibraltar, Venezuela, Greenwich and other exotic locales most Americans won't recognize.
Best pep talk: "But hey, just like everybody else, we bought our fair share of mortgage loans that had been diced, sauteed, smothered in triple-A ratings by those investment banks. They called them CDOs, collateralized debt obligations. By the way, some advice: whenever these guys in their fancy suits come up with a cute name for the stuff, watch out."
Understatement award: "Sam Coldsmith had gotten a good deal on the lease from the previous tenant, Long-Term Capital Management, after its prized financial modeling engines had been clogged by a vicious little bug called Russia."
Financial simile of the week: "Any way you measured it, WR Shipley & Co. was like a meatball of limited capital proportions drowning in the immense bowl of very tangled spaghetti of derivative contracts that overflowed and touched every facet of the world economy."
Fashion award: "His usual black Armani suit enveloped a white French cuffed shirt and black tie. Everything about him was crisp, fresh, and reeking of cash."
Overall realism score: 3 Cartier gold stars
THE GODS OF GREENWICH 
In brief: Jimmy Cusack, an unlucky money manager, gets a high-paying job with Cy Leeser, a prickly hedge fund mogul who wants to tank an Icelandic bank for fun and profit. The cast includes a nurse with a violent streak, a trader nicknamed "The Geek," and a wife with prosopagnosia, a condition that impairs the ability to recognize faces. Greenwich, of course, plays a starring role.
Best pep talk, jilted Greenwich wife edition: "We won't be taken for granted. We won't bear children for our husbands. We won't trade our careers for diapers, while our husbands cavort around the globe. Eating what they want. Unzipping their flies for whom they want. We won't watch passively from the sidelines as our husbands leer at younger women."
Thing we can't actually imagine anyone in Greenwich saying: Calling the nonrich "oxygen thieves."
Thing we can totally imagine someone in Greenwich saying: "This rose is all the rage on St. Barth."
Aaron Sorkin School of Dialogue award: "Bentwing dropped like a rock at the end of August.""Can you bring me into your quadrant?" asked Geek."December, April, and September-those months all followed bad markets.""The Dow was up during July and August.""Bentwing got smoked," replied Cusack."Sounds six sigma."Overall realism score: 5 Cartier gold stars

HEADLINE: The Factory Age Isn't Over

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Even if they employ less workers, American factories have been resilient in some regards, a study by the Minneapolis Fed shows. 

 BODY:
The number of factories in the United States employing more than 1,000 workers fell by one-third from 1997 to 2007, leaving 1,014 such factories. This probably will not surprise you. The shattered windows of empty factories have become a familiar sight.
But a new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis puts an interesting twist on this familiar narrative. It reports that most of those factories did not close. They simply employ fewer people.
Of the factories that fell from the list of large employers, the study found that 48 percent still employed more than 500 people. Another 7 percent employed from 250 to 500 people. The remainder either had closed or employed fewer than 250 people.
The numbers predate the recession, making it likely that more of those factories have since closed or shed workers. But particularly at this moment, as millions of Americans struggle to find work, the study offers a reminder that our manufacturing base is to some extent a victim of its own success. In 1950, the United States Steel Corporation employed 30,000 workers at its plant in Gary, Ind. Today that factory employs only 5,000 workers. But they produce more steel: 7.5 million tons a year now, compared with 6 million tons then.
The study also includes an interesting list of new super factories, plants that employ at least 2,500 people. There were only 15 such factories. Four of them were built to make light trucks. Three were built to kill chickens. One makes guided missiles.

HEADLINE: Young Executives to Meet With Capital's Old Guard

BYLINE: ERIC LICHTBLAU


HIGHLIGHT: Seeking to attract a new generation of voters, the White House and U.S. Chamber of Commerce plan to meet with 125 young executives.

 BODY:
The White House and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have been at war for much of the last two-and-a-half years. One thing they can agree on, however, is the need to attract successful young people, especially at the start of an election season when campaign cash will be at a premium. 
That's one reason why a group of 125 executives, all under 30, has lined up eminent audiences on Wednesday for invitation-only meetings and briefings at the White House, the Chamber of Commerce and Capitol Hill to push for greater job creation and economic opportunities for young people. 
"We're not pushing any particular political agenda," said Matthew Segal, 25, who is the founder of a group called Our Time in Washington that has organized the events. "What we're pushing is economic empowerment to drive participation by young people."
Mr. Segal points to an unemployment rate of more than 17 percent among people ages 18 to 24 as evidence of the need to rethink economic strategies. To lay out its case, the group has events set up throughout the day with senior administration officials from the White House Business Council, the Chamber of Commerce and Congress, including a leading Democrat, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, and a leading Republican, Senator John McCain of Arizona. 
No, the country's most famous young executive - Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg - will not be part of the visiting delegation. (The company cited scheduling conflicts.) But the sisters who run the Georgetown Cupcake brand are expected to be there, as are Lady Gaga's manager and young adults running social media sites, fashion and entertainment firms, Internet start-ups, a pickle company, a butcher shop and a chain of lobster shacks. 
"Everyone wants to hear from young entrepreneurs and young job creators," said Mr. Segal, who first became active in political mobilization as a college student after growing frustrated with long voting lines on Election Day in 2004. "These are young people who are self-made. What we want to do is launch a marketplace for young people and get consumers to vote with their wallets."

HEADLINE: Freshmen Republicans Push House Toward Right

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Freshmen Republican in Congress veer to the right, but it may be at their political peril.

 BODY:
Nobody would dispute that the 240 Republicans who serve in the House of Representatives are a conservative bunch. A big part of the story are the 85 Republicans -- roughly one-third of the caucus -- who are serving in Congress for the first time, or who are doing so after having lost or retired from their seats previously. Because of them, the Republican caucus has continued to drift toward the right despite now occupying most of the swing districts in the country, which are normally fertile ground for moderates.
According to the website ProgressivePunch.org, an objective system to rate members of Congress from liberal to conservative based on their voting records, these 85 first-term Republicans have adopted the liberal position on votes in Congress an average of just 6.8 percent so far this year. By comparison, the 155 Republicans who are holdovers from the previous Congress have done so 7.5 percent of the time.
That might not sound like a big difference -- and it isn't. The catch is that the first-term Republicans are from considerably more moderate districts than the returnees. On average, the districts with first-term Republicans are 6.4 percentage points more Republican than the country as a whole based on their presidential voting. By comparison, those districts with Republicans returning to Congress are 11.0 points more Republican than the national average.
Put more succinctly, first-term Republicans are considerably more conservative, relative to their districts, than those who also served in the 111th Congress.
This is perhaps best demonstrated visually. In the graphic below, I've plotted the ideological positions of the 240 House Republicans against the partisanship of their district as rated by the Partisan Voting Index. Ideology is measured by a version of ProgressivePunch.org's statistics, which I call the Conservative Score. This simply takes ProgressivePunch.org's Progressive Score for votes so far this year and inverts it -- so a member who takes the liberal position 5 percent of the time would have a Conservative Score of 95.
As you can see, there is some relationship between the partisanship of the district and a Republican's voting patterns. Those Congressmen from more conservative districts tend to vote more conservatively.
What I want to draw your attention to, however, is the difference between first-term Republicans, who appear in red in the chart, and the holdovers, who appear in black-and-white. About four-fifths of freshman Republicans are above the regression line, which is formed from the scores of the returning members. Essentially this means that 80 percent of the first-termers are more conservative than you'd "expect" based on knowing how the veteran Republicans are voting.
Through regression analysis, we can determine that the trend is highly statistically significant. (This is also true, incidentally, even if you also account for membership in the Tea Party Caucus.) Although first-term Republicans, like returning members, are somewhat sensitive to the partisanship of their districts, they are nevertheless more conservative across the board once you've accounted for it.
The difference between first-term and returning Republicans is equivalent to about 7 or 8 percentage points worth of partisanship. So, for example, we'd expect a first-term Republican from Ohio, which is 1 percentage point more Republican than the country as a whole, to take about the same positions as a returning Republican from South Carolina, which is 8 points more Republican than the national average.
There are a couple of fairly straightforward theories to explain this. First, the first-term Republicans were elected in an environment in which the party won 51.6 percent of the national popular vote for the U.S. House. By comparison, the returning members were elected in environments when Republicans had an average of about 47 percent of the popular vote.
In addition, the electorate that turned out in 2010 was not just highly Republican but also highly conservative. The "enthusiasm gap" that produced lopsided turnout toward the Republicans was because of conservative Republican voters specifically -- moderate Republican voters were no more likely to turn out than Democrats.
The other factor, however, is that conservative Republicans have not yet had to defend their seats. Some of the gains they made this year may prove to be ephemeral.
Consider the last time that Republicans made gains of this magnitude, which was in 1994. That year produced 73 freshman Republicans in the House of Representatives.
How many of those 73 freshmen are still serving in the House today? Only 7 of them. By comparison, there were just 13 freshmen Democrats elected that year. But 6 of the 13 are still serving. The reason for the discrepancy is that any Democrat elected in 1994 probably had to be a very strong politician, whereas many Republicans were elected simply by virtue of having an (R) next to their name.
Likewise, 19 of the 42 Democrats elected to the House for the first time in the Democratic wave year of 2006, or almost half, no longer occupy their seats, despite having had just two elections since then.
The mistake that a lot of first-term members of Congress can make is to assume that electoral environment from which they were elected is one that will persist indefinitely. Most freshmen Representatives aren't likely to have developed particularly strong constituent services, or to have acquired positions of power within the Congress. These are the kinds of things that help a member get re-elected when the political environment becomes more challenging, as it inevitably will get sooner or later.
But those who stake out ideological positions that are out of step with the voters in their district are liable to be especially vulnerable. Political scientists generally agree that there is a relationship between the ideological views of a Congressman and the share of the vote he tends to get in subsequent elections, with more extreme and partisan members having a higher bar to clear.
So something very probably has to give for the Republicans. Even if the public has become somewhat more conservative on fiscal issues, something which I suspect is true, it is not nearly to the degree reflected in the representation in Congress.
The two most plausible paths are as follows. First, Republicans in Congress will maintain their present course toward more and more conservative views. There will be yet another wave election but this time one that breaks against them, whether in 2012, 2014, 2016 or some combination thereof. One of the more likely scenarios, for instance, is that a conservative Republican like Rick Perry is elected president in 2012 along with a Republican Congress. But the economy continues to sputter, as it often does for as many as 5 to 10 years after a financial crisis. In that case, Democrats might win back 50 or 60 or (who knows) 70 or 80 seats in 2014.
A second scenario is that the Republicans show a little bit more willingness to compromise. Perhaps not a lot, but enough so that the public decides to give both the House Republicans and President Obama another go. This is essentially what happened after 1994: although Republicans in Congress shifted to the right that year, as they have this year, they nevertheless reached a number of bipartisan compromises with President Clinton, and the parties continued to share power.
There also might have been a third path, but it seems exceptionally unlikely to be pursued. When Democrats won overwhelming numbers of seats in Congress during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Democratic Party itself actually shifted substantially toward the right relative to where it had been previously. But policy shifted substantially toward the left because the Democrats controlled the center, leaving Republicans to be little more than a fringe party. In fact, although there were often substantial regional disputes -- Northern and Southern Democrats substantially differed on social policy while generally agreeing on economic policy -- Democrats dominated the Congress for the next 60 years.
More on this in a subsequent post, in which we'll look at the current positioning of the Republican Congress relative to other points in American history. But a bit of a teaser: there is some evidence to suggest that the current House of Representative may be the most conservative ever on economic policy, and the furthest removed from the center of the electorate.

HEADLINE: Says Dodd-Frank Misses Goals, S.E.C. Chief Under Bush Says

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Some of the rules under the Dodd-Frank Act "favor certain special interests at the expense of rank-and-file shareholders," Harvey Pitt, a former S.E.C. chairman, told Congress.

 BODY:
7:26 p.m. | Updated 
Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, criticized the Dodd-Frank Act on Tuesday, saying the financial regulatory overhaul would fall short of its goal of protecting investors from future financial crises .
The law "unfortunately did not provide the regulatory reform that our financial and capital markets, and those who invest, so urgently needed and still require," Mr. Pitt, who was chairman of the S.E.C. from 2001 to 2003, said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
"The act is unduly complex, adds more layers of regulatory bureaucracy to an already overbloated bureaucracy, makes financial regulation more cumbersome and less nimble than it already was," said Mr. Pitt, now the chief of Kalorama Partners, a Washington consulting firm.
Nearly a year after President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law, the banking committee on Tuesday examined the law's efforts to protect investors. The act dedicated an entire section to "investor protections," creating an Office of Investor Advocate, enhancing regulation of credit rating agencies and reining in executive pay.
But some of the corporate governance rules "favor certain special interests at the expense of rank-and-file shareholders," Mr. Pitt said.
He also objected to a new corporate whistle-blower program, created under the act. In April, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a program that rewards employees who report crucial information about fraud and other wrongdoing. Under the rules, whistle-blowers are not required to report fraud internally before going to the government.
"This provision threatens to undermine corporate governance, internal compliance and the confidence of public investors in our heavily regulated capital markets," said Mr. Pitt, a Republican who was appointed to run the S.E.C. by President George W. Bush.
Mr. Pitt issued some support for expanding the S.E.C.'s authority to examine thousands of investment advisers. But he said the agency lacked the budget to fully take on its new responsibilities.
His comments on the agency's budget echo concerns raised by consumer advocates, who have long called for the S.E.C. to receive a budget increase.
"While we are sympathetic to those who argue that money alone cannot solve all of the agency's problems, we also believe that, without additional funding, the agency cannot reasonably be expected to effectively fulfill its investor protection mission," Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, told the committee.

HEADLINE: Lowering Economic Expectations

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The administration has been mocked for what proved to be overly optimistic projections for the economy. It seems to have learned its lesson, and then some.

 BODY:
As my colleague David Leonhardt has written, government officials (both in the White House and at the Federal Reserve) have been overly optimistic in their economic forecasts. In particular, conservatives like to make fun of the administration's rosy projections from 2009 for how the economy would behave under the Recovery Act; the administration's economic advisers predicted unemployment today would be below 7 percent, rather than the 9.2 percent we're actually stuck with. Buzzwords like "shovel-ready" and "Recovery Summer" have also become major mockery talking points.
Last Wednesday, in his Twitter town hall, President Obama acknowledged that his administration had not predicted enough doom and gloom. When asked for examples of things he might have done differently in his presidency, he said:One would have been to explain to the American people that it was going to take a while for us to get out of this. I think even I did not realize the magnitude, because most economists didn't realize the magnitude, of the recession until fairly far into it, maybe two or three months into my presidency where we started realizing that we had lost four million jobs before I was even sworn in.And so I think people may not have been prepared for how long this was going to take and why we were going to have to make some very difficult decisions and choices. And I take responsibility for that, because setting people's expectations is part of how you end up being able to respond well.It seems the administration may have learned its lesson, and then some. On "Meet the Press" on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner seemed to be doing his best to lower people's expectations going forward:This is a very tough economy. And I think for a lot of people it's going to be -- it's going to feel very hard, harder than anything they've experienced in their lifetime now, for some time to come. And that -- but that is because that is the tragic effects of a crisis this deep and this bad caused by a long period of lost opportunities to do things to make the country stronger.It will be interesting to see if this is a more permanent shift in the way the administration talks about the economy, and how it advocates for stimulative policy measures in the next few months.

HEADLINE: Doctoroff Named Chief Executive of Bloomberg L.P.

BYLINE: BRIAN STELTER


HIGHLIGHT: The former deputy mayor of New York takes over day-to-day duties of his old boss's sprawling media company.

 BODY:
Daniel L. Doctoroff, a former deputy to Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York who became president of Bloomberg L.P. three and a half years ago, was promoted on Tuesday to be the company's chief executive.
The promotion will shift day-to-day responsibility for all of Bloomberg L.P. to Mr. Doctoroff from Peter T. Grauer, the longtime chairman of the sprawling financial and media company founded by Mr. Bloomberg 30 years ago. It comes at a time when Bloomberg L.P., historically known for its financial terminals, is expanding its terrain -- with Bloomberg Businessweek, Bloomberg Government and Bloomberg View being three much-talked-about examples.
"In addition to our very successful core businesses, the Bloomberg terminal and Bloomberg News, we have started eight new businesses just in the past few years," Mr. Grauer said in a statement. "Dan is perfectly suited to manage our increasingly diversified business model."
The promotion is effective Aug. 1. Employees were notified Tuesday morning in an internal e-mail memorandum. Mr. Doctoroff will continue to report to Mr. Grauer.
Also Tuesday, Thomas F. Secunda, the manager of Bloomberg's biggest unit, financial products, was named a vice chairman of the company.
Bloomberg has not had a chief executive officer since mid-2008, when Lex Fenwick was moved to a business incubator called Bloomberg Ventures. At that time Mr. Grauer, the chairman of Bloomberg since 2001, took on day-to-day oversight of many of the company's divisions, with Mr. Doctoroff, who had joined the company as its president six months earlier, as his deputy.
As president, Mr. Doctoroff was responsible for the financial products, data products, news, multimedia, operations and ventures units of Bloomberg. As chief executive and president, he will add to his portfolio the finance and administration, marketing, corporate communications and professional development units.
The move will make Mr. Grauer a more traditional chairman. According to the internal memo, he will "focus on several key areas: ensuring that we are building and maintaining high-level relationships with customers and other external stakeholders, including senior government officials; enhancing our legal, compliance and security functions; driving our world-class sustainability and philanthropy programs; and building our unique culture through mentoring and new leadership and career development programs."

HEADLINE: In Debt Ceiling Fight, Obama Has the Edge

BYLINE: MATT BAI


HIGHLIGHT: It's possible for voters to rebuke Mr. Obama and trust his opposition even less. And in fact, polling shows that is exactly what is going on.

 BODY:
Last year, President Obama and House Republicans managed to reach a last-minute accord on preserving the Bush tax cuts, and then in April they just barely averted a government shutdown. But now, in this debate over the debt ceiling, each side seems ready to make a stand at last and find out whom the voters really trust when it comes to righting the nation's finances. 
The question is whom you would rather be if this thing does, in fact, escalate into a full-blown crisis. As things stand today, I'd much rather be in the president's shoes than in those of his adversaries, and not only because he tends to dress better.
I say this because politicians very often get themselves into trouble when they subscribe to what you might call the transference theory of political popularity. This is the theory that suggests that the enemy of the person voters don't trust is someone they will inherently trust more. Or to put it another way: if you've lost faith in that guy over there, and I walk up and kick him in the teeth, then your faith will be somehow transferred to me.
This is the political theory under which George W. Bush's advisers were operating when they predicted spontaneous outpourings of support from Iraqis once American troops toppled Saddam Hussein. Anyone who'd spent a little time in Iraq should have known that while most Iraqis were going to be glad to be rid of Saddam, that didn't mean they were ready to embrace his deposer, either.
And this is effectively the same theory that Republicans in Washington have adopted since last November. They mistake disappointment with Obama's policies for an emphatic validation of their antigovernment rhetoric. They think the voters have to trust someone, and since they're not so enamored of Mr. Obama's performance, that someone must be them.
But politics really isn't binary; it only seems that way. It's possible for voters to rebuke Mr. Obama and trust his opposition even less. And in fact, polling shows that's exactly what's going on.
In a New York Times/CBS News poll from a few weeks ago, Mr. Obama maintained a tepid approval rating of 47 percent, with 44 percent of the voters registering disapproval. But only 20 percent approved of Congress, versus 70 percent who disapproved. Those are Roger Clemens-type numbers. They don't get you anywhere near the Hall of Fame.
Polls also show that the president remains personally liked by large majority of the public. But really, the discrepancy in their approval ratings probably has less to do with Mr. Obama or House leaders personally than it does with the nature of our system. Presidents always seem bigger and more commanding than members of Congress. Even a beaten-down president tends to be more compelling than some guy who needs to wear a lapel pin just to make sure he can ride the right elevator.
This is why President Clinton squashed his Republican opponents during the government shutdown in 1996 and again after his impeachment in 1998. Even disgraced, he managed to come off like the only grownup in town, a real-life Gulliver tottering while tiny people scurried to bind his ankles together.The Republican nominee in next year's election, whoever that turns out to be, might be able to stare down Mr. Obama on something as consequential as the debt ceiling and come away looking larger and more capable. But not so for your average Congressional leader, which is probably why the shrewd Mr. Boehner appeared so eager to cut a deal until his caucus rebelled over the weekend.
Working in Mr. Obama's favor, too, is that he seems now to understand this power dynamic and how to use it. Earlier in his presidency, Mr. Obama seemed to think he could best his opponents by appealing to their sense of shared responsibility and chatting them up at Super Bowl parties. It didn't work.
Now, though, he seems to get that a president wins when he boxes in his adversaries, forcing them either to compromise on his terms or to risk the political consequences of appearing intransigent. For the past week or so, the president has relentlessly sought the mantle of maturity, casting himself as the guy seeking bold and far-reaching compromise while his opponents seek the lower ground of marginal change.
Republicans may be right on this point; it may not be the wisest thing in the world to remake the entire federal budget in the space of a furious few days. But to the extent that Mr. Obama gets his message across more effectively, he hands Republicans the unenviable choice or either joining him in a comprehensive solution or looking self-interested for backing away and imperiling the economy.
Does that mean voters won't blame Mr. Obama for a crisis over the debt ceiling? It doesn't. But they'll probably blame Congress even more. If you're Republican right now, the flawed theory of transference is one you'd probably rather not put to the test.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Warns Lawmakers on Debt

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Avoid a default, a group of executives and investors said, or risk disarray in the markets and disruption to the economic recovery.

 BODY:
The White House and Congress received dual warnings from Wall Street on Tuesday about the consequences of failing to raise the federal debt ceiling in a timely manner.
Business groups and investors said that President Obama and lawmakers needed to act quickly to raise the debt limit to avoid sending the government into default and that a deal must include a plan to rein in long-term deficits.
The Business Roundtable sent a letter (pdf) to lawmakers warning that a failure to increase the debt limit would cause widespread fallout in the global financial markets and raise the costs of financing mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and student loans.
"This is a Main Street not Wall Street issue," the letter said, predicting that default would create "disarray" in the markets and have numerous unintended consequences. "This is a risk our country must not take."
The letter was signed by dozens of chief executives, including those of Xerox, Wal-Mart and General Mills.
Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. resumed debt talks with Congressional leaders this afternoon at the White House after Senator Mitch McConnell offered his own proposal.
The letter said lawmakers should agree to a "long-term, predictable and binding" agreement to rein in federal deficits in order to encourage businesses to invest and hire.
Separately, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a Wall Street trade group, downgraded its economic outlook to "subpar," citing the debt impasse among its concerns. The group revised its estimate for economic growth this year down to 2.5 percent from 2.6 percent and predicted that unemployment would remain above 8 percent through 2012.
The warnings are the latest that lawmakers have received in recent months. Earlier this year, two major credit ratings agencies -- Moody's and Standard & Poor's -- threatened to downgrade federal debt if lawmakers failed to reach a deal.
Lawmakers need to pass a deal by Aug. 2 to avoid a default, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geither has said. The White House is seeking a deal by July 22 to give lawmakers time to move the legislation through the House and Senate.

HEADLINE: McConnell Proposal Gives Obama Power to Increase Debt Limit

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: Saying that a bipartisan budget deal was probably out of reach, the Republican leader on Tuesday offered a plan to allow the president to increase the federal debt limit without prior Congressional approval for offsetting spending cuts.

 BODY:
The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Tuesday that a bipartisan budget deal with President Obama was probably out of reach, and he proposed a plan under which the president could increase the federal debt limit without prior Congressional approval for offsetting spending cuts. 
Mr. McConnell's proposal reflected a growing sense of pessimism on Capitol Hill about the prospects that Mr. Obama and Congressional leaders could come to terms on a budget deal before the government's borrowing authority hit its limit on Aug. 2. The negotiators sat down for another round of talks at the White House on Tuesday afternoon.
In an interview with CBS News, Mr. Obama said he "cannot guarantee" that the government can pay benefits next month to Social Security recipients, veterans and the disabled if Congress does not increase the federal debt limit, raising the political stakes even as Republicans hardened their opposition to him.
Mr. McConnell's proposal would give Mr. Obama sweeping power to increase the government's borrowing authority, in increments, by up to $2.4 trillion - enough, it is estimated, to cover federal obligations through next year - only if Mr. Obama specified spending cuts of equal amounts. But Congress would not have to approve the spending cuts prior to the debt-limit increase.
It is not clear whether House Republicans would sign on to such a measure, given their drive to extract deep spending cuts in return for any debt-limit increase. 
Mr. McConnell, who after the midterm elections last November said Republicans' goal would be to make Mr. Obama a one-term president, said in his Senate speech, "After years of discussions and months of negotiations, I have little question that as long as this president is in the Oval Office, a real solution is probably unattainable."
At the White House, the press secretary, Jay Carney, responded, "This president's going to be in office for at least another 18 months, and I think the American people expect Congress to work with him."
With the Aug. 2 deadline for raising the government's $14.3 trillion debt limit just three weeks away, Tuesday seemed to mark a new low in the summer's maneuvering between the White House and Congressional Republicans over a debt-reduction package that would clear the way for a vote on the debt limit. The back-and-forth had people in both parties nervously eyeing the financial markets, fretful that the political fighting would unnerve investors; to date, Wall Street has been generally complacent, believing that the White House and Congress ultimately would come to an agreement, if only because failing to do so would hold such economic peril.
Representatives of major business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, put out public statements urging a bipartisan agreement on raising the debt limit. They had met with the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, on Monday and other business groups and individuals similarly have contacted the White House to volunteer help in reaching a compromise.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg opened an unrelated event on Tuesday morning in New York by saying: "If America, for the first time in its history, defaults on its obligations, it would have a catastrophic effect on our financial system and on our credibility around the world. It would also take a serious toll on our economy, and that at a time when the nation is still trying to recover from the deep recession." 
"America's good name and credit are just too important to be held hostage to Washington gridlock, and I hope that in the end cooler heads will prevail and an agreement will be reached quickly," Mr. Bloomberg added.
In advance of what have become daily White House meetings, Congressional Republican leaders stood firm against raising taxes on the wealthy and businesses after 2013, as Mr. Obama demands as part of a "balanced package" with deep spending cuts, including in Medicare and Medicaid.
Mr. Obama, responding to a question in an interview with CBS News, said: "I cannot guarantee that those checks go out on Aug. 3 if we haven't resolved this issue. Because there may simply not be the money in the coffers to do it."
He added, "This is not just a matter of Social Security checks. These are veterans' checks, these are folks on disability and their checks. There are about 70 million checks that go out."

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Urges Washington to Raise Debt Limit

BYLINE: JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ


HIGHLIGHT: The mayor urged national leaders to first focus on the debt ceiling, accusing them of playing "chicken" with the American economy.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, warning of potentially "catastrophic" effects to the financial system, urged Republicans and Democrats on Tuesday to stop bickering over taxes and spending cuts and move swiftly toward an agreement to raise the country's debt limit. 
Mr. Bloomberg, an independent, said that failing to do so would imperil America's status as a superpower.
"The debt ceiling is so important that playing 'chicken' with it may be cute and may be good politics but it doesn't leave the rest of the world having a warm and fuzzy feeling about investing in America," Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference in Maspeth, Queens. "It's just irresponsible."
Lawmakers and President Obama are deadlocked over how to resolve an impending debt crisis before Aug. 2, when the United States could begin defaulting on its obligations. Republicans have urged deep cuts to programs like Medicare, while Democrats have said reductions in spending should be accompanied by tax increases.
While Mr. Bloomberg, a businessman known for his fiscally conservative views, said he was "100 percent in favor" of tackling the swelling deficit, he urged national leaders to first focus on the debt ceiling. He said that Mr. Obama, whom Mr. Bloomberg has sometimes differed with on economic issues, "has got to be the one that is pushing everybody together."
"Both sides are going to have to stop all this posturing," he said, "and come to the table and realize we have been spending money for many, many years that we don't have."

HEADLINE: A San Diego Barrio's $58 Million Moment Arrives

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO -- A 20-year effort by city officials to bring a supermarket and other essential services to Barrio Logan, a working-class neighborhood south of downtown, has entered its final phase with the construction of a $58 million retail and housing development aimed at Hispanic shoppers.
The anchor of the 311,000-square-foot project, called Mercado del Barrio, is Northgate Gonzalez Market, a grocery chain based in Anaheim, Calif. Kevin McCook, an acquisitions and development manager for Shea Properties, which is building the retail part of the Mercado, described it as the ''Whole Foods of the Hispanic community.'' 
''The community has lacked a modern, Hispanic-oriented supermarket,'' Mr. McCook said. ''We're trying to fill that void.''
The market and a restaurant tenant will occupy free-standing buildings in the development, which is in the shadow of the huge San Diego-Coronado Bridge. In a third building, retail storefronts wrap around all four sides of the building on the ground level, while 92 affordable apartments sit atop the retail space. Within the structure is a three-story, above-ground parking garage.
Chelsea Investment Corporation of Carlsbad, Calif., which specializes in low-income housing, is the apartment developer. Completion of the entire project is scheduled for late 2012.
Located on the San Diego Bay waterfront, Barrio Logan dates back to the early 20th century. The former neighborhood of fishermen became industrialized during World War II, when San Diego became a center of shipbuilding. Nassco, a unit of General Dynamics, continues to operate the largest shipbuilding operation on the West Coast in the area; its tall cranes are visible as one looks south from between the massive bridge piers.
Freeway construction in the 1950s bisected the community, while postwar zoning laws further damaged the residential neighborhood by encouraging industrial construction amid aging wood-frame houses, according to Xavier Del Valle, a project manager for the city's redevelopment agency. Construction of the Coronado bridge in 1969 introduced another barrier to the neighborhood.
In the 1970s, the community organized to fight a proposed police substation, which would have blocked a popular view of the bay from beneath the bridge. The contested site is today Chicano Park, a symbolic center of the community, where the bridge piers are covered in colorful murals depicting Emiliano Zapata, Frida Kahlo and other figures from Mexican history and pop culture. The area has a population of about 4,300, according to the city and census figures, with a median household income of $28,342. San Diego County as a whole has a median household income of about $60,000.
The city has invested heavily in the Mercado venture. The San Diego Redevelopment Agency spent about $8 million in the early 1990s to assemble the seven-acre site. Later, in 2008, the city sold the land to the Shea-Chelsea team for $100, using a tool in California redevelopment known as land conveyance, which is an incentive for developers to undertake projects by reducing land costs.
The redevelopment agency also contributed more than $9 million from an affordable housing fund. The city put together a loan and a grant from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development worth a total of about $7.9 million.
The redevelopment agency began assembling land for a future supermarket and retail center in 1991, but the project was delayed for many years by the failure of two earlier developers in succession to build the commercial project.
The master plan for the project, designed by Safdie Rabines Architects of San Diego, arranges the new buildings as a continuation of an existing shopping street. To minimize the visual impact of the bridge on the neighboring retail and apartment building, the architects oriented the larger rental units toward unobstructed views; apartments facing the Coronado bridge have angled windows to maximize views of the bay.
The Mercado is not the only development in Barrio Logan. The local community college district is building a new campus immediately west of the Mercado for 3,800 students. With the combined market and college campus, the Mercado area ''becomes the focal point of the community,'' Mr. Del Valle said.
And if the elevated freeway and bridge present difficulties in site planning, they may also help promote the Mercado, said Mr. McCook, the developer. ''This location is the definition of freeway visibility,'' he said wryly.
Beyond the benefit to Barrio Logan, the Mercado project is an indication that mainstream developers have awakened to the commercial potential of projects that reflect the culture of the nation's growing Latino population.
Steve Duffy, managing director of Moss Adams Capital of Irvine, a real estate finance firm with no ties to the project, said that in projects like Mercado del Barrio ''we are seeing bigger developers working in redevelopment areas, building at a scale that we haven't seen before.''
Shopping centers aimed at specific ethnic groups, Mr. Duffy said, are ''just emerging as a feasible real estate project for developers to undertake, because the underlying demand is there.''
''In this case,'' he said, ''the demand just happens to be Latino.''
''We're going to see far more of those in California, the Southwest and around the country,'' Mr. Duffy said.

HEADLINE: Art Groups Preserve Chelsea by Buying, Not Renting

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
It is an all-too-familiar pattern in many communities: artists discover an inexpensive, underdeveloped neighborhood and move in, only to be ousted from the area by soaring retail rents once it catches on in popularity.
Many argue that it happened in Greenwich Village, and most point to SoHo as the quintessential example of the phenomenon. Now, the same pattern may be occurring in Chelsea, where an explosion of residential development along the High Line is attracting retailers serving new residents -- retailers who are now competing for space with the hundreds of art galleries that are the backbone of the neighborhood.
But some real estate experts say Chelsea's fate may be different, because a healthy number of the neighborhood's arts businesses had the foresight to buy their gallery and studio spaces, rather than lease them.
''The difference between SoHo and Chelsea is that so many artists, or even art companies or art investors, bought condos in Chelsea, so they actually made investments as opposed to leasing,'' said Barbara Byrne Denham, the chief economist at Eastern Consolidated, a commercial real estate brokerage. 
''I think that will preserve their spaces, and the flavor of Chelsea as kind of an art mecca,'' she said.
Ms. Byrne Denham said there could be as many as 350 art galleries in Chelsea. Enough of them own their space that in a recent report on the commercial property sales market in Chelsea, Ms. Byrne Denham said, ''we had to separate them as their own property type.''
''I said, 'There's something in this that really stands out: the fact that so many properties sold as art studios, art condos and art buildings,' '' she said.
In 2008, the sales volume in that sector peaked at about $105 million, then activity froze with the financial crisis, according to the report. Sales activity in arts-related properties recommenced in the latter half of 2010.
Before 2007, arts-related sales activity in Chelsea was much slower, with about two properties changing hands a year between 2003 and 2006, Ms. Byrne Denham said. Much of that space is in former industrial buildings that were converted as artists and art galleries left SoHo in the mid-1990s.
Many of Chelsea's arts sales in 2007 and 2008 were fed by one developer, Bass Associates L.L.C., which built the Chelsea Arts Tower, a 20-unit commercial condominium at 545 West 25th Street.
The building took just over two years to sell out, beginning at prices of about $700 a square foot and peaking at prices of more than $2,000 a square foot in 2007, said Margarette Lee, a principal with Youngwoo. Then prices fell, as they did throughout Chelsea, though they have now returned to about $1,200 a square foot, she said.
Ms. Lee said that planning for the Chelsea Arts Tower began as far back as the mid-1990s, when the developer acquired the lot in Chelsea.
''All these galleries were being ousted by retailers in SoHo, and they came to Chelsea, and they started buying their real estate, because everywhere they go, the neighborhood gets really nice, and the rent goes up so high, they have to leave,'' she said. ''We saw that and went in early and said, 'I think a lot of these art-related businesses would want to buy instead of rent.' ''
Initially, the Chelsea Arts Tower was aimed only at galleries, but developers soon found out that relatively few galleries had the capital to purchase a condo. ''You had to be an established gallery to buy,'' Ms. Lee said. ''There are many more struggling galleries than successful galleries.''
Ms. Lee said that about half of the Chelsea Arts Tower was art galleries, most of which came not from SoHo but from the 57th Street area, a part of Manhattan popular with the interior design industry. The rest of the tower's units are devoted to fashion- and arts-related businesses.
Relatively few of the units have resold. ''Maybe four at the most,'' Ms. Lee said.
Part of what has kept real estate developers and retailers at bay so far in Chelsea is special zoning created by the city in the 1990s, which helped preserve Chelsea's low scale and kept commercial mixed in with residential, mostly in midblock areas of 24th through 27th Streets. As well, the area's relative lack of mass transportation has discouraged widespread residential development, real estate experts said. While SoHo has many subway lines running through it, creating ample foot traffic, gallery-hoppers -- and potential shoppers -- have to go out of their way to get to Chelsea.
But the residential development along the High Line is changing that equation. For instance, among the dozens of projects planned is one by AvalonBay that is creating more than 700 rental apartments near 28th Street and 11th Avenue. The growing need for retail amenities as well as essential services is creating competition with art galleries for retail space, said Jonathan Denham, a principal with Denham Wolf Real Estate Services, a commercial real estate brokerage that works exclusively with nonprofit organizations.
Mr. Denham said there were still commercial spaces that nonprofit arts businesses could afford to lease, especially in the eastern part of Chelsea, away from the High Line. But Ms. Byrne Denham said she thought the number of art galleries in Chelsea might have peaked at about 350.
Still, the opening of a six-story branch of the Whitney Museum of American Art at Washington and Gansevoort Streets at the foot of the High Line could spur renewed interest in Chelsea by arts tenants, Ms. Byrne Denham said. She described it as a double-edged sword, however, saying it could drive up real estate values even more.
Even buying space may not protect all art galleries and businesses, and there have already been some arts-related casualties in the neighborhood. After being foreclosed upon, the Chelsea Art Museum sold its building at 556 West 22nd Street earlier this year to the Albanese Organization, a New York City developer. The museum will continue to operate there until the end of 2011, but then will find a new home. Meantime, the building is on the market for leasing.
''We bought the building to be sure the museum could stay,'' said Dorothea Keeser, the president of the Chelsea Art Museum, who attributed the building's loss to failed and contentious real estate negotiations with a developer. As for relocating somewhere in Chelsea, with its rising prices, Ms. Keeser said that would be ''very questionable.''
''But how would people find us if we move to another part of New York?'' she asked. ''It already took years for the visitors to be accustomed to us in Chelsea.''
The Joyce Theater at 175 Eighth Avenue and 19th Street, which has a 35-year lease that expires in 2016, is contemplating moving out of Chelsea altogether. Part of that is because of pricing worries, but the theater company also needs more operational space, said Mr. Denham, who is counseling the Joyce in its search.
''We've looked at a couple things in Chelsea, but we're being realistic, and if we do have to go, we'll probably want to play the role of being the incubator or pioneer in another up-and-coming neighborhood, similar to what we've done here,'' said Linda Shelton, the executive director of the Joyce.
Other arts organizations may be maneuvering to stick it out in Chelsea, like the Pace Gallery, which bought the space at 510 West 25th Street in September 2010, Ms. Byrne Denham said. Still, selling is not always as simple as accepting a cash buyout, brokers said. Unless the art business is closing altogether or has other branches, it has to buy or lease a new location.
''It can be tempting to entertain those offers,'' Mr. Denham said. ''You might be able to sell for top dollar, but in order for the organization to stay in business, they also have to go out immediately and buy property, also frequently at top dollar.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about arts-related spaces misidentified the developer of the Chelsea Arts Tower condominium on West 25th Street. It was built by Bass Associates L.L.C. -- not by Youngwoo & Associates. (Bass is a partnership of Youngwoo & Associates and Chelsea Development Group.)

HEADLINE: The Start-Up Of You

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
The rise in the unemployment rate last month to 9.2 percent has Democrats and Republicans reliably falling back on their respective cure-alls. It is evidence for liberals that we need more stimulus and for conservatives that we need more tax cuts to increase demand. I am sure there is truth in both, but I do not believe they are the whole story. I think something else, something new -- something that will require our kids not so much to find their next job as to invent their next job -- is also influencing today's job market more than people realize.
Look at the news these days from the most dynamic sector of the U.S. economy -- Silicon Valley. Facebook is now valued near $100 billion, Twitter at $8 billion, Groupon at $30 billion, Zynga at $20 billion and LinkedIn at $8 billion. These are the fastest-growing Internet/social networking companies in the world, and here's what's scary: You could easily fit all their employees together into the 20,000 seats in Madison Square Garden, and still have room for grandma. They just don't employ a lot of people, relative to their valuations, and while they're all hiring today, they are largely looking for talented engineers. 
Indeed, what is most striking when you talk to employers today is how many of them have used the pressure of the recession to become even more productive by deploying more automation technologies, software, outsourcing, robotics -- anything they can use to make better products with reduced head count and health care and pension liabilities. That is not going to change. And while many of them are hiring, they are increasingly picky. They are all looking for the same kind of people -- people who not only have the critical thinking skills to do the value-adding jobs that technology can't, but also people who can invent, adapt and reinvent their jobs every day, in a market that changes faster than ever.
Today's college grads need to be aware that the rising trend in Silicon Valley is to evaluate employees every quarter, not annually. Because the merger of globalization and the I.T. revolution means new products are being phased in and out so fast that companies cannot afford to wait until the end of the year to figure out whether a team leader is doing a good job.
Whatever you may be thinking when you apply for a job today, you can be sure the employer is asking this: Can this person add value every hour, every day -- more than a worker in India, a robot or a computer? Can he or she help my company adapt by not only doing the job today but also reinventing the job for tomorrow? And can he or she adapt with all the change, so my company can adapt and export more into the fastest-growing global markets? In today's hyperconnected world, more and more companies cannot and will not hire people who don't fulfill those criteria.
But you would never know that from listening to the debate in Washington, where some Democrats still tend to talk about job creation as if it's the 1960s and some Republicans as if it's the 1980s. But this is not your parents' job market.
This is precisely why LinkedIn's founder, Reid Garrett Hoffman, one of the premier starter-uppers in Silicon Valley -- besides co-founding LinkedIn, he is on the board of Zynga, was an early investor in Facebook and sits on the board of Mozilla -- has a book coming out after New Year called ''The Start-Up of You,'' co-authored with Ben Casnocha. Its subtitle could easily be: ''Hey, recent graduates! Hey, 35-year-old midcareer professional! Here's how you build your career today.''
Hoffman argues that professionals need an entirely new mind-set and skill set to compete. ''The old paradigm of climb up a stable career ladder is dead and gone,'' he said to me. ''No career is a sure thing anymore. The uncertain, rapidly changing conditions in which entrepreneurs start companies is what it's now like for all of us fashioning a career. Therefore you should approach career strategy the same way an entrepreneur approaches starting a business.''
To begin with, Hoffman says, that means ditching a grand life plan. Entrepreneurs don't write a 100-page business plan and execute it one time; they're always experimenting and adapting based on what they learn.
It also means using your network to pull in information and intelligence about where the growth opportunities are -- and then investing in yourself to build skills that will allow you to take advantage of those opportunities. Hoffman adds: ''You can't just say, 'I have a college degree, I have a right to a job, now someone else should figure out how to hire and train me.' '' You have to know which industries are working and what is happening inside them and then ''find a way to add value in a way no one else can. For entrepreneurs it's differentiate or die -- that now goes for all of us.''
Finally, you have to strengthen the muscles of resilience. ''You may have seen the news that [the] online radio service Pandora went public the other week,'' Hoffman said. ''What's lesser known is that in the early days [the founder] pitched his idea more than 300 times to V.C.'s with no luck.''

HEADLINE: Unrelenting Heat Alters Routines Across the U.S.

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER and TIMOTHY WILLIAMS; A. G. Sulzberger reported from Kansas City, Mo., and Timothy Williams from New York.

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- When the temperature rises to three sweltering digits, it is a sure sign of a stolen summer day: Children find little joy in the outdoors, adults recoil at the work of their sweat glands and whole communities slog forward in the hope of a cooler tomorrow.
But like a hamburger flipping endlessly on a grill, each turn of a calendar page of late has brought more punishing heat to the Midwest, the South and even the ocean-cooled coasts. 
The heat wave has been particularly unrelenting in Wichita, Kan., where the temperature first hit 100 this year on May 9, the earliest ever recorded. And for 20 more days, the temperature has passed that milestone -- it reached 101 on Tuesday and is expected to remain near or above that mark for the next week, according to the National Weather Service.
But if you really want to know how hot it is, head to Michael Rausch's farm outside of Wichita, where for the first time in his 57 years, he is wearing shorts as he walks his fields and milks his cows.
''I'm out there with my white legs and boots on, and it looks silly,'' he said on Tuesday. ''But I don't care what people think. I'm just trying to stay cool.''
Other signs can be found at Freddy's Frozen Custard, where the air conditioner cannot keep up with the heat and the employees cannot keep up with the orders; or at the city parks, where fully clothed adults stroll into the sprinklers alongside children because at some point, long past, cool is preferable to dry; or at baseball diamonds, where the position of catcher has been abandoned altogether rather than forcing children to don the extra gear.
''Take your hair dryer, turn it on high, turn it on hot and turn it into your face,'' said Ross Viner, head of Drums Across Kansas, who is already preparing for ways to keep a thousand students in itchy uniforms cool when they arrive for an annual marching band competition next week. ''That is what Wichita is like right now.''
Though no meteorologist will dispute that it is uncomfortably hot right now, it is certainly not the hottest summer on record.
For this summer to earn those bragging rights, temperatures would have to remain at about their current levels through the end of August, which meteorologists say is unlikely. Even the most sun-baked places like Wichita would have a long way to go to trump records (50 triple-digit days in 1936).
''This heat wave is hot, but we've seen heat waves like this in the last 10 years,'' said Jeff Masters, director of meteorology for Weather Underground. He noted that last month had been only the 26th hottest June in the past 117 years. ''It's notable but not extreme.''
The heat does have real consequences, of course, prompting the National Weather Service to issue heat warnings across much of the country. So in many places, children are being taken to movies and bowling alleys rather than to parks and soccer fields. Fans are being distributed to low-income families without air conditioning, and cooling centers have opened for those in need.
In Kansas, there have been no reports of heat-related deaths, a state spokeswoman said. But there are concerns about an economic toll. Ranchers say cows are eating less -- lowering beef and milk production. The ranchers are also worried about a replay of last year when hundreds of cows died because of heat. More than 4,000 turkeys reportedly died at a poultry farm over the weekend. Farmers note that the heat is hurting corn and other crops already strained by a long drought.
''It's been getting worse every day,'' said David Widmar, an economist with the Kansas Department of Agriculture. ''There have been reports of damage across the state.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Jumped in May

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
A rise in imports of petroleum products helped widen the United States trade deficit in May to more than $50 billion, marking its largest gap since late 2008, according to government statistics released on Tuesday. 
The Commerce Department report said that exports of goods and services were $174.9 billion, while imports were $225.1 billion, resulting in a deficit of $50.2 billion. That made it the largest trade deficit since October 2008, when it was $59.5 billion, and was up from a revised $43.6 billion in April.
Exports in May were the second highest level on record after the $175.8 billion in April, while imports were the second highest after the $231.6 billion in July 2008.
Still, economists said that exports from the United States were expanding at a good pace, with a lower dollar, increased competitiveness and strong growth in global markets.
''Trade is growing at a very rapid pace,'' said Paul Ballew, a former Federal Reserve economist and now the chief economist at Nationwide Insurance. ''Emerging markets outside of the U.S. have come back briskly. It is a very uneven recovery but there are pockets of real strength.''
The department said the April-to-May decrease in exports reflected lower sales of industrial supplies and materials; consumer goods; and foods, feeds and beverages. The rise in imports reflected more industrial supplies and materials; capital goods; and automotive vehicles, parts and engines.
The increase in imports reflected mostly $4.3 billion more for industrial supplies and materials and $1.2 billion in capital goods.
Crude oil imports were up more than 10 percent in May because of strong volume and higher prices, totaling $29.4 billion. The deficit in petroleum goods was $30.4 billion, making it the highest since October 2008, when it was $34.5 billion.
Consumer demand in the United States appeared weaker, resulting in a slack growth of less than 1 percent for non-pharmaceutical consumer products. But a rise in capital goods imports could be a good sign for domestic production down the road, economists said.
Foreign trade is expected to raise real gross domestic product growth in the second quarter, although economists expect its contribution to be smaller. Gregory Daco, a United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said that his estimate for trade's contribution to gross domestic product has declined to 0.6 percent from 1.1 percent, based on the stronger import figures.
''One very surprising element was the rebound in automotive imports,'' Mr. Daco said. ''We were expecting somewhat of a drag from the disruptions in the supply chain because of Japan. We did not see that.
''That is a sign that automobile production will gradually recover as we import more vehicles and parts.''
The monthly report also showed that the United States trade deficit with China grew to $25 billion in May from $21.6 billion in April, the largest deficit the United States has with any country.
The goods and services deficit increased $8.1 billion from May 2010 to May 2011. Exports were up $22.8 billion, or 15 percent, and imports were up $30.8 billion, or 15.9 percent.

HEADLINE: Fed Officials Divided on Need for More Monetary Stimulus

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers disagreed on whether additional monetary stimulus would be needed even if the outlook for economic growth remained weak, minutes of their meeting last month showed.
''A few members noted that, depending on how economic conditions evolve, the committee might have to consider providing additional monetary stimulus, especially if economic growth remained too slow to meaningfully reduce the unemployment rate in the medium run,'' the Federal Open Market Committee said in the minutes of its June 21-22 meeting, released Tuesday in Washington.
''On the other hand, a few members viewed the increase in inflation risks as suggesting that economic conditions might well evolve in a way that would warrant the committee taking steps to begin removing policy accommodation sooner than currently anticipated.'' 
Policy makers cut their forecasts for growth this year before a July 8 government report showed that employers added jobs in June at the slowest rate in nine months. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said at a June 22 news conference that growth would pick up as energy prices subsided and disruptions of parts from Japanese factories eased, while also leaving the door open to additional stimulus. In their meeting, policy makers also agreed on a strategy for withdrawing record monetary stimulus and adopted a new set of communications guidelines.
A divided Federal Open Market Committee means officials are likely to prolong their low interest-rate policy, said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.
''The majority view is that they can't ease because inflation is rising, but at the same time they can't tighten because the unemployment rate is too high, so they're on hold,'' Mr. Low said.
The minutes show some officials have doubts about whether their policy toolkit has anything more to offer. ''A few participants expressed uncertainty about the efficacy of monetary policy in current circumstances but disagreed on the implications for future policy,'' the minutes said.
Some members of the committee ''saw the recent configuration of slower growth and higher inflation as suggesting that there might be less slack in labor and product markets than had been thought,'' the minutes said. In that case, ''the withdrawal of monetary accommodation may need to begin sooner than currently anticipated in financial markets.''
The Fed's Washington-based governors and regional presidents agreed to complete their $600 billion bond-buying program, known as QE2 for the second round of quantitative easing, as scheduled at the end of June.
''The Fed will be watching and waiting to learn more about the economy,'' said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase & Company in New York. ''One camp is worried about what happens if growth slows more than expected. The other camp is worried about what happens if the rise in inflation isn't transitory.''
Policy makers also renewed their pledge to hold interest rates ''exceptionally low'' for an ''extended period.'' The Fed has kept its target rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. Mr. Bernanke said at the June press conference the Fed would be ''prepared to take additional action, obviously, if conditions warranted,'' including the purchase of more Treasury securities.
''Most'' committee members said the rise in inflation would ''prove transitory'' and that over the medium term inflation would ''be subdued as long as commodity prices did not continue to rise rapidly and longer-term inflation expectations remained stable.''

HEADLINE: British Distiller Diageo Shifts Its Focus in Acquisitions to Fast-Growing Markets

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- Baijiu, a popular Chinese spirit known for its harsh and fiery kick, might not be everyone's preferred drink, but the management at Diageo liked it so much that it pursued a takeover of a baijiu maker in China for two years.
When the Beijing authorities last month finally allowed the deal between Diageo, the world's largest liquor maker, and Shui Jing Fang to go ahead, Diageo's chief executive, Paul S. Walsh, was in an airplane crossing the Atlantic. He plans to celebrate the acquisition, which could be worth as much as $1 billion, by sharing a shot of baijiu with his team in Singapore this week. 
Like its rivals, Diageo, the British maker of Smirnoff vodka and Johnnie Walker scotch, is going after local spirits makers in faster-growing economies like China to make up for declining sales elsewhere.
Diageo is working on a new management structure it plans to announce in August that will allow it to better track local consumer trends in China, Africa and Latin America.
''These markets are getting to a size that they have real scale now,'' Mr. Walsh said in an interview last week. ''Rather than to call on the London office for support, they need to stand on their own feet.''
Mr. Walsh plans for half of Diageo's sales to come from developing economies within the next four years. Diageo, which also makes Guinness and Ciroc vodka, generated 32 percent of sales from these markets in 2010.
To achieve that goal, Mr. Walsh says he plans to shift investments from the mature markets of Europe and the United States to the faster-growing regions.
''I need fewer sales people in Greece, and I need more sales people in Asia and Latin America,'' he said, sitting in his office, the shelves of which are lined with special editions of Diageo brands, including Shanghai White, a baijiu-infused vodka it sells in Hong Kong and Macao.
Diageo's profit rose 1.5 percent, to $:1.63 billion, or about $2.6 billion, in 2010 from $:1.61 billion a year earlier as growing demand for spirits in China and Latin America and for beer in Africa made up for slower growth in the United States and Europe.
Sales in the nine months that ended on March 31 fell 3 percent in Europe, as many consumers in Greece and Ireland stayed home rather than go to restaurants or bars.
Some analysts said Diageo's push into Asia was long overdue because its French rival, Pernod Ricard, the world's second-largest liquor company, had been quickly gaining market share there and had started to challenge Diageo's No. 1 position. But with about $:2 billion cash in hand, Diageo has a larger war chest for acquisitions than Pernod Ricard, which owns Absolut Vodka.
Still, acquisitions in developing markets can be complex, which the baijiu deal showed. They also are few and far between and sometimes expensive, analysts said.
''The level of competition is intensifying and the level of investment you have to make is high,'' said Matthew Webb, an analyst at JPMorgan Cazenove in London. ''It's a good opportunity, but it's not without risks.''
Local spirit brands in Asia were too small or unattractive for companies like Diageo seven years ago, Mr. Walsh said. Yet as disposable incomes among Asian households grow, so do local brands. ''In these new markets there are no huge businesses to buy,'' he said. ''But I want to see more of these local deals.''
Diageo is now in takeover discussions with the family that owns Jose Cuervo, the world's biggest tequila brand, that could be worth $2 billion. Diageo already distributes Cuervo.
Any deal would add to an already busy year for takeovers. In its largest deal since it bought some Seagram brands in 2000, Diageo agreed to pay $2.1 billion for the Turkish distiller Mey Icki in February. A month earlier, Diageo bought a 23.6 percent stake in Halico, one of the biggest spirits producers in Vietnam.
In June, the company took a 50 percent controlling stake in the Guatemalan rum producer Zacapa.
Some analysts said Diageo could also bid for Fortune Brand's Jim Beam bourbon label to increase its market share in the United States. Mr. Walsh did not rule it out and said Diageo was being careful not to let its footprint in the United States diminish. But he said as far as acquisitions were concerned, his attention was now on emerging markets.
''They realize that they put too many costs behind the mature markets and that they have the finances to participate in acquisitions and investments again,'' said Laetitia Delaye, an analyst at Kepler in Paris. ''It's a new turning point.''
The shift would also be reflected in Mr. Walsh's travel schedule. Instead of doing short trips abroad, he says he plans to spend a month at a time in Singapore, Mexico and other faster-growing economies. ''I'm keen to spend more time there,'' he said.
Diageo was created in 1997 through the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan, though many of its brands, including Johnnie Walker, are more than 100 years old. Diageo, a combination of the Latin word for day and the Greek word for world, went on to sell food businesses it inherited from Grand Metropolitan, like Burger King, to focus on spirits and beer.
Diageo started to step up its marketing and distribution investments outside its British and Irish home markets in 2004. Last year, marketing spending in Asia, Latin America and Africa increased by 15 percent compared with just 2.7 percent in North America and Europe.
Part of its marketing efforts is the Johnnie Walker House in Shanghai, which Diageo opened in May to promote the scotch brand in China, where it lags Pernod's Chivas Regal. Visitors to the restored $3.2 million villa, which once belonged to Mao's tutor, can relax surrounded by walls made of peat, a kind of turf that is burned to give scotch its smoky flavor, and floors made of straightened whiskey barrels.
Mr. Walsh, whose favorite drinks are Johnnie Walker and Guinness, says he hopes to open more Johnnie Walker houses soon. But he says he is equally excited about the growth prospects for rum.
''Rum is becoming a more discerning product,'' he said. ''It has a lot to offer and appeals to those who find Johnnie Walker too much. It has this little risque Latin feel.''

HEADLINE: They're Here. With Mayo.

BYLINE: By BETSY ANDREWS

 BODY:
NEW YORK is being invaded! With their claws and tails cunningly camouflaged in split-topped buns, lobsters are everywhere, passing themselves off as street food.
Blame overfishing of predatory cod, credit sustainability-minded lobstermen; for lots of reasons, there's a glut of Maine lobster, and a glut of new lobster rolls in New York. But be careful: abundant doesn't mean economical. At $8 to $25, better choose wisely.
Like many lobster roll peddlers, Lots o' Lobstah, lotsolobstah.com, has its meat (the usual claws and knuckles, plus tails) caught, cooked and packed in Maine. Then it's whisked to stands at New York street fairs. There it appears pleasingly chilled but chewy on the Ay Up roll, with a tad of parsley-flecked mayonnaise, or it's spicy with cayenne and garlic and crunchy with celery and chive on the New York roll, with its tasty charisma ($15 each, or $8 for a half). 
Another carnival hawker is the Oceana chef, Ben Pollinger, who, along with the live Maine lobster wholesaler Homarus, sometimes sells ''classic'' Maine, buttery Connecticut and banh mi-style rolls at fairs. On weekdays, Mr. Pollinger's table outside Oceana, 120 West 49th Street; (212) 759-5941, oceanarestaurant.com, lures Midtowners with the classic version. Woe to those who take the bait. For $15, you get a parcel from a dish tub of pre-wrapped rolls: measly meat and big celery bound with an underwhelming lobster mayo on a gummy bun. It's a sad little lunch.
Leave it to the World Financial Center to host its pumped-up opposite. At Ed's Lobster Bar Kiosk on the waterfront, 225 Vesey Street (Liberty Street); (917) 364-3787, lobsterbarnyc.com, Ed McFarland's six-ounce celery-and-chive-dotted blob of musky mayonnaise-y lobster meat bobs atop its butter-drenched roll like one of the sprawling yachts in the adjacent marina ($25). It's an object of conspicuous consumption as befits the captains of finance. We ordinary seamen would do well to get with a mate, order one large and one small three-ounce roll ($13), and split the difference.
Another Ed (Ed Brown, of Ed's Chowder House) does a hazardous riff on the lobster club at Ed's Raw Bar at BeerParc, Eventi hotel,851 Avenue of the Americas (West 29th Street), (646) 600-7140, foodparc.com/eateries/beerparc. Celery, lemon and Tabasco tease the meat, mayonnaise binds it, and lettuce, tomato and avocado crowd it ($12). Then Nueske's bacon bits strafe the gentle lobster like smoke bombs. And the roll tends to split (inconvenient for the business-casual crowd propping plates on laps in the BeerParc courtyard).
Seating is more comfortable in Greenpoint at Lobster Joint, 1073 Manhattan Avenue (Eagle Street), (718) 389-8990, lobsterjoint.com, one of the few brick-and-mortar newcomers. Its sea-hued interior is home to the prettiest lobster-roll combo ($17), with snappy slaw, a pickle and chips, fries or, best of all, salad -- a bright addition to what boils down to ''bugs,'' fats and carbs. The fats are judiciously employed here, but tarragon overwhelms the seafood, which isn't quite chilled enough and can be chalky. Booze helps. Kraken spiced rum and ginger beer make for a squall of a Dark and Stormy.
Also tending toward chalkiness is the lobster at the new financial district location of Luke's Lobster, 26 South William Street (Broad Street), (212) 747-1700, lukeslobster.com, and at Luke's new truck. That's a pity because otherwise Luke's makes a roll ($15) so bracing and pure, it's hard not to love. The meat is well chilled; it's bound with a nod to Hellmann's, seasoned just right with celery salt and finished with a lovely drizzle of lemon butter. If only the texture were ideal.
The Red Hook Lobster Pound has also taken to wheels this summer, (646) 326-7650, redhooklobsterpound.com. On its knockout Connecticut roll (hot butter, smoked paprika, blades of sharp scallion) and its Maine roll (nicely chilled with a touch of homemade mayo, celery, scallion and shredded lettuce), the meat is ample, firm and sweet (each $16). It tastes as fresh as can be, which matters when you're dealing with a trend that's growing so fast, it threatens to fall off its bloom.

HEADLINE: Plenty of Action Before the Game, Not Much of It on Immigration Law

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- The All-Star Game parade was snaking along Jefferson Street on Tuesday afternoon when a rancorous voice rang out from the crowd.
Rebecca Garcia leaned over a guardrail and addressed the Arizona Diamondbacks' bobcat mascot, Baxter, who was pawing a Dodgers cap as he strutted across the red-carpeted street.
''Step on it! Step on it!'' she screamed. ''Beat L.A.!'' 
It was the loudest grievance voiced all day and it would not go unheard. Baxter gave Garcia a thumbs-up, placed the Dodgers cap on the carpet and stood back as a pickup truck carrying Washington Nationals pitcher Tyler Clippard ran over it.
The midsummer classic at Chase Field did not foment significant protests over illegal immigration, as many predicted (and a few promised) in the wake of the passage last year of S.B. 1070, which would tighten the surveillance and prosecution of suspected illegal immigrants. There had been talk of demonstrators passing out white ribbons to protest the law.
But hours before the game, which the National League won, 5-1, the white accessory sported by seemingly every other fan filing into the stadium was a hotel chain's promotional tea towel, which could be redeemed for $75 off a two-night stay.
In the end, commerce trumped conscience. It was no mystery why the fervor over the immigration law was as flat as a half-full can of soda left in the 100-degree heat.
The sign of the times was not carried by any protester. It was a billboard a mile and a half from the stadium that offered personal loans for people with unexpected bills.
For a state hard hit by the recession, the bustling downtown before the sold-out game was a welcome sight, like a rainbow after a devastating storm.
''Look at all the people who are coming in and enjoying this,'' said Garcia, an Arizona native. A few blocks away, her sentiments were echoed by Sam Carter, who said: ''Arizona is a broke state. Arizona needs this.''
Carter, a mechanic, was with his friend Francisco Cantu who had spent the morning in court. Cantu said he crashed Carter's car into an apartment complex. While investigating the accident, the police charged him with marijuana possession -- but did not ask him for proof of citizenship.
The 82nd All-Star Game had already been awarded to Phoenix when S.B. 1070 was passed. There was talk of moving the game, which longtime Arizonans like Joe Rhein knew better than to dismiss as an idle threat.
The 1993 Super Bowl was shifted from Phoenix to Pasadena, Calif., because of Arizona's refusal to observe the holiday for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Citizens eventually voted to make it a paid holiday, and the 1996 Super Bowl was held in Arizona.
''In our case, over the long term, I thought everything worked out well,'' Rhein, the point man for Arizona's 1993 Super Bowl bid, said in a telephone interview.
He added, ''It was very important for the Diamondbacks, as an organization, to host the All-Star Game because they are still a relatively young organization, just like the Cardinals were to Arizona in 1993.''
The downtown area was festooned in red-white-and-blue bunting and had the feel of a belated Fourth of July block party. Along the parade route, team mascots threw trinkets into the crowd: red-white-and-blue bead necklaces and rubber balls and the like.
A little off the red-carpeted path, Karl Wolf of the Big Papa -- not to be confused with David Ortiz, a k a Big Papi -- ferried fans to Chase Field on his bicycle taxi.
The carnival scene included religious barkers. Three men stood on the corner of Washington and Third and took turns preaching to people making their way to the convention center for Fan Fest. Unlike the major league players who had floated the idea of boycotting the All-Star Game after the passage of the immigration law, Robert Gray, Bobby McCreery and Rick Skeens had the courage of their convictions.
''This is not a protest,'' McCreery said. ''It's a proclamation.''
One could find protesters, but they were not taking up the cause of illegal immigration. A block from the parade route, near the gleaming Alliance Bank building, four union members belonging to Carpenters Local 408 were handing out fliers denouncing unfair labor standards.
Nothing could dampen the spirits of Tidbit, a Cubs fan from St. Louis attending her 43rd consecutive All-Star Game. She was impossible to miss in sunglasses tinted with the Cubs logo and a jersey dress adorned with the logos of all the N.L. teams.
Tidbit, 56, said she was part of a pack of fans who traveled to every All-Star Game. A few of the regulars, she said, chose to boycott this year's event. But nothing was going to keep her from being here. She grew teary as she explained this could be her last All-Star Game because she already has endured a liver transplant and now her kidneys are failing.
''This is my World Series,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Dissident Chinese Writer Is 'Ecstatic' After Finding Freedom in Germany

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Li Bibo contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- After being denied an exit visa 17 times, yanked off planes and trains by the police and threatened with yet more prison time, one of China's most persecuted writers, Liao Yiwu, slipped across the border into Vietnam last week and then made his way, via Poland, to Germany, where he promptly declared himself an exile.
''I'm ecstatic, I'm finally free,'' he said in a telephone interview from Berlin on Monday morning before plunging into a day of interviews and photo shoots. ''I feel like I'm walking through a dream.''
Of course, his escape -- arranged by friends whom he declined to name -- has not brought unadulterated joy. By fleeing his homeland, Mr. Liao, 52, made the difficult decision to abandon the wellspring of his work, much of it journalistic explorations of China's downtrodden: the political outcasts, impoverished farmers, death row inmates and others who have been traumatized by famine and Communist-inspired zealotry, then cast aside during the nation's manic embrace of material wealth and collective amnesia. 
He also leaves behind his family in southwestern Sichuan Province, including his mother, his son, two siblings and a girlfriend. ''I'm trying to convince myself that I won't be away from China very long, that things will change sooner than later,'' he said.
In the West, Mr. Liao is best known for ''The Corpse Walker: Real-Life Stories, China from the Bottom Up,'' which was banned in China soon after it was published in Taiwan in 2001. The book, a collection of interviews with people he encountered in prison and during wanderings in the southwest, tells the unadorned stories of 27 people, among them a public toilet attendant, a persecuted landlord, and the men, known as corpse walkers, whose job it is to transport the dead back to their hometowns for burial.
After it was published, his already strained relationship with the authorities worsened. He was barred from traveling to literary festivals in Germany, Australia and the United States, and was forced last spring to sign a vow to cease publishing outside China. Breaking the pledge, he was warned cryptically, would bring even greater torment.
Given the predicament of his friend Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize winner and writer who is serving an 11-year sentence for subversion, Mr. Liao knew what might await him. The threat gained greater urgency with the impending publication in the United States of ''God Is Red,'' a book by Mr. Liao about Chinese Christians, and a memoir about his time in jail, ''The Witness of the 4th of June.'' The memoir, whose title refers to the military suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, has been delayed several times by skittish publishers in Germany and Taiwan.
His most recent travails are part of a wholesale stifling of creative expression and dissent by the ruling Communist Party. Rattled by turmoil in the Arab world, the government began cracking down on scores of activists and rights lawyers in February. The most prominent victim has been Ai Weiwei, the caustic artist and social critic.
''I think Liao Yiwu's decision to leave really reflects the extreme unease that writers in China are facing right now,'' said Larry Siems, the director of international programs at the PEN American Center, an advocacy group. ''It's a shame, because he is one of China's most interesting writers, and he has his eyes on some of the great human dramas that accompany China's emergence as an economic power. China should be unleashing the imagination of its writers instead of trying to restrain and control them.''
The Chinese government has yet to respond to news of his escape. The public security bureau in his hometown would not discuss his case; calls and e-mails to the Chinese Embassy in Berlin were not returned.
Like many of his generation, Mr. Liao has endured a numbing cascade of hardships. He nearly starved to death as an infant during Mao's disastrous Great Leap Forward, when famine killed more than 20 million people. When he was a child, he and his classmates were forced out of school by the Cultural Revolution, the decade in which education was maligned as a bourgeois indulgence. Much of what he learned came from his father, a teacher of Chinese literature, and his mother, a music instructor.
''As a boy, my dad would make me stand high up on a table and not allow me to come down until I finished reciting the classics,'' he said.
As early as 1987, he drew the ire of cultural bureaucrats for poetry, printed in official journals, that was condemned as too pessimistic and anti-establishment. After the Tiananmen crackdown, he experienced the stinging limits on free expression. Inspired by Allen Ginsberg and by Dante's ''Inferno,'' he and five friends circulated poems recited on video that lamented the bloodshed in Beijing. Mr. Liao called the piece ''Massacre.''
Not long afterward, in 1990, he and the others were jailed as ''counterrevolutionaries.'' His four years of confinement were characterized by torture and the terror of watching 20 inmates be dragged out for execution. Twice, he said, he tried to kill himself.
But it was in jail that Mr. Liao met many of the characters who would fill ''The Corpse Walker.'' It was also where he learned to play the xiao, an ancient flutelike instrument that sustained him as a street musician during long bouts of joblessness after his release. Those were bitter years, he said, when friends and even his wife found him politically radioactive.
''I never imagined they would distance themselves from me as if I were the plague,'' he said. ''From this, I concluded that people's memories can be easily erased.''
Since then, Mr. Liao has devoted himself to collecting the memories of people on the margins of society. For ''God Is Red,'' he sought out Christians in rural Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces who had endured years of official persecution.
Mickey Maudlin, the executive editor of HarperOne, described it as refreshingly devoid of polemics. ''Liao isn't trying to score ideological points,'' Mr. Maudlin said by phone from San Francisco. ''He's just trying to describe how people survived in an environment that is not very friendly.''
Mr. Liao said that since he reached Germany, he has been too overwhelmed and excited to eat or sleep much. Having arrived with no money, he is relying on the generosity of friends, his German publisher and, he hopes, royalties from his forthcoming books. He speaks neither German nor English, and said he was unsure whether to plunge into learning a new language.
''Germany, the U.S. and Australia have all welcomed me,'' he said. ''But the place I really want to be is China.''

HEADLINE: The Budget Talks as Political Mirror

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Ideology Trumps Economics'' (editorial, July 12):
The economic ideology of both Democrats and Republicans tells us a lot about what kind of country we want to be going into the 2012 presidential election. Democratic Party ideology is more compassionate toward the sick, the elderly, the disabled and the most vulnerable, and fights spending cuts for social programs. Republican Party ideology tends to abhor vital social programs, and its survival-of-the-fittest philosophy demands permanent tax cuts for the rich. 
The gulf between America's haves and have-nots grows wider every day. We are a stronger and better nation when both sides of the political divide incorporate compassion into their ideology. Compassion unites us; selfishness divides us. The rich, the middle class, the poor are all important. We are in this together and need one another. The most generous in any society should be those to whom much has been given. It is time to play the compassion trump card.
PAUL L. WHITELEY Sr. Louisville, Ky., July 12, 2011
To the Editor:
If both political parties can agree that certain government expenditures are wasteful, unproductive, ineffective or accruing to the wrong beneficiaries, they should be able to agree to cut these expenditures. Nobody in Washington wants wasteful government, so it is a place where compromises can be forged. No area should be spared, including defense, entitlements and welfare.
The problem is that Democrats are unwilling to consider any suggestions that certain programs are not getting the job done or are too expensive. And Republicans have not proved that there are programs that deserve to be cut.
Republicans should identify this low-hanging fruit and agree to the elimination of abusive tax loopholes. Maybe then we can end this crisis, approve an increase in the debt ceiling, and give the economy an opportunity to grow and recover.
SALVATORE J. BOMMARITO New York, July 12, 2011
To the Editor:
The stance taken by Republicans has less to do with ideology than with special interests. Republicans have a way of bringing up ideology when it suits their political purposes and not being concerned with it when it doesn't.
Where was all the Republican ideology during the Bush years when wars were waged, and the prescription drug program was enacted, by borrowing the money to pay for it all? Now that the consequences have hit home and the Republicans can use the problems they have created to hurt this president, it's all about ideology.
In fact, the one thing consistent about Republican policy is reducing government revenue by cutting taxes and reducing government regulation; this was done in the Bush years and is still front and center. Nobody believes that revenue increases proposed by President Obama that would not be scheduled to go into effect before 2013 would have a serious effect on the current economy.
But special interests (large corporations and many wealthy citizens) that support Republicans don't want to pay their fair share for the necessary services and infrastructure that government provides that make their wealth possible. If there is an ideology the Republicans are pushing, this is it.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall a 3rd Day On Europe and Earnings

BYLINE: By REUTERS; Bettina Wassener reported from Hong Kong. Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.

 BODY:
Stocks closed lower for a third consecutive day on Tuesday as Europe's fiscal woes and a weak start to technology earnings gave investors little reason to buy even after the recent losses.
Moody's downgrade of Ireland's credit rating late in the session provided the latest jolt to investors, reminding them of the scope of Europe's debt problems.
Stocks bounced briefly after the release of the Federal Reserve's minutes with comments by Fed officials suggesting the possibility of more policies to stimulate the economy, but uncertainty over Europe kept investors away from beaten-down shares. On Monday, stocks posted their worst day in a month. 
''The Fed gave us a little pop, but people are more worried about the issues in Europe right now,'' said Steven M. Roge, portfolio manager at R.W. Roge & Company ''That said, given the recent losses, I expect us to tread water until we get more clarity on Europe and earnings.''
European officials would not rule out default by Greece. Investors feared the crisis could overtake the larger Spanish and Italian economies.
The concern is that bank exposure to troubled euro zone debt will hurt their profits and liquidity. Barclay shares listed in the United States slid 2.5 percent, to $14.60.
European issues resurfaced after Moody's downgraded Ireland's credit rating to junk status, saying it would probably need additional rounds of official financing.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 58.88 points, or 0.47 percent, to close at 12,446.88. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 5.85 points, or 0.44 percent, to 1,313.64. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 20.71 points, or 0.74 percent, to 2,781.91.
The Nasdaq underperformed the other two indexes, but chip makers' shares fell sharply after Novellus Systems said it expected bookings to continue to fall as chip makers curbed capacity. Novellus fell 11.2 percent to close at $31.75. The semiconductor index lost 2.9 percent.
According to the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's June meeting, which were released Tuesday afternoon, some Fed officials are ready to provide more monetary policy easing if the recovery is deemed too sluggish to cut the nation's unemployment rate. But others said the Fed should tighten sooner than expected if recent increases in inflation did not moderate.
The Fed's second round of quantitative easing, which ended in June, contributed to sharp stock gains. Some stock analysts have questioned the market's prospects in a tighter environment.
''People were expecting a flat-out: 'No, this is it. This is the end of the line,' and the fact that the door is still a little bit open provides a little bit of hope,'' said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer of OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Ill.
In an economic report, the Commerce Department said an increase in imports of petroleum products helped widen the United States trade deficit in May to more than $50 billion, its largest gap since late 2008.
The department said that exports of goods and services were $174.9 billion, while imports were $225.1 billion, resulting in a deficit of $50.2 billion. That made it the largest trade deficit since October 2008, when it was $59.5 billion, and was up from a revised $43.6 billion in April. Interest rates were lower for a second straight day.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 13/32, to 102 4/32, and the yield fell to 2.88 percent from 2.92 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: China's Economy Slowed a Bit in the 2nd Quarter

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
The Chinese economy expanded at an annual rate of 9.5 percent during the second quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics reported on Wednesday, a figure that, for all its strength, represented a slowdown from the sizzling pace of previous quarters, and underlined the challenges now facing policy makers in Beijing. 
China's economy, the second-largest in the world after that of the United States, expanded 9.7 percent year-on-year during the first quarter of 2011, and 9.8 percent in the last three months of 2010.
While the reading was strong compared with the expansion in the United States, Europe and Japan and was slightly firmer than analysts had projected, it underlined how much more moderate China's expansion has become in recent months.
Much of the slowdown has been deliberately engineered by the authorities in Beijing, who have over the last year gradually tightened the spigot on the ample lending that has fueled growth, but also contributed to sharp rises in property prices and overall consumer prices. The central bank has also raised interest rates five times since last October, most recently last week.
The tightening has caused some concern that China's economy could slow down more rapidly than intended, thus weakening what has become a critical pillar of growth for the entire world.
However, most economists believe that China is headed for a soft -- rather than a hard -- landing, and Wednesday's robust figures appeared to support those expectations.
However, inflation remains stubbornly high, at least for now, with data from Saturday showing consumer prices rose 6.4 percent in June from the same month last year. The prices of some foodstuffs, like pork, have risen even more sharply.
Inflation has become a major concern for policy makers in Beijing, who worry that price rises could fuel discontent among the many millions of ordinary Chinese.
The government has repeatedly pledged to lower inflation, and a spokesman for the national statistics bureau repeated this mantra. ''We should stick to our effort to control prices,'' he said, according to The Associated Press.
The combination of slower growth and persistent inflation has put the government in a quandary, analysts say: While more aggressive tightening could mitigate inflation, it also risks stifling economic growth.
''The government's desire to maintain growth by sustaining a healthy level of liquidity expansion is counterbalanced by the need to rein in inflation, in part caused by an abundance of liquidity,'' Jing Ulrich, chairman of global markets for China at JPMorgan, wrote in a note on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Assassination In Afghanistan Creates a Void

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN and SCOTT SHANE; Alissa J. Rubin reported from Kabul, and Scott Shane from Washington. Reporting was contributed by Carlotta Gall, Jack Healy, Abdul Waheed Wafa and Sangar Rahimi from Kabul; Eric Schmitt and Mark Mazzetti from Washington; and Andrew W. Lehren from New York.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Ahmed Wali Karzai, the powerful half brother of Afghanistan's president, was assassinated Tuesday, removing from the political scene a divisive power broker who was accused of corruption and alienated the American military, but whose connections and ruthlessness made him a critical force in volatile southern Afghanistan.
The death of Mr. Karzai, who effectively ruled much of the country's southern tier from Kandahar, sent tremors through the country's political establishment and raised questions about whether tenuous security gains made by the influx of American forces in the south could hold.
Mr. Karzai was shot to death by a police official, Sardar Muhammad, a longtime confidant, who was immediately killed by Mr. Karzai's bodyguards, Afghan officials said. Mr. Muhammad's body was later hung above a busy Kandahar street. His motives were not known; the Taliban claimed responsibility for the killing, but there was no evidence that Mr. Muhammad, a member of the Karzais' Populzai tribe, had ties to the insurgency. 
The immediate implications of Mr. Karzai's death for the American-led war against the Taliban and the withdrawal of American troops beginning this month were uncertain. Many in the region warned that the Taliban, as well as competitors for Mr. Karzai's position, would try to take advantage of the power vacuum and that without him the hard-earned security gains made by American and Afghan troops over the past year could erode.
American military commanders have long argued that Mr. Karzai's reputation for blatant self-dealing undercut support for the government among many Afghans, and some wondered on Tuesday whether his death might make room for a leader with greater integrity.
But those commanders had clashed with Central Intelligence Agency officers who had long paid Mr. Karzai for information and other services and saw him as a crucial broker of intelligence and influence. Mr. Karzai identified Taliban fighters for attack by American forces, recruited Afghan men for a NATO-allied ''Kandahar Strike Force,'' and even rented space to the agency in the city, officials said.
In a sense, contradictory American attitudes toward Mr. Karzai have reflected the evolving American war strategy. When the United States was trying to win over the population with a counterinsurgency strategy, the corruption he symbolized was an insurmountable obstacle. But as the Obama administration has gradually embraced a more limited counterterrorism policy -- killing Taliban fighters and moving toward political negotiations -- Mr. Karzai became an indispensable, if never fully trustworthy, ally.
''We viewed him as more of an enemy of our enemy than as a friend,'' said Bill Harris, who until last November served as the senior American diplomat in Kandahar.
''The fact is, we made common cause with A.W.K. during the last fighting season to run the Taliban out of Kandahar, and we should make no apologies for that,'' Mr. Harris said, using the government's shorthand for Ahmed Wali Karzai. ''His death will only complicate an already complicated situation.''
One American official on Tuesday lamented the ''huge power vacuum'' left by the assassination. ''Do we care more about security and fighting the Taliban, or about drugs and corruption?'' said the official, who would discuss the internal debate only on the condition of anonymity. ''I think that most people would agree that taking on the Taliban is our top priority, and Ahmed Wali Karzai helped us with that.''
Mohammed Naim Hamidzai Lalai, the chairman of the Afghan Parliament's internal security committee and a Kandahari, said, ''His presence in Kandahar was like a backbone for the security of the province.''
The president, Hamid Karzai, held a news conference in Kabul with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France barely two hours after the shooting, speaking in a steady but somber voice as he confirmed the death of his half brother.
''This is the life of Afghan people,'' he said. ''This sorrow is in every Afghan home; every one of us has this sorrow.'' Then he turned to Mr. Sarkozy and said, ''We welcome Mr. Sarkozy and hope he forgives us for not speaking with a smile today.''
President Karzai flew to Kandahar later in the day to attend mourning ceremonies along with much of the Pashtun political elite, even as a power struggle began for the lucrative business deals, trade routes and political influence that Ahmed Wali Karzai previously controlled not only in Kandahar Province, but also in neighboring Helmand Province, the heart of the country's poppy production, and Oruzgan and Zabul Provinces.
Some of the jostling for power may involve other family members. Mr. Karzai's relatives said the killing came as Mahmoud Karzai, another brother of the president, who has been under criminal investigation in the United States, was moving to live full time in Kandahar. Two young cousins of the president, Hashmat and Hekmat Karzai, who have been feuding with Ahmed Wali and Mahmoud, are also viewed as vying for greater political and economic power, the relatives said.
Ahmed Wali Karzai, who was about 50 at the time of his death, had always denied the accusations that most American and Afghan officials believed: that he had connections to the opium trade, skimmed millions of dollars off contracts for supplying NATO troops and made deals with some Taliban even as he fiercely fought others. He delivered votes for President Karzai and gave him a measure of confidence that the Karzai family's hold on its ancestral homeland in the south was secure.
American military strategists have praised the growing stability in the south in the wake of the buildup in troops there and have said they plan to shift troops to the east this winter. But those plans could be slowed if instability rises again in the south.
Lt. Gen. David W. Barno, a former American commander in Afghanistan who is now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said the killing of Mr. Karzai ''threatens to undermine the complex power structures that the U.S. and NATO forces have relied upon over the last year to support counterinsurgency gains in this region.''
Mr. Karzai, he said, ''had the family ties, the tribal connections and the political and security muscle to get things done in and around Kandahar -- and the coalition took full advantage of that power.''
It was a compromise many in the military came to reluctantly, and after failing to move him aside.
Military officials said that in April 2009, Gen. David D. McKiernan, then the top American commander in Afghanistan, told subordinates that he wanted them to gather any evidence that might tie the president's half brother to the drug trade. ''He put the word out that he wanted to 'burn' Ahmed Wali Karzai,'' one of the military officials said.
But by the following year, the effort to persuade President Karzai to ease his half brother out of power, perhaps with a diplomatic posting, had failed. The bruising internal battles over Mr. Karzai's role were largely settled, though there remained disagreements in Washington about whether his virtues as a tough ally against the Taliban balanced out the land grabs and corruption schemes that turned many Afghans against the government in Kabul.
''We tried to appeal to the better angels of his nature,'' said a Western official who had watched Ahmed Wali Karzai for years. ''But there was no turning him around, or rehabilitating him. We recognized that we needed him to help run the show down there. He controls everything, he has fingers in many pies. It was a marriage of convenience, so here we were banging on about corruption and he's a poster child for it.''

HEADLINE: Mayoral Election Still Two Years Off, but Fund-Raising Is Already Well Under Way

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Eying a bid for New York mayor in 2013, the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, raised a robust $1.3 million in the first half of this year, outpacing all of her likely rivals, according to campaign finance estimates released Tuesday.
And two potential mayoral candidates -- Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, and Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president -- posted figures of almost $700,000 each. 
By contrast, William C. Thompson Jr., a former city comptroller who lost to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2009, reported raising a modest $250,000. But his supporters said that his campaign got off to a late start and that they anticipated raising a significant amount before the next report is due to the city's Campaign Finance Board, in January 2012.
The mayoral election is still two years away. Many political analysts believe that by that time, the major contenders all will have raised enough money to qualify for the city's generous campaign finance matching program, which particularly rewards contributions from small-dollar donors. Each dollar that a New York City resident gives, up to $175, is matched by $6 in public funds, with a maximum of $3.5 million in matching funds during the primary.
Still, political consultants say that early fund-raising reports are useful as a gauge of the level of enthusiasm for candidates. There is also an incentive for city candidates to raise money in 2011, because the political world's attention -- and money -- is expected to shift to the presidential and Congressional races in 2012.
''The campaign fund-raising reports that will come out this week are like an early primary in the mayoral race,'' said Cynthia R. Darrison, a Democratic fund-raiser who has not yet signed up with a 2013 mayoral candidate.
In her latest filing, which included a same-sex marriage event on Monday night, Ms. Quinn reported donations in small amounts (like $11) and from big stars (Rob Reiner, Jon Bon Jovi, Anna Wintour and Harvey Weinstein). Over all, she has roughly $4 million in her coffers, and is on track to finish fund-raising for the primary in the fall. She could then begin to raise money for a general election campaign.
''In the last month, Chris Quinn helped pass marriage equality, save thousands of teacher jobs, stop 25 firehouses from being closed and now had her best fund-raising period ever,'' said Mark Guma, a Quinn consultant. ''She is on a roll.''
Mr. Stringer's haul means that he now has $2.7 million, with the most common contribution, he said, being $50.
''In a city of over eight million people, you can still run an Iowa-caucus kind of campaign, and that is what we are doing,'' Mr. Stringer said. ''It's sitting in a living room with 10, 20 people, exchanging ideas, making your pitch, getting their feedback, hearing what they think.''
Mr. de Blasio, meanwhile, posted an impressive figure that political analysts said should eliminate any concerns that his grass-roots campaign, built with strong labor support, would be unable to attract enough donors.
''Strength begets strength,'' he said. ''My filing makes very clear that I'm going to have the resources I need for whatever I do next.''
Betsy Gotbaum, Mr. de Blasio's predecessor as public advocate, said that her preferred candidate, Mr. Thompson, still had plenty of time. She noted that Ms. Quinn's predecessor as speaker, A. Gifford Miller, posted strong fund-raising reports at the same point in 2003, prior to the 2005 mayoral election, and still lost badly.
''We know we're behind everyone else, but that's O.K., because we're enthusiastic,'' she said.
Mr. Thompson's successor as comptroller, John C. Liu, said through an aide that he would disclose his preliminary figures if an article about them focused heavily on him -- an arrangement that was not agreed to. He had $484,000 in his account in January.
It remains possible that other candidates will jump into the race. And on Tuesday, another Democrat did announce, unexpectedly, that he would enter the contest: Tom Allon, the publisher of Manhattan Media, which owns community newspapers including The New York Press and City Hall. A strong supporter of Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Allon said in an interview that he would campaign as a pragmatic, nonideological political newcomer, emphasizing education, job creation and economic development.
''I like each and every one of them,'' Mr. Allon said of the other Democrats. ''I think each of them would make very able mayors. But I think given where the city is and the strides we've made, it's going to require a certain skill set where someone who has not purely been in the public sector will have an advantage. And I think I fit that mold much better.''

HEADLINE: In Children's Art, a Block's New Face

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Fifty years ago, 84th Street, between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, beat out some pretty stiff competition to be designated the ''worst block'' in New York City - a ''ghetto of sociopaths,'' in the words of the rector of a nearby Episcopal church who despaired that city officials would ever do anything to clean up the mess.
What propelled 84th Street past other contenders was a blockwide street brawl that erupted on July 5, 1961, involving about 400 combatants armed with knives and lye, which sent one man to the hospital after it was thrown in his face. Police officers' attempts to quell the disturbance by firing shots in the air were unavailing. Nine patrol cars had to be dispatched to break up the melee. 
A visit to the block one day last week revealed a much different landscape. Granted: the measure of so complex an ecosystem as a city block cannot be taken in an hour. But for that hour, on that quiet block, it can be reported that most passers-by were mothers walking fearlessly with little children.
The real delight of the block was to be found at the east end, alongside Public School 9. There, five exuberant student artworks - all but one made from recycled plastic bottles or bags - ornament the otherwise forbidding institutional expanse. They all give delectable voice to the notion of blooming, which was the theme of the school's Art Night this year.
''Parents, students and any teachers that can be there - but particularly our art teachers - are on hand for Art Night to showcase the work of their kids,'' said Tara Maurice, who has children in the first grade and in pre-kindergarten. ''We have fantastically talented art teachers at P.S. 9, and many parents that are architects and designers.''
Ms. Maurice said a deliberate choice was made this year to use recycled materials as a significant element in the Art Night projects. Not only were lots of bottles and bags brought into the school, but the stands from last year's projects were reused. The community sculptures, as they are called, were under the supervision of Lilia Rivera, another parent.
''The actual sculpture happens during the Art Night event,'' Ms. Maurice said. ''Although there is a plan - of course when you have that many hands on deck, things take their own path and directions, sometimes surprisingly. And that is the beauty of the event.'' Participants in Art Night get to sample international cuisine in a potluck dinner in which families bring dishes from their countries of origin.
The crew along 84th Street was much different 50 years ago, as described by McCandlish Phillips in The New York Times of July 7, 1961:Drunkenness. Unemployment. Gambling. Overcrowding. Prostitution. Homosexuality. Narcotics addiction. Despair. These are things that went into the making of a brawl on West 84th Street, in which 400 Negroes and Puerto Ricans battled Wednesday afternoon, fighting for they knew not what.
And these are the things that give the long block between Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues a sinister, brooding quality and make it look like a slice of the Bowery.
This is, clearly, more than a slum. A slum is good people in bad houses. But this, as one man put it yesterday, is a ''ghetto of sociopaths.''The man in question was the Rev. James A. Gusweller, rector of the Church of St. Matthew and St. Timothy at 26 West 84th Street, who had been shouting himself hoarse at city officials in his efforts to get some help.
When the government finally did respond, moved in part by the ugly episode of July 1961, it did just about the only thing it seemed to know how to do in those days: condemning the decrepit housing, razing it and erecting big public institutions on the vacant lots. Both P.S. 9 and the Louis D. Brandeis High School, across 84th Street, opened in 1965. But Mr. Phillips, writing on the fifth anniversary of the melee, said ''they have not cured the problems of 'the worst block in the city.' ''
When asked to reflect on those troubled times, which now seem so distant, Ms. Maurice noted that the school itself evolved year after year ''as students change and new parents come in with ideas, passions and personalities.'' Given the way schools and cities change, Ms. Maurice said she was not startled to learn of the block's unsavory reputation a half century ago.
''It would surprise me more,'' she said, ''to find out that the block we have now is the same block that existed 50 years ago.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Toyota Pitches Its RAV4 to a New Demographic

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
TOYOTA this week introduced an ad campaign promoting its RAV4 compact sport utility vehicle to the African-American market.
Created by Burrell Communications, the campaign is the first time Toyota has marketed the vehicle directly to African-Americans, though it has previously advertised many of its cars, including the Camry, Corolla and Prius, to that demographic.
''The African-American market is looking for a vehicle that combines the utility of an S.U.V. with a more carlike ride,'' features the RAV4 offers, said Bob Zeinstra, national manager for advertising and strategic planning for Toyota Motor Sales USA. 
The vehicle ''fills a pretty important niche,'' added Monica Warden, group account director of Burrell Communications, which is based in Chicago, is 49 percent owned by the Publicis Group and has previously worked with Toyota. African-American car owners ''are looking for versatility, and the RAV4 drives like a car, has great acceleration and roominess,'' she said.
The timing of the campaign, which began Monday, is meant to coincide with the summer selling season, said Mr. Zeinstra, who also said Toyota wanted ''to generate momentum as we move to the normal August sales event.''
People are active and outdoors now, he said, and ''this is the kind of vehicle they're looking for.''
The star of the new campaign is a bulldog named Benny, who accompanies his owner, Mark, on excursions around Los Angeles in their red 2012 RAV4; Benny's thoughts are heard in a voiceover.
In one of the campaign's two 30-second TV spots, Benny says he and Mark ''were in the RAV4, it was a rough day. Got into a scuffle with the poodle across the street.''
The two pick up Mark's friend, Nina, load the car with a few items and drive through mountain scenery. Later, as Mark and Nina sit holding hands and looking up at the starlit night sky, Benny says, ''As always, the RAV handled the journey like a dream and we got to see something that would stay with us for the rest of our lives. I even forgot about the poodle. I love that day. It was one of my faves.''
In a 30-second radio spot, Benny announces, after barking and clearing his throat, ''I'm Benny and yep, I'm a bulldog. Me and my owner Mark are best friends, and with RAV4 we are a crew!''
The TV ads are running on BET, TV One, TBS and TNT, while the radio spot is running on programs like the ''Tom Joyner Morning Show.''
On Monday, Toyota introduced digital and mobile ads featuring Benny in the RAV4 that are running on sites like BlackAmericaWeb.com and Myxer.com.
Ms. Warden said her agency opted to have a dog star in the campaign because Benny was a ''memorable character, and provides an interesting way in. A dog allows us to speak to men and women, and we're targeting both.''
She said the African-American car buyers whom Toyota was trying to reach were 25 to 49 years old, ''active, youthful, with fairly old-fashioned values, some college education'' and a household income of over $50,000. Introduced in 1996, the RAV4 is now in its third generation and has a base price of $22,475.
Jeffrey M. Humphreys, director of the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia, a research center that studies the multicultural United States economy, suggested one reason Toyota was pursuing African-American consumers was that the recent growth rate of their disposable personal income had exceeded that of the total United States population.
According to Mr. Humphreys, African-Americans' disposable personal income grew 60 percent from 2000 to 2010 and was expected to rise an additional 30 percent by 2015. The total United States population had a 52 percent increase in disposable personal income between 2000 and 2010, and will have a projected 27 percent increase by 2015.
''It's a numbers game. That's where the growth is, so that's where they're focusing their ad dollars,'' Mr. Humphreys said.
Priya Raghubir, a marketing professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, praised Burrell's choice of a bulldog as a ''mascot'' for the RAV4.
''It's extremely memorable, like the Budweiser Clydesdale horses in their Super Bowl ads,'' she said.
To many people, ''dogs are the new children, and therefore I think a campaign like this could also be appreciated by dog-lovers irrespective of their demographics,'' she added.
However, Rohit Deshpande, a professor of marketing at the Harvard Business School, criticized the campaign, calling it ''something that was pasted on. The creative was not developed from the ground up, there's nothing specific here to African-Americans except African-American models and what seems to be rather stereotypic patois coming out of a dog's mouth.''
He said car manufacturers generally ''have a product-centric approach, not a customer-centric approach, where you figure out the needs of a group, design a product to fit them and then communicate this. Cars get built on a long development cycle where it becomes 'sell what's on the lot' rather than 'design from scratch to delight specific customer segments.' ''
According to industry sources, Toyota will spend $5 million to $10 million on the new advertising through early 2012.

HEADLINE: Debt Talk Mired Leader For G.O.P. Proposes Options

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- From the White House and Congress to financial centers, pessimism spread on Tuesday about the prospects of a debt-limit deal between President Obama and Republicans, prompting the Senate Republican leader to propose a ''last-choice option'' that piqued the administration's interest but angered conservatives in his own party.
The leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said a bipartisan budget-cutting deal is probably out of reach, making it unlikely that Republicans would approve an increase in the government's debt limit by Aug. 2. To prevent default, he proposed that Congress in effect empower Mr. Obama to raise the government's borrowing limit without its prior approval of offsetting cuts in spending.
Administration officials welcomed the McConnell initiative for at least signaling that both parties' leaders were committed to averting a potential economy-shaking government default; many Democrats in Congress saw it as a way to avoid the sort of deep cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that Republicans have sought as the price of their votes for a debt-limit increase. 
But many conservatives immediately assailed Mr. McConnell's proposal as a panicky sell-out, much as they in recent days had attacked the House Republican leader, Speaker John A. Boehner, for privately discussing with Mr. Obama a debt-reduction deal that could raise revenues as well as cut spending -- ultimately forcing Mr. Boehner to retreat.
Mr. Boehner, though, suggested he could be open to the McConnell proposal, highlighting concern among the Republican leadership about how the showdown with the administration would end, the blame the party could suffer if a debt-limit crisis hurt the economy and the challenge of leading their rank and file into a compromise.
Mr. Boehner, in an interview on Fox News, said, ''I think everybody believes there needs to be a backup plan if we are unable to come to an agreement, and frankly I think Mitch has done good work.''
Yet Mr. Boehner also acknowledged the limits of his own leadership given the passions of conservatives on the issue. ''I don't think such a proposal could pass the House in any way, shape or form,'' he said. ''You have a number of members who will never vote to raise the debt ceiling and a large block of members who believe this really is the moment to put our fiscal house in order.''
Mr. McConnell made his proposal after days in which Mr. Obama has been on the offensive in the fight over the budget, calling for more deficit reduction than Republicans are and urging both parties to put ideology aside in favor of compromise.
While Mr. McConnell's plan would face an array of political and perhaps constitutional issues, it signaled that Republican leaders did not intend to let conservative demands for deep spending cuts provoke a possible financial crisis and saddle the party with a reputation for irresponsible intransigence. And with prospects for a broad budget deal having dimmed, Mr. McConnell's plan would shift both substantive and political responsibility onto Mr. Obama, forcing him to take almost sole ownership of a debt-limit increase and any consequences from not doing more to address the budget deficit.
The longtime conservative activist Brent Bozell encouraged followers online to call Mr. McConnell's office, saying he had ''betrayed the trust of the American people.'' And Newt Gingrich, a Republican presidential candidate, wrote on Twitter, ''McConnell's plan is an irresponsible surrender to big government, big deficits and continued overspending.'' Yet Mr. Gingrich is no stranger to the risks in a showdown with a president of the other party; in the mid-1990s, as House speaker, he forced a government shutdown in a budget fight with President Bill Clinton that backfired against Congressional Republicans.
The conservatives' reaction against Mr. McConnell, coming after their earlier attack on Mr. Boehner, raised the prospect that the White House has long feared -- that Republican leaders cannot lead a rank-and-file membership that is defiantly opposed to compromise with Mr. Obama.
Among administration officials, that fear offset their relief that the McConnell proposal suggested at least a fallback in the event that the talks break down.
''Senator McConnell's proposal today reaffirmed what leaders of both parties have stated clearly, that defaulting on America's past-due bills is not an option,'' the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said in a statement. ''The president continues to believe that our focus must remain on seizing this unique opportunity to come to agreement on significant, balanced deficit reduction.''
The latest White House meeting of nearly two hours on Tuesday afternoon ended with both sides agreeing to return Wednesday and further seek up to $2 trillion in debt reductions. But the two parties remain far apart on Mr. Obama's demand that a quarter of the package come from higher taxes on the wealthy and businesses.
With the deadline for raising the government's $14.3 trillion debt limit just three weeks away, Tuesday seemed a new low in the weeks of maneuvering and negotiations between the White House and Republicans.
Mr. McConnell, who after Republicans' gains in the November elections said their goal would be to make Mr. Obama a one-term president, said in a morning speech in the Senate, ''After years of discussions and months of negotiations, I have little question that as long as this president is in the Oval Office, a real solution is probably unattainable.''
Mr. Obama stoked Republicans' political concerns when, in answering a question in an interview with CBS News, he said he ''cannot guarantee'' that the government can pay benefits next month to Social Security recipients, veterans and the disabled if Congress does not increase the debt limit by August.
In outlining his proposal hours after his speech excoriating Mr. Obama, Mr. McConnell told reporters: ''If we're unable to come together, we think it's extremely important that the country reassure the markets that default is not an option, and reassure Social Security recipients and families of military veterans that default is not an option.''
Mr. McConnell's proposal would give Mr. Obama sweeping power to increase the government's borrowing authority, in three increments, by up to $2.4 trillion -- enough, it is estimated, to cover federal obligations through next year -- only if Mr. Obama specifies spending cuts of equal amounts. Congress would vote on whether or not to approve Mr. Obama's debt-limit increases, but the president could veto any disapproval and presumably sustain his veto in the House and Senate. And Congress would not have to approve the proposed spending cuts prior to the debt-limit increase.
Representatives of major business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Financial Services Forum, issued statements urging a bipartisan accord on raising the debt limit. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York opened an unrelated event on Tuesday morning by saying, ''If America, for the first time in its history, defaults on its obligations, it would have a catastrophic effect on our financial system and on our credibility around the world.''

HEADLINE: Stubborn Presence in Debt Wrangling: Deep Distrust

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- If President Obama thought he could rattle House Republicans with his warning on Tuesday that Social Security checks might get held up in the event the debt limit was not raised soon, he was mistaken.
''That's not leadership; that is sad and pathetic,'' said Representative Allen West, a freshman Republican representing thousands of Social Security recipients in South Florida. He said the president and the Treasury secretary could pay pressing federal obligations out of money still coming in, and if they say they cannot, ''Then they are liars.''
Mr. West is no outlier in the House Republican majority, where distrust of the Obama administration runs deep and warnings of economic Armageddon do not seem to be moving lawmakers toward a compromise. 
Instead, many Congressional Republicans seem to be spoiling for a fight, calculating that some level of turmoil caused by a federal default might be what it takes to give them the chance to right the nation's fiscal ship.
''I certainly think you will see some short-term volatility,'' said Representative Austin Scott of Georgia, the president of the freshman class. ''In the end, the sun is going to come up tomorrow.''
Such sentiments are strongly influencing the negotiating posture of House Republican leaders as they try to strike an agreement with the White House while remaining well aware that the rank-and-file seem more than prepared to oppose a deal if they believe it falls short of the deep spending cuts they contend are required. The determination of the Republican freshmen reflects a sense among some of them that the last time they went along with a budget deal -- in April, when Congressional leaders negotiated a spending-cut package with Mr. Obama for this year to keep the government operating -- the cuts were not as deep as they were portrayed to be.
Though the new members were not in Congress in 2008 for the vote on the bank bailout during the height of the financial crisis, there is lingering sentiment in Republican circles that the risks of rejecting the program were also overstated in that case.
The clout of the freshmen and other House conservatives was clearly seen in the decision by Speaker John A. Boehner to pull back from trying to reach a sweeping deficit deal that would have taken new revenue while tinkering with Bush-era tax cuts that many House Republicans hold sacrosanct. Freshman lawmakers say it was their insistence that has also led House Republican leaders to set a vote for next week on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.
''A month and a half ago, the leadership was laughing about the notion of a balanced budget amendment,'' said Representative Joe Walsh, a freshman from Illinois. ''They are not laughing now.''
Mr. Walsh said he considered the implications of the nation's $14.3 trillion debt to be much more serious than any fallout from failing to increase the federal debt limit by a Treasury Department deadline.
''As far as I am concerned, the president is clueless,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''He has no idea how severe this debt crisis is. We have a $14 trillion debt and the economy is teetering and he gets in here and is talking about nickels and dimes. They are not serious.''
With both sides seeming to be returning to their respective corners in the budget fight, the outlook for a quick agreement seemed slim.
Surveying the party positions, a senior House official said Tuesday that there was no proposal circulating that could attract anything near the 218 votes required for House approval given Republican desires for cuts beyond the roughly $2 trillion now being discussed and the Democratic push for new revenue.
But Mr. Boehner, following a closed party meeting Tuesday where he and other Republican leaders heaped disdain on the White House, said he still hoped a default could be averted.
''I was born with a glass half full,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''I'm the optimist. I'm going to continue to be the optimist that we can do the right thing for the country.''
Acknowledging that no deal may pass muster with many Republicans, Senate and House Republican leaders began exploring an escape hatch that would essentially allow all Republicans to vote no but allow the debt ceiling to rise nonetheless.
Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Budget Committee chairman seen as the voice of fiscal authority among House Republicans, said that he believed an agreement leading to a debt limit increase would eventually be reached, but that the impasse could extend beyond the administration's Aug. 2 drop-dead date.
''Let's say we go past Aug. 2,'' he said in an interview. ''As time goes on, the situation deteriorates, so I do believe there will be something.'' He pointed to ''macroeconomic circumstances and credit markets -- and also paying the bills -- Social Security, Medicare, the troops.''
''I think there ultimately will be something,'' he said. ''I really honestly don't know what it's going to be. I really don't.''
To Democrats, the rising sentiment in the House that the federal government could indeed default seemed almost unthinkable.
''It is unacceptable to believe that we would allow the federal government to default on its bills,'' Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, told reporters. He said every House leader he had talked to had acknowledged that a default ''would have an extraordinarily negative impact, so there's no dispute about that.''
But House Republicans outside leadership circles say they see no resolution unless Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats get more serious about cutting.
''Why are we continuing down the same path when it is not working?'' asked Mr. Scott, the freshman class leader, who said freshman Republicans had the long-term fiscal health of the nation in mind.
''The thing to remember about the freshman class is we have 300 children and grandchildren among the members,'' he added. ''We are going to protect their economic opportunities.''

HEADLINE: Why Taxes Will Rise In the End

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com; twitter.com/DLeonhardt

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Polls show that most Americans are opposed to raising the federal debt ceiling. Even when the Pew Research Center included the consequences in its question -- a national default that would damage the economy -- slightly more people were against raising the ceiling than were for it.
How could this be? Above all, I think it reflects a desire to return to the good old days. Not so long ago, nobody was talking about tax increases or Medicare cuts, and the federal budget seemed to be in fine shape. If only we could get back to the past -- get spending under control, as the cliche goes -- we'd be O.K. The debt ceiling, with its harsh finality, offers the chance. 
Unfortunately, this nostalgic view depends on a misunderstanding of the budget. It imagines a budget in which the United States indefinitely has the world's highest medical costs, its largest military, an aging population and, nonetheless, taxes that are among the world's lowest. Economists have a name for that combination: a free lunch.
Free lunchism is ultimately the problem with the no-new-taxes pledge that so many politicians have adopted. A refusal to raise taxes, no matter how principled, cannot take us back to the good old days. It would instead lead to a very different American society. For taxes to remain where they are, Washington would need to end Medicare as we know it, end Social Security as we know it, severely shrink the military -- or do some combination of the above.
''We cannot repeat the past when it comes to the federal budget,'' Douglas Elmendorf, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, recently wrote. ''The aging of our population and the rising cost of health care have changed the backdrop for federal budget policy in a fundamental way.''
The most important part of the recent Republican budget plan, written by Representative Paul Ryan, was that it acknowledged this reality (in its details, if not its packaging). It called for no tax increases. To make the numbers come close to adding up, the plan also called for eliminating the current Medicare and replacing it with a system in which the elderly would buy less generous private insurance plans. Such is the price of no new taxes.
Early indications are that Americans don't like Mr. Ryan's plan all that much. In upstate New York this spring, a Democrat won a typically Republican House district by campaigning relentlessly against the plan. National polls show huge majorities favor keeping Medicare and Social Security in something approaching their current form -- much larger majorities, tellingly, than oppose an increase in the debt ceiling.
In the near term, Congressional Republicans have decided to play down the Ryan plan. Most continue to oppose new taxes, without going so far as to explain the consequences. They will have little trouble sticking to that position through the current debt ceiling fight, because the deficit does not need to be solved immediately.
Eventually, though, drawing up a credible deficit plan with neither Ryan-like cuts nor higher taxes will be impossible. And you can already see the start of a potential Republican compromise.
It revolves around raising taxes, on net, by shrinking corporate or individual loopholes. The country's highest-ranking Republican, John Boehner, the speaker of the House, signaled his openness to such a deal last week. (Mr. Boehner abandoned the deal under pressure from Representative Eric Cantor, the No. 2 House Republican and a Tea Party ally.)
Stalwart Republican economists -- like Martin Feldstein, a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Ronald Reagan, and Gregory Mankiw, who held the same job under George W. Bush -- also favor raising taxes by closing loopholes. So do most of the Republicans from the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles deficit commission, including Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho, former Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and David Cote, the chief executive of Honeywell.
One obvious compromise along these lines would follow the outline sketched out by the Simpson-Bowles plan. Marginal tax rates could actually fall. But the closing of loopholes would more than make up for the loss in revenue from lower tax rates.
Conservatives might accept the deal, partly because it would satisfy their longtime desire for a simpler tax code with lower rates and partly because spending cuts would still make up the bulk of any deal. Liberals might accept the deal because tax loopholes disproportionately benefit the wealthy, and a simpler code -- even one with lower rates -- could be more progressive.
The mortgage interest deduction, for example, saves more than $5,000 a year for the typical household in the top 1 percent of earners. Most middle-income households don't benefit from the deduction at all, because they instead claim the standard income tax deduction. And the mortgage deduction is the second-largest tax break for individuals, costing about $80 billion a year, more than the budgets for the Education Department and Justice Department combined.
Yet despite all the substantive arguments for such plans, I still wonder whether one of them is the most likely outcome.
The truth is, closing loopholes has much stronger support among economists and columnists than it does among voters. Only 23 percent of Americans benefit from the mortgage deduction, but 93 percent support it. Other big breaks, like the exclusions for health insurance and 401(k) contributions, are popular, too. On the corporate side, Eric Toder of the Urban Institute has pointed out that the biggest breaks also tend to be popular, like the credit for research and development.
So what kind of tax increases do Americans support? The old-fashioned kind. Seventy-two percent support raising taxes on income above $250,000, according to a recent New York Times/CBS poll, and a large majority likewise favor raising Social Security taxes on the affluent.
In the end, the most likely tax increase may be the one that's already on the books. On Jan. 1, 2013, all the Bush tax cuts -- on the affluent and nonaffluent alike -- are set to expire, which would solve roughly one-quarter of our long-term deficit problem. If Republicans have their way, all the tax cuts will be extended. If the Democrats have their way, most of them will be.
But if the two parties each control a branch of government after the 2012 elections, neither may be able to get their way. Instead, they would have to compromise -- or a stalemate would cause the Bush tax cuts to disappear. After the last few days, a stalemate doesn't seem like such a bad bet.

HEADLINE: White House, In Shift, Turns Against Syria Leader

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and DAVID E. SANGER; Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration, after weeks of urging Syria to carry out democratic reforms and end a brutal crackdown, has now turned decisively against President Bashar al-Assad, saying that he has lost legitimacy and that it has no interest in Mr. Assad keeping his grip on power.
President Obama, in an interview Tuesday with the ''CBS Evening News,'' stopped short of demanding that Mr. Assad step down. But administration officials said the president may take that step in coming days, as he did with Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, much earlier in that country's popular uprising. 
Mr. Obama's comments, and even stronger ones by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday, showed that the administration has now concluded that Mr. Assad is no more willing or capable than Colonel Qaddafi of opening a dialogue with protesters or overseeing a political transformation.
The turning point in the administration's public posture came after angry crowds attacked and vandalized the United States Embassy in Damascus, and the residence of Ambassador Robert Ford, after his visit to Hama, the hub of the current protests and site of a bloody crackdown by Mr. Assad's father in 1982.
But administration officials said the shift has been weeks in the making, as Mr. Assad's government has continued to harass and jail demonstrators, quash peaceful protests, and clamp down attempts to organize a political opposition. The crackdown has also begun to threaten regional stability with thousands of Syrian refugees fleeing across the northern border into Turkey.
''You're seeing President Assad lose legitimacy in the eyes of his people,'' Mr. Obama said to the CBS anchor, Scott Pelley. ''He has missed opportunity after opportunity to present a genuine reform agenda. And that's why we've been working at an international level to make sure we keep the pressure up.''
On Monday, Mrs. Clinton said, ''If anyone, including President Assad, thinks the United States is secretly hoping that the regime will emerge from the turmoil to continue its brutality and repression, they are wrong. President Assad is not indispensable, and we have absolutely nothing invested in him remaining in power.''
Mrs. Clinton's comments seemed calculated to answer critics who pointed to the striking difference in how the administration responded to Libya and Syria -- and contended that it has acted too gingerly toward Mr. Assad, fearing that his downfall would destabilize other countries in its neighborhood.
Administration officials said they had no choice in Libya: Colonel Qaddafi is notoriously unpredictable, and had threatened to send his troops house-to-house in Benghazi, killing his opponents. In Syria's case, there is no military remedy. NATO nations have no interest in acting in Syria, and there is no chance of a United Nations Security Council resolution equivalent to the one that NATO is enforcing in Libya. Russia has made clear it would reject any resolution condemning Mr. Assad.
Unlike Libya, Syria is a force in the region, one that the administration once thought could be drawn away from Iran's orbit and play a part in an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. Some critics, however, have always contended that it was naive to assume that the Assad government could be a force for peace.
Still, until recently some American officials argued they were better off with Mr. Assad in power than with a power vacuum that could threaten the stability of Lebanon and security of Israel, and might be filled by Iran. But now that Mr. Assad ''has shown definitively he has no interest in reform,'' one senior official said, ''the rationale for holding on to him has evaporated.''
The United States, officials said, is readying fresh sanctions against senior members of the Assad regime, and is weighing sanctions on Syria's oil and gas industry. It is also watching a meeting of opposition groups set for this Saturday, which officials said could offer hope that the opposition -- disorganized and lacking in leaders after decades of repression -- is developing a viable transition plan.
Mr. Assad, officials cautioned, was far from being toppled. On any given day, they said, his government or the opposition holds the upper hand. But the upheaval has badly damaged Syria's economy. For the first time, a senior official said, ''the government has admitted that this is a crisis.''
''What led Washington, as well as the Turks and the Europeans to change their minds, was Assad's complete lack of reliability,'' said Andrew Tabler, an expert on Syria at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ''He promised not to use live fire against protesters, and the next day, he used live fire.''
While Mr. Tabler said the Assad regime was ''degrading and disintegrating,'' he added, ''most people believe this is going to take a long time.''
Marshaling action against Syria's oil and gas industry is complicated, Mr. Tabler said, because European and Canadian companies have investments there. The United States also has to worry about Arab neighbors like Saudi Arabia or Kuwait trying to throw Mr. Assad a financial lifeline in the name of regional stability.
The United States has tried to bring other forms of pressure to bear. It leaned on the International Atomic Energy Agency to refer to the United Nations a finding that the Syrian government sought to build a secret nuclear reactor, which was destroyed by Israel in a nighttime raid in September 2007. Mr. Assad has denied the facility had any nuclear use; the atomic energy agency concluded differently. The reactor was built, intelligence officials say, with secret aid from North Korea.
The mob attack on the United States Embassy and residence, as well as a similar assault on the French Embassy, brought a statement of condemnation from the United Nations Security Council. But the unanimity required of the 15 council members has proved harder to muster for any stronger action.
Administration officials said Mr. Ford's visit to Hama, where he was met by welcoming crowds, showed the value of sending an envoy to Syria -- something members of Congress have criticized. While the officials said they could not prove Mr. Ford's presence there averted a violent assault by security forces, one said: ''It's very possible. A lot of people were expecting Hama to be very ugly.''

HEADLINE: Fulfilling Vow, I.M.F.'s New Chief Names American and Chinese Deputies

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Baton Rouge, La.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Christine Lagarde, the new head of the International Monetary Fund, named an American official as her chief deputy Tuesday and, in a move that reflects China's rising influence, added a Chinese official to the ranks of her senior advisers.
David A. Lipton, a White House economic adviser, will become the fund's senior deputy managing director in September, after the previously announced retirement of John Lipsky. The United States, which owns a controlling share of the fund, maintained its historic insistence that an American should fill the position, just as a European has always headed the fund. 
But Ms. Lagarde also bowed to the future by naming a Chinese economist, Zhu Min, to a newly created position as the fourth deputy managing director. Mr. Zhu's elevation follows a campaign promise by Ms. Lagarde to increase the role of China and other emerging economies in managing the fund. The other two deputy directors, who will remain in place, come from Egypt and Japan.
''These appointments are part of a grand bargain that allowed Europe to retain its hold on the top job,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University who worked at the fund for 17 years. ''This may be one of the few instances where the three largest economic powers -- China, Europe and the U.S. -- found their short-term interests closely aligned.''
Mr. Zhu is a member of an elite group of Chinese economists who blossomed intellectually in the 1980s, exchanging market-oriented ideas at frequent social meetings in Beijing and Shanghai, and then scattered to rise through the ranks of various Chinese bureaucracies. An early graduate of Fudan University after Chinese universities reopened after the Cultural Revolution, Mr. Zhu came to the United States to earn a doctorate in economics at Johns Hopkins University.
He worked in Washington as an economist at the World Bank from 1990 to 1996, then returned home to become an executive at the Bank of China. He played a central role in reorganizing the company's operations so it could be listed on the Hong Kong stock market in 2002. He moved to the People's Bank of China as a deputy governor in October 2009.
The fund's previous managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, named Mr. Zhu to the newly created position of special adviser to the managing director in February 2010.
In announcing the appointment, which still requires the formality of approval by the fund's executive board, Ms. Lagarde said Mr. Zhu would aid ''in strengthening the fund's understanding of Asia and emerging markets more generally.''
Mr. Lipton is the senior director for international economic affairs for the National Economic Council and the National Security Council.
After completing a doctorate in economics at Harvard in 1982, Mr. Lipton worked as an economist at the fund for eight years. He joined the Clinton administration in 1993, rising to the position of under secretary for international affairs.
In between Democratic administrations, Mr. Lipton worked at Citigroup and at the hedge fund Moore Capital Management.
Mr. Lipton's selection was dictated by the Obama administration. The United States created the fund after World War II to provide a lender of last resort for troubled governments, and America still controls 16.77 percent of the voting shares, an effective veto because 85 percent of the votes are needed for big decisions.
Those decisions now are mostly focused on Europe, where the fund has pledged billions of dollars to prop up Greece. The fund also is a main stage on which the United States and China compete for international support for their economic policies.
''David's greatest strengths are his creativity and drive to solve things definitively,'' the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said in a statement.
Mr. Lipsky, a former chief economist at JPMorgan Chase, will complete his five-year term in August. He briefly took charge of the fund after the sudden resignation of Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who faces charges of sexually assaulting a New York hotel maid.

HEADLINE: A Pathway Out of the Debt Crisis: Senate Republicans back away from the explosive threat that their party made

 BODY:
Political gain, not economic sense or sound policy, has always been at the core of Republican strategy on the debt-ceiling talks -- a cynical ploy to appear serious about cutting spending while actually holding hostage the nation's strong credit rating. Now that the real risks to their strategy are becoming apparent, including the possibility of cutting off Social Security checks, the more experienced members of the party are beginning to rethink their plans. 
On Tuesday, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, proposed a convoluted fallback solution that would at least defuse the crisis his party created a few weeks ago by threatening to force the country into default on its national debts. The plan is no less cynical than the original threat, but if the House goes along, it may allow Washington, the credit markets and the American people to breathe a little easier.
Mr. McConnell's plan would allow President Obama to raise the debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion in three increments through the end of 2012. Congress could vote to disapprove each increment, but the president could veto its resolutions of disapproval, and the debt ceiling would then rise.
The president would have to identify possible spending cuts equal to the debt ceiling increases, but he would get to choose the cuts, and would not have to make them before the two chambers vote. Congress would be unable to force him to make the cuts it wants, except through the regular appropriations process.
The proposal is clearly meant to shift all the blame for raising the debt ceiling onto the president, and away from Republicans. Every Republican in Congress could proudly vote against the debt increases, but the ceiling would still go up, because there are not enough Republicans to override a veto. It's a distinction that makes sense only in the current Washington frame of mind, but it's a trade-off worth making to avoid either a default or radical cuts to discretionary spending and entitlement programs.
Republicans always planned to ''blame'' Mr. Obama for the debt ceiling increase, even if there was a deal. The House speaker, John Boehner, said Tuesday that the debt ceiling was the president's problem, as if Mr. Obama alone had cut taxes, started wars, expanded Medicare and bailed out Wall Street. Republicans are no less complicit in running up the nation's borrowing; they simply do not want to pay the bills now that they have come due.
Twice in the last few weeks, Republicans have walked away from proposals that would have cut trillions from federal spending, including entitlement programs, because Democrats insisted there could be no widespread cutting without tax revenue increases. Although some conservatives and presidential candidates are already accusing Mr. McConnell of surrendering, he and others in the party's leadership apparently decided that charge would be easier to bear than raising taxes. That's especially true now that the White House is warning that a default could halt Social Security checks.
All Mr. McConnell wants is the ability to yoke the debt increase to Mr. Obama, and his offer gives him two extra chances to do so. He hopes the maneuver will help his party win back the Senate and the White House, which remains a long shot. But at least he is no longer holding the economy hostage to his goals. It is now time for the House to reach a similar conclusion.

HEADLINE: Banking on the Future

BYLINE: By MICHAEL B. LIKOSKY. 
Michael B. Likosky, a senior fellow at the Institute for Public Knowledge, New York University, is the author of ''Obama's Bank: Financing a Durable New Deal.''

 BODY:
FOR decades, we have neglected the foundation of our economy while other countries have invested in state-of-the-art water, energy and transportation infrastructure. Our manufacturing base has migrated abroad; our innovation edge may soon follow. If we don't find a way to build a sound foundation for growth, the American dream will survive only in our heads and history books.
But how we will pay for it? Given the fights over the deficit and the debt, it is doubtful that a second, costly stimulus package could gain traction. President Franklin D. Roosevelt faced a similar predicament in the 1930s when the possibility of a double-dip Depression loomed. 
For this reason, the New Deal's second wave aggressively pursued public-private partnerships and quasi-public authorities. Roosevelt described the best-known of these enterprises, the Tennessee Valley Authority, as a ''corporation clothed with the power of government but possessed of the flexibility and initiative of a private enterprise.''
A bipartisan bill introduced by senators including John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, seeks a similar but modernized solution: it would create an American Infrastructure Financing Authority to move private capital, now sitting on the sidelines in pension, private equity, sovereign and other funds, into much-needed projects.
Rather than sell debt to investors and then allocate funds through grants, formulas and earmarks, the authority would get a one-time infusion of federal money ($10 billion in the Senate bill) and then extend targeted loans and limited loan guarantees to projects that need a push to get going but can pay for themselves over time -- like a road that collects tolls, an energy plant that collects user fees, or a port that imposes fees on goods entering or leaving the country.
The idea of such a bank dates to the mid-1990s. Even then, our growth was hampered by the inadequacy of our infrastructure and a lack of appetite for selling public debt to cover construction costs. Today we find ourselves trapped in a vicious cycle that makes this proposal more urgent than ever. Our degraded infrastructure straitjackets growth. We resist borrowing, fearful of financing pork-barrel projects selected because of political calculations rather than need.
While we have channeled capital into wars and debt, our competitors in Asia and Latin America have worked with infrastructure banks to lay a sound foundation for growth. As a result, we must compete not only with their lower labor costs but also with their advanced energy, transportation and information platforms, which are a magnet even for American businesses.
A recent survey by the Rockefeller Foundation found that Americans overwhelmingly supported greater private investment in infrastructure. Even so, there is understandable skepticism about public-private partnerships; Wall Street has not re-earned the trust of citizens who saw hard-earned dollars vacuumed out of their retirement accounts and homes. An infrastructure bank would not endanger taxpayer money, because under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, passed after the savings and loan scandal, it would have to meet accounting and reporting requirements and limit government liability. The proposed authority would not and could not become a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. It would be owned by and operated for America, not shareholders.
The World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank and similar institutions helped debt-burdened developing countries to grow through infrastructure investments and laid the foundations for the global high-tech economy. For instance, they literally laid the infrastructure of the Web through a fiber-optic link around the globe. Infrastructure banks retrofitted ports to receive and process shipping containers, which made it profitable to manufacture goods overseas. Similar investments anchored energy-intensive microchip fabrication.
President Obama has proposed a $30 billion infrastructure bank that, unlike the Senate proposal, would not necessarily sustain itself over time. His proposal is tied to the reauthorization of federal highway transportation money and is not, in my view, as far-reaching or well designed as the Senate proposal.
But he recognizes, as his predecessors did, the importance of infrastructure to national security. For Lincoln, it was the transcontinental railroad; for F.D.R., an industrial platform to support military manufacturing; for Eisenhower, an interstate highway system, originally conceived to ease the transport of munitions. America's ability to project strength, to rebuild its battered economy and to advance its values is possible only if we possess modern infrastructure.

HEADLINE: Young Executives in Washington

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

 BODY:
The White House and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have been at war for much of the last two-and-a-half years. One thing they can agree on, however, is the need to attract successful young people, especially at the start of an election season when campaign cash will be at a premium. 
That's one reason why a group of 125 executives, all under 30, has lined up eminent audiences on Wednesday for invitation-only meetings and briefings at the White House, the Chamber of Commerce and Capitol Hill to push for greater job creation and economic opportunities for young people.
''We're not pushing any particular political agenda,'' said Matthew Segal, 25, who is the founder of a group called Our Time in Washington that has organized the events. ''What we're pushing is economic empowerment to drive participation by young people.''
Mr. Segal points to an unemployment rate of more than 17 percent among people ages 18 to 24 as evidence of the need to rethink economic strategies. To lay out its case, the group has events set up throughout the day with senior administration officials from the White House Business Council, the Chamber of Commerce and Congress, including a leading Democrat, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, and a leading Republican, Senator John McCain of Arizona.
No, the country's most famous young executive - Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg - will not be part of the visiting delegation. (The company cited scheduling conflicts.) But the sisters who run the Georgetown Cupcake brand are expected to be there, as are Lady Gaga's manager and young adults running social media sites, fashion and entertainment firms, Internet start-ups, a pickle company, a butcher shop and a chain of lobster shacks.
''Everyone wants to hear from young entrepreneurs and young job creators,'' said Mr. Segal, who first became active in political mobilization as a college student after growing frustrated with long voting lines on Election Day in 2004. ''These are young people who are self-made. What we want to do is launch a marketplace for young people and get consumers to vote with their wallets.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Chief Under Bush Says Reform Misses Goals

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
7:26 p.m. Updated
Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, criticized the Dodd-Frank Act on Tuesday, saying the financial regulatory overhaul would fall short of its goal of protecting investors from future financial crises . 
The law ''unfortunately did not provide the regulatory reform that our financial and capital markets, and those who invest, so urgently needed and still require,'' Mr. Pitt, who was chairman of the S.E.C. from 2001 to 2003, said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
''The act is unduly complex, adds more layers of regulatory bureaucracy to an already overbloated bureaucracy, makes financial regulation more cumbersome and less nimble than it already was,'' said Mr. Pitt, now the chief of Kalorama Partners, a Washington consulting firm.
Nearly a year after President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law, the banking committee on Tuesday examined the law's efforts to protect investors. The act dedicated an entire section to ''investor protections,'' creating an Office of Investor Advocate, enhancing regulation of credit rating agencies and reining in executive pay.
But some of the corporate governance rules ''favor certain special interests at the expense of rank-and-file shareholders,'' Mr. Pitt said.
He also objected to a new corporate whistle-blower program, created under the act. In April, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a program that rewards employees who report crucial information about fraud and other wrongdoing. Under the rules, whistle-blowers are not required to report fraud internally before going to the government.
''This provision threatens to undermine corporate governance, internal compliance and the confidence of public investors in our heavily regulated capital markets,'' said Mr. Pitt, a Republican who was appointed to run the S.E.C. by President George W. Bush.
Mr. Pitt issued some support for expanding the S.E.C.'s authority to examine thousands of investment advisers. But he said the agency lacked the budget to fully take on its new responsibilities.
His comments on the agency's budget echo concerns raised by consumer advocates, who have long called for the S.E.C. to receive a budget increase.
''While we are sympathetic to those who argue that money alone cannot solve all of the agency's problems, we also believe that, without additional funding, the agency cannot reasonably be expected to effectively fulfill its investor protection mission,'' Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, told the committee.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Rush to Defend Tax Rule On Inventory and Profits

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- One of the biggest revenue-raisers proposed by President Obama in negotiations with Congress is what he describes as an arcane change in the tax treatment of business inventories -- things like steel, groceries and oil.
But however complex the details, the effect of the change would be substantial, and in pushing for it Mr. Obama has kicked a hornet's nest. Lobbyists from companies of all sizes are swarming around Congress to kill the proposal, which would prohibit the use of an accounting technique known as last in, first out, or LIFO. The technique is used to determine the cost of goods sold, and therefore the income earned, by a company. 
Mr. Obama's proposal, projected to raise $65 billion to $95 billion over 10 years, would increase the taxable income and tax liability of companies that have been using this method of accounting for decades. Small businesses, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and oil companies would be especially hard hit.
At a meeting late last week two dozen business lobbyists, working together as the LIFO Coalition, decided to redouble their efforts against the proposal by making urgent appeals to debt negotiators and lawmakers from both parties and both chambers.
The money at stake far exceeds the amounts that Democrats want to raise by curbing tax breaks for owners of corporate jets, yachts and racehorses -- the populist proposals frequently invoked by Mr. Obama to make the case that he is not seeking tax increases on the middle class.
Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said the LIFO proposal -- supported by the president's deficit-reduction commission -- would simplify the tax code and establish a standard method of calculating the cost of items that a company sells. Those costs are typically subtracted from the proceeds of a sale to determine the company's taxable income.
Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, said that in budget negotiations the White House had pushed harder for ''repeal of LIFO'' than for any other tax proposal. Mr. Kyl was the Senate Republican delegate in talks led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Visiting an Alcoa plant in Iowa last month, Mr. Obama emphasized the importance of creating jobs in manufacturing. But manufacturers say the repeal of LIFO would have just the opposite effect.
''The president's proposal would be devastating,'' said C. William Jones, vice chairman of O'Neal Industries, a 90-year-old family owned metals company in Birmingham, Ala. ''It would increase our tax bill by tens of millions of dollars. Thousands of companies would be affected the same way.''
Charles W. Mulford, a professor of accounting at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said that at first glance the LIFO proposal looked like ''an easy source of revenue.'' But, he said, ''it taxes illusory income, phantom profits that result from inflation.''
The LIFO method of accounting is beneficial to companies that face rising costs for the goods they buy or produce. They can assume, for tax purposes, that the goods sold in any given year are the ones most recently acquired. These new items -- the ''last in'' -- cost the company more than older items in its inventory, so the company's taxable income will be lower.
The Internal Revenue Service has allowed this method of accounting since the 1930s. In practice, according to the Congressional Budget Office, some companies prefer to sell their oldest inventory first, to minimize the risk that a product will become obsolete or be damaged. Under the president's proposal, White House officials say, tax-accounting rules would reflect business practice and economic reality.
But that is not true for all companies. Mr. Jones said his company sold its newest inventory first, pulling giant steel beams off the top of the stack.
''LIFO is not an accounting gimmick or a loophole,'' Mr. Jones said in an interview. ''It's been a readily accepted method of valuing inventory for decades.''
Ron Travis Jr., an accountant and vice president at O'Neal, offered an example of how the proposal would wallop his business.
''Assume that I buy a ton of steel for $1,000, buy another ton a few months later for $1,100 and then sell a ton of steel for $1,300,''
Mr. Travis said. ''Under the LIFO method of accounting, my profit is $200, and if you assume a 40 percent tax rate, I owe $80 in taxes.''
By contrast, Mr. Travis said, under the president's proposal, ''my cost would be $1,000, my profit would be $300, and I would owe $120 in taxes.''
The president's proposal would also undo the tax benefits that companies have obtained by using the LIFO method of accounting over the years.
''It's a huge retroactive tax,'' said Jade C. West, senior vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, who is leading the business coalition opposed to the change. ''The government would tell companies that they must go back and recalculate the tax savings they have claimed for decades.''
The Treasury Department said, in response to a question, that the president's proposal ''requires that tax be paid on long-deferred gains.'' However, it said, the tax could be paid over 10 years.
Mr. Carney, the White House spokesman, estimated that 40 percent of the benefits of the LIFO accounting method went to the oil and gas industry.
''If you're an oil company,'' Mr. Carney said, ''you can sell a barrel of oil today for, let's say, $100 that you bought two years ago for $40. Instead of paying taxes on that $60 profit, you pay taxes on, say, a $2 profit -- if that's what you were able to buy a barrel for yesterday, for $98.''
Stephen E. Comstock, the manager of tax policy at the American Petroleum Institute, confirmed that oil refiners would be exposed to significant new costs under the proposal.
As for Mr. Carney's example, Mr. Comstock said: ''It's correct as far as it goes, but it does not reflect the flow of crude through a refinery. If I sell more than I purchased or produced, I would have to pay tax on the difference between $40 and $100. The current method of accounting is absolutely fair.''

HEADLINE: Where a Minimum-Wage Increase Would Bite

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Increasing the minimum wage is likely to cut employment, particularly among the least educated and the unskilled, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. 
Although advertised as a well-deserved raise, another federal minimum-wage increase would eliminate paychecks for some of America's lowest-skilled workers.
Last week I explained how I estimated that the July 2009 federal minimum-wage increase reduced national employment by about 800,000. That 800,000 is the sum of employment impacts for each of several demographic groups and can therefore be used to estimate which groups were most affected by the wage increase.
For each group distinguished by age and part-time status, I calculated "impact": the percentage gaps between actual per capita employment after July 2009 and the employment I estimated to occur absent the minimum-wage increase. 
For example, I found the part-time employment impact among teenagers to be negative 14 percent: that is, 14 percent fewer teenagers were working part time since July 2009 as a result of the federal minimum-wage increase.The basic economics of the minimum wage suggests that employment impacts will be greatest among groups with the lowest hourly wages. Teenagers employed part time have particularly low hourly wages, and the hourly wages for teenagers employed full time are not much greater. The percentage impact on people 20 and over working full time should be essentially zero, because 98 or 99 percent of them would make more than the minimum wage anyway (see Table 1 of this paper).
The chart below compares, by group, the minimum-wage increase's employment impact (vertical axis) to a measure of the hourly wages of the workers in the lowest-paid quarter, shown on the horizontal axis). The diagram shows that impacts are negative, or essentially zero, and that the size of the impact is progressively smaller for groups with higher wages - exactly as economic theory predicts. 
Compare, for example, the minus 13 percent impact for teenagers in part-time jobs (25 percent of whom were earning less than $5.17 an hour in 2008 -- note that a -0.13 log change is essentially a 13 percent reduction) with the zero percent impact for full-time workers 20 to 54 (75 percent of whom were earning more than $11.76 an hour).
Teenage employment rates have fallen to 25 percent from 35 percent over the last four years. Much of that drop cannot be attributed to the federal minimum wage, but my estimates show that the federal minimum wage was a significant factor.
Profs. William E. Even and David A. Macpherson also studied the recent minimum-wage increases for the Employment Policies Institute, using a different methodology. They focused on teenagers (not distinguishing part time and full time), and their state-level model included three federal minimum-wage increases (2007, 2008 and 2009). 
They found that those three increases cost 114,000 teenage jobs (I found 800,000 for all age groups combined, only some of which were teenage employment effects; Prof. David Neumark had estimated that teenage and young-adult employment would be reduced 300,000 as a result of the July 2009 minimum-wage increase).
A minority of states were not affected by federal minimum-wage increases because their own state-legislated minimum wage would exceed even the new higher federal minimum (the federal minimum prevails over the state minimum whenever the former is greater). 
Thus, whatever jobs were lost because of the federal increase would be lost in the states -- 31, after the 2009 increase -- and the District of Columbia (which sets its minimum to be $1 above the federal minimum, so when the federal minimum jumps, do does the district's). Professors Even and Macpherson's state-level estimates confirmed that this was, in fact, the case.
For the same reason that my model separately considered teenagers and part-time workers, Professors Even and Macpherson followed their teenagers study with a study of 16-to-24-year-old men with less than a high school diploma. They found that each 10 percent increase in a federal or state minimum wage decreased white employment by 2.5 percent, Hispanic employment by 1.2 percent and black employment by 6.5 percent.
For the time being, at least, it seems that increasing the federal minimum wage again would give a few workers a small raise -- but at the cost of eliminating entire paychecks for the young, less educated and least skilled.

HEADLINE: Two Words to Live By

BYLINE: PAULA SPAN


HIGHLIGHT: A doctor urges health care providers to think harder about whether a medical procedure will improve an elderly patient's comfort and function. 

 BODY:
Not long ago I suggested that frail, elderly patients write "Do Less" across their foreheads with a Sharpie, but I'm rethinking that. Two other words might serve better: "comfort" and "function."
This occurred to me recently as I watched Dr. John Sloan, a family physician who cares for elderly patients in their homes in Vancouver, British Columbia, pace back and forth in front of a roomful of health care professionals here in Manhattan. "We do a rotten job in society, a terrible job, of looking after the frail elderly," Dr. Sloan said. 
Dr. Sloan presents a fuller explanation of his philosophy, along with his critique of the mismatch between contemporary medical practice and old patients, in his book "A Bitter Pill: How the Medical System Is Failing the Elderly." I recommend it: He pulls no punches.
The gist of his argument is summarized in those two words, "comfort" and "function." They are his own guidelines for when to suggest a treatment, drug or procedure to one of his patients -- almost all of whom have multiple chronic diseases and require a great deal of help -- and when to counsel against it.
In both Canada and the United States, he explained after his talk, physicians expend much effort trying to diagnose illness -- a worthy goal for those young or healthy enough to benefit from tests, preventive drugs and surgery, but not always suitable to those with more limited life spans. "And when we fail to prevent the calamity -- the pulmonary embolism, the myocardial infarction -- we rush in to rescue people," he said. "The alarms go off and the sirens roar. What I'm saying is, 'No, that doesn't work.'" At least, not for his fragile charges.
After consulting with patients and their families, often at length, Dr. Sloan often finds that what works better is to make comfort the top priority. "They don't want to be physically and mentally miserable," Dr. Sloan said of his patients. "My answer is to take the emphasis off the high-tech, expensive, futile health care system, and be a little kinder." (Dr. Dennis McCullough, a geriatrician, takes a similar approach in his book "My Mother, Your Mother," advocating what is often called slow medicine.)
Dr. Sloan told me about a patient in her 90s suddenly struck by a painful abdominal problem that he couldn't diagnose or treat at home, but that might have been surgically fixable in a hospital. Dr. Sloan knew, however, that with her heart and lung disease, the patient's odds of surviving an operation were low. 
"But her daughter couldn't bring herself to say no, if there was a sliver of hope that she'd survive," he recalled. So the ambulance came, the scans were taken -- and the surgeon told the family he couldn't ethically operate on someone so frail. The old woman died in the hospital after three days.
"It wasn't a nurturing environment," Dr. Sloan said. "We could have kept her comfortable at home, but we didn't stick to comfort."
His second lodestone is function: trying to help people continue to do what they can do, whether it's taking a walk with friends, navigating to the kitchen for breakfast or simply getting out of bed. In such cases, the risk-benefit ratio can shift.
Osteoarthritis, for instance, can be so painful that his patients have trouble walking. With corticosteroid injections, he said, "they might get 6, 8, 10 weeks of improved mobility, which might be half their lives." More function and more comfort, both -- though corticosteroids can cause side effects, this is an intervention he embraces. So is hospitalization to treat a hip fracture, something he can't do in someone 's living room.
Without knowing it, my father and I relied on something like Dr. Sloan's guidelines in rejecting removal of a for-now-harmless mole. My father, 88, isn't frail, so he probably wouldn't have been harmed by the local anesthesia, the outpatient procedure, the several weeks of healing. But would removing the mole improve his comfort? Or his function? No? Then we pass.
Let's acknowledge one very big difference between Dr. Sloan's patients and their families in Vancouver and families caring for older adults in the United States: his 30-year-old house call practice. His patients don't have to head for an emergency room when they're short of breath at 2 a.m. They can call him.
About 4,000 doctors make house calls in the United States, including a number of geriatric specialists, but "it's a drop in the bucket," Dr. Sloan said. And without a smart family doctor or geriatrician who knows a patient well, it's hard for family members to figure out what improves comfort and function, and what is useless or overly aggressive or downright abusive.
Of course, that doesn't begin to explain the rampant overtreatment of the elderly. "Why," Dr. Sloan wondered aloud, "haven't we smartened up?" 
I had no simple answer. Economic factors matter, as does the shortage of primary care doctors and geriatricians. But worried, well-meaning families also contribute to the endless parade of high-tech procedures Dr. Sloan helps his patients avoid. 
Still, even in our fragmented and frustrating system, making "comfort" and "function" our watchwords could be a common-sense way to vet decisions for the oldest and the frailest.

HEADLINE: Red Bulls Sign Rost, Veteran German Goalkeeper

BYLINE: JACK BELL


HIGHLIGHT: The Red Bulls on Wednesday signed the veteran German goalkeeper Frank Rost as the team's third designated player. 

 BODY:
Going against the conventional wisdom in Major League Soccer that asserts paying big money for a goalkeeper rarely makes sense, the Red Bulls on Wednesday used their third slot for a designated player to sign Frank Rost, 38, whose contract with Hamburg of the German Bundesliga had expired.
"Frank is a very experienced goalkeeper who will provide a strong presence in between the posts for our club during our quest for a M.L.S. title," Erik Soler, the Red Bulls' general manager and sporting director, said in a statement. "We are thrilled that he has decided to join us in the middle of our campaign and look forward to his contributions for the remainder of the season."
From Soler's statement, it appears that Rost may be here only for the balance of this season, though it is unlikely the goalkeeper would make the move for only four or five months. The club did not say when it expected Rost to be available, but the M.L.S. transfer period begins on Friday, which means Rost could play Saturday night at Chivas USA in Carson, Calif., providing all of his paperwork is in order by then. Rost has played in more than 400 games over 18 seasons in the Bundesliga. Rost, Thierry Henry and Rafael Marquez give the Red Bulls a full complement of three designated players -- the most permitted by M.L.S. Toronto is the only other team that has three D.P.'s on its roster.
Rost began his professional career in 1992 and stayed 10 years with Werder Bremen. With Bremen, Rost, who is 6-foot-4, made 147 appearances for the senior team. He moved to Schalke 04 in 2002, playing in 130 matches, and had been with Hamburg since 2007, playing in 149 games. He has also played four times for Germany, coincidentally making his national team debut in a 4-2 win against the United States in March 2002.
The Red Bulls have grown increasingly dissatisfied with the play of Bouna Coundoul ($179,500) and Greg Sutton ($80,100). One is likely to be dropped or traded, with Coundoul perhaps having more value, but with Sutton the better bargain in the budget-conscious M.L.S. The Red Bulls would have to eat Coundoul's contract unless he or Sutton could be traded. All M.L.S. contracts became guaranteed for the rest of the season on July 1.
Footnote: Rost is one of only two keepers (Jens Lehmann is the other) in Bundesliga history to score a goal from open play when he scored against Hansa Rostock on March 31, 2002.
Does spending D.P. money for a goalkeeper make sense to you? Do you think the club should have acted in the off-season to solve its goalkeeping needs? Would it make more sense for the club to either draft a goalkeeper or develop one from its academy, which would be a lot more economical?

HEADLINE: Despite Benefit Disparities, Middle Class Supports Mortgage Deduction

BYLINE: BRIAN J. MCCABE


HIGHLIGHT: Despite their strong support for the mortgage interest deduction, middle-class Americans are not the primary beneficiaries -- the wealthy are. 

 BODY:
A couple of weeks ago, David Streitfeld and Megan Thee-Brenan of The New York Times reported on the results of a Times/CBS News poll on homeownership in the United States. The poll found continued support for government subsidies for homeownership, including the mortgage interest deduction. Noting broad, bipartisan support for the deduction, Mr. Streitfeld and Ms. Thee-Brenan acknowledged that " almost no one favors discontinuing the mortgage tax deduction, a prized middle-class benefit that has been featured on some budget-cutting proposals."
Commentators often talk about the mortgage interest deduction as a prized middle-class benefit that enables households to achieve the American dream of homeownership. But despite their strong support for the deduction, middle-class Americans are not the primary beneficiaries of this federal tax subsidy. Instead, wealthy Americans take home a disproportionate share of the deduction's benefits.
The deduction lowers the taxable income of American homeowners by allowing them to deduct mortgage interest from their tax bill. In 2009, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the mortgage interest deduction cost the federal Treasury more than $80 billion, making it not only the largest subsidy provided to homeowners, but one of the most expensive tax expenditures in the American tax code.
According to data from the Internal Revenue Service Income Bulletin and the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, wealthy taxpayers are substantially more likely to claim the mortgage interest deduction than low- or middle-income taxpayers. In 2009, more than 75 percent of Americans making $100,000 or more claimed the mortgage interest deduction. On the other hand, barely one-quarter of middle-class Americans in the $40,000 - $50,000 income bracket claimed the deduction. In part, low- and middle-income Americans are less likely to claim the deduction because they are less likely to be homeowners. Of those who own homes, taking the standard deduction often makes better economic sense than taking the mortgage interest deduction.
But not only do the wealthy disproportionately claim the mortgage interest deduction. They disproportionately benefit from it, as well. Twenty percent of tax filers report an income of $75,000 or more. In 2009, these tax filers reaped 60 percent of the financial benefits from the deduction. Tax filers with an income of $20,000 to $40,000, on the other hand, make up 23 percent of all returns. They pocketed less than 9 percent of the benefits of the deduction.
The graphic below highlights this disparity in the distribution of the mortgage interest deduction. For each income group, the figures in the top row show the proportion of tax filers that fall into that income group. The dollar signs show the proportion of the benefits of the mortgage interest deduction going to taxpayers in that income group. Although American tax filers overwhelming fall into the bottom two income groups, the benefits of the mortgage interest deduction overwhelming accrue to households in the top income group.
It's not surprisingly that the wealthy benefit disproportionately from the mortgage interest deduction. High-income Americans are more likely than middle-class or low-income Americans to be homeowners, and the deduction rewards homeowners who take out larger mortgages to buy bigger homes. What is surprising, however, is that Americans continue to support a housing subsidy that distributes benefits so disproportionately.
The poll found that more than 90 percent of Americans support the mortgage interest deduction. (Other polls report similarly high levels of support for the deduction. A recent USA Today/Gallup poll found that 72 percent of Republicans and 59 percent of Democrats oppose efforts to eliminate the deduction, and a survey from the National Association of Home Builders found that two-thirds of Americans would be less likely to support a political candidate who favored eliminating or reforming the deduction.) But, the Times/CBS News poll also asked respondents who should benefit from home loans subsidized by the federal government. While a handful of previous polls report consistently high levels of support for the mortgage interest deduction, this is the first poll I've come across asking respondents about their preference for the distribution of federal homeownership subsidies.
The mortgage interest deduction benefits the set of households that Americans think are least deserving of federal homeownership subsidies. Twenty-six percent of respondents in the Times/CBS News poll prefer that low-income homebuyers benefit from federally subsidized home loans. Twenty-four percent prefer that all homebuyers reap the rewards, regardless of their income. And 15 percent believe middle-class Americans should be the beneficiaries of federal subsidies for homeownership. Although wealthy Americans disproportionately benefit from the mortgage interest deduction, only 1 percent of Americans believe high-income homebuyers should receive federally subsidized home loans.
The results of the New York Times/CBS News poll point to an important disconnect in American attitudes towards homeownership policy, especially as we continue to re-evaluate the role of the federal government in supporting homeownership. While Americans prefer that federal subsidies benefit low-income and middle-class Americans, they simultaneously (and overwhelmingly) support a policy that provides benefits disproportionately to high-income households. Although often billed as a middle-class benefit, the mortgage interest deduction primarily benefits wealthy Americans - the group of homebuyers most Americans believe least deserving of federal subsidies for homeownership.

HIGHLIGHT: A leading analyst of global risk says economic overshoot has pushed environmental overshoot off his list of concerns. 

 BODY:
A few days ago, I had a short e-mail exchange with Vaclav Smil, a master analyst of risks and resources, on strokes and aging, climate policy, the global debt crisis and a few other light subjects. I've excerpted our chat below in the form of a dialogue.
Here's one bottom line:
As the impacts of spending beyond one's means mount from the euro zone to the Beltway, they illustrate the irrelevance of well-meaning, high-minded discussions of how human economies are, in the end, subsets of global physical and ecological systems. (I admit readily that I've been in many such discussions, including with Smil.)
In the long haul, there really are finite aspects to life on Earth. But in the short haul, human nature is deeply biased to dodging real-time threats. That's why, for example, energy security will always trump climate stability as an issue, from the United States to China.
That is why, if you care about the environment and seek action on issues like greenhouse-driven climate change or conserving the planet's biological riches, you'd do well to focus hard right now on the debt crisis and other legacies of politics and policies built around sustaining a free lunch culture.
In the short run, a thriving economy is a prerequisite to having the resources to deploy renewable energy technology on a large scale (for those who prefer this path) or to intensify research, development and demonstration of new technologies and invest in education to build the capacity of future generations to be resilient and creative and caring (my preference).
But if the standard practice of growing our way out is chosen without considering long-haul issues -- like boosting the human capacity for resilience, innovation and care -- my sense is the outcome will simply be deeper cycles of relief and pain.
I would like to think that recent shocks to the system would have been enough to shift the balance from spending to savings, from buying to creating. That didn't happen, yet.
Can the political wrangling in Washington now meaningfully torque the country from a mindset seemingly framed around maintaining entitlements, be they unrealistically fluffy retirement cushions or low tax rates and energy prices?
Signs are not promising, given the tendency to play the game as if saddling the other side with blame for failure is the main goal. I wish top staff to all the political combatants would take a minute to read the "National Strategic Narrative" penned by two advisers to Adm. Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the hollow nature of the American enterprise at the moment, and some paths toward change.
So back to my chat with Smil. There are few people I've met who are both broad and deep enough to weigh global risks with much credibility, and Smil, at the University of Manitoba, is high on my short list. This doesn't mean he's routinely right, and in fact he's the first to warn that efforts to be right, in a world of complex connections, are doomed to be wrong. But I circle back to him often to clear my head.
It can be a painful process -- like any purgative. But it's vital.
Here's a distillation of our e-chat (I've cleaned up some e-mail shorthand and stroke-driven typos): 
I had forwarded Smil information on a new book by Gordon Woo, a professional catastrophist (no joke) and mentioned:I dodged a personal catastrophe when the lining if my left carotid artery gave way on 1 July and I ended up with a (thankfully mild) stroke. Just a headsup to care for those carotids (neck bending on red-eye flights, chiropractic manipulations, some yoga, or - as in my case - strenuous exercise.Smil wrote:I have become a denialist of sorts, trying to repress the news of assorted personal catastrophes: being deep in the "zone" (68 this December) I hear of them among my peers, and younger ones, all too often. I hope that yours has been nothing but a mild bump on long and fairly smooth road ahead!On Woo and disaster odds makers, he added:Heard of him. He is far from alone, this is a giant industry led by reinsurance companies trying to place their bets properly, and, needless to say, getting repeatedly burned; who can ever calculate the likelihood of Libyas or Fukushimas -- and even if you can it is the particular modalities of the unfolding event rather than the occurrence of the event itself that determine the impact and outcome. We just have to live with it.Sifting for lessons at both the personal and planetary scale, I wrote:There is some crossover here between the personal and global. The stroke I had was the type that is essentially unpredictable.
In a situation of that sort, what seems best, on reflection, is general awareness of risk and ways to reduce it (I rushed home and swallowed half a dozen baby aspirin before my son drove me to the hospital), but also confidence that institutions (the emergency room triage process) have the ability to recognize and respond with agility and skill. That didn't work out so well at my initial hospital.
For the most part global warming has been perceived like the other kind of stroke (high blood pressure, stress, bad diet raising risk of bad outcome). But I've noted recently the lack of understanding of the relationship of building greenhouse warming to extreme weather events (other than hotter heat waves).
There's more, not yet on Dot Earth, building on what Kevin Trenberth said here. Same with sea level. The factors leading to truly disruptive change are the least clear.
What are the wise moves in such a situation, both in cutting drivers of downside odds and girding for worst while hoping for best?Smil:I know you have invested so much into that entire global warming story, but I see it as very secondary compared to the already unfolding Great Unraveling, with all rich economies in chronic downfalls that will last and last (real U.S. unemployment already 20%, debt at $14 trillion is trivial compared to $114 trillion of uncovered obligations, all E.U. save for Germany is collapsing etc., etc.). The only sensible way out of it is to tax and tax and that will kill the economies even more in the medium-run, and combine it with aging and China and terrorism (by my estimate bin Ladin has, so far, cost the U.S. at least $6 trillion and counting) -- and soon there will be no monies for anything beyond basic survival. Try to watch this for five minutes: U.S. Debt ClockMe:I kind of figured you'd make my day!My hope is that Smil is wrong, of course, and that our inventive streak will combine with the widening human field of view (both geographically and temporally) and, in the process, provide new ways for us to appreciate the human traits that got us into this "fine mess."
I don't expect we'll avoid making mistakes, but I do think we might develop a better capacity for falling forward without falling down.

HEADLINE: Live Blog: Lobbyists Meeting on Financial Overhaul

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul will turn a year old next week. In honor of its birthday, bankers, regulators and journalists are gathering in New York to discuss some of the law's thorniest provisions. 

 BODY:
The Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul will turn a year old next week. In honor of its birthday, bankers, regulators and journalists are gathering in New York on Wednesday to discuss some of the law's thorniest provisions -- derivatives, the new consumer protection agency and, of course, its efforts to end "too big to fail." 
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, one of Wall Street's largest lobbying groups and among the law's sharpest critics, is hosting the conference, which it called "Regulatory Reform Summit 2011." Headlining the Sifma event is a "special guest speaker," Mary J. Miller, assistant Treasury secretary for financial markets.
 DealBook is on hand for the conference. 
1:18 PM | New Cop on Wall Street
We've moved on to the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency, the scorn of many a banker.
Mr. Zandi, the Moody's economist, said some of the banking industry's fears of the bureau may be irrational. The bureau could put smaller banks on a level playing field with their Wall Street competitors, he said.
Naturally the conversation turned to who President Obama will pick to lead the bureau. Elizabeth Warren is charged with setting it up, but has yet to be named director.
Mr. Zandi noted that Ms. Warren "leads" with or without the formal title.
12:45 PM | Goodbye, Debit Card Fees
It's hard for bankers to pick their least favorite provision in Dodd-Frank (the menu of options is just too long). But the new restriction on debit card fees is a top contender.
John Carey, a high-ranking Citigroup exec, tore into the so-called Interchange rule. Last month, the Fed capped the fees that banks charge retail stores each time a consumer uses a debit card at 21 to 24 cents, a roughly 50 percent cut. In December, the Fed proposed a 12 cent limit.
"It's a tremendous loss of revenue," Mr. Carey said. Some peg the total loss at more than $11 billion annually.
Even Mr. Barr, the former Treasury official, said it is "A little worrisome" for the government to set prices.
Mr. Carey later acknowledged that the Fed's rule got "better," saying the Fed "did the best job it could." 
12:05 PM | Retaining that Risk
DealBook has spotted an oddity at the Sifma conference - someone who does not loathe the financial regulatory overhaul. "Dodd Frank is a good piece of legislation," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics. The audience was silent.
After the brief interlude, life returned to normal at the Grand Hyatt ballroom, as Mr. Zandi went on to criticize Dodd-Frank's risk retention rules. The plan requires banks that sell mortgage-backed securities to keep some of the related risk on their books. He said the rule would "likely result in higher costs for borrowers." Quite frankly, it's "not very helpful," he said.
Michael Barr, a former assistant Treasury secretary who played a crucial role in crafting Dodd-Frank, disagreed. He called risk retention an "important additional tool." He did note, however, that regulators are struggling to implement the law given that the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is unclear. 
09:30 AM | Breaking Down TBTF
After a polite ovation for Mr. Kudlow, the conference has now turned to the "too big to fail" problem. Dodd-Frank mandates higher capital requirements and enhanced oversight of so-called SIFIs, or systemically important financial institutions. The goal: prevent future bailouts. 
But how do you balance the safety of the financial system with economic growth? John Dugan, the comptroller of the currency during the financial crisis, noted that tougher capital requirements could actually make the system more risky. As banks get stuck with new capital charges under Dodd-Frank, hedge funds and other unregulated shadow banking players could fill the void.
"It won't look like the shadow banking system five years ago, but it will come," said Wilson Ervin, of Credit Suisse.
James Wigand, a top Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation official, acknowledged there was a "trade off."
But perhaps more importantly, Dodd-Frank does provide the tools to unwind large firms when they are on the verge of failing, Mr. Wigand said.
Still, preventing the next crisis is not the regulator's job alone. Speaking to a room full of bankers, lobbyists and lawyers, Mr. Wigand called for "market discipline." 
"Sifis should have the freedom to fail," Mr. Wigand said.
9:27 A.M. | Kudlow Is Up
Next up: A CNBC star and former Wall Street executive, Larry Kudlow.
Sure enough, Mr. Kudlow is not a fan of Dodd-Frank either. How come?
"Too much paperwork," he said.
"The idea that fat cat bankers should be punished is crazy."
Besides, he said, the economy already "stinks."
"Blame the banks, blame rich people, blame George Bush ... it's incredible the stuff I'm hearing."
He also takes issue with the Federal Reserve's QE2 policy, saying it did "more harm than good."
So who in Washington do you like, Mr. Kudlow? Michele Bachmann. He called her a "smart woman."
9:23 A.M. | Let the Dodd-Frank Debate Begin.
Sifma's regulatory reform conference began with Timothy Ryan, the group's chief executive, laying into Dodd-Frank's new mandates for Wall Street.
"We risk impeding the flow of capital and credit." The law, he said, will trickle down to hurt "American families."
Mr. Ryan noted that regulators had a "daunting" task implementing Dodd-Frank. There are some 300 rules to write and enforce. The S.E.C. and other regulators have blown 26 deadlines to finalize the rules, he said. The delays have upset many Dodd-Frank watchers.
But not Mr. Ryan. "It's probably a good thing," he said. He wants the regulators to get it "right," and he is concerned that federal agencies are not coordinating with one another on derivatives regulations and other new rules.
Now, he's not saying Dodd-Frank is all bad. "We're not here to say, 'Don't do anything.' We support Dodd-Frank because it's the law of the land, and we'll follow it."

HEADLINE: Unearthing Exotic Provisions Buried in Dodd-Frank

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Aimed at changing how Wall Street does business, the Dodd-Frank Act is also peppered with little-known items on issues like so-called conflict minerals and mining safety - the pet concerns of lawmakers. 

 BODY:
At a meeting in February to discuss the recent overhaul of financial regulations, lobbyists and policy makers never once mentioned Wall Street. They did not talk about derivatives, mortgage-backed securities or any of the exotic products at the center of the crisis.
Instead, Mary L. Schapiro, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, hurled questions at representatives of Apple and Hewlett-Packard about war-torn central Africa, an odd topic for a financial regulator. She wanted to know more about the American companies that buy coveted minerals extracted from the region.
After months of writing dozens of rules on arcane financial instruments, Ms. Schapiro told attendees the discussion was "certainly an interesting change of pace," according to two people with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.
While the issue may be outside the S.E.C.'s core expertise, it is now within its jurisdiction. A little-known amendment tacked onto the Dodd-Frank financial reform law requires corporations to disclose whether they manufacture products using so-called conflict minerals from Congo or neighboring countries.
Lawmakers are worried about metals like tantalum, tin and gold, which they believe have financed armed rebels throughout the region during a roughly 15-year conflict punctuated by incidents of mass slaughter and rape. Many American companies use these metals to build cellphones, computers and cameras.
The conflict minerals amendment is one of several unusual elements buried in Dodd-Frank, which spans some 2,300 pages and touches nearly every corner of Wall Street. One section is dedicated to derivatives. Another chunk covers lavish Wall Street bonuses.
Then there are the "miscellaneous provisions" Congress tucked into Dodd-Frank last summer - a catchall for some lawmakers' pet concerns, among them mining safety and spending by the International Monetary Fund.
One provision requires companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments for the right to extract oil and natural gas. The proposal had an influential backer: the co-author of the financial overhaul package, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who introduced similar legislation in 2008.
"The provisions are appropriately called miscellaneous," said Andrew J. Foley, a partner at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, which represents oil, natural gas and mining companies that are subject to the rules. "There's no question it's unrelated to the financial crisis."
Given the ongoing partisan stalemate, Dodd-Frank presented a rare opportunity for Republicans and Democrats. In the aftermath of the economic crisis, the act was the closest thing to a sure bet in Washington. Lawmakers "jumped on to the passing bandwagon," Mr. Foley said, using the moment to insert popular, if sometimes random, rules.
Representative Jim McDermott, a Democrat from Seattle, had tried for years to regulate conflict minerals.
Mr. McDermott, who served as a Foreign Service medical officer in central Africa during the 1980s, returned to Congo four years ago to tour a hospital that was treating people wounded in the continuing civil war. After visiting with a group of rape victims, he said he was shocked by the human rights abuses. Mr. McDermott traced much of the suffering to rebel soldiers who sold tantalum and other minerals to finance their war.
The issue gained traction in 2008 after Sam Brownback, then a Republican senator from Kansas, introduced legislation requiring companies to disclose their use of conflict minerals. A few years before, Mr. Brownback, now the governor of Kansas, had traveled to the Congo with Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. But the effort soon stalled. 
"Of course, it never moved anywhere - and along comes the Dodd-Frank bill," said Mr. McDermott. After a short debate on the Senate floor, the plan to regulate conflict minerals was attached to the sweeping new law by Mr. Brownback. 
"You get bills passed any way you can," Mr. McDermott said.
Almost immediately, companies took aim at the regulation. They figured it would be a costly proposition to trace the roots of such minerals.
In February, the United States Chamber of Commerce called on the S.E.C. to withdraw its plan to enforce the regulation. "The proposed rule, if implemented, would create a disclosure regime that is burdensome and difficult, if not impossible to comply with, resulting in potentially erroneous disclosure," lobbyists for the group said in a letter to the commission.
Tiffany & Company, one of the world's largest jewelry companies, pushed the agency to exempt gold from the disclosure requirements, arguing in a separate letter that the proposed rules "would violate the First Amendment."
Many other companies were caught totally off guard by the rule. In recent months, lawyers and auditors say they have had to explain the rule to clients who were unaware of its existence. 
"Some weren't aware of the provision and most didn't realize its complexity," said Douglas K. Dean, a partner in the sustainable business solutions practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
The S.E.C. did not fully grasp the intricacies of the provision either. As with other Dodd-Frank rules, the agency has missed important deadlines for both the conflict minerals provision and the one about payments to foreign governments. While the S.E.C. proposed rules to enforce the disclosure requirements, it was supposed to complete the regulations about three months ago. The agency said it needed additional time to study the thorny topics.
"The new payment disclosure rule is a powerful tool, but we are still waiting for the law to be enforced," said Ian Gary, a senior policy analyst at Oxfam America, an advocacy group.
Mr. Dean of PricewaterhouseCoopers said his clients were anxiously awaiting the S.E.C.'s final conflict minerals rule, hoping it would finally clarify the issue. They also want to know whether the agency will issue exemptions for businesses that use only trace amounts of the minerals or get them from recycled sources, he added.
"Companies," he said, "are basically in a holding pattern."

S.E.C. and Pension Systems to Examine Fletcher Fund | The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an inquiry into Fletcher Asset Management, a New York hedge fund run by Alphonse Fletcher Jr., a prominent Wall Street investor, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation.
News of the S.E.C. inquiry comes as three Louisiana public pension systems have raised questions about a Fletcher fund. The three pension systems said on Tuesday that they were hiring a team of experts to closely examine the Fletcher fund's financial records after it was unable to meet their requests to withdraw money from the fund earlier this year.
Mr. Fletcher, 45, already drew headlines in February when he sued the Dakota apartment building on the West Side of Manhattan, accusing it and several of its board members of racial discrimination for denying his application to buy an apartment adjacent to his.DealBook

HEADLINE: Obama Campaign Reports Big Fund-Raising Quarter

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama raised more than $86 million for his reelection campaign and the Democratic National Committee in the last three months. 

 BODY:
President Obama raised more than $86 million for his re-election campaign and the Democratic National Committee in the last three months, besting previous campaign fund-raising records for the quarter and far outpacing the Republicans who are hoping to replace him in the White House.
Mr. Obama's campaign, Obama for America, raised $47 million, while the president's frequent fund-raisers boosted the D.N.C.'s coffers by $38 million. Democrats had set a goal of raising a combined $60 million for both groups by the end of June.
The fund-raising total gives Mr. Obama and the Democratic Party an early and large lead over his potential rivals. The president's campaign manager, Jim Messina, said he will use the cash to ramp up Mr. Obama's campaign operation across the country even as the Republican primary is under way.
The Republican front-runner, Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, raised $18.25 million in the quarter that ended on June 30. Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, raised $4.2 million. Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, raised $4.1 million, including about $2 million from himself. 
Mr. Messina announced the president's fund-raising totals in a predawn video to campaign supporters, two days before the campaign is required to file what is expected to be a 15,000-page campaign finance report with the Federal Election Commission. 
And it comes even as the president is locked in a high-wire negotiation with Republicans in Washington over how to raise the nation's debt ceiling, reduce the government's annual deficit and revamp costly entitlement programs.
In the fund-raising message, Mr. Messina thanked supporters for the early support.
"We have reason to be proud of what we've built so far but it's going to be tougher from here," he said.
The president's top political aides have said they expect to match -- or even possibly exceed -- the $750 million that Mr. Obama raised during the 2008 campaign. Mr. Messina noted that the support for Mr. Obama during the last three months far exceeded the support he got as a candidate. The numbers also reflect the inherent advantages of incumbency; President George W. Bush raised just more than $35 million during the same period in 2003, as he prepared for his re-election campaign.
Mr. Messina said that 552,462 people had contributed to the president and the D.N.C. this year, nearly triple the number of contributors to Mr. Obama's first presidential campaign by this time in 2007.
Mr. Messina claimed, somewhat immodestly, that the number of donors represents "more grassroots support at this point in the process than any campaign in political history."
Mr. Messina also bragged that 98 percent of the contributions to Mr. Obama's campaign this year have been $250 or less, and that the average contribution was $69. 
The president's campaign is bracing for a bruising re-election battle that will be waged in part by outside groups, like Crossroads GPS, a conservative group that counts Karl Rove among its advisers; and Priorities USA Action, formed by Bill Burton, President Obama's former deputy press secretary. Those groups are expected to raise hundreds of millions of dollars, in part because they are allowed to raise unlimited amounts of money directly from corporations.
The money raised by the president will allow early advertising efforts to push back against criticism of the president coming from the Republican presidential candidates and from outside groups about Mr. Obama's handling of the economy.
Mr. Messina said that it would also allow the campaign to begin building its infrastructure. He said the campaign already has 60 field offices across the country and will be opening more in the months to come.
"This is a whole new ballgame like we've never done before," he said.

HEADLINE: Parties Can't Agree on the Consequences of Default

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The fact that the parties can't agree on what happens if they don't raise the debt ceiling is significant. 

 BODY:
The fact that politicians in Washington can't agree on how to raise the debt ceiling is hardly surprising. The fact that they can't agree on what happens if they don't may be more significant.
In an interview Tuesday night on Fox News, House Speaker John A. Boehner was asked bluntly, "What if you don't get a deal?" There was a long pause before he answered.
"I don't know," he said gravely. "This is how serious this is."
Even as Mr. Boehner and President Obama plan for more negotiations with other Congressional leaders on Wednesday, their descriptions of the consequences of failure are radically different.
Mr. Obama and members of his administration painted a dire picture of financial calamity if Congress does not increase the debt ceiling by Aug. 2, when Treasury Department officials say the nation will default on its obligations. The president himself said he could not guarantee that Social Security checks would be mailed to recipients if the deadline passes without action.
"There may simply not be the money in the coffers to do it," Mr. Obama said in an interview with CBS News.
But that view of the post-Aug. 2 world -- one involving higher interest rates, sinking global confidence and an inability to meet basic obligations -- is itself worlds apart from the one described by Mr. Boehner and his Republican caucus in the House.
In the Fox interview, Mr. Boehner asserted that "no one really knows what would happen" after Aug. 2 if no deal was reached. He conceded that a failure could "spook the market, and you could have a real catastrophe."
But he also said "there's going to be money available on Aug. 3," and he criticized Mr. Obama for "making some types of veiled threats" about Social Security checks.
White House officials have privately expressed some optimism that they will reach a deal before the deadline -- in part because they believe Republicans understand the magnitude of the consequences if they don't.
But Tea Party Republicans in the House are even more skeptical of Mr. Obama's predictions than their leadership. They argue that the White House is overstating the dangers for political purposes. (Congressional Memo: In Fiscal Fight, G.O.P. Distrust of Obama Runs Deep, July 13)
"Expect Geithner to talk about Social Security payments not going out on time," one Republican House member said Tuesday. "Expect Secretary Panetta talking about troops may not get paid on time. Expect Secretary Duncan and the Department of Education saying financial aid may not get there on time."
"So, I get that there will be some pressure there," said the member, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to candidly discuss strategic conversations among his Republican colleagues. "But again, we think this is an historic moment where we have to be tough enough to take a tough stand."
On the Republican presidential campaign trail, there's even less willingness to accept the administration's view of a future without a debt limit increase.
Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, accused Mr. Obama of "trying to scare Americans into agreeing to higher taxes and spending."
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota on Monday challenged Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner's statements that refusing to raise the debt ceiling would cause interest rates to rise and stocks to plunge.
"He's wrong because all you have to do is look at the books," Mrs. Bachmann said. "We have sufficient revenue coming in. Everybody needs to get their feathers down and not ruffled."
But the skepticism of the Aug. 2 deadline may not extend to Republicans in the Senate, where Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, on Tuesday offered a complicated, last-ditch plan to avoid a default. 
Mr. McConnell's proposal, to essentially give the president the ability to increase the debt ceiling unilaterally, suggests that he may view the consequences of failure more like Mr. Obama does.
"We're certainly not going to send a signal to the markets and to the American people that default is an option," Mr. McConnell said. "What we're not going to be a party to in the Senate, I'm pretty confident, is default."
That view was echoed by a coalition of business groups on Tuesday, who predicted in a letter to Mr. Obama and members of Congress that a default would be a "Main Street" issue, not one just affecting Wall Street.
"Treasury securities influence the cost of financing not just for companies but more importantly for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and student debt," the business leaders wrote. "A default would risk both disarray in those markets and a host of unintended consequences."
Mr. Obama clearly agrees. Mr. McConnell appears to as well. But Mr. Boehner seems uncertain, and his conservative colleagues in the House and on the campaign trail see a different future.
If they can't reach a deal by Aug. 2, something will happen.
The outcome of the negotiations may come down to whether all of the participants eventually agree on what that something will be.

HEADLINE: Times Company to Repay Carlos Slim Early

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: Cost-cutting has allowed the company to repay, more than three years early, a $250 million loan with 14 percent interest from Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helu. 

 BODY:
9:54 a.m. | Updated The New York Times Company said Wednesday that it would pay back the $250 million loan from Carlos Slim Helu, a Mexican telecommunications billionaire, on Aug. 15, freeing itself from one of its larger financial obligations.
The repayment will come three and a half years before the loan is due and five months sooner than the company initially planned to settle the debt.
 Janet L. Robinson, chief executive of the Times Company, and Arthur Sulzberger Jr., chairman and publisher of The New York Times, said in a message to employees that the company's strengthened financial position enabled the early payback.
 "Our ability to pay down this debt at this time is directly linked to the decisive steps we have taken to improve our financial flexibility over the past two years," they wrote. "We remain focused as we move to the next phases of our business plans and as the uncertain global economy and the ongoing volatility in our industry continue. But today we take pride in this moment."
 The Times Company ended the first quarter with $352 million in cash and short-term investments on hand. The total cost of the loan, with a 14 percent interest rate, was approximately $279 million. 
 While the company will incur a $46 million loss on the prepayment in the third quarter, savings on interest over the next three and a half years will exceed $39 million each year.
 Mr. Helu and members of his family hold about 7 percent of the Class A shares in the Times Company. 
 The Times Company has taken other steps recently to firm up its financial position, including a deal last month to sell most of its stake in the Fenway Sports Group, owners of the Boston Red Sox. It sold 390 of its 700 Class B units of the Fenway Sports Group to three separate buyers in a deal for $117 million. It now holds a 7 percent stake in the company.

HEADLINE: Democrats Lambast Republicans on Crisis Commission

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: Democrats released a scathing 37-page report detailing how they think Republicans on the commission used their position to undermine the Dodd Frank act, a law aimed at improving financial regulation. 

 BODY:
Washington was all prepared for a hearing today on "What Went Wrong" with the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which was set up in 2009 to look into the causes of the meltdown. 
While the meeting was canceled at the last minute, Democrats released a scathing 37-page report detailing how they think Republicans on the commission used their position to undermine the Dodd Frank act, a law aimed at improving financial regulation. 
The work by Republicans, the Democrats concluded, was "guided by politics rather than fact-finding." 
The report, prepared by Democratic congressional staffers for the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, took aim at Republicans attempts to derail Dodd-Frank -- before and after the legislation was passed. 
House Republicans voted almost unanimously against the Dodd-Frank Act. On the day it passed the Senate, then-House Minority Leader John Boehner stated: 'I think it ought to be repealed.' Since then, House Republicans have been aggressive in their efforts to repeal the Act and prevent its protections from being implemented.
Although the purpose of the commission was supposed to be to conduct in-depth fact-finding to determine the causes of the economic crisis, internal commission documents obtained by the committee include e-mails from a Republican commissioner urging his colleagues to use their positions on the commission to help House Republicans in their efforts to repeal the Dodd- Frank Act.
It also called out Republicans for using their positions on the commission to exert undue influence over the law.
Internal Commission documents raise questions about the extent to which Vice Chairman [Bill] Thomas and his commission staff were providing information to, and receiving information from, a CEO of a political consulting firm who is also employed by the Vice Chairman's law firm.
Internal Commission documents indicate that Commissioner [Peter] Wallison used his position to promote a theory of the economic crisis supported by Chairman [Darrell] Issa and put forth by Edward Pinto, a Resident Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). This theory, that government housing policy was the primary cause of the nation's economic crisis, was ultimately rejected as flawed by every other member of the Commission.

HEADLINE: Pawlenty's Playbook for Skipping Marriage Pledge

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The former governor of Minnesota on Wednesday offered a textbook, three-step process that he hopes will lessen the impact of his decision not to sign on to the Family Leader Marriage Pledge. 

 BODY:
Here's a political puzzle: How do you decline to sign a pledge defending marriage if you are a Republican presidential candidate? Now, consider you need to win Iowa, where conservative voters have proven their affinity for candidates who are demonstrative about their faith. And those voters already have made it know that they feel that the candidates are focusing almost exclusively on the economy at the expense of social issues.
Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, on Wednesday offered a textbook, three-step plan that he hopes will lessen the impact of his decision not to sign on to the Family Leader Marriage Pledge, which was put forth by a conservative, pro-family group in Iowa. 
Step 1: Release a six-minute YouTube video describing in depth your long-standing commitment to faith.
In the video released Wednesday, Mr. Pawlenty describes his upbringing as a Catholic, his shift in religious views when he met his wife, an evangelical Christian, and the role religion plays in his career and his life. 
His mother's sudden passing, when he was 16, was an important moment in his life, he said. "I leaned deeply into my faith, and turned to it, and my faith in God, as a source of strength, as a source of reassurance, as a source of comfort," he says. "And remembering that hope is always with us and our hope is not in these earthly things. But it is in Jesus Christ."
The video focuses heavily on Mary Pawlenty, who describes the role of religion in their lives.
"We ask for God's guidance," she says. "It really is a matter of a faith walk. And you ask that God light your path and help you day by day, to make the best decisions that you can possibly make, both in your marriage, for your family, in your career. In all of the decisions that you make."
He describes religion's role in his views on marriage, in particular. Mr. Pawlenty says in the video that traditional marriage is "a moral building block of our society."
"It's in the Bible," Mr. Pawlenty said. "God teaches us that. He values traditional marriage as between one man and one woman. That's something that I personally believe strongly and I've always stood for that in my public life and my personal life."
Step 2. Distribute the video to supporters, especially in Iowa, along with a personal note from Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the daughter of the last man to win the Iowa caucuses on the strength of his connection to religious conservatives.
Ms. Sanders helped her father, Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, win the caucuses in 2008 by appealing to religious voters. (The campaigndenied that the image of a cross appeared in a late-December ad, but many voters said they appreciated it.)
In the message, Ms. Sanders writes that Mr. Pawlenty's "commitment to faith and family is not a product of coaching by campaign consultants." She adds: "As a devoted husband to Mary and supportive father to Anna and Mara, Governor Pawlenty gets it. For the Pawlentys, parenting is not just an obligation - it's a moral responsibility."
Step 3. Release a statement declaring that you "unequivocally" support traditional marriage - even as you decline, very politely, to sign the pledge.
In his statement, Mr. Pawlenty said that he deeply respected those who are promoting the pledge. But he said he would rather not sign.
"I prefer to choose my own words, especially seeking to show compassion to those who are in broken families through no fault of their own," he wrote. "I respectfully decline to sign the pledge."
Will it work? 
Mr. Pawlenty is hoping he can win the support of conservative, religious voters in Iowa while preserving a broader appeal among moderates and even independents during later primary contests -- and the general election, should he become the nominee.
Mr. Pawlenty's approach is not unlike that of Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, who has also declined to sign the Iowa marriage pledge. Mr. Romney is presenting himself as a candidate focused almost exclusively on the country's economic struggles. A pledge on marriage does not fit in to his strategy.
By contrast, Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania embraced the marriage pledge, and signed it quickly.
(Mrs. Bachmann later acknowledged that she had not read parts of the pledge which became controversial, including one which suggested that black children were better off during slave times.)
Mr. Pawlenty and Mrs. Bachmann are both targeting Iowa as a key part of their strategy to win the Republican nomination. Their different decisions on the marriage pledge could make the difference in a close race.

HEADLINE: Want to Play Abroad During the Lockout? No Problem, Says the Players Union

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
If the locked-out N.B.A. players choose to take their talents overseas, they will do so with the spirited support of their union's leadership.
In a letter sent to 450 players this week, Billy Hunter, the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association, said that playing abroad would keep the pressure on owners while allowing union members to continue making a living.
''This lockout is intended to economically pressure our players to agree to an unfavorable collective bargaining agreement,'' Hunter said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. ''It is important for owners to understand that there may be significant consequences to their decision to put their own players in these difficult economic circumstances.'' 
Hunter said, ''If the owners will not give our players a forum in which to play basketball here in the United States, they risk losing the greatest players in the world to the international basketball federations that are more than willing to employ them.''
Most players received Hunter's letter on Tuesday, five days after reports surfaced that Deron Williams, the Nets' star point guard, had committed to play for a Turkish club, Besiktas. Under the terms of his contract, Williams is free to return to the N.B.A. when the lockout ends.
A handful of other players -- mostly reserves and fringe rotation players -- have signed deals to play abroad. Others are entertaining the possibility, although so far it has not become a trend.
There are some concerns for players like Williams who have lucrative contracts with N.B.A. teams. In theory, their deals could be voided if they are injured while playing abroad. Salaries are much lower in Europe and Asia, and teams sometimes fail to pay their players.
Commissioner David Stern has indicated that the league would not stand in the way of players who want to work overseas. However, the sport's international federation, FIBA, has yet to say whether it will clear players who are under contract to N.B.A. teams. A statement is expected soon.
In his letter, Hunter said he believed there was no impediment to N.B.A. players working abroad during the lockout, while contracts are suspended. He said he also believed that neither the N.B.A. nor FIBA would block such a move.
Hunter did advise that foreign contracts should contain a clause that would allow players to return after the lockout was lifted. He also advised players to ''secure appropriate protection'' -- i.e., insurance -- ''to guard against any injury or unforeseen circumstances.''
The N.B.A. locked out its players on July 1, after two years of failed talks. The parties have not met since June 30.
Williams is by far the biggest star to commit to playing overseas, and his decision is of great interest to both sides in the labor dispute. In his letter, Hunter commended Williams ''for the wisdom and courage he has demonstrated'' and for showing that the players ''will not be intimidated by the league's hard-line tactics.''
Not all players were enthusiastic about the overseas option. Josh Childress, who returned to the N.B.A. last season after two years in Greece, told ESPN.com he would not do it again.
''And I don't know why guys would,'' Childress said, citing the lower pay, injury risk, tough travel schedule and teams' unreliability in paying players.
''If a guy isn't playing well or a team is out of the playoffs, they'll just stop paying you,'' Childress told ESPN.com. ''I know tons and tons of players who just walked away because they didn't want to go through the hassle of going to court to get their money.''

HEADLINE: Don't Rush The Painter

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
EVERY summer, thousands of homeowners entrust their homes to college-age painters, possibly on the theory that if you're smart enough to matriculate, you can smear paint on a flat surface. Seriously, how could you mess it up?
To the dozens of customers who asked precisely that question in the 1980s, soon after my college buddies and I left the job: you're about to find out.
I recently embarked on an exterior painting job on my home, and given my experience in college and after, I had more hubris than you can dump in a five-gallon bucket. Partway into the project, I decided to call on a few painting experts -- not to get advice, mind you, just to trade war stories.
Instead, I learned everything that my old bosses never taught me, tips that can easily make the difference between a two-year paint job and a 12-year paint job. 
My new mentors were Carl Minchew, the director of color technology at Benjamin Moore; Chris Ring, regional sales manager for ProTect Painters, a nationwide company based in Ann Arbor, Mich; and Randy Schuetz, a vice president at Valspar.
The first task, my panel said, is to determine whether you really need a paint job. Phrased differently, How long does paint last?
''That's the eternal question,'' Mr. Minchew said. ''The eternal answer is, it depends.''
Roughly, many homeowners will go between seven and 10 years before they notice fading or chalking, both of which signify that the protective quality of the enamel is diminishing. Protection is the key. Old or damaged paint is ugly, but it also exposes raw wood to water. Rotting wood attracts carpenter ants, and carpenter ants, as everybody knows, attract second mortgages.
So for homeowners who have not yet documented winter's damage, a reckoning is in order.
Inspect the siding and trim, especially near drains and gutters, where ice and water may have taken a toll. If the damage or paint erosion is significant, pull out the calendar to plan the job. Schedule one full day to clean the house exterior with a pressure washer. A week later, you will need at least a day to scrape, sand, caulk and prime the worn spots. At least one full day after that, you can start painting.
How long will the painting itself take? Mr. Ring said three professional painters would need three or four days to complete a typical three-bedroom colonial. A pair of novices, he said, would probably need seven to 10 days. (If, somehow, your home was last painted before 1978, when lead paint was taken off the market, or if you have vinyl siding, your job just got more complicated. Consult a professional.)
Once your schedule is set, go rent the two large items you will need: a pressure washer (about $77 a day) and a 24-foot extension ladder, which is big enough to suit most homes (about $29 a day).
The economics of a do-it-yourself paint job shift noticeably if you include the cost of a hospital visit, so be careful. Don't step higher on the ladder than recommended and, when moving side to side, keep your belt buckle within the uprights, Mr. Schuetz said. Never work alone, either. Partners can anchor the bottom of the ladder when it is on uneven ground, and they can watch for power lines and other hazards.
Pressure washers require caution, too. A friend blew a hole through his forearm while using the narrowest nozzle, which yields the highest pressure. It barely missed an artery. You'll use wider nozzles, so the risk of injury is lower. Still, point the washer away from things that breathe.
If you have mold or mildew on the house, use a cleaning solution with one cup of bleach for every gallon of water. A week later, when the house is dry and any fungus is finally dead, you're ready for the serious prep work.
Bring the ladder, caulk (Dap Alex Plus, 10.1 ounces cost about $3), a good scraper (Master Painter's Allway 2.5-inch scraper with soft-grip handle is $7.50), a screwdriver and a boombox. The screwdriver is for removing downspouts, the caulk is for sealing gaps and the boombox is for your sanity. It's also less antisocial than an iPod.
Also, two sheets of sandpaper, one 80-grit and another 180-grit (about 80 cents apiece), to smooth out scraped areas. Buy primer for covering those areas (Benjamin Moore Fresh Start Superior Primer costs about $37 a gallon), a two-gallon paint bucket (Leaktite's is $5.50) and a hook ($2.50 or so) to hang the bucket on the ladder and keep your hands free. Don't forget rags to wipe up scrapings, paint drips and errant strokes (a Painter's Choice one-pound bag is $3.30), and if you are unsure what top coat you want, buy paint samples, too.
Finally, choose brushes wisely. Good ones, which usually have tight, compact bristles, are expensive. But bad ones are excruciating. You need a four-inch brush for siding (Purdy's costs $28), and a 2.5-inch, angled brush for trim (Wooster's is $12). If you buy a good brush, never let it dry out while loaded with paint, and clean it thoroughly at day's end. If you buy a bad one, have a nice day.
As you prime, remember that professional painters ''follow the sun,'' meaning they work around the corner from the sunny side of the house. This prevents paint from drying too quickly (more on that later), and it prevents you from dying of heat stroke. I failed to follow the sun, and I roasted the back of my neck. Extreme heat -- think of the recent heat wave -- may also cause paint to dry too fast, so check the manufacturer's label.
I also forgot how much wasps love gutters until I climbed my ladder, brush in hand, and a yellow jacket strafed my face. It flew off when I flailed my brush at it. (That streak of wet paint across the window? A testament to my wasp-fighting brilliance.) Spare yourself some high-altitude drama by gently banging the gutter with your ladder before you ascend.
Prep work is otherwise devoid of nuance. The goal is to create a smooth surface, because wet paint will run off sharp edges and leave those areas with little protection.
After the prepping, test your samples on patches of the siding. The next day, visit the areas in the morning, at midday and in the evening. Choose your color, then give in to your spouse's choice and live to fight another day. We picked white.
Most reputable shops will mix your paint without being asked. If they don't, ask. The less manual stirring you have to do, the better.
Finally, the main event. Cover the bushes with a dropcloth (Film-Gard, 10 by 25 feet, $12), mix the paint, partly fill the bucket and ascend.
I mentioned our painting transgressions in college. We committed two major ones, and both involved rushing.
For one, we routinely swarmed the house from all sides. Professionals paint from one side of a wall to the other, and blend the sections of paint before they dry. If the paint dries before you can blend, the paint job will be marred by seams, or ''lap marks,'' much like a certain crimson-colored house in Ridgefield, Conn., circa 1985.
Second, we swore by paint pads because they spread paint quickly. But novices can spread paint too thin with a pad by squeezing it as its paint supply dwindles. The job may look fine initially, but the paint can gradually fade into blotches.
My panelists suggested using a brush, which drags noticeably when there is little paint left.
Even with a brush, though, you can still spread paint too thin. Mr. Schuetz said a 10-foot-square area should require a quart of paint, so fill your first bucket with exactly one quart, see how much you cover, and adjust your technique accordingly.
I had already painted part of my house with a pad before our conversation. I checked it, and, sure enough, the paint was thin in places. My panel said a second coat is a good idea, to cover missed spots and double the job's overall protection.
Of course, during the New York area's monsoon season, painting was not on the agenda. Mr. Ring said his crews don't paint on days when the chance of rain is 40 percent. ''If it sprinkles, wait a day,'' he said. ''If it rains hard, wait a couple days.''
I waited. And waited. Finally, I got back out with a brush in hand and took it slow.
When I was done, the paint looked thick and bright and free of lap marks. Nothing like that crimson-colored house in Ridgefield.
Correction: July 21, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Pragmatist column last Thursday, about house painting, referred incorrectly to a yellow jacket in describing the author's mishaps. It is a wasp, not a bee.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: PHOTO(D1)
DROPCLOTH: Plastic sheeting (Film-Gard's 10-by 25-foot cloth costs $12) shields furniture when painting indoors
outside, use it to cover the bushes.
RAGS: Use cloths (Painter's Choice one-pound bag, $3.30) to clean up scrapings, sawdust, paint drips, dirt and leaves. BRUSHES: Good brushes, with tight bristles, are costly but worthwhile. Choose a four-incher for siding (Purdy, $28), and an angled 2.5-incher for trim (Wooster, $12).
PAINT: Apply primer (Benjamin Moore Fresh Start, about $37 a gallon) and top coat (Moore's Aura, about $64 a gallon) by ''following the sun'' -- working around the corner from the sunny side. That way, paint won't dry too fast and painters won't get sunburned.
STIRRER: Mixers are free with paint purchases, but ask the clerk for a first mix on the store machine.
HOOKS: Hang the paint bucket on a hook ($2.50 each)
it frees up the painter's hands.
PREP TOOLS: Before priming, worn areas must be scraped (Master Painter's Allway 2.5-incher, $7.50), caulked (Dap Alex Plus, 10.1 ounces, about $3) and sanded (80-grit and 180-grit sheets, 80 cents each).
 BUCKET: Select paint containers with handles (Leaktite's two-gallon is $5.50), for easy hanging on the ladder. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY TONY CENICOLA/THE NEW YORK TIMES)(D7)

HEADLINE: The Downtown Crowd Finds an Uptown Perch

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
IT'S the dining version of the scene where the Gale house judders down in Oz. Monochrome up until that point, the world is suddenly, gorgeously Technicolor once Dorothy opens the door.
On any Friday night at Red Rooster, the crowd is likely to encompass not only elements of New York's ''gorgeous mosaic'' but also David Dinkins, the former mayor who coined the phrase. There, either at the 76-seat restaurant, the 24 seats at communal tables near the bar, the 20-seat bar itself or the 40-seat sidewalk cafe, neighborhood bankers rub elbows with Bill Clinton; Nora Ephron might be seated alongside Thelma Golden, the director of the Studio Museum; Alicia Keys is likely to be found in a corner with Ralph and Ricky Lauren at a table bracketing her left side and a group of local church ladies on her right.
That, in a sense, is a typical experience at Red Rooster, the door onto Harlem opened by the celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson at the end of last year. 
Smack on Lenox Avenue just north of 125th Street, and with glamorous neighbors like Marshalls, Staples and CVS, the place almost instantly became a destination not just for those seeking soul food cooked with a Swedish accent, but for people with an appetite for a dining experience reflective of the New York Grace Paley once lauded for its ''chromatic dispersion.'' Very likely it was the latter that moved Barack Obama to choose Red Rooster as the spot for a $30,800-a-plate fund-raising dinner for the Democratic National Committee in March.
And, after all, there had to be someplace besides certain sections of hipster Brooklyn where -- as Sam Sifton, the restaurant critic of The New York Times, pointed out in a review awarding Red Rooster two stars -- the servers, the crowd and the atmosphere all come together to represent the ''polyglot, diverse'' city that has historically been ''a shining beacon for people of all races.''
There had to be a place that put the lie to a circumstance noted in an earlier Times article whose headline, ''The Tablecloths Are White, and So Are Most Faces,'' neatly captured restaurant reality in this town. And there had to be a Manhattan neighborhood capable of giving the meatpacking district a run for its money, at the very least in terms of style.
And what better place than Harlem? Make that the ''new Harlem,'' a historic neighborhood so long trumpeted by boosters as the next big thing that the creaky phrase seemed in need of an oiling.
This Mr. Samuelsson provided.
''We're really now seeing the renaissance that had been imagined,'' Myiesha Phelps, a J. P. Morgan banker and Harlem resident, said this week, as she waited outside Red Rooster for a reservation she said it took months to procure.
She may be correct, and not just on account of a spate of recently opened bars and galleries and retail establishments, places like the neo-Jazz Age boite 67 Orange Street, or the upscale Levain Bakery or the concept shop Swing.
''It's much more interesting here than the meatpacking district,'' said Ms. Phelps, a Northern California native who considers herself ''a true Harlemite.''
Harlem is far more stylish, she added, and anyone who has spent time on West 14th Street lately would surely agree that the endless parade of ''It'' girl aspirants teetering around in Christian Louboutins has imbued the area with the look of a luxury-goods ghetto, where runway trends and logos go to die.
Harlem, by contrast, seems freshly vitalized, particularly when seen from Red Rooster's sidewalk cafe. Perched there on a breezy summer evening, a viewer beholds the pageant of Harlem street life unfolding in a manner that would have made James Van Der Zee, the great African American photographer and chronicler of Harlem, proud.
True, the dandies of Van Der Zee's day, in their felt fedoras and raccoon coats, are long gone. In their stead are young men wearing cotton Breton fishermen's sweaters, rolled jeans and Topsiders; African immigrants in brilliantly patterned head wraps and flowing robes; young boys with their hair styled in neo-retro Kid 'n Play flattops; waitresses with plaited dreadlocks swept up into cantilevered coiffures; men in seersucker suits and straw trilbys with stingy brims; matrons dressed in flowing celestial-white ensembles; teenage boys with saggers slung so low on their hips that they're forced to pluck at them, delicate as antebellum maidens, to keep them from dropping to the ground.
Banshee-wailing throttles open, bareheaded daredevils do wheelies up Lenox Avenue on candy-colored Yamahas 250's.
''You don't really get run-of-the-mill-type people'' at Red Rooster, said Adrian Surgeon, the restaurant's natty greeter, as he waited by the curb to greet a man in a pastel track suit as he exited a chauffeur-driven S.U.V. ''What you do get is a mirror of what Harlem offers as a whole.''
Harlem offers this human panorama not only to patrons of Red Rooster, of course. The same spectacle may be enjoyed by diners at Red Rooster's neighbors Chez Lucienne and Sylvia's, at the Lenox Lounge and, come September, at the Pink Tea Cup, the legendary West Village soul-food spot that is establishing an outpost on Lenox Avenue.
''You can't not dress up if you're going out for the evening in Harlem,'' said Martin Johnson, an account executive for Kim Kardashian Fragrance. Despite the dreary weather on a recent Friday evening, Mr. Johnson and his date, Latifah Abdur, arrived at Red Rooster dressed, respectively, in a tie from Hermes, a suit from Ralph Lauren Black Label, shoes from Ferragamo, a Gucci bag and a flowing flowered dress from H & M.
''Why not preen,'' Mr. Johnson added, ''when there are so many fabulous fashions to embark upon?''
For Gerald Tucker, uptown's revived lure is so strong that every weekend since Red Rooster opened he has polished his brogues, brushed his mustache, slipped into a Ralph Lauren suit, selected a bow tie from his collection of 14 and then headed uptown from his home on the Lower East Side.
Nowadays he takes the D train, the retired high school teacher said, having lost heart for the hassle of keeping a car in New York.
A glass of red wine cupped in his hand, Mr. Tucker surveyed the bar last weekend and pronounced the experiment that is Red Rooster a success. ''Of course, everything looks good when it's new, and believe me, at 80 I've seen a lot of things develop and happen in Harlem.''
He has known the neighborhood in its shiny salad days, when the original Red Rooster, a speakeasy on the outskirts of Strivers' Row sometimes called the Stork Club of Harlem, was still a watering hole for homegrown sports stars and local pols.
He has known it when Nicky Barnes, the heroin kingpin, ordered murders and ran the drug trade from a stool at the Monarch Bar. He has known it when, even after Harlem was declared a federally funded empowerment zone, the bedrock economics of the place remained bleak, when the median income for a family of four was $18,000, when scrub grew in lots where handsome old brownstones had tumbled down and when on blocks where housing projects stood the population density was the greatest in New York.
That other, earlier Harlem now seems a long way off.
''I think this time Harlem is really back for good,'' said the sprightly Mr. Tucker, who attributed his youthful vigor to an unusual regimen. (''A little red wine, very little marijuana, no cocaine and no heroin.'')
Whether Harlem is ''back'' (if it ever went away) remains to be seen, of course. For Mr. Samuelsson, the celebrity chef born in Ethiopia, adopted and raised in Sweden, the decision to engage with the ''mystique, the beauty, the history of Harlem was not to be undertaken lightly,'' he explained by phone this week from Sweden.
''I lived in Harlem for six years, and for the first four years I wasn't ready to open a restaurant,'' he said. ''I didn't have license to do that until I felt I was in and of Harlem. I don't take the commitment lightly. It's important that people can smell that sincerity when they come into the restaurant, regardless of whether they like the chicken or not.''
The point, he added, is that Harlem is the largest and most vital character in the story of Red Rooster, and not the other way around. It is with this in mind that a visitor there senses a crucial balance being held. Red Rooster may help put Harlem on display but not exclusively for the consumption of tourists. Like Paris, to which the chef often compares it, Harlem as a neighborhood, and one blessed with abundant light, wide avenues and a diverse population, functions like a proscenium on which the rich theater of pedestrian life is ceaselessly enacted.
''It's always a total hodgepodge,'' Raymond Bailey, a retired chauffeur, said Tuesday night, as he sipped a Bailey's Irish Cream on ice at the Red Rooster bar, referring to the street scene in Harlem.
Dressed in a suit, a crisp straw hat and sunglasses, Mr. Bailey surveyed the incoming crowd, a parade that included lovely young women in flowing dresses carrying Prada handbags, muscular gay couples in tank tops and Toms shoes, parties of elderly women in their evening finery, French tourists in the clam diggers that only French tourists still favor, and ... isn't that Cindy Crawford getting out of a black Suburban?
It is.
And what brings you up to Harlem, a reporter asked the model/mogul and her companion, the celebrity hairstylist Stephen Knoll.
''Dinner!'' the two said in unison.

HEADLINE: How U.S. Companies Can Help Solve the Debt Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Big Business Leaves Deficit to Politicians'' (Economic Scene, July 6):
David Leonhardt's critique of the Business Roundtable as ''part of the problem'' for Washington's failure to address the nation's debt crisis suffers two flaws. 
First, he relies on the zero-sum argument favored by Washington insiders; that is, you cannot simultaneously support lower tax rates and be in favor of deficit reduction. The Business Roundtable believes that the United States' high corporate tax rate, near the top among the world's advanced economies, hinders growth and the revenues needed to reduce the nation's debt.
Second, he doesn't address the issue of global competitiveness. That's a columnist's luxury unavailable to Business Roundtable's members -- more than 200 chief executives of the largest United States-based companies who operate in a fiercely competitive world.
The Business Roundtable advocates for a balanced tax climate and investments in such critical areas as infrastructure and research and development as policies necessary to improve American competitiveness and economic growth. When it comes to solving the national debt crisis, that's not part of the problem; that's part of the answer.
JOHN ENGLER President, Business Roundtable Washington, July 7, 2011
To the Editor:
David Leonhardt's column provided a nice review of the debate over the deficit and the various suggestions -- eliminating the Bush tax cuts, Medicare cuts, military cuts and so on -- for reducing it. Not mentioned was eliminating the tax deductibility of corporate advertising.
Corporations will howl at this idea and remind us of the importance to the economy of the advertising industry. But I'm not suggesting that we eliminate, regulate or in any way restrict advertising; just don't make us taxpayers help cover the cost of it.
Total spending on advertising in the United States is projected to be more than $300 billion this year, according to eMarketer. At a corporate tax rate of 35 percent, eliminating the deductibility of advertising would bring into the Treasury approximately an extra $100 billion per year.

HEADLINE: Import Prices Fall for First Time in a Year

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Prices of goods imported to the United States fell in June for the first time in a year as oil and food expenses retreated, the Labor Department said Wednesday.
The 0.5 percent fall in the import-price index followed a revised 0.1 percent gain in May, the figures showed. Economists projected a 0.6 percent decrease for June, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Prices excluding petroleum fell 0.2 percent, the first decline since July 2010. 
''The drop is really reflective of what we're expecting for the second half of the year with weaker energy and food prices,'' said David Semmens, a United States economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. ''This really feeds into the transitory story that you've been hearing from the Fed.''
Compared with a year earlier, import prices rose 13.9 percent, the biggest 12-month advance since August 2008, the report showed.
The cost of imported petroleum fell 1.6 percent from the previous month, the largest one-month drop since June 2010. Even with the decrease, the cost was still up 50 percent from a year earlier.
Excluding all fuels, import prices decreased 0.1 percent from the previous month and were up 4.8 percent from June 2010. The 12-month gain was the biggest since October 2008.
Imported food was 1.9 percent cheaper last month, the largest decline since February 2009. A 2.6 percent drop in unfinished metals also helped hold down nonfuel import costs.
Rising costs for automobiles limited the overall decline in prices. Costs of imported automobiles, parts and engines climbed 0.3 percent, and were up 2.9 percent over the last 12 months. It was the biggest yearly gain since August 2008.
Consumer goods excluding vehicles rose 0.1 percent after increasing 0.3 percent in May.
The cost of goods from China climbed 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since September, while those from Japan were little changed, the report showed. Goods from Latin America fell 1.1 percent, and those from the European Union increased 0.1 percent. Prices of Canadian imports dropped 1 percent, and goods from Mexico fell 2.2 percent, the biggest decline since November 2008.
Export prices increased 0.1 percent after advancing 0.2 percent the previous month, the figures showed. Prices of farm exports rose 0.7 percent, while those of nonfarm goods were little changed.

HEADLINE: Europe Tries to Curb U.S. Role in Tracking Terrorists' Funds

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Commission on Wednesday presented proposals for tracking the finances of terrorists in Europe that are aimed at ending the primary role of the United States in those efforts. 
The European Union needed ''to find a European solution for extracting the requested data on European soil,'' said Cecilia Malmstrom, the E.U. commissioner for home affairs.
Many E.U. lawmakers have long objected to an existing program that sends information on financial transactions in bulk to the United States where it is sifted for evidence of terror plots.
That program was established by the administration of George W. Bush in the wake of the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. The program became a symbol of differences between the United States and the European Union over how to balance personal privacy guarantees with concerns on national and international security.
Ms. Malmstrom's proposals could help to quell criticisms that financial tracking jeopardizes European standards of privacy by establishing a parallel system that would share tips with the United States and other powers.
Any European system ''would need to fully respect fundamental rights, and in particular ensure a high level of data protection,'' said Ms. Malmstrom.
A key objective would be ''limiting the amount of personal data transferred to the U.S.,'' according to a statement by Ms. Malmstrom's department.
The commission already has discussed plans to create a so-called European Terrorist Finance Tracking System with the American authorities who have participated in expert meetings on the initiative.
But a European system still could cost nearly 50 million euros to implement and about 11 million euros in annual running costs. Depending on how a European system was designed, it also could require unprecedented cooperation among the security services of fractious E.U. member states, raising questions about feasibility.
The current program allows American agencies to get access to European banking data held by a cooperative -- the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift -- which is responsible for routing trillions of dollars daily among banks, brokerage houses, stock exchanges and other institutions.
But members of the European Parliament and other campaigners have complained for years that the program undermines privacy because it requires large batches of information to be sent to the United States for analysis and storage there.
Frustration among members of the Parliament welled up in February 2010, when they vetoed a previous accord and deprived the United States of access to the information.
The European Commission, the E.U. executive, then led negotiations with the United States to win assurances that any requests for information would be evaluated by the European police agency, Europol.
The European Parliament approved a revised agreement in July 2010.
But some lawmakers who approved that agreement have criticized Europol for too readily approving American requests for large amounts of data, and they have suggested they could withdraw their support again in the future.

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF

 BODY:
DEBATING DODD-FRANK Bankers, regulators and journalists gathered in New York on Wednesday to discuss some of the Dodd-Frank Act's thorniest provisions -- derivatives, the new consumer protection agency and, of course, its efforts to end ''too big to fail.'' 
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, one of Wall Street's largest lobbying groups and among the law's sharpest critics, hosted the conference, called Regulatory Reform Summit 2011. Headlining the event was Mary J. Miller, above, assistant Treasury secretary for financial markets. BEN PROTESS
ON VIDEO By dropping efforts to acquire outstanding shares of the British Sky Broadcasting Group, Rupert Murdoch is trying to quell the political uproar that threatens his empire. Andrew Ross Sorkin of DealBook and The New York Times's media editor, Bruce Headlam, discuss the News Corporation's announcement that it is withdrawing its $12 billion bid for Britain's main satellite-TV broadcaster.
A LONG FIGHT International Paper's $3.3 billion offer for Temple-Inland should be termed a ''patient hostile.'' The company has officially begun a tender offer for Temple-Inland's outstanding shares. But this is a mere placeholder, and International Paper is settling in for what could be a long fight.
International Paper announced its offer for Temple-Inland on Monday, and the tender offer documents were filed on Tuesday. The offer is at best an incremental step, the Deal Professor says. STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF
FINGER-POINTING Washington was prepared for a hearing on Wednesday on ''What Went Wrong'' with the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which was set up in 2009 to look into the causes of the collapse.
While the meeting was canceled at the last minute, Democrats released a scathing 37-page report detailing how they thought Republicans on the commission used their position to undermine the Dodd-Frank Act, the law to overhaul financial regulation.

HEADLINE: Utility Shelves Ambitious Plan To Limit Carbon

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD and JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A major American utility is shelving the nation's most prominent effort to capture carbon dioxide from an existing coal-burning power plant, dealing a severe blow to efforts to rein in emissions responsible for global warming.
American Electric Power has decided to table plans to build a full-scale carbon-capture plant at Mountaineer, a 31-year-old coal-fired plant in West Virginia, where the company has successfully captured and buried carbon dioxide in a small pilot program for two years.
The technology had been heralded as the quickest solution to help the coal industry weather tougher federal limits on greenhouse gas emissions. But Congressional inaction on climate change diminished the incentives that had spurred A.E.P. to take the leap.
Company officials, who plan an announcement on Thursday, said they were dropping the larger, $668 million project because they did not believe state regulators would let the company recover its costs by charging customers, thus leaving it no compelling regulatory or business reason to continue the program. 
The federal Department of Energy had pledged to cover half the cost, but A.E.P. said it was unwilling to spend the remainder in a political climate that had changed strikingly since it began the project.
''We are placing the project on hold until economic and policy conditions create a viable path forward,'' said Michael G. Morris, chairman of American Electric Power, based in Columbus, Ohio, one of the largest operators of coal-fired generating plants in the United States. He said his company and other coal-burning utilities were caught in a quandary: they need to develop carbon-capture technology to meet any future greenhouse-gas emissions rules, but they cannot afford the projects without federal standards that will require them to act and will persuade the states to allow reimbursement.
The decision could set back for years efforts to learn how best to capture carbon emissions that result from burning fossil fuels and then inject them deep under-ground to keep them from accumulating in the atmosphere and heating the planet. The procedure, formally known as carbon capture and sequestration or C.C.S., offers the best current technology for taming greenhouse-gas emissions from traditional fuels burned at existing plants.
The abandonment of the A.E.P. plant comes in response to a string of reversals for federal climate change policy. President Obama spent his first year in office pushing a goal of an 80 percent reduction in climate-altering emissions by 2050, a target that could be met only with widespread adoption of carbon-capture and storage at coal plants around the country. The administration's stimulus package provided billions of dollars to speed development of the technology; the climate change bill passed by the House in 2009 would have provided tens of billions of dollars in additional incentives for what industry calls ''clean coal.''
But all such efforts collapsed last year with the Republican takeover of the House and the continuing softness in the economy, which killed any appetite for far-reaching environmental measures.
A senior Obama administration official said that the A.E.P. decision was a direct result of the political stalemate.
''This is what happens when you don't get a climate bill,'' the official said, insisting on anonymity to discuss a corporate decision that had not yet been publicly announced.
At the Energy Department, Charles McConnell, the acting assistant secretary of energy for fossil energy, said no carbon legislation was near and unless there was a place to sell the carbon dioxide, utilities would have great difficulties in justifying the expense. ''You could have the debate all day long about whether people are enlightened about whether carbon dioxide should be sequestered,'' he said. But, he added, ''it's not a situation that is going to promote investment.''
His department has pledged more than $3 billion to other industrial plants to encourage the capture of carbon dioxide for sale to oil drillers, who use it to more easily get crude out of wells.
The West Virginia project was one of the most advanced and successful in the world. ''While the coal industry's commitment and ability to develop this technology on a large scale was always uncertain, the continued pollution from old-style, coal-fired power plants will certainly be damaging to the environment without the installation of carbon capture and other pollution control updates,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, co-author of the House climate bill. ''A.E.P., the American coal industry and the Republicans who blocked help for this technology have done our economy and energy workers a disservice by likely ceding the development of carbon-capture technology to countries like China.''
A.E.P., which serves five million customers in 11 states, operated a pilot-scale capture plant at its Mountaineer generating station in New Haven, W.Va., on the Ohio River, from 2009 until May of this year. But the company plans to announce on Thursday that it will complete early engineering studies and then will suspend the project indefinitely.
Public service commissions of both West Virginia and Virginia turned down the company's request for full reimbursement for the pilot plant. West Virginia said earlier this year that the cost should have been shared among all the states where A.E.P. does business; Virginia hinted last July that it should have been paid for by all utilities around the United States, since a successful project would benefit all of them.
Five years ago, when global warming ranked higher on the national political agenda, the consensus was that this decade would be one of research and demonstration in new technologies. A comprehensive 2007 study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that global coal use was inevitable and that the ensuing few years should be used to quickly find ways to burn the cheap, abundant fuel cleanly. But with the demise of the Mountaineer project, the United States, the largest historic emitter of global warming gases, now appears to have made little progress solving the problem.
Robert H. Socolow, an engineering professor at Princeton and the co-director of the Carbon Mitigation Initiative there, said he was encouraged that some chemical factories and other industries were working on carbon capture without government incentives.
Mr. Socolow, the co-author of an influential 2004 paper that identified carbon capture as one of the critical technologies needed to slow global warming, said that there was a trap ahead. ''Lull yourself into believing that there is no climate problem, or that there is lots of time to fix it, and the policy driver dissolves,'' he said in an e-mail. He added that for companies like A.E.P., ''business wants to be ahead of the curve, but not a lap ahead.''

HEADLINE: China's Growth Slowed To 9.5% in 2nd Quarter

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER; Michael Wines contributed reporting from Beijing.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Chinese economy expanded at an unexpectedly robust pace during the second quarter of this year, data released Wednesday showed, but a slowdown from the sizzling pace of previous quarters also underlined the challenges that now face policy makers in Beijing.
China's economy, the second-largest in the world after that of the United States, grew 9.5 percent compared with the second quarter last year, the National Bureau of Statistics said, and picked up a notch from the first three months of 2011. 
The reading is well above what developed economies like those of the United States, Japan and Europe are managing and topped analysts' expectations.
But it was also markedly more modest than the pace recorded in previous quarters: Chinese gross domestic product expanded 9.7 percent compared with the same period a year earlier during the first quarter of 2011 and 9.8 percent in the last three months of 2010.
Much of the cooling has been deliberately engineered by the Chinese authorities and is by no means unwelcome.
Over the past year, Beijing has progressively tightened the spigot on the ample bank lending that has fueled growth but also contributed to sharp increases in property prices and overall consumer prices. The central bank has also raised interest rates five times since October, most recently last week.
Inflation, however, remains elevated, and the authorities now have to strike a careful policy balance. On the one hand, more action is needed to stifle price rises. On the other hand, any excessive tightening risks choking off growth.
The successive economy-cooling steps taken so far have already caused some concern that the Chinese economy could slow more rapidly than intended.
Any sharp weakening in China, which has become a key engine for global growth, would be unwelcome news for the rest of the world, especially at a time when the United States and Europe are struggling to reduce heavy debt loads and high unemployment levels, and as Japan is still grappling with the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami.
However, most economists believe that China is headed for a soft -- rather than a hard -- landing, and the robust figures on Wednesday appeared to support those expectations.
The second-quarter G.D.P. data, and retail sales and industrial output figures for June, also released Wednesday, provided ''further evidence that China's slowdown since the start of the year remains moderate and gradual,'' Brian Jackson, an analyst at the Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong commented in a research note. ''Although we expect growth will weaken to some extent in the third quarter, today's data reinforces our view that concerns about an imminent 'hard landing' in China are overdone.''
Li-Gang Liu, a China economist at ANZ Bank, also was confident about China's prospects. Chinese exports, he wrote in a research note, will be buoyed by demand from Japan after the earthquake; investment will be supported by an ambitious housing project; and domestic consumption was likely to see solid growth.
Financial markets also took the data positively. The Shanghai composite stock index in mainland China rose 1.5 percent Wednesday.
However, inflation remains stubbornly high, at least for now, with data released Saturday showing that consumer prices had risen 6.4 percent in June from the same month last year. The prices of some foodstuffs, like pork, have risen even more sharply.
Inflation has become a major concern for policy makers in Beijing, who worry that such price increases could fuel discontent among ordinary Chinese.
Top officials, including the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, have said repeatedly that tackling inflation is a top policy priority. Earlier this week, Mr. Wen called specifically for more action to raise the supply of pork, a staple for many Chinese families.
A spokesman for the national statistics bureau, Sheng Laiyun, said at a briefing Wednesday that the slowdown in growth had also been driven by the winding down of stimulus measures from past years that succeeded in cushioning the effect of the 2008 global economic crash.
In particular, he said, car sales dropped 20 percent this year after the government canceled a nationwide subsidy to encourage the purchase of fuel-efficient cars and some big cities, like Beijing, imposed limits on new-car purchases.
''Compared to the same time last year, sales of furniture, construction materials and home decoration have all seen an obvious drop. It is a normal response when stimulus policies exit the market,'' he said. ''It's like when a man runs, he can't be dashing all the time. Instead, he needs to slow down for a bit, in order to run better in the future.''
Meanwhile, the quandary created by the combination of slower growth and inflation has created uncertainty as to what the next policy moves by Beijing will be.
Some analysts expect the central bank to deliver at least one more small rate increase later this year in a bid to combat inflation. Others believe that the central bank will not want to jeopardize growth and that it is thus unlikely to act.
''The government's desire to maintain growth by sustaining a healthy level of liquidity expansion is counterbalanced by the need to rein in inflation, in part caused by an abundance of liquidity,'' Jing Ulrich, chairman of global markets for China at JPMorgan Chase, wrote in a research note.
However, she added that the data also showed that the Chinese economy was gradually becoming more centered around consumption. This ''should support policy makers' efforts to engineer a soft landing'' through a combination of monetary tightening policies and pro-consumption measures, as well as changes to social welfare programs.

HEADLINE: Town & Country Man Eases Into His New Home

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
JAY FIELDEN cut a lean figure as he paced his glass-walled office on the 33rd floor of the Hearst Building. Occupying that space, the top editor's perch at Town & Country, is a bit, he said, ''like being a gerbil in a cage.''
It's a handsome cage, sleek if sparsely furnished, an unspoiled space on which he intends to place his stamp. It was littered on a recent visit with yellowing back issues of the magazine, a carton of Slim Aarons's society photographs and a stray copy of The Paris Review showily propped on his desk. Totems, they hinted at a new direction for the magazine. Its August issue is the first Mr. Fielden claims as his own. 
He has taken the reins at an institution that has been edited, since its founding in 1846, for an affluent, ambitious reader eager to master the art of living well.
In some ways Mr. Fielden is that reader. He commutes each day from his home in Connecticut. He wears a trim gray Ralph Lauren suit (''black label,'' he says). He speaks in a resonant cosmopolitan drawl, an occasional twang the remnant of a childhood in San Antonio, a place he plainly itched to leave. ''I still have cousins who are wildcatters,'' he said with mingled discomfort and pride.
These days Mr. Fielden, 41, is negotiating the magazine's identity and, it seems, his own. When he was 14, he had an older girlfriend, he said, who placed a slim red and yellow paperback in his hand. ''It was 'Catcher in the Rye,' '' he recalled. ''I read it and immediately set my sights on going East for college. Unfortunately, it wasn't Yale.''
At Boston University, he studied Milton, a gentlemanly pursuit presumably meant to prepare him for a rarefied post in the publishing world -- one, he confided with disarming sincerity, ''that I always wanted to be in.'' His job, which he started in March, caps a career that took him from the typing pool and assorted editorial posts at The New Yorker to Vogue, where in 2000 he was named arts editor. ''I was taught to parse sentences by Eustace Tilley,'' he says, ''and everything else by Anna Wintour.'' As he speaks, you expect him to draw on a pipe. Or sip an Old Fashioned, Don Draper's poison of choice.
His grasp of the trappings of privilege evidently played a role in his appointment by Ms. Wintour to the helm of Men's Vogue, which he edited for readers with a taste for Kiton suits, rare Scotch and Hinckley yachts. The magazine folded in 2008 as a result of a hobbled economy.
But Mr. Fielden is nothing if not resilient. He continued to work, collaborating with Grace Coddington, Vogue's creative director, on a memoir, a project he abandoned soon after starting at Town & Country.
Last October his house burned down; he is rebuilding it.
And last month he was found to have Lyme disease. Yet he turns up daily to edit a magazine that he hopes will both appeal to, and reflect, a readership he is still sussing out. Resisting the impulse to make what he calls ''a snooty, exclusionary magazine,'' he broadly said he intends to bring ''a lot of people under the tent.''
He is fond of paraphrasing Frank Zachary, Town & Country's editor emeritus, who used to boast, ''We made stars of people in Tulsa.'' He will report on a society that he said ''is always in flux.''
Mr. Fielden inherited a title that showed a 20 percent increase in newsstand sales for the second half of last year, and ended it ahead by 7.1 percent in advertising pages. Would the pressure to keep up those numbers and woo a new audience take its toll? ''I might have thought so once, but that was before I had the fire,'' he said wryly.
Today he is positive, even ebullient. A cover portrait of a model sheathed in Prabal Gurung, a Wintour favorite, is a giddy invitation to indulge in the pleasures of summer. Among the ''seductions'' promised by a cover line is a piece about the American Hotel in Sag Harbor, N.Y., home in more leisurely eras to the likes of Herman Melville and Larry Rivers. International society is represented in Social Network, a monthly column peopled by Bill Gates, Mercedes Bass, Gigi Mortimer, Dasha Zhukova, Elle Macpherson and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, among others.
But there is more to the issue than escapism, Mr. Fielden wants you to know. Nor will it, he says, simply be ''about things you should buy,'' despite its cornucopia of luxury goods like Bulgari soaps and Cartier diamonds. He points to an article that attempts, he said, ''to decode the Byzantine workings of the auction room,'' appended with capsule portraits of the art world's premier power brokers.
''We are not too much in the lap of the people we are covering,'' he said. And there is an article that appears to chide Newt Gingrich, who bought his wife, Callista, a queen's ransom of baubles on interest-free credit at Tiffany & Company, before going on to detail the virtues of Tiffany's interest free-payment plans.
Town & Country's photography is sumptuous, if stiff. Its art direction, until recently, was pedestrian. ''Finding a visual voice for the magazine may be one of our biggest battles of the moment,'' Mr. Fielden said.
He envisions a magazine that will be a showcase for literary stars like Alexandra Styron and Jay McInerney and even a rocker or two. Why not? Mr. Fielden recently raided Hearst's archives, unearthing a 1966 Town & Country cover that portrayed a mop-topped Keith Richards encircled by fawning society swans. He described the image as spirited. ''When they showed this to the publishing people, they almost had a heart attack,'' he said. ''But then they saw the way it sold.''
Lindsay Lohan, however, won't be on his cover anytime soon. ''And you won't be seeing Lady Gaga,'' Mr. Fielden said. ''Other people have a better platform for telling that story than we do.''
Then again, who can say?

HEADLINE: The Republican Case for Compromise

BYLINE: By AL HOFFMAN Jr.. 
Al Hoffman Jr. was a national co-chairman for George W. Bush's 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns and a finance chairman for the Republican National Committee.

 BODY:
North Palm Beach, Fla.
I HAVE always been a conservative Republican, and I subscribe to the ideas of less government, lower taxes, innovation and entrepreneurship. But I also believe that, in the face of a possible debt default by the federal government, Republicans need to embrace the principle of compromise.
Indeed, despite talk that Senate Republicans might simply let the president raise the debt ceiling unilaterally, and thus avoid the issue of budget and tax reform, it's not too late for both sides to strike a grand bargain. By so doing, they will prove the better statesmen. 
The threat of default is not about liberal or conservative politics: our nation has spent $14 trillion in money it doesn't have and is on track to be saddled with as much as $26 trillion in debt by the end of the decade. That's simply unsustainable.
Yes, Democrats are depicting Republicans as fanatics holding, as President Obama put it in a recent speech, a ''gun against the heads of the American people to extract tax breaks for corporate jet owners.'' Republicans may want to walk away from these cheap demagogic attacks, but our nation can't afford it.
Instead, they should counter the president's smallness by going big. Rather than go to their martyrdom as ideological purists, they should open the door to tax increases -- but only if every $1 in new taxes is applied to deficit reduction and is matched by at least $4 in real spending cuts, including entitlement reform.
Why the 4-to-1 ratio? Precedent: in a study of fiscal reforms by 21 developed countries between 1970 and 2007, the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group, found that, on average, ''failed attempts to close budget gaps relied 53 percent on tax increases and 47 percent on spending cuts.''
Successful formulas, on the other hand, combined 85 percent in spending cuts with 15 percent in tax hikes. The president has proposed a much lower ratio, closer to 60 percent in spending cuts and 40 percent in tax hikes, but at least the two sides would be on the same page.
Moreover, tax revenues do not need to come through higher, growth-deterring tax rates. The president's bipartisan debt commission has already developed proposals to reduce or scrap tax breaks in a way that would both lower tax rates and generate $1 trillion in revenues over 10 years. Under one scenario, all tax breaks would be zeroed out except the child tax credit and the earned-income tax credit; meanwhile, three new, lower income tax rates of 9 percent, 15 percent and 24 percent would be established.
This plan, or a variant, would check several boxes in the Republican agenda: it would fundamentally reform the tax code, promote economic growth, reduce the deficit and make America more competitive in the global economy.
Unfortunately, there is a major stumbling block to any sort of real reform: the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, a document written by Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative advocacy group, and signed by most Republican senators and representatives. The pledge states not only that signers will oppose hikes in marginal income tax rates, but also that they will ''oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.'' In other words, signers of the pledge are supposed to vote to keep an irrational and corrupt system of tax loopholes if even $1 of savings goes toward deficit reduction.
And yet many House Republicans seem willing to wait until 2013 to pass major reform. By then, they hope, their party will control both chambers and they will be able to pass their own budget plan into law, with its promises to eliminate or shrink tax breaks and drastically reduce government spending, all without violating their tax pledge.
Whether or not their plan is a good idea, the strategy assumes there is time -- and time is one luxury we don't have. If Republicans really believe their own oratory about an impending debt crisis, now is the time to act, not the spring of 2013, even if it means compromise.
Some Republicans understand this. When queried about breaking the tax pledge, Senator Tom Coburn, a stalwart conservative from Oklahoma, asked which pledge was more important, ''the pledge to uphold your oath to the Constitution of the United States or a pledge from a special interest group?''
Republicans needn't abandon their commitment to smaller government. But by taking the high road of compromise now to achieve real reform later, they might just show which party is truly committed to its country's future.

HEADLINE: As Immigration Audits Increase, Some Employers Pay a High Price

BYLINE: By ADRIANA GARDELLA

 BODY:
David Cox was at his desk in September 2009, when his receptionist announced an unexpected visitor, a special agent from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE. Mr. Cox is chief executive of L. E. Cooke Company, a fourth-generation, family-owned nursery in Visalia, Calif., that grows deciduous trees and shrubs. The agent handed Mr. Cox a letter and informed him he had three days to produce I-9 employment-eligibility forms for all current employees. Mr. Cox said the agent was ''pleasant and nonthreatening,'' but he noticed she carried a gun.
L. E. Cook was one of 1,444 businesses to receive an introduction to ICE's stepped-up worksite enforcement program in 2009 -- almost three times the number audited in 2008. Last year, 2,196 businesses were audited. An ICE representative said the agency did not categorize audits by business type and that the law applied across industries.
''Any company is at risk at any given time,'' said Leon Versfeld, an immigration lawyer in Kansas City, Mo. In one prominent case, American Apparel, the clothing manufacturer, was forced to terminate 1,800 undocumented workers after a 2009 audit. Chipotle Mexican Grill, the restaurant chain, has let go hundreds of workers since its audit began last year. 
While the administration of George W. Bush focused on headline-making raids that resulted in arrests of immigrant workers, the Obama administration has gone after employers with ICE's I-9 audits on the theory that employers who hire unauthorized workers create the demand that drives most illegal immigration.
In addition, the Social Security Administration has resumed sending ''no-match'' letters after a three-year hiatus. The letters, which alert employers that information on an employee's W-2 form does not match information on file with the Social Security Administration, had been halted in 2007. The main purpose is ostensibly to ensure that employee Social Security accounts are credited properly, but the letters can also be used by ICE to show that an employer had reason to believe an employee might not have documentation.
''The master narrative of immigration reform is being crafted around the notion of unscrupulous employers seeking cheap labor,'' said Craig Regelbrugge, a lawyer and lobbyist with the American Nursery and Landscape Association.
Unscrupulous employers exist, Mr. Regelbrugge said, but more often he sees business owners who are just trying to follow the law. When a new hire produces seemingly legitimate forms of documentation required by the I-9 form, the employer must accept them. (To refuse could expose the owner to charges of employment discrimination.) ''The employer is not required to be a forensics expert,'' said Monte Lake, an immigration lawyer in Washington.
The upshot of the more aggressive enforcement is that even employers who have followed the rules can be devastated by an audit that compels them to fire valuable, long-time employees.
The I-9 audit of Mr. Cox's nursery revealed that 26 of his 99 employees were not authorized to work in the United States. Because ICE determined he had acted reasonably in hiring them, Mr. Cox was not fined or held criminally liable. But after confirming that the 26 employees could not produce authentic documents, he was forced to fire them. All had been with him for five to 10 years, and he lost half of his budding crew, a highly specialized team that grafts trees. ''Telling them was probably the worst day of my life,'' he said. ''I don't just sit at a desk here, I'm actually out in the field harvesting with them.''
Mr. Cox said he was lucky the audit hit midrecession, after he had already reduced his work force and inventory. Still, he estimates that his 2009 expenses climbed 10 percent as a result of the terminations. And, despite California's high unemployment rate, finding replacement employees has proved challenging. ''I've gone through more workers this year than I have in the past 10 years combined,'' Mr. Cox said.
While most such workers earn the $8-an-hour minimum wage in California, Mr. Cox said he generally paid $8.90 an hour for a 50-hour week. The terminated budding crew workers made $10 an hour. Compensation includes state-mandated overtime of time and a half, health insurance and two weeks' paid vacation. ''If I raised the wage,'' he said, ''I'd have to shut my doors.''
Meanwhile, after an audit, ICE does not round up the affected workers for deportation. That meant Mr. Cox's former workers were free to seek employment elsewhere -- including with his competitors. Mr. Cox said that he knew through his remaining workers that the terminated employees were all working in the area.
After the audit, Mr. Cox started using E-Verify, a federal program that lets employers confirm the authenticity of a job applicant's Social Security and green card numbers electronically. Although the program's use is mandatory in some states, its reliability has been debated, and it remains voluntary in California. A bill in Congress that would require all American employers to use the program could go to a vote this month.
The owner of another agricultural business, this one on the East Coast, requested anonymity because he was currently undergoing an I-9 audit that had resulted in the loss of half of his work force. He said the employees he was forced to terminate were 25 to 40 years old and had been in the United States for five to 10 years. Many were raising children born here. ''They're all staying here and working for someone else,'' he said.
After the terminations, the East Coast owner said he was struggling to get replacement workers up to speed. He has endured a substantial increase in customer complaints -- to 30 a week from about three -- and has reduced his 2011 sales goals by 15 percent. The terminated employees included members of his management team who earned $12 to $15 an hour. He paid them all their vacation pay, and said he was bothered by the perception that employers like him were unscrupulous and treated undocumented workers unfairly. ''We did everything by the book,'' he said. ''There were a lot of tears here.''
While the human side of the issue is compelling, employers must comply with the law, said Mr. Lake, the immigration lawyer. There is no way to avoid an ICE audit, but establishing and maintaining the right procedures can help you survive one. Mr. Lake recommends that employers review their practices and seek professional assistance if they are not knowledgeable about legal requirements. Sloppy record-keeping can lead to fines for technical violations.
If a review reveals incomplete I-9 forms, employers should fill in the missing information and initial it with the date and time it was added. Mr. Lake advises random checks to ensure that employees are completing the forms. Be sure to retain I-9 forms for the legally required period of time -- the longer of three years or one year after the employee leaves the company. Business owners should understand their obligations upon receiving a no-match letter. Mr. Lake advises employers who receive these letters to meet one-on-one with the designated worker to ensure that a clerical error did not cause the confusion, confirming that names are spelled correctly and no numbers have been transposed.
Assuming there is no mistake, Mr. Lake said the owner must instruct the worker to pursue the issue with the Social Security Administration and report back within a ''reasonable time.'' Document your actions and treat all workers the same, Mr. Lake said. If an employee reports that everything is fine, and you get another no-match letter the next year, you know it is not fine. After that, Mr. Lake said, there is no good answer if ICE conducts an audit and asks, ''Why didn't you take action the second time?''

HEADLINE: Cuomo Says Curbing Public Pension Benefits Will Be His Top Goal in '12

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, basking in the afterglow of a legislative session that he described as ''unusually successful,'' said Wednesday that his top priority next year would be limiting retirement benefits for new state and city workers.
He said that his inability to win such an overhaul was the biggest failing of the session that just ended. 
In a wide-ranging interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times, the governor was both candid and combative as he offered his thoughts about the poor performance of schools statewide, his concern that high taxes are driving residents away and his reflections on his own use of charm and threats in an effort to win over lawmakers in Albany.
Mr. Cuomo, a longtime student of politics who has recently shied away from commenting on national affairs, called the Republican Party a prisoner of the ''extreme right.'' He predicted that President Obama would be re-elected despite the nation's stubbornly high unemployment rate. And he took a gentle swipe at a predecessor, Gov. Eliot Spitzer, a fellow Democrat, who he suggested had failed to understand the delicate interplay between the governor's office and other elements of society.
''There is also something called the Legislature. There is something called the press. There is something called people. These are all different players on the stage,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''I don't think that was his forte.''
Mr. Cuomo said he was heartened by the accomplishments of his first six months -- particularly the passage of a property-tax cap and the legalization of same-sex marriage -- in a state capital divided by party and infamous for corruption and dysfunction.
But he attributed his legislative success to ''a set of reasons that I don't know are necessarily replicable,'' and acknowledged that he was already at odds with lawmakers over how to draw legislative districts -- an exercise that poses an existential threat to many elected officials. ''We had a good period with the State Legislature,'' he said. ''I would not say that the problem has been solved with the State Legislature.''
The governor praised the state's largest public employee union for agreeing to wage and benefits concessions this year, but also criticized unions for resisting lower retirement benefits for what he described as ''the unborn'' -- future state workers for whom he wants to reduce pensions.
''This will be the bar for next year,'' Mr. Cuomo said of his pension proposal.
Even as he mused about his future in Albany, he dismissed talk about a near-term future in Washington. Asked about a New York Post report that he would replace Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as Mr. Obama's running mate next year, Mr. Cuomo said ''there were no discussions'' about that possibility.
But Mr. Cuomo, who was housing secretary during the Clinton administration, weighed in on several pressing federal issues. He praised Mr. Obama's management of the economy, saying ''he brought us back from the abyss,'' and criticized Republicans for gamesmanship over raising the nation's debt ceiling, saying they were looking for ways to attack the president.
''It's the tail that wags the dog,'' he said. ''I think they've lost control of the extreme right, and the extreme right is dictating what they're doing.''
In Albany, the governor said he had assiduously courted lawmakers, who, he said, have been under siege for years. He said he had had numerous meals and conversations with legislators and their spouses and had repeatedly argued, ''You know what, this could be a new beginning, and you can actually succeed and you can do well and you go home heroes.''
''Very few people go into politics to be reviled,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''People go into politics because they want the affirmation, and they want the applause.''
Mr. Cuomo said he did not see a way to compromise with the Legislature over redistricting. The governor would like an independent commission to draw district lines, but he said any overhaul of the redistricting process was ''all negative'' for the Senate Republicans, because it threatened their majority.
''If they don't draw the lines themselves, the odds of them retaining the majority go way, way down,'' he said.
Mr. Cuomo, who shepherded the same-sex marriage bill through the Legislature, spoke glowingly of the four Republicans who provided the pivotal votes for it, pledging political support.
''The problem is, their threat now is from the Conservative Party,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''I'm sort of the Antichrist to the Conservative Party. But anything I can do, I will do to help.''
The governor said that he had been asked to officiate at the weddings of several close gay friends, but that he did not intend to preside over any on July 24, the first day they will be legal in New York, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will officiate at the marriage of two of his top aides.
''I don't want to compete with what the mayor's doing,'' Mr. Cuomo said.
Despite a dizzying legislative session filled with political uncertainty, Mr. Cuomo said, his biggest regret involved disagreement between his mother and his girlfriend, the Food Network celebrity Sandra Lee, over the proper preparation of his favorite dinner dish: lasagna. ''That was the mistake I made over the past six months,'' he said, mischievously. ''Commenting on the lasagna.''

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about an interview with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo misstated the date of the first day that same sex marriages will be allowed in New York. It is Sunday, July 24 -- not this Sunday, July 17.

HEADLINE: Amazon Takes On California

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL and VERNE G. KOPYTOFF; Stephanie Clifford contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Amazon, the world's largest online merchant, has an ambitious and far-reaching new agenda: it wants to rewrite tax policy for the Internet era.
Amazon said this week that it would push a voter initiative in California that could eliminate sales tax for virtual sellers with only a modest physical presence in the state. Its move instantly escalated the company's long-running battle with many states over collecting sales tax, taking the question directly to voters. And it has sharply intensified its dispute with physical retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and Target, which have vowed to fight the measure.
Some political science and business professors say the conflict could take on the polarizing nature of Proposition 13, a decades-old referendum that limited property tax increases and remains a lightning rod in the state. Political experts say Amazon's proposed referendum is likely to gather the signatures necessary to appear on the ballot as early as next February.
Nancy F. Koehn, a retail historian at the Harvard Business School, said the initiative highlighted the evolution of Internet retailing into a ''major highway of commerce.'' 
Internet shopping ''is no longer a small, out-of-the way quirky tributary of shopping,'' she said, adding: ''It's the fastest-growing distribution channel in America. This is a referendum on how we're going to treat it.''
She said that what happened in California could catch on in other states and have a domino effect.
Ms. Koehn, who opposes the idea of exempting online retailers from sales tax, said the stakes were amplified by the fact that state budgets, already under duress, needed the hundreds of millions of dollars in potential tax generated by online retailers.
''Do we really want online retailers big and small to walk through a gaping door that says 'You don't have to pay sales tax'?'' she said. ''I don't think we want to send the message that companies can fund a political campaign for a referendum and maybe your customers won't be subject to sales tax.''
Amazon argues that such sales tax, even if it raises revenue, ultimately hurts investment and job growth. ''Californians deserve a voice and a choice about jobs, investment and the state's economic future,'' Paul Misener, Amazon's vice president of global public policy, said in a statement about the referendum.
The referendum is a response to a California law, passed last month, that requires Internet retailers to pay sales tax if they have affiliates or subsidiaries in the state. State officials estimate Amazon will owe $83 million in taxes this year, nearly half of the $200 million the state estimates Internet retailers owe over all.
Amazon says the law penalizes companies that have not traditionally been subject to sales tax.
Big retailers are already organizing and financing opposition. They complain that Amazon has an unfair advantage because it does not collect sales tax from shoppers while other retailers must add in the extra cost, which in California starts at 7.25 percent.
''They need to play by the same rules as everybody else,'' said Danny Diaz, a spokesman for the Alliance for Main Street Fairness, a coalition of large and small retailers that is agitating for Amazon to pay sales tax.
In a signal of how the political arguments might line up, William R. Harker, senior vice president of Sears Holdings, which owns Sears and Kmart, said in an interview, ''At a time where our state and municipal governments are going through really a fiscal crisis, taking steps to collect taxes that are already on the books is to me the fiscally responsible thing to do.''
The question of how to tax out-of-state retailers is a longstanding one, dating back to the popularity of catalog shopping. Courts have ruled that companies without a physical presence in a given state are exempt from collecting sales tax there.
Individual consumers are supposed to declare what they owe in so-called use tax when they file taxes, but most people do not.
The boom of Internet commerce has prompted a growing number of states to pass laws redefining ''physical presence.'' California's law, which took effect July 1, is the most expansive, while laws in other states, like Illinois, Colorado and Connecticut, expand the definition of physical presence to include affiliates but not subsidiaries.
To avoid paying sales taxes in those states, Amazon has severed business ties with its affiliates, local Web sites that promote and link to Amazon products. Two weeks ago, in response to the California law, Amazon cut ties with California affiliates. In Texas, it plans to close a warehouse to avoid having a physical presence. In New York, Amazon has gone to court to challenge a state law that defines physical presence to include affiliates. In the meantime, the company is collecting New York sales tax.
But using the initiative process here takes the war to another level, industry analysts said. It is an evolution that is in some ways natural, given that companies like Google and Microsoft get more political as they get bigger. But that kind of visibility also brings public relations risks because opponents of the measure will seek to define Amazon as taking money out of the state without contributing to the state's infrastructure, said Colin W. Gillis, who follows Amazon for BGC Financial, an investment firm.
''Think of the backlash that Wal-Mart has gotten in terms of how it wrecks Main Street,'' he said. ''There hasn't been that kind of thing directed at e-commerce, but it's likely to come.''
Others consider Amazon to be squarely in the right. George Runner, a Republican member of the state Board of Equalization, said the proposed referendum would spare not just Amazon but thousands of smaller online retailers, which he argued could not possibly handle the intricacies of collecting sales tax for California, and other states starting to demand it, too.
''Some mom-and-pop company doing an Internet business out of their garage, they would be responsible for collecting sales tax,'' said Mr. Runner. He argued, like Amazon, that California's new law hurts jobs by causing online retailers to cut ties with affiliate companies in the state and to close subsidiary offices.
''They'll say, 'We're not going to do our research for the Kindle in California,' '' Mr. Runner said. ''It just takes more jobs out of California.''
Some opponents of Amazon's proposed referendum say the company is putting its own profits above California, jobs and economic fairness.
''Of the top 10 Internet retailers in the state, only one does not collect sales tax -- that's Amazon,'' said Nancy Skinner, a state assemblywoman whose proposed legislation was incorporated into the California law. Among the others are Wal-Mart and Target, which have physical presences in the state.
Californians are already dividing on the issue. Stephen Carter, 47, a technology manager at AT&T who lives in Hayward, Calif., and buys from Amazon four times a week, said he was supporting the referendum, arguing that taxing Amazon was ''unjust'' and that revenue would be wasted by the legislature.
Matthew Stotts, 41, a Santa Barbara resident who does marketing for venture capital firms, spends as much as $1,000 a month on Amazon. He said he generally believed that limiting taxes on Internet retailers helped spur innovation. But he does not like that the company is taking its case to taxpayers and bypassing the Legislature. ''What I want to see from Amazon is innovation, not litigation,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Fed Is Ready to Act Again if Necessary, Bernanke Tells Congress

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, gave a subdued account of the economy's health Wednesday and said that the Fed was prepared to expand its economic aid campaign once again, if necessary, though such a step was not imminent.
Less than a month has passed since Mr. Bernanke said at a press conference that the central bank intended to stand back and take the measure of the nation's sluggish recovery. Wednesday's remarks amounted to acknowledgment that so far, the news has been almost uniformly bad. 
''I think we have to keep all the options on the table,'' Mr. Bernanke said in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. ''We don't know where the economy is going to go.''
He described options, including a public commitment to maintain existing aid programs for a longer period, new asset purchases to drive down interest rates, or steps to encourage banks to withdraw money kept on reserve at the Fed and use it to make loans.
Republicans have criticized the Fed for its efforts to stimulate growth, fearing that it would lose control over inflation. But Representative Spencer Bachus, the Alabama Republican who is chairman of the committee, said on Wednesday that he agreed with Mr. Bernanke.
''I'm glad that you are going to maintain some flexibility, which may be needed, because we don't know what tomorrow will bring,'' Mr. Bachus said.
Mr. Bernanke made clear that a resumption of the central bank's economic revival campaign faced a high hurdle. He said that the Fed would look for two conditions, economic weakness beyond current expectations, and a renewed threat of deflation.
The first seems obvious. The second, however, may be the more important factor. The Fed's decision to resume asset purchases last summer was made in large part because the central bank feared that prices might begin to decline, a phenomenon that can undermine growth because it causes people to delay purchases, fueling a downward cycle.
Since then, the pace of price increases has rebounded toward levels that economists consider healthy. Indeed, earlier this year, concern shifted to the possibility that prices were rising too fast. While Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials say they believe those increases will abate, there is little risk of deflation -- and therefore little chance of additional efforts.
''In other words, it is a possibility next year if inflation drops back, but not in the short term,'' Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients.
Members of the Fed's policy-making committee discussed the issue during their most recent meeting, at the end of June, but are divided regarding the costs and benefits, according to minutes of that meeting, which the Fed released on Tuesday.
The Fed released its most recent economic forecast after that meeting, predicting that the economy would expand at a moderate pace of 2.7 to 2.9 percent this year.
In the intervening weeks, the government has reported that employment increased by only 18,000 jobs in June, and that exports were weaker than expected. That has led a number of private forecasters to slash estimates of second-quarter growth. Mr. Bernanke did not update the Fed's own projections, but his remarks reflected greater concern.
''Among the headwinds facing the economy are the slow growth of consumer spending, even after accounting for the effects of food and higher energy prices,'' Mr. Bernanke said in his prepared testimony. ''The ability and willingness of consumers to spend will be an important determinant of the pace of the recovery in coming quarters.''
Later, Mr. Bernanke described the Fed's economic projection for the rest of this year -- growth of about 3.5 percent -- and said, ''We'll see if that's the case.''
Despite the fragile health of the economy, most questions from the members of the committee focused on the political battle over the federal deficit -- a long-term problem that, as Mr. Bernanke told the committee, does not pose an immediate danger to the economy, although he warned that the debt ceiling must be raised immediately.
When Mr. Bernanke was asked about the millions of Americans who cannot find jobs, he took the opportunity to gently chide the committee for its focus. ''I think I'd like to make very clear that I think we have two crises in the economy,'' he said in response. ''One of them is the fiscal set of issues that you're all paying a lot of attention to right now, but I think the job situation is another crisis.''
The Fed is charged by Congress with minimizing unemployment, and some of its critics say that current unemployment rate of 9.2 percent should be a sufficient reason by itself for the central bank to expand its roster of economic aid programs.
Mr. Bernanke noted that the scale of the Fed's existing efforts was unprecedented. The central bank has kept short-term interest rates near zero for more than two years. It also owns more than $2 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and government debt, the legacy of its two asset-purchase programs to reduce long-term interest rates.
''We are prepared to take further steps if needed,'' he said.
Mr. Bernanke's account of the Fed's efforts was challenged by Texas Republican Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the central bank. ''Spending all this money hasn't helped,'' Mr. Paul said. The Fed's aid programs benefitted financial companies, he said, while people ''lost their job, and they lost their houses and mortgages, and they're still in trouble.''
Mr. Paul, who recently announced that he would not run for re-election to focus instead on his presidential campaign, began on a lighter note, suggesting that news of his impending departure might have caused Mr. Bernanke to smile. Amidst the ensuing laughter, Mr. Bernanke was unable to resist.

HEADLINE: Dire Warning Amid Discord On Debt Talks

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Jackie Calmes, Robert Pear and Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, warned on Wednesday of a ''huge financial calamity'' if President Obama and the Republicans cannot agree on a budget deal that allows the federal debt ceiling to be increased. Moody's, the ratings agency, threatened a credit downgrade, citing a ''rising possibility'' that no deal would be reached before the government's borrowing authority hits its limit on Aug. 2.
And the latest bipartisan negotiating session on Wednesday evening ended in heightened tension. Republicans said Mr. Obama had abruptly walked out in an agitated state; Democrats described the president as having summed up with an impassioned case for action before bringing the meeting to a close and leaving.
Across Washington, officials were weighed down with a sense that they were hurtling toward a crisis. Grim-faced lawmakers spent the day shuttling from meeting to meeting in search of a way out of the fix. 
The stakes are high, for the economy, the financial markets and both parties. But the pressure was particularly intense on Republican leaders, who only weeks ago seemed to be on the offensive and in a strong position to extract major concessions from Mr. Obama and the Democrats.
For months, the Republican leaders have emphatically pledged that there will be no increase in the federal debt ceiling absent huge cuts in government spending and fundamental changes in popular social programs, all without the whiff of a tax increase.
Now, with negotiations stalled and a potential default by the United States government just over the horizon, they are being held to those promises by their own rank-and-file, leaving them in a bind that is defying easy resolution and putting them at risk of being blamed if things end badly.
Behind closed doors and by phone, they groped for a solution and struggled to assert some kind of control over the situation as rank-and-file Republican members, especially in the House, grew more confrontational.
Panic had not yet set in, but the worry and tension were evident as seasoned lawmakers of both parties whose experience told them that Congress always finds a white-knuckle way to avert disaster wondered if this was going to be the time when it did not.
''Our problem is, we made a big deal about this for three months,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.
''How many Republicans have been on TV saying, 'I am not going to raise the debt limit,' '' said Mr. Graham, including himself in the mix of those who did so. ''We have no one to blame but ourselves.''
Potential last-minute options were being gamed out around Capitol Hill. Senate Republicans were pushing their counterparts in the House to deliver some legislation, which could take the form of a balanced budget plan due on the House floor next week. A bipartisan group that had been working on a major deficit-cutting plan in the Senate was trying again to produce a proposal.
And Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader and procedural maestro, was pushing his plan that would allow a debt limit increase to clear Congress without Republican fingerprints -- and without the guaranteed cuts many in his party are demanding. He would establish an elaborate process where Congress would vote to disapprove instead of approve a debt limit request. That would allow the president to raise the debt ceiling via a successful veto of the disapproval if it came to that.
Despite resistance from conservatives and the initial unease many lawmakers expressed at such a slippery approach, the McConnell gambit was gaining credence as the best escape hatch. Senate Democrats went virtually silent on the idea for fear of jinxing it. While the White House said it was not the preferable option, it was viewed inside the West Wing as a real option nonetheless, even if it would transfer to Mr. Obama and his party all the political responsibility for a debt limit increase.
Some of Mr. McConnell's colleagues were coming around to it as the reality of a possible default began to sink in.
''I strongly support Senator McConnell's efforts to avoid a default on our nation's debt, and the last-case emergency proposal he outlined yesterday to ensure that Republicans aren't unduly blamed for failure to raise the debt ceiling,'' said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.
But with House Republicans showing little to no appetite for Mr. McConnell's plan, top lawmakers in both parties were looking for ways to sweeten the deal, perhaps by adding required spending cuts or somehow forcing consideration of a deficit-reduction package. Mr. McConnell portrayed his proposal as a last-stand way to spare Republicans from being blamed for a default if no alternative plan could be approved.
Recounting how the 1995 government shutdown helped President Bill Clinton win re-election the following year, Mr. McConnell said any impasse that drove down the nation's credit rating and led to government checks being delayed could have the same result for Mr. Obama.
''He will say Republicans are making the economy worse,'' Mr. McConnell said in an interview with the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham. ''It is an argument that he could have a good chance of winning, and all of the sudden we have co-ownership of the economy. That is a very bad position going into the election.''
After the meeting at the White House, Republicans and Democrats offered differing versions of what by all accounts was a tense session.
Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, said he raised the idea of taking what savings could be achieved now -- roughly $1.4 trillion -- and then having additional votes to raise the debt limit again before the elections in November 2012, with Republicans ultimately seeking a total of at least $2.4 trillion in cuts with no tax increases.
At this, Mr. Cantor said, the president ''got very agitated, seemingly.'' Mr. Cantor quoted the president as saying: ''Eric, don't call my bluff. I'm going to the American people with this.''
Then, Mr. Cantor said, ''He shoved back and said, 'I'll see you tomorrow' and walked out.''
''I was a little taken aback,'' Mr. Cantor added.
Democrats said that Mr. Obama's departure was not abrupt, but that he had forcefully made a case that Republicans had been unwilling to compromise. ''Enough's enough,'' one Democrat familiar with the talks quoted Mr. Obama as saying.
Democrats said Mr. Obama had set a deadline of Friday for the two sides to determine whether they could reach a broad budget deal. If not, he said, they will turn to finding an accord over how to raise the debt limit without agreement on taxes and spending.
In Asia, Moody's threat to downgrade the United States' credit rating dragged down the U.S. dollar. The dollar was set for its steepest two-day loss against the euro in five weeks, Bloomberg reported, declining 0.3 percent in Tokyo by mid-afternoon Thursday, and hit a fresh four-month low against the yen.
Investors also rushed to buy assets seen as safer, like gold, which hit a record high on Thursday at over $1,589 an ounce.

HEADLINE: Times Co. to Pay Back $250 Million Loan Three Years Early

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
9:54 a.m. Updated The New York Times Company said Wednesday that it would pay back the $250 million loan from Carlos Slim Helu, a Mexican telecommunications billionaire, on Aug. 15, freeing itself from one of its larger financial obligations. 
The repayment will come three and a half years before the loan is due and five months sooner than the company initially planned to settle the debt.
-Janet L. Robinson, chief executive of the Times Company, and Arthur Sulzberger Jr., chairman and publisher of The New York Times, said in a message to employees that the company's strengthened financial position enabled the early payback.
-''Our ability to pay down this debt at this time is directly linked to the decisive steps we have taken to improve our financial flexibility over the past two years,'' they wrote. ''We remain focused as we move to the next phases of our business plans and as the uncertain global economy and the ongoing volatility in our industry continue. But today we take pride in this moment.''
-The Times Company ended the first quarter with $352 million in cash and short-term investments on hand. The total cost of the loan, with a 14 percent interest rate, was approximately $279 million.
-While the company will incur a $46 million loss on the prepayment in the third quarter, savings on interest over the next three and a half years will exceed $39 million each year.
-Mr. Helu and members of his family hold about 7 percent of the Class A shares in the Times Company.
-The Times Company has taken other steps recently to firm up its financial position, including a deal last month to sell most of its stake in the Fenway Sports Group, owners of the Boston Red Sox. It sold 390 of its 700 Class B units of the Fenway Sports Group to three separate buyers in a deal for $117 million. It now holds a 7 percent stake in the company.

HEADLINE: Dodd-Frank Strays Far From Street

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
At a meeting in February to discuss the recent overhaul of financial regulations, lobbyists and policy makers never once mentioned Wall Street. They did not talk about derivatives, mortgage-backed securities or any of the exotic products at the center of the crisis.
Instead, Mary L. Schapiro, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, hurled questions at representatives of Apple and Hewlett-Packard about war-torn central Africa, an odd topic for a financial regulator. She wanted to know more about the American companies that buy coveted minerals extracted from the region. 
After months of writing dozens of rules on arcane financial instruments, Ms. Schapiro told attendees the discussion was ''certainly an interesting change of pace,'' according to two people with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.
While the issue may be outside the S.E.C.'s core expertise, it is now within its jurisdiction. A little-known amendment tacked onto the Dodd-Frank financial reform law requires corporations to disclose whether they manufacture products using so-called conflict minerals from Congo or neighboring countries.
Lawmakers are worried about metals like tantalum, tin and gold, which they believe have financed armed rebels throughout the region during a roughly 15-year conflict punctuated by incidents of mass slaughter and rape. Many American companies use these metals to build cellphones, computers and cameras.
The conflict minerals amendment is one of several unusual elements buried in Dodd-Frank, which spans some 2,300 pages and touches nearly every corner of Wall Street. One section is dedicated to derivatives. Another chunk covers lavish Wall Street bonuses.
Then there are the ''miscellaneous provisions'' Congress tucked into Dodd-Frank last summer - a catchall for some lawmakers' pet concerns, among them mining safety and spending by the International Monetary Fund.
One provision requires companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments for the right to extract oil and natural gas. The proposal had an influential backer: the co-author of the financial overhaul package, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who introduced similar legislation in 2008.
''The provisions are appropriately called miscellaneous,'' said Andrew J. Foley, a partner at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, which represents oil, natural gas and mining companies that are subject to the rules. ''There's no question it's unrelated to the financial crisis.''
Given the ongoing partisan stalemate, Dodd-Frank presented a rare opportunity for Republicans and Democrats. In the aftermath of the economic crisis, the act was the closest thing to a sure bet in Washington. Lawmakers ''jumped on to the passing bandwagon,'' Mr. Foley said, using the moment to insert popular, if sometimes random, rules.
Representative Jim McDermott, a Democrat from Seattle, had tried for years to regulate conflict minerals.
Mr. McDermott, who served as a Foreign Service medical officer in central Africa during the 1980s, returned to Congo four years ago to tour a hospital that was treating people wounded in the continuing civil war. After visiting with a group of rape victims, he said he was shocked by the human rights abuses. Mr. McDermott traced much of the suffering to rebel soldiers who sold tantalum and other minerals to finance their war.
The issue gained traction in 2008 after Sam Brownback, then a Republican senator from Kansas, introduced legislation requiring companies to disclose their use of conflict minerals. A few years before, Mr. Brownback, now the governor of Kansas, had traveled to the Congo with Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. But the effort soon stalled.
''Of course, it never moved anywhere - and along comes the Dodd-Frank bill,'' said Mr. McDermott. After a short debate on the Senate floor, the plan to regulate conflict minerals was attached to the sweeping new law by Mr. Brownback.
''You get bills passed any way you can,'' Mr. McDermott said.
Almost immediately, companies took aim at the regulation. They figured it would be a costly proposition to trace the roots of such minerals.
In February, the United States Chamber of Commerce called on the S.E.C. to withdraw its plan to enforce the regulation. ''The proposed rule, if implemented, would create a disclosure regime that is burdensome and difficult, if not impossible to comply with, resulting in potentially erroneous disclosure,'' lobbyists for the group said in a letter to the commission.
Tiffany & Company, one of the world's largest jewelry companies, pushed the agency to exempt gold from the disclosure requirements, arguing in a separate letter that the proposed rules ''would violate the First Amendment.''
Many other companies were caught totally off guard by the rule. In recent months, lawyers and auditors say they have had to explain the rule to clients who were unaware of its existence.
''Some weren't aware of the provision and most didn't realize its complexity,'' said Douglas K. Dean, a partner in the sustainable business solutions practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
The S.E.C. did not fully grasp the intricacies of the provision either. As with other Dodd-Frank rules, the agency has missed important deadlines for both the conflict minerals provision and the one about payments to foreign governments. While the S.E.C. proposed rules to enforce the disclosure requirements, it was supposed to complete the regulations about three months ago. The agency said it needed additional time to study the thorny topics.
''The new payment disclosure rule is a powerful tool, but we are still waiting for the law to be enforced,'' said Ian Gary, a senior policy analyst at Oxfam America, an advocacy group.
Mr. Dean of PricewaterhouseCoopers said his clients were anxiously awaiting the S.E.C.'s final conflict minerals rule, hoping it would finally clarify the issue. They also want to know whether the agency will issue exemptions for businesses that use only trace amounts of the minerals or get them from recycled sources, he added.
''Companies,'' he said, ''are basically in a holding pattern.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Clouds Around Karzai Darken the Road Ahead

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- At midday, the glare and dust obscures Afghanistan's horizon in what seems a metaphor for the position of the Afghan president as political and economic crises mount on every front: it is increasingly hard to see how he will find his way.
The death of President Hamid Karzai's half brother, who was shot by a police commander on Tuesday, was only the latest in a series of blows to the stability of the government as the United States and Afghanistan's other international backers have made it clear they want to reduce their commitments here.
Without his brother, who gave the president the assurance that he could count on the political and economic backing of at least a quarter of the country -- the south -- Mr. Karzai's government appears increasingly adrift.
''The situation is very difficult for him,'' said Ahmad Wali Massoud, the former Afghan ambassador to Britain who lost his own brother, Ahmed Shah Massoud, in a suicide bombing in 2001. ''His brother's killing is not just a political matter, but a personal and family blow as well.'' 
Often a critic of President Karzai, Mr. Massoud struck a more empathetic tone on Wednesday, a day when the president buried his half brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, noting that the president faced many serious problems.
In Parliament, many members are talking openly about impeaching Mr. Karzai, who wants to dismiss a quarter of the assembly's members over allegations that they gained their seats through electoral fraud. Their deadlock with Mr. Karzai has meant that he has not been able to form a full cabinet for nearly 18 months.
The banking system is such a shambles that the International Monetary Fund has refused to extend its program here and the lack of one has meant the loss of at least $70 million in aid. More is likely to be lost this summer and fall; another Afghan bank appears to be mired in fraud and is likely to need a cash infusion.
Meanwhile, efforts to reconcile with the insurgency are barely moving, and Pakistan is firing artillery rounds over the border, even as it professes to support a peace plan between Afghanistan and Taliban insurgents, many of whom live in the Pakistan's tribal areas.
The Pakistani bombardment is said to be an effort to repel Taliban insurgents who have taken refuge in Afghanistan. However, it is widely believed that the Pakistanis are trying to make the point that the Afghan government is weak and cannot protect its own borders and should look to Pakistan, not the Americans, for support.
In this case, President Karzai has seemed clear: he has resisted calls from Afghan nationalists to fight back, since Afghanistan cannot win a fight with Pakistan.
The troubles facing him, like the Pakistani artillery fire, are not all of his making, but some are, and he appears increasingly isolated and overwhelmed.
''He is under enormous pressure,'' said a knowledgeable businessman here, who did not want to be named because he feared retribution for his analysis. ''He's dealing with six or seven crises and on none is he really prevailing and on every single one he is creating new enemies.''
Confronted at a news conference on July 6, Mr. Karzai played down the seriousness of the country's troubles. ''Afghanistan has to go through these problems,'' he said. ''These are maturity problems. As a child grows and grows teeth, he gets a fever; when his bones grow he feels pain. These all are signs of maturity. We should not worry about it.''
But the severity of the symptoms has become alarming. The problems with Parliament verge on a constitutional crisis and are in many ways self-inflicted. Mr. Karzai has struggled to address complaints of fraud from losing candidates -- many of them his supporters -- after the 2010 parliamentary elections, which the country's international backers and its election commission agreed were flawed but fair enough.
His solution -- to set up a special court to adjudicate the complaints -- has satisfied no one. Three weeks ago the court ruled that 62 members of Parliament should be replaced with candidates whose electoral defeat had been certified.
Parliament has refused to recognize the court or its order, and a majority decided to fight the president and began talking about impeachment. Although that option is unlikely, the mere discussion of it was a measure of the enmity between the president and Afghan lawmakers.
Mr. Karzai now risks either infuriating members of Parliament by allowing the court to force them out or infuriating the losing candidates, who have come to believe that they should be in office.
''When he set up the special court I don't think he thought about how the situation might turn out,'' said Fazal Ahmad Manawi, the chairman of the Independent Election Commission.
Mr. Manawi offered the president a way out last week: he offered to have the commission examine the cases of the losing candidates and determine whether there was fraud that needed to be reviewed by the attorney general's office. The president did not accept that approach and the fight goes on.
On the financial front, too, there are few signs of immediate relief. The I.M.F. is demanding greater scrutiny of the banking system as well as a more legally binding way to ensure that borrowers with loans from Kabul Bank, the nation's largest bank, will pay back the bank, which was found to have nearly $900 million in losses.
The president and his close associates want to draw a line, fearing that if they look too closely, the whole financial system may collapse, said several Afghan and Western officials.
''But if you need to audit two banks, you audit two,'' said a Western official here, who is familiar with the situation. ''If three, you audit three. You need to look at the health of the whole system.''
In the meantime, Afghanistan is without an I.M.F. program and has lost at least $70 million because some of the money in the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, administered by the World Bank, can be doled out only if there is a working I.M.F. program.
As the problems mount, NATO's military commanders and civilian officials express cautious optimism that there will be ''Afghan solutions.''
''Afghans have shown innovation and the capacity to overcome crises,'' said Vygaudas Usackas, the European Union's ambassador here. ''I'm hopeful it will bring a new pattern of political culture -- instead of fighting each other, finding a political solution.''
However, other analysts are far more doubtful and say that NATO lacks a strategy to handle the increasingly treacherous landscape. ''There is no plan,'' said Thomas Ruttig, a co-director of the Kabul-based Afghanistan Analysts Network, a research group.
''What we have is a public relations strategy -- 'Everything is improving; it's hard but we're making progress,' '' Mr. Ruttig said, quoting Western officials here. ''But for the president, the picture is gloomy. For Afghanistan, the picture is gloomy.''

HEADLINE: After Big Early Gains, Rally Fizzles a Bit

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks stopped a three-day slide on Wednesday, but ended well off the day's highs as investors took the suggestion of further Federal Reserve stimulus as a mixed blessing.
Stock index futures dropped after Moody's Investors Service said it might cut the United States' triple-A rating because of the chance that the country's debt ceiling might not be raised by the Aug. 2 deadline. Concerns about the debt ceiling have been a headwind for equities. Futures initially slumped on the news, though they later recovered some losses.
''The rating agencies were so slow to respond to anything in 2007 and 2008 that now they're overly quick to respond,'' said Paul Schatz, president and chief investment officer of Heritage Capital in Woodbridge, Conn., who added that he felt there was ''no chance'' of a default. 
''I don't think this is a big deal and I don't think it will move the needle for long,'' Mr. Schatz said. ''This will be a short-term issue, no more than half a day.''
In Wednesday's session, the three major stock indexes rose more than 1 percent at their peaks after Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested that the Fed would consider additional measures to support the economy if the outlook got worse. Energy and materials stocks led gains, but the rally fizzled in afternoon trading.
''Bernanke's comments were a positive this morning, but we had a little too much happiness early on,'' said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at the Philadelphia Trust Company. ''The comments were not upbeat by any means, and obviously, no one wants the economy to get to the point where more stimulus is needed.''
The Fed's $600 billion bond-buying effort, known as QE2, has contributed to equity gains since September.
In testimony to the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Bernanke said ''the recent economic weakness may prove more persistent than expected,'' implying a need for additional policy support.
Stock investors had put a low probability on any more stimulus from the Fed, but June's dismal jobs report altered some perceptions.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 44.73 points, or 0.36 percent, to 12,491.61. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 4.08 points, or 0.31 percent, to 1,317.72. The Nasdaq Composite index advanced 15.01 points, or 0.54 percent, to 2,796.92.
After the closing bell, Yum Brands, the fast-food chain, rose 2.3 percent to $56.88 in extended trading after it reported a better-than-expected profit and raised its full-year profit view. Shares of the hotel chain Marriott International fell 4.3 percent to $35.55 after the bell after the company reported results.
During the regular session, share of the News Corporation jumped 3.8 percent to $15.93. It was the Nasdaq's most active issue after the company announced that it had withdrawn a $12 billion bid to buy the 61 percent of British Sky Broadcasting it did not already own. Volume in the media company's stock was its highest since Dec. 17, 2004, when it was officially added to the S.& P. 500.
The News Corporation is at the center of accusations that one of its tabloid newspapers committed criminal acts. Energy and material stocks were the top gainers, though they were off their highs as crude oil cut its gains. The S.& P. energy sector index rose 0.7 percent, while August crude futures gained 62 cents, or 0.6 percent, to settle at $98.05 a barrel. Baker Hughes was one of the top energy sector gainers, rising 3.3 percent to $74.83.
The S.& P. materials sector index rose 0.8 percent, with Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold up 2 percent to $54.89 on heavy volume.
Shares of JPMorgan Chase rose 0.6 percent to $39.62 while Google climbed 0.8 percent to close at $538.26. JPMorgan is scheduled to report results on Thursday morning and Google after the market's closing bell.
Wall Street got an early boost from overseas data that showed China's economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter, but there was still caution over developments in Europe. Moody's downgraded Ireland's debt to junk late on Tuesday and said that Ireland, like Greece, would probably need a second bailout. Irish bond yields jumped to record highs.
Electronic Arts, the video game publisher, is buying PopCap Games in a deal worth up to $1.3 billion as it tries to build its social and casual games portfolio. Shares of Electronic Arts shed 1.1 percent to $23.91. [Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 2/32, to 102 2/32, and the yield was unchanged at 2.88 percent.

HEADLINE: The Opposing Party

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Senator Mitch McConnell has a clever plan to resolve the federal debt impasse. Congressional Republicans would invite President Obama to raise the debt ceiling on his own, and then they would excoriate him for doing so.
Hm. Just a bit contradictory?
Meanwhile, the impasse arose because Congressional Republicans thunder against government red ink, yet refuse to raise revenue by ending tax breaks that help Warren Buffett pay a lower tax rate than his receptionist (which he agrees is preposterous). 
Another contradiction? Of course.
Senator McConnell's plan -- a pragmatic way to avert a catastrophic default -- may be torpedoed by more extremist House Republicans, like Michele Bachmann. They seem to fear that ending tax loopholes for billionaire fund managers would damage a fragile economy. Yet they seem to think that this invalid of an economy would be unperturbed by the risk of a default on our debts.
A contra- -- yes, you got it!
What about this one? Republicans have historically been more focused on national security threats than Democrats. Yet what would do more damage to America's national security than a possible default that might halt paychecks for American military families?
This game of ''spot the contradiction'' is just too easy with extremist Republicans; it's like spotting snowflakes in a blizzard. Congressional Republicans have taken a sensible and important concern -- alarm about long-term debt levels, a genuine problem -- and turned it into a brittle and urgent ideology.
Politicians in both parties have historically been irresponsible with money, but President Bill Clinton changed that. He imposed a stunning fiscal discipline and set the United States on a course of budget surpluses, job growth and diminishing federal debt -- until the Republicans took over in 2001.
In the Bush years, Republicans proved themselves reckless both on the spending side (unfunded wars and a prescription drug benefit) and on the revenue side (the Bush tax cuts). Their view then was, as former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill quoted Vice President Dick Cheney as saying, ''Reagan proved deficits don't matter.''
It may seem odd that Republicans were so blithe about debt in the Bush years, yet now insist on addressing the problem in the middle of a downturn -- even though basic economics dictates that a downturn is the one time when red ink is advisable. Well, just another of those contradictions.
Then there's the rise of health care costs, a huge burden on our economy. The Congressional Budget Office foresees a rise in federal spending on health care from 5.5 percent of gross domestic product today to more than 12 percent in 2050 (at which point it will be double the share of spending on Social Security).
''The United States' standing in the world depends on its success in constraining this health care cost explosion,'' Peter Orszag, the former budget director, observes in Foreign Affairs. So how do we contain health care costs?
It's pretty clear what doesn't work -- the existing, dysfunctional system. A forthcoming book on health care by Paul Starr, ''Remedy and Reaction,'' notes that in 1970 the United States spent a smaller fraction of income on health care than Denmark and the same share as Canada. Today, in dollar terms, we spend two and a half times the average per capita of other rich countries.
When Congressional Republicans do talk about health care, they have one useful suggestion -- tort reform -- and it was foolish for Democrats (in bed with trial lawyers) to stiff them on it. But research suggests that curbing malpractice suits, while helpful, would reduce health costs only modestly.
Beyond that, the serious Republican idea is to dismantle Medicare in its present form. That would indeed reduce government spending, but would increase private spending by even more, according to the C.B.O.
The Obama health care plan could have done better on cost control, but it does promote evidence-based medicine, so that less money is squandered on expensive procedures that don't work. And a panel of medical experts, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, will recommend steps to curb excess spending in Medicare. These initiatives will help hold down health care costs, even if it's difficult to know how much -- and they are the only game in town.
Yet Congressional Republicans are trying to kill the Obama health plan. Yes, of course: another contradiction.
A final puzzle concerns not just the Republican Party but us as a nation. For all their flaws, Congressional Republicans have been stunningly successful in framing the national debate. Instead of discussing a jobs program to deal with the worst downturn in 70 years, we're debating spending cuts -- and most voters say in polls that they're against raising the debt ceiling. I fear that instead of banishing contradictions, we as a nation may be embracing them.

HEADLINE: For News Corp., Murdoch Discount

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GOLDFARB, RICHARD BEALES and HUGO DIXON

 BODY:
Rupert Murdoch's political influence may be surpassed by his impact on the value of the News Corporation. The stock routinely trades more cheaply than media rivals', largely because the company, which is listed in the United States, is run at Mr. Murdoch's whim. As a result of the British phone-hacking scandal, the Murdoch discount has widened to 30 percent.
The affair forced the News Corporation to shutter The News of the World, its most widely read newspaper, and led the company to withdraw a $14 billion plan to buy full ownership of the British pay-TV operator BSkyB. The damage could extend further. Senator Jay Rockefeller, for instance, has called on Congress to open an investigation that would accompany those in Britain. 
The News Corporation enterprise now trades at a paltry five times estimates of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the fiscal year 2012, according to Credit Suisse. That's 40 percent less than media groups like Walt Disney and Time Warner -- double the typical gap seen since 2002.
The most valuable component of the empire is its American cable networks, including Fox News. Put their combined Ebitda, as estimated by Barclays Capital, on a multiple of nine and they're worth more than $30 billion. The movie studio behind the global blockbuster ''Avatar'' and the Fox broadcast network, home to hit shows like ''American Idol'' and ''Glee,'' together should be worth more than $12 billion.
The publishing arm at the heart of News Corporation's troubles warrants a lower multiple of four, between those of Trinity Mirror of Britain and The New York Times, for a value just above $5 billion. The Sky Italia satellite unit and various private stakes add more than $6 billion, and holdings in publicly traded companies bring another $10 billion-plus, three-quarters of which is accounted for by News Corporation's 39 percent stake in BSkyB.
Ignore the money-losing digital unit, total it and strip out net debt of around $4 billion, and News Corporation's shares ought to be worth about $60 billion. The market values them about a third lower than that. For shareholders, that's the downside of Mr. Murdoch's clout writ large.
Time's Up, Berlusconi
Silvio Berlusconi's time is up. It's no longer about abuse of power and ''bunga bunga'' sex parties. His continuation as Italy's prime minister could drive the country into a financial death spiral. His own supporters are shaken and the Italian public is afraid. But the left-wing opposition is behaving responsibly, so there's some hope.
Italy has pulled back from the brink -- slightly. After nudging above 6 percent early on Tuesday, the yield on 10-year government bonds has fallen back to a still uncomfortable 5.6 percent. That's partly because the opposition agreed to a fast-track parliamentary vote on the government's new austerity program, so it should pass by the end of the week.
But this is not enough. Mr. Berlusconi is in virtual open warfare with Giulio Tremonti, his finance minister. The idea that this dysfunctional government could serve its term until 2013 is troubling. Italy could lurch from minicrisis to minicrisis with the borrowing cost on its debt, currently totaling 120 percent of gross domestic product, ratcheting ever higher.
As the world's eighth-largest economy, Italy is too big to bail out. But it is rich and can be rescued by its people. In the past, they have been too complacent about their country's political and economic mess. The recent scare may help concentrate minds about the need to make some medium-size sacrifices now.
As for Mr. Berlusconi, he is unlikely to fall on his sword. So members of his own right-wing coalition, which has a thin majority, would have to push him out. They might just do that if market jitters continue.
Then, of course, there's a question of whether any replacement for Mr. Berlusconi would be better. There are broadly two options: a grand coalition led by a technocrat like Mario Monti, the former European commissioner, or early elections. The first might secure some short-term stability. But such a government wouldn't have a mandate to push through the needed big reforms. For that, new elections would be required.
Elections in the heat of the euro zone crisis would be risky and might bring no clear winner. But Italy will have to confront its political problems at some point -- and sooner is better than later.

HEADLINE: If Indian Point Closes, Plenty of Challenges

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Peculiarities of the electricity system in New York State, including its unusual independent status, would make it difficult and expensive to replace electricity from the Indian Point nuclear power plant if Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo succeeds in shutting it down, experts on the grid warn.
Closing the plant could also increase the frequency of power failures, officials who run the state's high-voltage grid say, given that New York has weak ties to generation capacity in other states.
Citing safety concerns, Mr. Cuomo warned Indian Point's owner, Entergy, last month that he would insist that the plant's two reactors in Westchester County be retired in 2013 and 2015, when their initial 40-year licenses expire. He maintains that some combination of new generators and new transmission lines could be ready in time to cope with summer 2016, the first peak demand period that power-hungry New York City and Long Island would face without both reactors.
But industry experts are skeptical that new generators or transmission lines could be built that quickly in the New York metropolitan region's cumbersome regulatory environment. Obtaining construction permits, countering legal challenges and then building a plant or transmission line almost always takes more than five years, they note. 
While a downstate coal or natural gas plant could step up production once Indian Point closed, that electricity could prove far more expensive, industry analysts say. And a lighting strike or other event that knocks out a transmission line -- a problem that the system can usually ride through today -- could lead to rotating blackouts, they add.
''The answer is pretty simple: prices will be higher and reliability will be lower,'' said Edward Kee, vice president of the firm NERA Economic Consulting.
Up to 2.1 million customers in southern New York would be vulnerable to power interruptions from 2016 to 2020 if Indian Point shut down, Rick Gonzales, chief operating officer of the New York Independent System Operator, or I.S.O., told a State Senate committee in May.
Officials at the I.S.O., which runs the state's grid, estimate that Westchester and New York's five boroughs will use about 64,500 gigawatt-hours this year. Indian Point will generate about a quarter of that, or 16,000 gigawatt-hours.
If both Indian Point reactors were to close, wholesale electricity prices would rise about 12 percent, or $1.4 billion a year, according to a projection from Consolidated Edison, which serves more than three million customers in New York City and part of Westchester.
In New York's daily energy auctions, the I.S.O. prices electricity by matching offering bids from suppliers against the amount of energy that utilities say they need to serve their customers. Nuclear plants always submit relatively low offers because their costs are the same whether they are running or not, and they want to be assured of having a market.
If Indian Point closes, the list of successful bidders will eventually include more plants fired by coal or natural gas. Their operating costs are higher and they will therefore bid higher, analysts say. And in a quirk of New York's system, every supplier is paid at the price of the most expensive megawatt-hour needed to satisfy the region's demand, which will magnify the rise in prices.
The price impact would be smaller if the state added some low-cost generation or transmission. So far, Mr. Cuomo has not been specific about where substitute power would come from, but aides say proposals are certain to emerge, now that he has taken a hard line on closing Indian Point.
''We recognize the window is relatively short,'' said an aide, referring to the time it takes to build plants and transmission capacity. The aide spoke on the condition of anonymity because the policy has not been made final.
Some experts on New York's electricity system suggest that existing transmission lines could be rebuilt to operate at higher voltage and thus provide more capacity. A proposal for a new line running from Quebec to New York City under Lake Champlain and the Hudson River is inching forward, for example, and sponsors say it could be completed by 2015.
Ashok Gupta, an energy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, has suggested that some generators in northeastern Queens that run on natural gas could be replaced by newer ones that get more power out of a given amount of fuel. Such steps should be taken regardless of Indian Point's fate, he and others contend.
''Everything we're saying should be done if Indian Point should be shut down -- should be done anyway,'' he said, referring to proposals for cleaner and more efficient technology and new transmission lines.
The challenges facing electricity suppliers in New York are rooted partly in the way the system is administered. While New York City is in a densely populated region, it is only loosely tied to power generators in neighboring states. The city is served mainly by five big transmission lines that run from upstate New York, squeezing through the narrow stretch where Westchester is corseted by New Jersey and Connecticut to deliver a mix of power from energy sources in Quebec, Ontario and upstate.
By contrast, the six New England states have been integrated for decades into a single system, which gives each far more flexibility in balancing supply and demand in peak periods. From New Jersey southward, PJM Interconnection -- the letters once stood for Pennsylvania, Jersey and Maryland -- manages supply and demand for all or part of 13 states and the District of Columbia.
Even in New York State, connections are weak, further limiting options. ''New York's grid is a patchwork,'' said Mr. Gonzales of the I.S.O., which keeps a round-the-clock watch on how heavily the state's power lines are loaded. The agency divides the state into 11 zones mimicking the former territories of utilities, and it prices electricity separately in each one because of the weak way they are interconnected.
As a result, some parts of the system are highly congested, and power in those places can sell for double what it does in better-connected areas with strong generation like northern New York. In a region that stretches from south of Albany down through Dutchess, Ulster, Orange, Rockland and Westchester Counties, the five boroughs and Long Island, prices are sometimes double what they are in upstate or western New York.
Sometimes wind turbines upstate generate electricity for which there is no local market, but the energy cannot be delivered to the New York area because of congestion on the grid. Wind power could one day help replace Indian Point, experts say, but not without more transmission capacity.
Yet construction of new lines or new plants tends to stir enormous opposition, industry experts say. Paul Steidler, a spokesman for an energy lobbying group largely financed by Indian Point's owner, pointed to NYRI, a proposed 190-mile high-voltage link between upstate and downstate that was shelved in 2009 after major objections from people in areas it would pass through.
''Based on the NYRI experience, I do not think it is possible to underestimate the amount of opposition that the Champlain line will face,'' Mr. Steidler said. ''We shouldn't count on it until it is up and running and all the lawsuits are resolved.''
Power plant construction in the New York City area faces yet another hurdle: because the air already violates the smog standard, for each ton of nitrogen oxides that any new power plant would emit, the Environmental Protection Agency requires the builder to cut output of that pollutant from another source by 1.3 tons. That means a developer wanting to build a new plant has to find another plant to clean up.
Closing the Indian Point reactors would, however, hardly be gloom and doom for everyone. Any company that runs a generator in downstate New York ends up selling its output at a higher price, and would share in the $1.4 billion a year that Con Edison says its customers will pay if the nuclear plant closes.

HEADLINE: Pact on Adoptions Ends A U.S.-Russian Dispute

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- More than a year after an adopted-child abandonment scandal led Russian officials to threaten a ban on adoptions of Russian children by Americans, the United States and Russia have reached an agreement that will allow such adoptions to proceed under heightened scrutiny.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and her Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergei V. Lavrov, signed the accord at a ceremony in Washington on Wednesday, and officials from both sides expressed hope that it would end the animosity and suspicion that had plagued the adoption issue for years. 
''We take very seriously the safety and security of children that are adopted by American parents, and this agreement provides new important safeguards to protect them,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''It also increases transparency for all parties involved in the adoption process.''
Russian officials have long demanded greater oversight of American adoptions.
Russia is one of the largest sources of adopted foreign children in the United States, with more than 50,000 adopted by American families since 1991. While the vast majority have been successful, both sides have acknowledged some cases in which adopted children died from abuse in American homes.
The issue reached a crisis in April 2010, when a 7-year-old boy named Artyom arrived alone at a Moscow airport on a commercial jetliner from the United States. He had been sent back from Tennessee by his adoptive mother, who said she could not handle what she described in a note she sent with him as his severe emotional problems.
The Russian government threatened to halt adoptions, and although it never did, adoption agencies said their work was significantly slowed amid heightened scrutiny by officials.
''After every one of these incidents the screws tighten a little further,'' said Marina V. Amirkhanova, the Russian representative of Home Studies and Adoption Placement Services, an American adoption agency.
From a peak of 5,862 in 2004, adoptions of Russian children by Americans fell to 1,079 last year, according to State Department statistics.
The new agreement will give the Russian government the authority to approve which adoption agencies operate in the country, and will provide mechanisms for improving the monitoring of families after adoptions, the State Department said in a statement. Prospective parents will now be screened more thoroughly and be better informed about children's medical histories and upbringing.
Mr. Lavrov suggested that Russian negotiators had encountered difficulties with American adoption laws, which differ from state to state; in Russia, adoption is federally regulated. He did not discuss points of disagreement, but the government-run Ria Novosti news agency said that laws in some states granting same-sex couples the right to adopt were a particular sticking point. Russian officials insisted that same-sex couples not be allowed to adopt Russian children.
The Russian Parliament must ratify the agreement, and is expected to do so.
Despite the agreement, the issue of international adoption will continue to be contentious here in Russia, experts said. Many Russians find it difficult to acknowledge that their country can no longer take care of all its children.
Social upheaval and economic travails in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse have disrupted Russian families, leaving the country with more orphans now than at the end of World War II, officials say.
Thousands languish in Russian orphanages. While many of these institutions have improved markedly in recent years, most of their inhabitants remain trapped in them. Few Russian families are willing to adopt, and large government subsidies to orphanages keep the system entrenched.
Adoption by foreigners, particularly Americans, has been like a ''giant rescue operation,'' said Boris L. Altshuler, director of Children's Rights, an advocacy group in Moscow.
''I am very happy that this was signed,'' Mr. Altshuler said, referring to the adoption accord. ''For children who remain in Russian orphanages because of the difficulties of international adoption, this has been a calamity -- it is a crime committed by us all.''

HEADLINE: Amid Minnesota Crisis, Pawlenty Faces Scrutiny

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
On the presidential campaign trail, Tim Pawlenty, who in January completed two terms as governor of Minnesota, runs largely as an implacable foe of government spending, saying he drew ''a line in the sand'' in his home state and stood tough against Democrats during a government shutdown in 2005.
Now, with Minnesota struggling through Week 2 of another government shutdown over a budget shortfall, Mr. Pawlenty's fiscal record as governor is drawing closer scrutiny. And while Mr. Pawlenty did face economic and political challenges in balancing the state's budget each year, his record includes what critics say was an overreliance on one-time accounting maneuvers that failed to address the underlying problems.
The current shutdown, with interstate truckers barred from rest stops and 22,000 state workers placed on furlough, is over how to close a $5 billion deficit that the state finance department says is largely the result of holes left by Mr. Pawlenty's final budget. 
Minnesota's bond rating was downgraded last week by the national firm Fitch Ratings, which cited the current shutdown as well as ''nonrecurring balancing tools'' in earlier years that have left the state on shaky financial ground.
''That's the classic definition of how you kick the can into the future,'' said Arne Carlson, a former Republican governor of Minnesota who is a critic of Mr. Pawlenty's fiscal management. ''He basically reduced the weight in Pocket A and increased the weight in Pocket B, and said, 'Look at what a great job I did.' This was all sleight of hand.''
Mr. Pawlenty pushed back aggressively on the suggestion that he bore any responsibility for the current crisis, in which his Democratic successor, Gov. Mark Dayton, is deadlocked with Republican majorities in the Legislature. ''Everybody is responsible for the budgets on their watch,'' Mr. Pawlenty said in an interview. ''I've been gone for six months, and the last budget on my watch is in the black.''
Dismissing the budget projections showing a large shortfall, he said, for example, that about $2 billion could be trimmed by continuing to delay state aid to public schools into the future, which Democrats have agreed to.
Many other states used one-time accounting maneuvers to balance their budgets during the recessions of the last decade. In addition to delaying money owed to schools, Minnesota under Mr. Pawlenty balanced its books by using money from a tobacco industry settlement meant for health care and $2.3 billion from the federal stimulus.
''They were like drowning sailors looking for stopgap measures, hoping the economy would rebound and revenue would increase,'' said Lawrence R. Jacobs, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota.
Mr. Pawlenty points to having significantly reduced the growth rate of state spending as governor for the first time in Minnesota history and balancing budgets without new taxes.
But though he largely held the line on increasing state taxes, residential property taxes soared by 38.2 percent during the Pawlenty years, as cities and towns sought to maintain services like police forces and schools, according to Minnesota 2020, a progressive research group.
Mr. Pawlenty is hardly alone among presidential aspirants in having a record as governor that complicates his efforts to advance a clear-cut image. Mitt Romney is shadowed by the health care plan he signed in Massachusetts. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. may come under scrutiny by conservatives for advancing civil unions for same-sex couples in Utah.
Mr. Pawlenty inherited a deficit in 2003, his first year in office, and his attempts to balance budgets while fulfilling a no-new-taxes pledge were checked by Democratic or split Legislatures, which accused him of undermining schools and social services.
''I love my state, it's a beautiful state, but it's a very liberal place,'' he said. ''That's the tradition I was trying to break. We didn't finish it, but I moved it in the right direction.''
In many ways Mr. Pawlenty's final budget, in which he outflanked the Democratic Legislature, was his signature moment.
Minnesota enacts budgets on two-year cycles. In the spring of 2009, Mr. Pawlenty signed every spending bill that Democratic lawmakers sent him, surprising opponents.
''As this thing progresses, he's going to outmaneuver us,'' Dick Cohen, a Democratic state senator, recalled thinking at the time.
Mr. Pawlenty then vetoed the Democrats' revenue bill to pay for the programs, including a tax increase primarily on the wealthy. Next, after the Legislature adjourned, he invoked emergency powers to balance the budget by making $2.7 billion in unilateral cuts, including from the University of Minnesota and health care programs. ''He outfoxed them,'' said Patrick Garofalo, a Republican member of the state House of Representatives.
Tom Hanson, Mr. Pawlenty's budget commissioner at the time, said the strategy highlighted his boldness. ''He's not afraid to battle for something, even with an uncertain outcome,'' he said.
But in May 2010, the State Supreme Court ruled that his unilateral cuts violated the State Constitution.
''It feels like the last eight years we've been in constant crisis management,'' said Tom Bakk, the minority leader of the State Senate, who squared off against Mr. Pawlenty on many budget issues.
Mr. Bakk pointed to the government shutdown in 2005, a confrontation that Mr. Pawlenty is invoking on the campaign trail as an example of his toughness. A television advertisement in Iowa bluntly concludes, ''Pawlenty won.''
But at the time Mr. Pawlenty described the resolution of the shutdown more generously, in terms that may be out of fashion now: ''It was a true bipartisan compromise,'' he said. Largely a dispute over health care costs, the nine-day shutdown ended when Democrats abandoned a plan to tax the wealthy and accepted Mr. Pawlenty's proposal to add 75 cents to a pack of cigarettes. The governor labeled it a ''health improvement fee,'' but he was blasted by antitax activists, who said it was a tax increase.
''There is no way to put lipstick on that tax-increase pig,'' Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, an influential antitax group, said at the time. ''No. You cannot do that. This will not fly.''
Mr. Pawlenty never again agreed to increase state revenues in a way that could be interpreted as adding taxes. This included vetoing a transportation bill financed by a gasoline tax that even the pro-business Minnesota Chamber of Commerce favored.
Mr. Bakk, a member of the Senate tax committee, said that when he tried in later years to convince Mr. Pawlenty to accept tax increases, the governor would bring up the health improvement fee, which he called the ''HIF.''
''It was that personal to him that he gave it an acronym,'' Mr. Bakk said. ''He said to me in his office he'd paid quite a price with the real fiscal conservatives.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 15, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the fiscal record of the presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty, a former governor of Minnesota, misidentified the branch of the state Legislature in which a lawmaker, Patrick Garofalo, serves. Mr. Garofalo, who said Mr. Pawlenty had outfoxed Democrats in 2009 in maneuvering over the state budget, is a member of the state House of Representatives, not a state senator.

HEADLINE: Searching for the Wives of Wall Street

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Fans of "Real Housewives," "Mob Wives" and "Basketball Wives" may soon be programming their TiVos for another set of larger-than-life spouses: the wives of Wall Street. 

 BODY:
Fans of "Real Housewives," "Mob Wives" and "Basketball Wives" may soon be programming their TiVos for another set of larger-than-life spouses: the wives of Wall Street.
A casting call notice went out on Wednesday for "Wall $treet Wives," a new reality show (or "docu-series," in the patois of Hollywood) that is looking to fill out an ensemble cast of four or five women. Qualified applicants, the notice said, would have "a fun and attractive personality," and would either be married or formerly married to a man working in an "'investments oriented" position on Wall Street.
 "Wall $treet Wives," which has not yet secured a network deal, is the brainchild of Devon Fleming, a Connecticut-based author and lifestyle guru, and her friend and co-producer, Sammi Mendenhall. Ms. Fleming and Ms. Mendenhall first pitched the show in 2007, using Ms. Fleming, who is married to a Deutsche Bank wealth manager, as a central character. But networks had a different vision.
"They all wanted this ugly cat-fight scenario," Ms. Fleming said in a telephone interview.
Now, Ms. Mendenhall said, they are again trying to identify women who have "fabulous lives," live in the greater New York area and are willing to let TV cameras invade their homes. But mere trophy wives need not apply.
"These are not idiots. These are the intelligent women who hold it down," Ms. Mendenhall said of her ideal candidates. "Some of them have M.B.A.'s!"
A Wall Street reality show has precedent. The Mojo HD cable network aired two seasons of "Wall Street Warriors," which followed the lives of several finance professionals, and Bravo is developing "The Women of Wall Street," which tells the story of "five predictably beautiful, ambitious and successful women who make millions by day and swap stories over martinis by night," according to The Hollywood Reporter.
But Ms. Fleming and Ms. Mendenhall said their show would differentiate itself by focusing on the women behind the men of Wall Street, some of whom were victims of the recent financial crisis. The topic was explored in a 2009 essay in Portfolio titled "Confessions of a TARP Wife," whose anonymous author was later revealed to be Elizabeth Peek, the wife of former CIT Group chief executive, Jeffrey M. Peek. But it has never been brought to the small screen.
"These women have a lot to tell," Ms. Fleming said. "They've been through a very bumpy ride."
Ms. Mendenhall, who has done casting for reality shows including the History Channel's "Food Tech" and MTV's "16 and Pregnant," called "Wall $treet Wives" a "tough casting," since many financiers are less than thrilled about exposing their families to the spotlight.
And Ms. Mendenhall added that while she tried to protect her cast members, she bore no responsibility for the fates of the marriages depicted on the show. One of the married Wall Street couples originally cast for the 2007 pitch, she noted, had since gotten divorced.
"The market is volatile," she said. "And so are the marriages."

HEADLINE: Anarchists and Tasseled Loafers

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The debt-ceiling debate suggests that a wing of the G.O.P. is willing to flirt with chaos. 

 BODY:
Amid shattered glass and the black smoke of urban pyres, I found myself in a riot some years ago - the anarchists-led assault on the World Trade Organization meetings of 1999. At the height of what became known as The Battle of Seattle, I bumped into an otherwise mild-mannered, libertarian-leaning friend on the streets, gasping at the bitter taste of tear gas. He was ecstatic.
"Isn't it great?" he shouted. "The established order is coming down!"
Turns out, only Nike Town, the Gap and a few other outposts of global capitalism were coming down, and just for a day or so. But the nihilistic spirit of those window-smashers, whose goal was to bring chaos to a city of passive refinements, seems to have found a home: in the Republican Party.Who would put at risk, at a time when most people are hurting from a gasping economy, the monthly issuance of life-supporting funds for wounded veterans, disabled children, countless elderly couples living on barely $2,000 a month - all told, over 70 million checks that go out each month?
Who would risk pushing the livelihoods of businesses small and big off a cliff by an interest rate spike, possibly igniting a second recession as the credit-rating agencies have just suggested - essentially saying "blow your brains out, America," as Warren Buffett phrased it?
Who would risk this anarchists' storm, rather than a pass a formality: extending the borrowing authority of the United States so the country can pay bills from the past? Certainly, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, cannot find anyone so reckless in Washington. "Nobody is talking about not raising the debt ceiling," he said last Sunday. "I haven't heard that from anybody."
Either he's deaf to the roar on his right or he's speaking exclusively to that diminishing other wing of his party, the Tasseled Loafers. Not only is Michele Bachmann, a leading Republican presidential candidate, saying a government default is nothing to worry about, but a core group of 59 House Republicans have indicated they will not raise the debt ceiling under any circumstances, according to House Speaker John Boehner. 
That's right: no matter how much President Obama gives them - from curbing entitlements to cuts in excess of $3 trillion - this cadre of radical Republicans is taking the burn-it-all-down position. They don't want to see the terms of a deal because there is no deal they will accept. That's their stated position. 
With this step, what the chaos caucus has proven is that they have no interest in governing. They didn't go to Washington to find solutions; they went there to destroy the place. 
Based on Boehner's math, the anarchists make up perhaps 25 percent of the G.O.P. House. At the other end of party control are the moneyed interests who've long bankrolled Republicans. They're happy, of course, that their favored politicians are willing to go to the brink of catastrophe to keep even the most egregious tax loopholes from being closed. But now they're getting scared, as the anarchist wing indicates it is serious about bringing the whole government down - and with it a lot of private money. 
Symbolic of the Tasseled Loafers' hold on power was that dinner of Rep. Paul Ryan last week, in which the House budget-writer shared a pair of $350 bottles of wine with a hedge fund manager and a free-market economist. When the story broke, he was embarrassed enough to issue a copy of his credit card receipt showing he paid for at least one of the bottles of 2004 Echezeaux grand cru Burgundy himself, and was not simply being courted in violation of lobbying rules. (If he'd bought American, and had been as frugal with his money as he wants the country to be, Ryan could have drunk superb Oregon pinot noir for a fraction of the French grape's price.)
I don't care how rich guys spend their money, or even if a congressman pays as much for a single bottle of wine as some fellow Americans get for their weekly unemployment checks. Ryan is the architect of a budget that gives even more tax breaks for the corporate elite while making the elderly pay for diminished Medicare with coupons. Nobody should be surprised when he drinks $350 wine with people who want continue the policies of economic inequality.
But the dinner is instructive as a picture of power. Throughout these debt ceiling negotiations, I've been waiting for the Republicans' corporate overlords to jerk their chain. And finally, a few days ago, the Business Roundtable, in a letter signed by more than 350 C.E.O.'s, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued a dire warning - the game of chicken is up. They said what others who have a large stake in this economy have said: that default could cause a multi-billion dollar crash, affecting everything from auto loans to credit-card debt.
And so, in response to the Tasseled Loafers' concern, McConnell tried again, saying, "We think it's extremely important that the country reassure the markets that default is not an option."
Note who is getting the reassurance from the Senate Republican leader. But it may be too late. The loafers may want to retreat to their wine cellars until this thing blows over. A renegade wing of their party is lighting fires and throwing rocks (metaphorically, of course!). Once they got a taste of smoke in their nostrils, the anarchists realized they could smash the place up, maybe even burn it down, and no one would stop them. After Aug. 2, the default deadline, the smell will go bad, quickly.

HEADLINE: Out of Poverty, Family-Styl

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: An initiative that brings struggling families together to help each other out of poverty is providing a new model for social welfare. 

 BODY:
Shortly after Candace Keshwar immigrated from Trinidad to Boston in 2002, her life took a difficult turn. Her dream had been to go to college and have a career where she could help others. But her first daughter was born with cerebral palsy and Keshwar spent the next seven years caring for her at home. She grew isolated. Her husband worked in construction, but jobs were sporadic, and the family relied on government assistance. "It was a real dark space for me," Keshwar said. "I kept thinking, 'This cannot be my life. I know I have the potential to do so much more.'"
A turning point came when Keshwar was asked to join a group of families who had self-organized as part of an initiative that helps people in low-income communities achieve their goals. Called the Family Independence Initiative (FII), its approach is radically different from the American social service model. Although it is still quite small - working with a few hundred families - its results are so striking that the White House has taken notice. What FII does is create a structure for families that encourages the sense of control, desire for self-determination, and mutual support that have characterized the collective rise out of poverty for countless communities in American history.FII is not a "program" in a traditional sense. It doesn't seek to implement changes, but to elicit them from others. It was launched as a research project by Maurice Lim Miller in Oakland in 2001. Lim Miller, whose mother was an immigrant from Mexico who worked multiple jobs to support her children, had previously spent 22 years building Asian Neighborhood Design, a youth development and job training program, for which he was honored by President Clinton during the 1999 State of the Union address.
Lim Miller had come to believe that the American social welfare system focused too much on poor people's needs and deficits, while overlooking - and even inhibiting - their strengths. A safety net is crucial when people are in crisis, he said. But most poor families are not in free fall. They don't need nets to catch them so much as they need springboards to jump higher. In a conversation with Oakland's mayor Jerry Brown (now California's governor), Brown challenged Lim Miller to try something different and gave him broad scope to be creative.
Lim Miller wanted to see what families would do if they came together in a context that supported their initiative. He began by identifying families in low-income communities who were surviving, but who had "given up hope" of aspiring to more. He asked them to pull together six to eight other families. He offered them a challenge. The country had been waging a war on poverty for 40 years, he said, but the problem remained unsolved. "What we're going to do is give you some resources and connections and we're going to trust that you'll do something," he said. "You guys are in the power position. If you do nothing we'll fail. If you do something we'll all learn."
They started with 25 families in three cohorts - eight African American families, six Salvadoran refugee families and 11 Iu Mien families from Laos. The latter were all on welfare. FII asked them to write down their goals, gave each a computer and enlisted them to fill in a questionnaire each month that tracked changes in things like income, assets, debts, health, education, skills, social networks and civic engagement.
They offered families $30 for every success they reported up to a maximum of $200 per month. (FII pays for reporting, not for specific actions, a different anti-poverty approach known as "conditional cash transfers" that we have reported on in Fixes.) Lim Miller reasoned that if he were to hire a consultant to collect this data, it would cost three or four times more. The families agreed to meet with an FII liaison every three months for an audit. Anything they reported - a pay increase, a doctor visit, an improvement in a child's grades - had to be documented.
Most important, families had to agree to meet as a group at least once a month in a confidential setting to discuss their goals and any issues they deemed important. FII didn't guide the agenda and its liaisons did not act as facilitators. They established the structure and backed off, creating a vacuum for families to take the lead. Lim Miller gave his staff strict instructions that they could not offer any advice - not even friendly suggestions. For some, this proved too difficult; he had to fire people who couldn't help but be helpful. Lim Miller was convinced that the assumption of incapacity behind the helpfulness was a big part of the problem.
"When you come into a community that is vulnerable with professionals with power and preset ideas, it is overpowering to families and it can hold them back," he said. "Nobody wants to hear that because we're all the good guys. But the focus on need undermines our ability to see their strengths - and their ability to see their own strengths."
At first, families waited for direction from FII. Some grew frustrated. But soon people began sharing their goals, publicly declaring things like: "I need to get out of debt." "I need to spend more time with my kids." "I need to stop smoking." "I need to get my G.E.D." Group members offered encouragement, as well as advice and contacts. In follow up meetings, people would talk about steps they had taken. The group members would hold one another to account: "Didn't you say you were going to get your G.E.D.? Where are you with that?"
One Salvadoran couple, Jorge and Maria Elena, decided to borrow money from friends and take out a mortgage to purchase a home. It was a predatory loan - and when it became clear that they were in danger of losing the home, friends helped them renovate it and fix up the yard so they could refinance at better terms. Today, the couple are still in the home. Shortly after, other group members - who had historically sent extra money to El Salvador - began saving here, believing that home ownership might be a possibility for them in America. "That's when we saw how strong the ripple effect was," recalled Lim Miller.
Of the initial 25 families, FII found that, after two years, household incomes had increased 27 percent (excluding the payments offered by FII). People got promotions, pay raises, worked extra hours, and built up informal side businesses. After FII's payments stopped, incomes continued to increase. After another year, they were 40 percent higher than the baseline. "Nobody believed it," Lim Miller recalled. "The stereotype is that they can't do it. People said, 'You have to be creaming [picking the easiest people to help].' They can't believe that this capacity exists and that it can be brought forth."
He extended the work to Hawaii and San Francisco. After two years, FII reported that incomes across all its sites had increased, on average, by 23 percent and savings were up 240 percent. In San Francisco, 30 percent of families established side businesses - everything from lawn maintenance to making pupusas to cutting people's hair - to cope with the recession. A quarter of the families that had been receiving government income or housing subsidies - CalWorks or Section 8 - dropped them. Families reported improvements in health care, children's grades, reductions in debt, enrollment in training programs and home ownership - all audited. Word rippled outward and within six months, 200 families applied to join FII. "Something viral had happened," explained Mia Birdsong, FII's vice president. "We still trying to track how it spread. We think it has to do with the trust factor."
Last year, FII started working in Boston. Within six months, family incomes were up by 13 percent. At her first meeting, Candace Keshwar saw new possibilities for her life. "There were a bunch of people who had stories that were very similar to mine in terms of the struggles," she said. "But I saw that people were still managing some accomplishments. One girl went to college with her babies. The stories made me realize that I could go after some of the things that I wanted."
Keshwar's goals were to get a job, buy a car that could accommodate her daughter's wheelchair, enroll in college and buy a home. She found that tracking her progress was helpful in this process. "When you actually see on paper what you've done, it allows you to think further," she said. The networking was also critical. One of her group members helped her re-write her resume. Another arranged an appointment with a friend who offered credit counseling. "It's much better than having to call an office and get the runaround," she said.
Today, Keshwar works as a family partner at Boston Health Care for the Homeless, owns a 2007 Pathfinder, has enrolled in Springfield College and is building a credit history. She is working toward a degree in human services with a concentration in mental health counseling and also plans to pursue a nursing degree. She has also encouraged her husband to get his contractor's license.
Lim Miller is clear that FII is not trying to lend comfort to people who want to dismantle the social service system. He wants to fix it: to make it more about incentives. Today, 85 percent of the $400 billion that the government spends to encourage things like home ownership, college attendance, investment and small business ends up in the pockets of the top 20 percent of earners (and half goes to the top 5 percent). Very little ends up helping the working poor. On the other hand, many social benefits cut off when a family's income rises roughly 30 percent above the poverty line - which is still a far cry from being out of poverty.
For the middle class, resources are linked to initiative; for the poor, they are linked to problems. "We're not advocating for this gravity defying 'pull yourself up by your bootstraps idea,'" adds Birdsong. "We're saying: invest in families when they take initiative. We need to take what works for middle and upper income families and extend it to the whole income spectrum."
FII's budget is only $2.5 million. It is still to be seen if its approach will work with much larger numbers of families. But its experience with a few hundred reveals ways that social services could work better. Lim Miller offers three suggestions as a starter: 1) Where possible, replace case managers with peer families who have succeeded; 2) Make it easier for small scale entrepreneurs to start businesses and raise capital; 3) Solicit regular feedback from the clients. "These families have opinions about what works and what doesn't work," he explains. "Our system would work better if it responded to their feedback. And it would be very empowering to them if they knew their voices were heard."
On Wednesday, I'll respond to comments, explain how FII's work draws on the idea of "positive deviance," and explain how the organization plans to expand its reach by tapping the leadership that has emerged within the families in its network.

HEADLINE: Walkout Sours Global Whaling Conference

BYLINE: DAVID JOLLY


HIGHLIGHT: Joined by allies, Japan, Norway and Iceland leave a whaling conference when countries try to call a vote on creating a whale sanctuary. Usually such decisions are made by consensus. 

 BODY:
A meeting of the International Whaling Commission ended in disarray on Thursday when Japan and its allies used the most basic of procedural maneuvers to kill a proposal to protect whales in the southern Atlantic: they walked out.
The turmoil at the gathering, the commission's 63rd annual conference which began Monday on the Channel Island of Jersey, at one point left observers wondering if the strains on the organization had left it dysfunctional, making compromise between the pro- and anti-whaling camps impossible.
Brazil and Argentina had proposed the creation of a Southern Atlantic Whale Sanctuary, a vast expanse of ocean in which commercial whaling would be prohibited. Predictably, Japan, Norway and Iceland, the three nations that continue the practice, strongly opposed the measure. 
When Brazil suggested that the measure come to a vote -- a no-no in an organization that tries to operate by consensus -- delegates from the pro-whaling nations, joined by representatives of some African and Caribbean countries, decamped.The remaining delegates were left scratching their heads. Did they have the necessary quorum to vote without the pro-whaling nations present? Would doing so lead to the collapse of the organization?
So commissioners from all the 89 I.W.C. member nations retired behind closed doors for hours of intense discussion, emerging late Thursday evening to announce -- you guessed it -- the creation of a committee to study the question of what constitutes a quorum. The issue of the whale sanctuary was put off until next summer, when the commission meets in Panama.
"We've never been this badly deadlocked before, and I'm afraid that doesn't bode well," Monica Medina, the head of the United States delegation, said by telephone. Without greater cooperation among nations, she said, "we'll fail the whales."
A resolution more palatable to the commercial whaling nations might have been found if there had been more time, Ms. Medina said. But she acknowledged the destabilizing fault lines in the organization, saying: "Conservation countries will never agree to permit commercial and lethal scientific whaling, in my view.'' 
While environmentalists were disappointed with the outcome of the sanctuary proposal, some saw a silver lining. 
"We may be seeing some of the final death throes of the commercial whaling industry," Patrick Ramage, whale program manager at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said. "They're using any tactic they can to frustrate progress at the I.W.C."
Whales are threatened by much more than their value to humans as food. Pollution, sonar weaponry and ship strikes make the oceans less hospitable. Overfishing depletes their food supply and destabilizes the marine food chain, while global warming can harm fragile ecosystems on which the mammals depend for food. Offshore oil and gas exploration and development are increasingly endangering critical habitats.
None of those issues were discussed, though they were on the agenda, because the confusion over the sanctuary proposal consumed most of the final day of the meeting.
"We're absolutely devastated," Wendy Elliott, head of the W.W.F.'s delegation to the meeting, said. "The most important threats to the whales were dropped from the agenda because of the acrimony over the sanctuary."
Japan and the other whaling countries don't even have whaling operations in the South Atlantic, she said, "so it's mystifying as to why they oppose it."
The idea of whale sanctuaries is not new. There are already sanctuaries in the Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean, around Antarctica. Japan gets around the Southern Ocean commercial whaling ban by killing whales for "scientific research." The meat of those whales is then sold to consumers and in school lunches. 
In the language of the commission, those in the pro-whaling camp are called the "sustainable whaling countries." The other members who walked out, along with Japan, Norway and Iceland, were South Korea, Cambodia, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Gambia, St. Kitts and Nevis, Nauru, Mongolia, Mauritania, Guinea Bissau, Grenada, Kiribati, Morocco, Ghana, Palau, Togo, Tuvalu, Antigua and St. Lucia.
The United States and most of the 27 members of the European Union supported the South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary plan.
While Japan has long been the most visible and vocal supporter of whale hunting, the United States has itself come under increasing criticism from the Latin American nations known as the Buenos Aires Group over its support for aboriginal subsistence whaling by native Alaskans, which some see as a fig leaf for maintaining the status quo for whaling nations. 
The defense of native Alaskan rights leaves the United States vulnerable to political pressure because, like the other countries pursuing aboriginal subsistence whaling, it must seek approval from three-quarters of the I.W.C. members every five years. The next time it must do so will be in 2012 in Panama.
In a tit-for-tat move, Japan and its pro-whaling allies denied the United States quota request at the 2002 I.W.C. conference in Shimonoseki, Japan, prompting a subsequent special meeting to secure the aboriginal quota.
But Washington has long sought to protect whales on the international stage, Mr. Ramage said.
"A clear-eyed examination of the U.S. effort, whether inside or outside the I.W.C.," shows "a consistent and clear commitment to whale conservation over many decades," he said. "The reality for the whales in the water and in this commission is much better with the United States in a position of leadership. That said, the U.S. delegation is more focused on aboriginal subsistence whaling than any of the other issues in the forum."
The meeting did yield one positive development: For years, some of the smaller nations in the commission, who must be up to date on their dues to vote, have been paying in cash at the meetings, a mode of operating that is hardly suited to the 21st century of instant money transfers. That has led to persistent allegations of corruption and vote-buying by pro-whaling nations. 
Last year, in a sting captured on video, The Sunday Times of London showed a Guinean official bargaining with a supposed I.W.C. vote-buyer. 
In response, a measure sponsored by European nations was adopted on Wednesday that will require dues to be paid by bank transfer from government accounts, increasing transparency.
Mr. Ramage saw a certain paradox in that. "Yesterday they were congratulating themselves for passing a resolution requiring greater transparency," he said of the commissioners. "They spent the whole time today in discussion behind closed doors."

HEADLINE: Sluggish Market Stalls Funds That Thrive on Direction

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: Managed futures funds, which have found success in the financial crisis by betting on the ups and downs of everyone else, have finally hit their own slump. 

 BODY:
Managed futures funds, which bet on the ups and downs of stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, have been crowing for years about their performance during the financial crisis.
Now, some managers are eating crow.
 The portfolios, also known as commodity trading advisers, are down 1.5 percent on average so far in 2011, in contrast to a modest 1 percent gain for the average hedge fund. Several prominent managers like the Man Group and AQR Capital Management are faring worse. The performance of Altis Partners, which manages about $1.4 billion in assets, is off by more than 20 percent.
The weak returns offer a cautionary tale for investors chasing profits based on past performance. 
With the markets in free fall in 2008, the typical managed futures fund returned 14 percent, versus an 18 percent loss for hedge funds. After that, investors poured tens of billions of dollars into futures-based strategies. 
But the portfolios produced unremarkable returns in the years that followed the financial collapse, and they're off to a rough start in 2011, owing to the stagnant market. 
"These funds are supposed to be trend-following," said Brad H. Alford, chief investment officer of Alpha Capital Management. "How can they all lose money at once?"
The funds, for their part, say they have always been volatile investments that pay out over the long term. Futures-based strategies have produced annualized returns of 11.41 percent since 1980, according to BarclayHedge, the research firm.
"We don't give investors a smooth ride," said Natasha Reeve-Gray, a partner at Altis.
"It's not about working within a couple of months but within a couple of years," she said. "We look at things on a three-to-five-year time frame."
Typically, these managers do best when stocks, bonds, commodities or currencies are moving up or down. If a particular market is falling, managed futures traders, especially those using trend-following computer models, bet on the downward momentum and profit along with the decline. In a rally, they simply switch direction and try to ride it up.
But managers have a tougher time when markets aren't clearly headed in either direction. While the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up about 4.5 percent this year, markets have been volatile amid the economic uncertainty in the United States and Europe.
AQR Capital Management, a large hedge fund based in the United States and founded by Clifford S. Asness, was down almost 3.8 percent as of the end of June. It has $1.7 billion in futures under management. The Man Group, the giant British hedge fund, is down about 7.5 percent in its $23.9 billion managed futures fund.
Smaller funds tend to suffer the most, say experts. The managers often rely on heavy amounts of borrowed money, amplifying the performance swings. By contrast, large funds like Winton Capital - which manages about $21 billion and deploys a relatively low amount of leverage - is up about 2 percent in mid-July, according to a person with knowledge of the fund.
"A lot of these smaller funds take on more risk to grow and get bigger," said Greg N. Gregoriou, a professor of finance at the State University of New York, Plattsburgh.
The flood of money makes it only more difficult to navigate a lackluster market. Since 2008, industry assets have swelled 30 percent to nearly $300 billion. Some investors worry there is too much money fighting for a limited set of opportunities.
"The rise in speculative activity and the growth in assets may eventually show that situation where the music stops quickly and there are too many people looking for chairs that don't exist," said Troy W. Buckner, managing principal at NuWave Investment Management, a commodity trading adviser.
Herding around certain trades could worsen any market problems. If there is a sudden move, managers could simultaneously be forced to sell - putting further downward pressure on prices.
"That's been a worry for generations, and I think the jury is still out," said Scott H. Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
A number of academic papers have studied the impact of computer-based trading, and "it's very hard to find compelling evidence of them dragging prices up or down away from fundamentals and causing excess volatility," Mr. Irwin added.
Despite the weak performance, investors have not lost their enthusiasm for managed futures funds. Commodity trading advisers have gathered more than $28 billion in net inflows so far this year, according to BarclayHedge. More money has come into Altis than has gone out every month this year, Ms. Reeve-Gray said.
In part, institutional investors are starting to aim at managed futures funds as part of an overall diversification strategy, say industry analysts, especially because they often do well in down markets. Long-term investors tend to be less concerned about erratic returns in a single year. 
"For a long time it was a stepchild," said Sol Waksman, president of BarclayHedge, referring to managed futures. "As time goes on, I think the whole sector is increasing in acceptability."
An article on the DealBook page on Friday about managed futures funds, which bet on the ups and downs of stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, misstated the recent performance of one such fund, Altis Partners. The fund's performance - not its assets - is down more than 20 percent so far in 2011.

HEADLINE: Biggest Coal Company and Coal Country Collaborate on Mega Mine

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: China and the world's biggest coal company team up on a new mine, and the age of fossil fuels rolls on. 

 BODY:
A newly announced partnership between the world's biggest private coal mining company and coal-burning country cuts against recent efforts to paint China green because of its push on manufacturing wind turbines and solar panels. All of its efforts on renewable energy come atop ongoing expansion of its use of coal.
In a news release issued today, the coal company, Peabody Energy, gushingly describes the company's partnership with the government of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region and Communist Party on a plan to develop a surface coal mine that will produced 50 million tons of coal a year "over multiple decades." The news is summarized well by James Areddy and Simon Hall in The Wall Street Journal.
I sent the release to a few experts on coal and carbon dioxide for their reactions. David Victor, the University of California, San Diego, political science professor and author of "Global Warming Gridlock," noted some subtler aspects of the announcement that point to ever more efficient coal use in China, but also unrelenting growth in coal use -- and carbon dioxide emissions. Here's Victor's reaction: 
I think the really big story here - from the perspective of the industry - is that China is in the midst of a massive consolidation of its coal industry and a bunch of other efforts, including a larger role for best practice foreign operators like Peabody, that are designed to maximize output of coal and lower the costs, which have skyrocketed. All that points in the direction of making coal more competitive than it has been in the past. Barring a big change in technology and regulation on CO2, that trend is hard to square with widely discussed goals for stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations. If it is any consolation, the average efficiency of coal plants in China has been rising decisively-that doesn't bend down the emissions curve, but it slows the growth.
Here are a couple of descriptions of the pace of growth in coal use from the Peabody release:
The Xinjiang Region is China's largest administrative region with vast reserves of coal estimated to account for approximately 40 percent of China's reserves. The government expects Xinjiang's coal output will increase from approximately 100 million tonnes in 2010 to more than 1 billion tonnes.
China is the world's fastest-growing economy and the world's largest energy user. The nation is expected to bring online 600 gigawatts of coal-fueled electricity generation by 2035 according to the International Energy Agency, which would require more than 2 billion tons of coal each year. This year alone, China is expected to increase its coal-fueled power capacity by 50 gigawatts, representing several hundred million tons of additional annual coal use.
Here's the reaction from Raymond T. Pierrehumbert, a climate scientist at the University of Chicago who has weighed in on Dot Earth on questions raised by the ever growing flow of coal exports to China from industrialized countries -- notably the United States and Australia:
We have no control over the coal China mines on its own land, but there's no reason we (and Australia) ought to be bending over backwards to sell them coal we do have control of. Obama has authorized expanded coal mining in Montana, and there will be a push to expand coal export terminals for exports to Asia. 
Bigger things are already happening in Australia. We in the developed world can decide to leave this coal in the ground, if only we had the courage to do so. Every tonne of coal left in the ground is one less tonne in the atmosphere/ocean contributing to long term climate change. It's pointless to pearl-clutch (oh golly) over China's mining and say there's nothing we can do in the face of a big bad thing like THAT.
Every tonne counts, and any tonne of carbon we keep out of the atmosphere is an improvement, whether or not it offsets China's coal mining. For that matter, even in China one has to look at the fact that their substantial investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency means that at least their emissions are increasing at a much lower rate than they might be.
So, the fact that China is expanding coal mining has zero relevance to the climate benefits to be had by reducing our own emissions. A tonne saved is still a tonne saved. What IS gruesome, though, is that the first world sends coal to China to burn to make the junk we buy from them, and then we hand-wring about how China is burning so much coal it's hopeless for little old us do do anything about CO2 emissions.

HEADLINE: The Tax Increases We'll Get

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Why Republicans might be courting a soak-the-rich future. 

 BODY:
Continuing this week's series on what Republicans are risking if they punt on a deficit deal, I recommend readingDavid Leonhardt's column on tax increases from yesterday's Times - and particularly the conclusion, in which he points out that however much wonks may love the idea of a comprehensive tax reform that eliminates credits, loopholes and deductions, it's just as likely that taxes will go up the old-fashioned way:The truth is, closing loopholes has much stronger support among economists and columnists than it does among voters. Only 23 percent of Americans benefit from the mortgage deduction, but 93 percent support it. Other big breaks, like the exclusions for health insurance and 401(k) contributions, are popular, too. On the corporate side, Eric Toder of the Urban Institutehas pointed out that the biggest breaks also tend to be popular, like the credit for research and development.So what kind of tax increases do Americans support? The old-fashioned kind. Seventy-two percent support raising taxes on income above $250,000, according to a recent New York Times/CBS poll, and a large majority likewise favor raising Social Security taxes on the affluent.And again, if the Republicans don't win the White House in 2012, this kind of tax increase on high earners (achieved via the expiration of the Bush tax cuts) becomes more or less inevitable: With Obama's presidency extended by four years, the only question is whether there will be a bipartisan deal to extend the current middle class rates or whether gridlock ensures that those rates go up as well. For now, there's still a chance for Congressional Republicans pre-empt this future by agreeing on a bipartisan tax reform that supersedes the Bush tax code. But once the debt-ceiling negotiations are over, only Mitt Romney will stand between Republicans and a soak-the-rich future.
My fear is that a lot of Republican legislators are very happy to take this risk, because while as a policy matter they're against letting the Bush tax cuts expire, as a political matter they'd rather watch it happen and blame the Democrats for hiking taxes than vote for a bipartisan package and get damned as tax raisers by Americans for Tax Reform and Co. If you're a House Republican, the best kind of tax increase is obviously no tax increase at all. But the second-best kind of tax increase isn't necessarily the sort of revenue-raising reform that a lot of conservative wonks would swallow hard and support. It's just any tax increase that they don't have to vote for themselves.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Tension

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
The reality of a possible default is sinking in on Capitol Hill after a negotiating session at the White House took a sour turn, writes Carl Hulse. New warnings of economic woe from the Federal Reserve and a decision by Moody's Analytics to review the federal government's AAA credit rating for a possible downgrade preceded the meeting. President Obama will meet with the Congressional leaders today at 4:15 p.m to continue discussions aimed at reaching a deal to raise the federal debt ceiling.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, was on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, where he gave a subdued accountof the economy's health. Binyamin Appelbaum reports that Mr. Bernanke said that the central bank was reconsidering whether to provide additional stimulus to aid the recovery. The Fed chairman will be back on the Hill this morning at 10 to testify before the Senate Banking Committee.
Despite the squabbling over the debt, Mr. Obama managed to haul in a record $86 million for his re-election campaign and the Democratic National Committee between April 1 and June 30, reports Nicholas Confessore. The combined total is more than all of the president's potential Republican challengers have raised combined. For their part, Republicans seized an opportunity to contrast Mr. Obama's fund-raising totals with his record on job creation.
Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, iscoming under fire from critics who say he used one-time budget gimmicks to balance the state budget without new taxes that have contributed to the current crisis there, Trip Gabriel writes. In response, Mr. Pawlenty, who has used his success at balancing the state budget as a contestant in the 2012 Republican race for the White House, rejected any responsibility.
The story Mr. Obama used so often on the campaign trail and in the subsequent fight over health care about his mother fighting health insurers while she was on her deathbed may not be entirely accurate, Kevin Sack reports. Janny Scott, a Times reporter on book leave, challenges Mr. Obama's account of his mother's struggles, indicating that the dispute may have been over a disability insurance policy.
Around the Web:The Wall Street Journal looks at how credit agencies are responding to the debt impasse.
Happening in Washington:

HEADLINE: Wall Street Lobbyist Aims to 'Reform the Reform'

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Steve Bartlett, the head of the Financial Services Roundtable, has played a pivotal role in lobbyists' efforts to delay or water down financial regulatory changes. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - An unexpected voice dominated a closed-door meeting a few months ago on Capitol Hill, where senior Senate aides were discussing the financial regulatory overhaul adopted last summer.
It was not a lawmaker, or even a Congressional staff member. It was a Wall Street lobbyist. 
 Within minutes of arriving, Steve Bartlett, the head of a group representing 100 of the nation's largest financial institutions, was deriding a proposal aimed at limiting the fees that banks charge retail stores on debit-card purchases.
Mr. Bartlett, wearing ostrich leather cowboy boots, barked orders to surprised Congressional staff members, urging them to delay the rule, according to two people who attended. He acted like someone running the meeting, they said, rather than like an invited guest. 
Though little known outside Washington and Wall Street, Mr. Bartlett has played a pivotal role with other lobbyists in their fierce and frenetic behind-the-scenes effort that has successfully delayed or watered down many of the major regulatory changes passed by Congress in the aftermath of the financial meltdown. 
Wall Street has spared little expense, spending nearly $52 million to woo Washington in the first three months of the year, up 10 percent from the previous quarter, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Mr. Bartlett's organization, the deep-pocketed Financial Services Roundtable, itself spent $2.5 million in that period, more than any organization focused primarily on the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul law, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.
Mr. Bartlett is unapologetic. As in the case of the meeting with top Senate staff members, Mr. Bartlett says he is willing to be aggressive to protect the industry's profits from overly harsh rules. By his reckoning, Wall Street is not trying to dismantle the financial regulation enacted under the Dodd-Frank Act a year ago this month. Rather, as he explained with his Texas twang, "We are trying to reform the reform."
That is not how critics of Wall Street see it. After being saved by government largesse, they say, big banks then moved to thwart reforms aimed at preventing future meltdowns caused by excessive risk-taking. Wall Street "should have learned that these practices threatened the global economy," said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group. But "they're right back to spouting the same line." 
Ted Kaufman, the former Democratic senator from Delaware who played a role in drafting Dodd-Frank, lamented Wall Street's heavy spending in Washington, saying, "this is the most uneven battle since Little Big Horn." 
While Wall Street has lost a few skirmishes, the industry has gotten much of what it wanted. In late June, the Federal Reserve softened the cuts to debit-card fees, saving the industry billions of dollars a year. Mr. Bartlett's group and other lobbying firms also pressed regulators to put off new derivatives regulations for up to six months, after the Treasury Department moved to excuse some of the complex securities from oversight altogether. 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to one of its officials, is even reconsidering plans to curb banks' control over derivatives, once seen as a cornerstone of Dodd-Frank. 
Mr. Bartlett, a former Congressman who earns about $2 million a year as the roundtable's chief executive, has helped lead the charge. As regulators put the finishing touches on nearly 300 new rules, he is glad-handing government officials, uniting financial firms and alternately charming or haranguing to make Wall Street's case. 
At one point in the battle over the debit-card fees, he said, he urged the Republican head of the House subcommittee that oversees banking to do her duty as chairwoman by introducing legislation to delay any changes. A few weeks later, he visited his friend, Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-authored the overhaul law, to get support for the delay. 
In recent months, Mr. Bartlett's team has gone into high gear, sending regulators some 100 letters proposing changes to soften the Dodd-Frank rules and holding dozens of meetings with lawmakers and regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other federal agencies.
In February, the roundtable sponsored "Financial Services University," a two-day conference for Congressional staff members, where "visiting professors" gave presentations on Dodd-Frank. A top executive at Visa, the credit card giant, addressed new caps on debit card fees, according to a copy of the agenda. The associate general counsel for Bank of America discussed new mortgage regulations. 
Mr. Bartlett, 63, called the event educational. "We are not here to lobby," he told roughly 200 attendees. "We're here to tell you what the facts are, and we think you'll ultimately agree with us."
The roundtable has taken a similarly direct approach with regulators. In a letter to the S.E.C., it asked the agency to reward whistle-blowers who report fraud internally before going to the government, urging that it "must be a specific factor in determining the amount of any award." The language bore a striking resemblance to the S.E.C.'s description of the final regulation, which said working with internal-compliance departments was "a factor that can increase the amount of an award."
Mr. Bartlett, a lifelong conservative who met his wife at a Young Republicans bake sale in high school, has spearheaded several deregulation efforts over a three-decade career as a lawmaker and a lobbyist. A member of the House banking committee in the 1980s, he led the successful push to let the market set interest rates on government-insured mortgages. He also supported legislation that allowed banks to invest in private mortgage-backed securities, the investments that eventually helped feed the real estate bubble. 
After serving as mayor of Dallas, Mr. Bartlett landed the top spot at the roundtable in 1999. He said he had been hired in part to "secure passage" of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed some of the Glass-Steagall restrictions on banks set after the Great Depression. The law, signed in 1999, allowed investment banks and commercial banks to merge, creating the Wall Street powerhouses that eventually proved too big to fail during the crisis. 
Mr. Bartlett's Dodd-Frank efforts began in earnest on June 25 of last year. While a Congressional committee worked out the final details of the legislation, Mr. Bartlett's said his chief lobbyist, Scott Talbott, sent regular e-mails on the "gory details" of the all-night session. 
Around 5:40 a.m., Mr. Talbott signed off with a final, terse message: "It's done," which Mr. Bartlett read on his iPhone a few minutes later at his suburban Virginia home. In late July, President Obama signed the sweeping reform, which threatened to crimp lending, derivatives trading and other profit centers.
Almost immediately, Mr. Bartlett created 17 working groups - made up of lawyers, compliance officers and finance executives - to develop the industry's position on thorny issues. The team focused on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which meets every Thursday. The derivatives group gathers at lunchtime on Fridays. 
At first, the mortgage securities group could not agree on its stance about risk retention rules. Dodd-Frank requires banks that sell mortgage-backed securities to keep a small portion of the related risk on their books, excluding those containing the safest home loans. Wells Fargo called for a strict interpretation, pushing to exempt only mortgages with a down payment of 30 percent or more. Some Wall Street firms wanted no down payment requirement at all. Acting as conciliator, Mr. Bartlett is now advocating 10 percent.
 "It's taken a long time to reconcile those polar opposites," said Mr. Bartlett. 
Once armed with a strategy, the roundtable makes its pitch to regulators. Minutes after Mr. Obama chose Elizabeth Warren to set up the new consumer protection agency, Mr. Bartlett left Ms. Warren, a Harvard professor, a voicemail to congratulate her - and set up a lunch. 
A week later over cold-cut sandwiches, Mr. Bartlett implored Ms. Warren to revamp the mortgage paperwork that has befuddled home buyers and has proved costly to lenders. He advised merging two lengthy documents into a simplified, one-page form. In May, Ms. Warren invited the roundtable to an early private showing of two prototypes along the lines they had discussed.
A month later, he co-hosted a farewell fete for Sheila C. Bair, the outgoing head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Ms. Bair received a faux gold watch at the cocktail party, which was attended by dozens of bankers and regulatory officials.
"He's very good at the schmooze, and I mean that in the most flattering way," said Camden R. Fine, the president of the Independent Community Bankers of America, another trade group.
But some fellow Wall Street lobbyists and Congressional staff members worry that his tactics can be overly aggressive at times, undermining the industry's efforts and credibility. To help get support for the measure to delay the debit-card rules this year, the roundtable hired a consulting firm. Some bankers complained that the firm had pressured them to get on board. 
Mr. Bartlett also made promises about rounding up 40 Republican votes for the delay, according to two senior Senate staff members. But only 35 materialized, and the measure was defeated. 
He is not deterred. In recent weeks, the roundtable has compiled a "wrong" list, with two dozen rules to overhaul or repeal, including executive compensation disclosure and credit rating guidelines. Mr. Bartlett also plans to revisit the debit-card rule. By his estimates, the caps could cost the industry $14 billion. 
 "I wish I could look the other way," he said, but added, "I've got 14 billion reasons to be aggressive."

HEADLINE: Nobody Wins the Debt Default Blame Game

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Trying to dissect claims that either party to the debt ceilings negotiations could benefit from a default. 

 BODY:
The chances of a default on the United States debt are still fairly small. The prices for credit default swaps, financial instruments that pay investors in the event that a default happens, imply just a 0.05 percent chance, or 1-in-2,000, of a default occurring within the next year, according to The Wall Street Journal.
That seems like a considerable underestimate of the chances -- I don't have much confidence that Wall Street does a competent job of pricing in political risk. But Congress still has ample time to prevent one by raising the debt ceiling, and the Treasury Department may use any and all means to stave off a default for as long as possible even if Congress fails to act.
Even if an actual default is unlikely, the possibility of one may nevertheless influence both sides' bargaining positions. In addition, far more likely than an actual default are situations where we stop short of one but nevertheless have significant consequences for the American economy because of downgrades to the United States' credit rating, severe reductions in government spending and significant anxiety in the market. So although we've touched on this subject before, it's worth revisiting: what happens to American politics if the debt ceiling isn't raised by Aug. 2 and the economy suffers as a result?
Let's keep in mind that there are three basic possibilities:1) The situation plays out in such a way that is harmful to President Obama and helpful to the Republicans on balance.
2) The situation plays out in such a way that is harmful to Republicans and helpful to Mr. Obama on balance.
3) The situation plays out in such a way that is harmful to both Mr. Obama and the Republicans.What do I mean by the third possibility? A literal interpretation would be that Mr. Obama loses the White House, either to a Republican or (less likely) to an independent candidate. But the Republican Party loses its majority in the House. Maybe quite a few Democratic incumbents in Congress also lose.
More broadly, it would mean that any victories achieved in 2012 would be superficial and Pyrrhic. The public would not trust either side to carry out its agenda. The next several election cycles would be extremely volatile. Prospects for independent candidates for president and for third parties, whether emerging from the center of American politics or from the wings, would improve significantly. And within the major parties, power would tend to transfer away from those who hold it.
Whether you're Barack Obama or John A. Boehner, or a Republican senator in a swing state considering how to vote on the debt ceiling, two out of the three possibilities are bad for you. Those are terrible odds. This is why I'm deeply suspicious of claims that either party to the negotiations believes it could benefit from a default. This isn't a zero-sum game, and although politicians are bad at many things, they are usually fairly perceptive about what will enable them to hold onto power.
But suppose that you have to pick between the first two possibilities: one side loses and the other side "wins."
Arguing for the "Obama loses" side is the political scientist John Sides:Assume there is no deal and then assume, as [Treasury Secretary Timothy F.] Geithner and others have warned, that there are serious consequences for the economy when the debt ceiling isn't raised. This will hurt Obama. And it will hurt him more than it will hurt the Republican Party. Presidents suffer the consequences of a bad economy. Divided government does not change this. Beware pundits who see silver linings for Obama in this scenario.And arguing against Mr. Sides are Jonathan Chait of the New Republic and Ezra Klein of The Washington Post. Here's Mr. Chait:It seems highly plausible to imagine that, if the Republicans block a debt ceiling increase, that the public will turn on them. The business elite will decide that the Republicans are dangerous and must be stopped. Obama will use his bully pulpit to explain to the public that the Republicans have forced withholding of entitlement payments and the closing of vital government services. Quite possibly, this effect could overwhelm any actual economic ramifications. I know the models say the economy will be all that counts. That could be right. But the models have never seen anything like this before.I'm more inclined toward the argument advanced by Mr. Chait. I don't think I'd say that Mr. Obama would be likely to benefit politically -- but I do think it's anybody's guess, and the empirical models that Mr. Sides references tell us very little.
Part of the reason for my skepticism is that I think these empirical models are, in general, a little bit overrated by the political science community. Some models claim to explain as much as 90 percent of voting behavior based on economic fundamentals and a few other variables. But the models suffer from profound theoretical flaws owing to the infrequency of presidential elections, and their predictive power is nowhere near 90 percent when applied to new ("out-of-sample") cases. A cynical view is that the models are really just anecdotal arguments in quantitative dress: if a model has trouble explaining a particular election, you invent a new variable to excuse it. A fairer view, perhaps, is that the models do a good job with the "normal" cases -- clearly the economy matters quite a bit to a president's re-election chances -- but fumble on the more difficult ones.
Whatever else the 2012 election would be if the debt limit is not raised in a timely fashion, it would not be a normal case. There's no especially appropriate precedent for the economy tanking by such an immediate and direct result of action (or inaction) in Washington. One reason the public tends to score strong economic performance in favor of the president, and poor economic performance against him, is because the United States economy is incredibly complicated -- it's hard for the public to discern cause and effect. (It's also hard for economists!) So the heuristic of blaming the president for poor performance and crediting him for strong performance is as reasonable as anything.
This would be different, however. The stock market could drop by thousands of points. Some major corporations, particularly in the financial services sector, might go under. Although the consequences might take some time to filter through the broader economy, there would nevertheless be a number of immediate and extremely visible effects. Many voters would feel as though they had perfectly reasonable grounds to connect the dots.
You'd have to weigh two things against each other: the additional damage to the economy, which is bad for the president all else being equal, and the additional ownership of the economy that Republicans would take for it, which is bad for them all else being equal. I don't know which effect would win out, but it's not a risk that either side should feel happy about taking.

HEADLINE: 'Green' Economy Is Real but Needs a Push, Study Suggests

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: While green initiatives are driving growth and innovation, market and policy challenges are preventing them from reaching their full potential, a new study suggests. 

 BODY:
Like so many buzz phrases, "green economy" is an expression that is generously tossed around with little regard for its meaning. 
In his State of the Union address in January, President Obama stressed the importance of nurturing America's green economy to "strengthen our security, protect our planet and create countless new jobs for our people." For something said to be so crucial to growth and economic renewal, however, surprisingly little is actually known about the nature, size and growth of the green economy. 
The Brookings Institution, in collaboration with the Technology Partnership of the research and development company Battelle, has compiled what it describes as one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date analyses of the nation's enigmatic green economy. 
The report, titled "Sizing the Clean Economy," collected data from every county and major metropolitan areas in the United States from 2003 to 2010. Defining a "green" or "clean" economy as the sector that produces goods and services with an environmental benefit, the study amassed numbers on mascots of green like wind, solar and hydropower and less glamorous sectors like public mass transit and waste management and treatment. 
One point the article makes is that while green initiatives are driving growth and innovation, market and policy challenges are preventing them from reaching their full potential. Those obstacles include policy gaps that undercut market demand, shortfalls in financing that lead to uncertainty and instability for investors, and an inadequate system for supporting innovation. 
According to the report, the green economy employed 2.7 million people in 2010, or about 2 percent of the American work force. 
To put this number into some perspective, the health-care sector, the largest private job provider in the nation, employs 13.8 million people, or 10.2 percent. Despite its relatively modest size, the green economy is still larger than the fossil fuels sector (2.4 million jobs) or the biosciences sector (1.4 million jobs). 
Over the last seven years, the green economy has grown at a rate of 3.4 percent, trailing the 4.2 percent growth achieved over all, but still noteworthy given the disproportionate impact of the housing crisis on the green sector. (Many housing and construction-related companies can be classified under the green rubric.) 
The report also found that the green economy weathered the recession better than the nation's economy did as a whole. 
Where the green economy excels is at providing the kind of well-paid, low-skill jobs that are often lamented to be leaving the United States, the study suggests. These "green collar" jobs are manufacturing-heavy and export-driven and represent a substantial source of growth. 
One of the most surprising findings, said Jonathan Rothwell, a senior research analyst at Brookings, was where some of the largest and fastest-growing regional green economies are found. 
"Albany-Shenectady, New York emerged as the metropolitan region with the highest percentage of green jobs and the fifth-fastest growing green economy in the nation," he said. General Electric, for example, is based in Albany and has opened innovative battery factories and started other green initiatives there. 
One of the greatest challenge facing the growth and development of the green economy, however, is that companies with promising patented ideas that have proven themselves in small-scale test production simply cannot secure the financing they need to scale up production. 
"The same risky and breakthrough nature of these products that make them so exciting and attractive for scientists and venture capitalists, is what repels large investment banks which feel like they can't invest in a product unless it has a proven track record," Mr. Rothwell said. 
To combat this financing obstacle, Mr. Rothwell advocates scaling up the Department of Energy's loan guarantee program, and, more ambitiously, creating a tech fund that would parallel what crop insurance was for the agricultural industry. 
Such a program would further the development of new green initiatives but take the risk out of investing in them for the first few years by offering different types of insurance until they demonstrated their long-term viability. 
"The important take-away message here is that the green economy is real and it's growing, but it needs some encouragement to live up to all the expectations," Mr. Rothwell said.

HEADLINE: Scattered Attempts at Carbon Capture

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Some ventures cook coal into a gas and then sequester it; one may sell its carbon dioxide to oil drillers who use it to force petroleum to the surface. 

 BODY:
As my colleague John Broder and I reported in Thursday's paper, American Electric Power is dropping its plan to build a commercial-scale version of a carbon dioxide scrubber at Mountaineer, its coal-fired power plant in New Haven, W.Va. The company decided that since public service commissions in West Virginia and Virginia had refused to give it full reimbursement for a pilot version that it ran for two years, it could not expect to recover its investment for the full-scale version -- even if the Energy Department was going to pony up $334 million, or half the cost.
Senator Jay Rockefeller, the West Virginia Democrat who had helped secure the $334 million as part of the fiscal stimulus act, was quick to praise the pilot project and to say that the money would be available for other carbon-capture projects.
In fact, eight other such projects are in the pipeline, although none quite like Mountaineer, a middle-aged coal-fired electric plant that had planned to bury the carbon dioxide. Plants like that will probably continue to pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere for decades.
It is possible that not all of the eight will come to fruition, but they offer interesting possibilities the Southern Company, for example, has already broken ground on a $2.67 billion power plant in Kemper County, Miss., to which the Energy Department will contribute $270 million. The plant will cook coal into a gas, separate out some of the carbon dioxide and burn the gas. The plant will emit very low levels of other pollutants and can use local coals that have low heating value per ton.Some other projects aided by the Energy Department yield carbon dioxide but are not power plants. An Archer Daniels Midland ethanol plant in Decatur, Ill., will sequester its carbon dioxide in an underground sandstone layer. Ethanol production gives off a stream of nearly pure carbon dioxide, so capture is easy.
In Meredosia, Ill., the Energy Department is helping pay for the conversion of a plantthat was originally built to use oil. In its new configuration, an air separation unit will pull oxygen out of the air and use it to burn coal. At a conventional power plant, the exhaust is mostly nitrogen. But if the coal is burned in oxygen, the exhaust is mostly carbon dioxide. It is by far the Energy Department's biggest investment, $1.08 billion out of a total cost of about $1.3 billion.
The W.A. Parish generating station, a southwest of Houston, and owned by NRG, will be equipped with a carbon scrubber. It sits in the midst of oil fields and could sell its carbon dioxide to drillers, who would pump the material underground to force oil to the surface.
Depending on the oil field, a ton of carbon dioxide can produce two to four barrels. At $100 a barrel, that would be a high market value for the carbon dioxide. The Parish project is supposed to cost $339 million, with the Energy Department contributing $167 million. It is about one-quarter the size of the canceled A.E.P. project.
Near Odessa, another plant will also cook coal into a gas and sequester the carbon. But that plant,Summit TX Clean Energy, is a "poly-gen" plant, making both fertilizer and electric power. It is supposed to cost $1.7 billion, with a $450 million taxpayer contribution.
In Lake Charles, La., Leucadia Energy will turn petroleum coke into methanol and capture the carbon dioxide. That project is supposed to cost $436 million, with $261 million coming from the Energy Department.
And in Port Arthur, Tex., Air Products will expose natural gas to steam to create methanol; the carbon dioxide will be captured and used in the oil fields. That is a $426 million project, of which $261 comes from the Energy Department.
In Kern County, Calif., the Energy Department will put $408 million toward a $2.8 billion plant that will take petroleum coke, a leftover from oil refining, and cook it into hydrogen gas for use in power generation, with sequestration of the carbon dioxide.
These projects use a variety of capture technologies. A crucial part of A.E.P.'s now-abandoned attempt was the use of ammonia, which is well suited to existing plants, to bind with the carbon dioxide. A.E.P.'s partner in the Mountaineer pilot, Alstom, which built the ammonia system, said it understood the decision to shelve the capture project but cautioned that commercialization of the technology was needed to reduce climate change.
"If we deviate from the critical path for commercializing C.C.S. technology and do not build large-scale demonstration plants, it will take longer to drive down the technology cost curve, and significantly increase delivered electricity costs,'' Alstom said.

HEADLINE: City Eyes Overseas Investment Returns

BYLINE: JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ


HIGHLIGHT: Calling the rising cost of city pensions "unsustainable," Deputy Mayor Robert K. Steel said the city should overhaul its benefit system. 

 BODY:
Calling the rising cost of city pensions "unsustainable," Deputy Mayor Robert K. Steel said Thursday that New York City should move swiftly to overhaul its benefit system, including by investing more funds in overseas markets.
Mr. Steel, who oversees economic development for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said moving retiree investments out of American stock markets and into international equities could bring higher returns, helping alleviate some pressure on the city's budget.
"We have an obligation to all New Yorkers to ensure that we are being responsible stewards of the public's resources," Mr. Steel said before an audience at the Princeton Club in Midtown. "It's time for a clarion to action."
The city's pension costs have risen by an average of almost 20 percent annually over the past decade, reaching an estimated $8.4 billion in 2012, compared with $1.2 billion in 2001.
Mr. Bloomberg, facing a dreary economic outlook, has said that overhauling the pension system is a priority of his third term. But labor leaders remain skeptical of his plans, which include raising the retirement age to 65 from 57 for some workers and ending year-end bonuses.
Mr. Bloomberg has found an ally in Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who said in an interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times on Wednesday that he would make limiting retirement benefits for new state and city workers his top priority next year.
The mayor is seeking to go further and hopes to persuade Albany lawmakers to restore the city's power to negotiate pensions as a part of collective bargaining discussions. (The state stripped the city of that ability during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s.)
In making the case for international investments, Mr. Steel said pension returns in the city had been mediocre. Last year, the return on the city's investments was 20 percent, he said, while the S.&P. 500 stock index rose 31 percent.
Currently, 18 percent of the city's pension funds are invested in international equities. To invest more heavily in overseas markets, the city will need approval by the State Legislature.
Mr. Steel also called for consolidating the investment activities for New York's numerous pension funds to reduce costs and increase efficiency.
"We're spread across five funds with five sets of decision-makers and five sets of meetings and five sets of processes," he said. "Consolidating the plan operations will allow New York City to realize the benefits of scale."
Mr. Bloomberg shares oversight of the pension fund with the city comptroller, John C. Liu, who has a rocky relationship with the mayor. Mr. Steel went out of his way on Thursday to say he looked forward to working with Mr. Liu.
In a statement, Mr. Liu applauded Mr. Steel's ideas, saying his office had embraced many of them previously.
"We are encouraged by what we heard," Mr. Liu said.

HEADLINE: Ex-Official With Gates Foundation Abandons Plan to Open 3 Charter Schools

BYLINE: By ANNA M. PHILLIPS

 BODY:
After years spent directing the distribution of more than $1 billion from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation into hundreds of schools across the nation, Tom Vander Ark set his sights on the New York area, with a plan to create a network of charter schools of his own.
Mr. Vander Ark, the foundation's former executive director of education and a national leader in the online learning movement, was granted charters in 2010 to open a high school in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and two others in Newark. The New York school, Brooklyn City Prep, also got space in a public school building -- a precious and controversial commodity -- hired a principal, and welcomed applications from 150 eighth graders this spring.
But after spending more than $1.5 million of investors' money on consultants and lawyers, Mr. Vander Ark, 52, has walked away from the project, and the schools will not open as planned this fall, leaving others involved stunned and frustrated.
''If we had plotted a worst-case scenario, no one could have constructed the current situation,'' said Mr. Vander Ark, saying the weak economy and the difficulty of establishing charters in New York and New Jersey ''led to less success than we had hoped for.'' 
In an e-mail to the board members he had recruited, Mr. Vander Ark added, ''I have a lot more sympathy for nonprofit leaders now that I'm on this side of the table.''
Those he has been working with had a harsher assessment.
''He's flying 30,000 feet on the air, but can't do it on the ground,'' said Joshua Morales, a former official with the New York City Education Department who was hired by Mr. Vander Ark to develop the schools.
James Wiley, an educational technology consultant who has been serving as chairman of Brooklyn City Prep's board of directors, said: ''I'm from the Bronx, so you can imagine what language I used when I found out he was having these problems and we didn't know anything about it. We just assumed that he was ticking along and things were going O.K.''
Mr. Vander Ark said he had kept his colleagues informed.
''So it's ridiculous for them to claim that they were unaware,'' he said. ''They created these ideas. They helped pitch these ideas.''
While many new charter schools are asked to take a year for planning, it is relatively rare to require two, and unusual for a founder -- in this case, a well-known figure in education reform -- to walk away.
A former businessman and superintendent of a Washington State school district, Mr. Vander Ark doled out more than $1.6 billion in Gates Foundation money from 1999 to 2006, much of it to create and support small high schools. In 2008, he founded City Prep Academies, a for-profit organization intended to create and operate charter schools that combined traditional classroom teaching and online learning. He said the group was financed by $1.5 million from Revolution Learning, a venture fund where he is a managing partner.
But City Prep Academies immediately ran into problems. Its first application for a New York charter, made in summer 2009 as a close copy of the NYC iSchool that opened in SoHo the year before, received a tepid response from the city's Education Department. Like the iSchool, Brooklyn City Prep promised to blend traditional classroom teaching with online learning, but many who read the application found it lacking in details.
''There was definitely the sense that they were not immediately ready to open the school,'' said Michael Duffy, who was the director of the city's charter school office at the time.
Dirk Tillotson, a charter-school consultant who read the application, agreed. ''It didn't seem like there was enough of a 'there' there,'' he said, adding, ''You didn't know what the school was going to look like.''
The city and state approved the charter the next year, on the condition that Brooklyn Prep take an extra year to ready itself, with the opening scheduled for September 2011. At the same time, the first of the Newark schools, Vailsburg Prep, had its opening postponed to 2011 from the requested 2010, and the second, Spirit Prep, applied in 2010 for a 2011 opening but was also delayed a year.
After the initial $1.5 million investment from his own venture fund, Mr. Vander Ark found himself unable to raise the money -- up to $500,000 per school -- that he said he needed to open them. He switched strategies and asked the Charter School Growth Fund, a nonprofit investment fund based in Colorado, to help him start a charter management organization, City Prep Academies Northeast. He also changed the name of his for-profit organization to Open Education Solutions.
Known as OpenEd Solutions, the company is a consultancy that helps schools, districts and states ''make the pivot to digital learning,'' according to its Web site. In summer 2010, it hired Curtis Lawrence Jr., a principal in Newark, to be the principal of Brooklyn City Prep. The company also brought in Mr. Morales, who had worked with charters in New York, as vice president of schools. He was told he could eventually become chief executive of City Prep Academies Northeast.
By spring 2011, Mr. Morales had secured space for Brooklyn City Prep in a public school building on Marcy Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant. He and Mr. Lawrence were interviewing teachers and reviewing student applications, confident that the school would open in September.
All they needed was a management agreement with City Prep Academies Northeast, which Mr. Wiley, the school's board chairman, said he was negotiating with Kathi Littmann, the president of OpenEd Solutions.
But in April, Mr. Wiley came to an unsettling realization: City Prep Academies Northeast existed in name only.
In a phone call on April 21 that Mr. Wiley characterized as ''explosive,'' Mr. Vander Ark and Ms. Littmann acknowledged that City Prep Academies Northeast had no money to pay for Brooklyn City Prep's opening costs and would not sign a management agreement.
Mr. Vander Ark had been unable to get any money from the Charter School Growth Fund or other similar national organizations. He had basically abandoned the idea of beginning a charter management organization and left the three schools-in-progress to find outside help on their own.
Mr. Tillotson, the consultant, said: ''It signals what's wrong with the so-called charter school community. Somebody who doesn't deserve a charter gets a charter. Somebody who doesn't deserve a building gets a building. And then somebody who doesn't care about the communities can turn their head and walk away.''
Incensed, Mr. Morales pushed City Prep Academies Northeast's would-be board members to meet and officially establish the organization. He said he would lead the organization even if Mr. Vander Ark would not finance it. Mr. Morales said he did not need thousands of dollars to open the school, given that it had access to a free space and would receive operating money from the city on a per-pupil basis, as all charters do. He even paid a month of Mr. Lawrence's salary, more than $7,000.
Mr. Vander Ark, for his part, said he did what he could to help the schools open, suggesting they sign contracts with Connections Academy, a nonprofit cyberschool network that enrolls students who study from their homes, as well as with OpenEd Solutions. But the boards were not interested: connections was unfamiliar to them, and it was unclear why they would need both organizations.
Now, Brooklyn City Prep has lost its claim on the Marcy Avenue space, and is applying for a second planning year, with the hope of opening in 2012. Mr. Lawrence is still the principal, though he is not being paid. The two Newark high schools are also looking to 2012. All three boards are seeking new management organizations, and their members are no longer in contact with Mr. Vander Ark, who as chief executive of OpenEd Solutions travels the country evangelizing about online education and writes for the EdReformer blog.
''Now it's all about finding a good Samaritan or a management organization that will get us to the next steps,'' said Patrick Byrne, a former principal of a Newark parochial school, who worked for years on the Newark applications and is still trying to open the schools. ''It doesn't turn out like 'The Music Man,' where the uniforms and instruments appear at the end.''

HEADLINE: Leading the Wall Street Lobby

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - An unexpected voice dominated a closed-door meeting a few months ago on Capitol Hill, where senior Senate aides were discussing the financial regulatory overhaul adopted last summer.
It was not a lawmaker, or even a Congressional staff member. It was a Wall Street lobbyist.
Within minutes of arriving, Steve Bartlett, the head of a group representing 100 of the nation's largest financial institutions, was deriding a proposal aimed at limiting the fees that banks charge retail stores on debit-card purchases.
Mr. Bartlett, wearing ostrich leather cowboy boots, barked orders to surprised Congressional staff members, urging them to delay the rule, according to two people who attended. He acted as if he were someone running the meeting, they said, rather than as an invited guest.
Though little known outside Washington and Wall Street, Mr. Bartlett has played a pivotal role with other lobbyists in their fierce and frenetic behind-the-scenes effort that has successfully delayed or watered down many of the major regulatory changes passed by Congress in the aftermath of the financial meltdown. 
Wall Street has spared little expense, spending nearly $52 million to woo Washington in the first three months of the year, up 10 percent from the previous quarter, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Mr. Bartlett's organization, the deep-pocketed Financial Services Roundtable, itself spent $2.5 million in that period, more than any organization focused primarily on the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul law, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.
Mr. Bartlett is unapologetic. As in the case of the meeting with top Senate staff members, Mr. Bartlett says he is willing to be aggressive to protect the industry's profits from overly harsh rules. By his reckoning, Wall Street is not trying to dismantle the financial regulation enacted under the Dodd-Frank Act a year ago this month. Rather, as he explained with his Texas twang, ''We are trying to reform the reform.''
That is not how critics of Wall Street see it. After being saved by government largesse, they say, big banks then moved to thwart reforms aimed at preventing future meltdowns caused by excessive risk-taking. Wall Street ''should have learned that these practices threatened the global economy,'' said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group. But ''they're right back to spouting the same line.''
Ted Kaufman, the former Democratic senator from Delaware who played a role in drafting Dodd-Frank, lamented Wall Street's heavy spending in Washington, saying, ''this is the most uneven battle since Little Big Horn.''
While Wall Street has lost a few skirmishes, the industry has gotten much of what it wanted. In late June, the Federal Reserve softened the cuts to debit-card fees, saving the industry billions of dollars a year. Mr. Bartlett's group and other lobbying firms also pressed regulators to put off new derivatives regulations for up to six months, after the Treasury Department moved to excuse some of the complex securities from oversight altogether.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to one of its officials, is even reconsidering plans to curb banks' control over derivatives, once seen as a cornerstone of Dodd-Frank.
Mr. Bartlett, a former Congressman who earns about $2 million a year as the roundtable's chief executive, has helped lead the charge. As regulators put the finishing touches on nearly 300 new rules, he is glad-handing government officials, uniting financial firms and alternately charming or haranguing to make Wall Street's case.
At one point in the battle over the debit-card fees, he said, he urged the Republican head of the House subcommittee that oversees banking to do her duty as chairwoman by introducing legislation to delay any changes. A few weeks later, he visited his friend, Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-authored the overhaul law, to get support for the delay.
In recent months, Mr. Bartlett's team has gone into high gear, sending regulators some 100 letters proposing changes to soften the Dodd-Frank rules and holding dozens of meetings with lawmakers and regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other federal agencies.
In February, the roundtable sponsored ''Financial Services University,'' a two-day conference for Congressional staff members, where ''visiting professors'' gave presentations on Dodd-Frank. A top executive at Visa, the credit card giant, addressed new caps on debit card fees, according to a copy of the agenda. The associate general counsel for Bank of America discussed new mortgage regulations.
Mr. Bartlett, 63, called the event educational. ''We are not here to lobby,'' he told roughly 200 attendees. ''We're here to tell you what the facts are, and we think you'll ultimately agree with us.''
The roundtable has taken a similarly direct approach with regulators. In a letter to the S.E.C., it asked the agency to reward whistle-blowers who report fraud internally before going to the government, urging that it ''must be a specific factor in determining the amount of any award.'' The language bore a striking resemblance to the S.E.C.'s description of the final regulation, which said working with internal-compliance departments was ''a factor that can increase the amount of an award.''
Mr. Bartlett, a lifelong conservative who met his wife at a Young Republicans bake sale in high school, has spearheaded several deregulation efforts over a three-decade career as a lawmaker and a lobbyist. A member of the House banking committee in the 1980s, he led the successful push to let the market set interest rates on government-insured mortgages. He also supported legislation that allowed banks to invest in private mortgage-backed securities, the investments that eventually helped feed the real estate bubble.
After serving as mayor of Dallas, Mr. Bartlett landed the top spot at the roundtable in 1999. He said he had been hired in part to ''secure passage'' of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed some of the Glass-Steagall restrictions on banks set after the Great Depression. The law, signed in 1999, allowed investment banks and commercial banks to merge, creating the Wall Street powerhouses that eventually proved too big to fail during the crisis.
Mr. Bartlett's Dodd-Frank efforts began in earnest on June 25 of last year. While a Congressional committee worked out the final details of the legislation, Mr. Bartlett's said his chief lobbyist, Scott Talbott, sent regular e-mails on the ''gory details'' of the all-night session.
Around 5:40 a.m., Mr. Talbott signed off with a final, terse message: ''It's done,'' which Mr. Bartlett read on his iPhone a few minutes later at his suburban Virginia home. In late July, President Obama signed the sweeping reform, which threatened to crimp lending, derivatives trading and other profit centers.
Almost immediately, Mr. Bartlett created 17 working groups - made up of lawyers, compliance officers and finance executives - to develop the industry's position on thorny issues. The team focused on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which meets every Thursday. The derivatives group gathers at lunchtime on Fridays.
At first, the mortgage securities group could not agree on its stance about risk retention rules. Dodd-Frank requires banks that sell mortgage-backed securities to keep a small portion of the related risk on their books, excluding those containing the safest home loans. Wells Fargo called for a strict interpretation, pushing to exempt only mortgages with a down payment of 30 percent or more. Some Wall Street firms wanted no down payment requirement at all. Acting as conciliator, Mr. Bartlett is now advocating 10 percent.
''It's taken a long time to reconcile those polar opposites,'' said Mr. Bartlett.
Once armed with a strategy, the roundtable makes its pitch to regulators. Minutes after Mr. Obama chose Elizabeth Warren to set up the new consumer protection agency, Mr. Bartlett left Ms. Warren, a Harvard professor, a voicemail to congratulate her - and set up a lunch.
A week later over cold-cut sandwiches, Mr. Bartlett implored Ms. Warren to revamp the mortgage paperwork that has befuddled home buyers and has proved costly to lenders. He advised merging two lengthy documents into a simplified, one-page form. In May, Ms. Warren invited the roundtable to an early private showing of two prototypes along the lines they had discussed.
A month later, he co-hosted a farewell fete for Sheila C. Bair, the outgoing head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Ms. Bair received a faux gold watch at the cocktail party, which was attended by dozens of bankers and regulatory officials.
''He's very good at the schmooze, and I mean that in the most flattering way,'' said Camden R. Fine, the president of the Independent Community Bankers of America, another trade group.
But some fellow Wall Street lobbyists and Congressional staff members worry that his tactics can be overly aggressive at times, undermining the industry's efforts and credibility. To help get support for the measure to delay the debit-card rules this year, the roundtable hired a consulting firm. Some bankers complained that the firm had pressured them to get on board.
Mr. Bartlett also made promises about rounding up 40 Republican votes for the delay, according to two senior Senate staff members. But only 35 materialized, and the measure was defeated.
He is not deterred. In recent weeks, the roundtable has compiled a ''wrong'' list, with two dozen rules to overhaul or repeal, including executive compensation disclosure and credit rating guidelines. Mr. Bartlett also plans to revisit the debit-card rule. By his estimates, the caps could cost the industry $14 billion.
''I wish I could look the other way,'' he said, but added, ''I've got 14 billion reasons to be aggressive.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: N.B.A.'s Twin Realities: Lockout and Layoffs

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
More than 100 N.B.A. employees were laid off this week, heightening the sense of economic distress as the league's owners and players haggle over a new labor agreement.
All told, 114 positions -- 11 percent of the league's work force -- were eliminated, primarily in New York and New Jersey, from nearly every division, including marketing, community relations, player programs, broadcasting and information technology. Most employees received the news Wednesday or Thursday.
The layoffs came two weeks after the N.B.A. locked out its players and froze operations. League officials said the two events were unrelated, although they were clearly intertwined, with the N.B.A. claiming annual losses of $300 million and searching for cost savings. 
''The layoffs are not a direct result of the lockout but rather a response to the same underlying issue -- that is, the league's expenses far outpace our revenues,'' the N.B.A. spokesman Mike Bass said.
The layoffs were framed as part of a broader effort to cut expenses by $50 million in all areas of the business. The cuts would have been made irrespective of the lockout, Bass said, and there are no plans to rehire the laid-off employees when the dispute is over. Although the league declined to offer specifics, the layoffs included a number of senior-level executives. All of the affected employees were offered severance packages.
Adam Silver, the N.B.A.'s deputy commissioner, informed owners of the cuts in a memo, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. He called the layoffs ''part of our larger efforts to restructure our operations and create a long-term sustainable business that is well-positioned for future growth.''
The league has been retrenching since the onset of the recession in 2008 -- reducing its work force, consolidating international offices and turning over digital operations to Turner Broadcasting.
Even before this week's layoffs, the N.B.A. had eliminated 275 positions at the team and league level since October 2008. That month, Commissioner David Stern, citing a ''wobbly'' economy, announced the elimination of 80 jobs, about 9 percent of the league's domestic work force at the time. That year, the N.B.A. handed management of its digital properties -- including its Web site and television station -- to Turner Broadcasting, and moved most of the operations to Atlanta.
More recently, the N.B.A. consolidated its overseas operations, shutting down offices in Paris and Tokyo. It is conducting all European business from London and its Asian business from Hong Kong.
Later this summer, the N.B.A. plans to shut down its Secaucus, N.J., studio, where the draft lottery is staged each year. The league has not identified a new home for the lottery, but it will likely be held at an ESPN or ABC studio in Manhattan. Commercial shoots and other programming that had been done in Secaucus will be moved to Atlanta.
As the lockout enters its third week, some teams have begun quietly shedding employees. The Charlotte Bobcats recently laid off at least seven people, including their radio play-by-play announcer, Scott Lauer, according to The Associated Press. The Detroit Pistons let go of 15 people, The A.P. reported.
The Los Angeles Lakers, one of the league's richest franchises, have laid off most of their training staff, their longtime equipment manager and their assistant general manager.
Meanwhile, negotiations on a new labor deal remain at a standstill. Although the parties had expressed a desire to keep talking, they have not held a bargaining session since the lockout began July 1, nor are any meetings scheduled. There is some dialogue at the staff level, with the two sides exchanging information during the annual audit of the league's revenue.

HEADLINE: Sluggish Market Stalls Funds That Thrive on Volatility

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED

 BODY:
Managed futures funds, which bet on the ups and downs of stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, have been crowing for years about their performance during the financial crisis.
Now, some managers are eating crow.
The portfolios, also known as commodity trading advisers, are down 1.5 percent on average so far in 2011, in contrast to a modest 1 percent gain for the average hedge fund. Several prominent managers like the Man Group and AQR Capital Management are faring worse. Altis Partners, which manages about $1.4 billion in assets, is off by more than 20 percent.
The weak returns offer a cautionary tale for investors chasing profits based on past performance. 
With the markets in free fall in 2008, the typical managed futures fund returned 14 percent, versus an 18 percent loss for hedge funds. After that, investors poured tens of billions of dollars into futures-based strategies.
But the portfolios produced unremarkable returns in the years that followed the financial collapse, and they're off to a rough start in 2011, owing to the stagnant market.
''These funds are supposed to be trend-following,'' said Brad H. Alford, chief investment officer of Alpha Capital Management. ''How can they all lose money at once?''
The funds, for their part, say they have always been volatile investments that pay out over the long term. Futures-based strategies have produced annualized returns of 11.41 percent since 1980, according to BarclayHedge, the research firm.
''We don't give investors a smooth ride,'' said Natasha Reeve-Gray, a partner at Altis.
''It's not about working within a couple of months but within a couple of years,'' she said. ''We look at things on a three-to-five-year time frame.''
Typically, these managers do best when stocks, bonds, commodities or currencies are moving up or down. If a particular market is falling, managed futures traders, especially those using trend-following computer models, bet on the downward momentum and profit along with the decline. In a rally, they simply switch direction and try to ride it up.
But managers have a tougher time when markets aren't clearly headed in either direction. While the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up about 4.5 percent this year, markets have been volatile amid the economic uncertainty in the United States and Europe.
AQR Capital Management, a large hedge fund based in the United States and founded by Clifford S. Asness, was down almost 3.8 percent as of the end of June. It has $1.7 billion in futures under management. The Man Group, the giant British hedge fund, is down about 7.5 percent in its $23.9 billion managed futures fund.
Smaller funds tend to suffer the most, say experts. The managers often rely on heavy amounts of borrowed money, amplifying the performance swings. By contrast, large funds like Winton Capital - which manages about $21 billion and deploys a relatively low amount of leverage - is up about 2 percent in mid-July, according to a person with knowledge of the fund.
''A lot of these smaller funds take on more risk to grow and get bigger,'' said Greg N. Gregoriou, a professor of finance at the State University of New York, Plattsburgh.
The flood of money makes it only more difficult to navigate a lackluster market. Since 2008, industry assets have swelled 30 percent to nearly $300 billion. Some investors worry there is too much money fighting for a limited set of opportunities.
''The rise in speculative activity and the growth in assets may eventually show that situation where the music stops quickly and there are too many people looking for chairs that don't exist,'' said Troy W. Buckner, managing principal at NuWave Investment Management, a commodity trading adviser.
Herding around certain trades could worsen any market problems. If there is a sudden move, managers could simultaneously be forced to sell - putting further downward pressure on prices.
''That's been a worry for generations, and I think the jury is still out,'' said Scott H. Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
A number of academic papers have studied the impact of computer-based trading, and ''it's very hard to find compelling evidence of them dragging prices up or down away from fundamentals and causing excess volatility,'' Mr. Irwin added.
Despite the weak performance, investors have not lost their enthusiasm for managed futures funds. Commodity trading advisers have gathered more than $28 billion in net inflows so far this year, according to BarclayHedge. More money has come into Altis than has gone out every month this year, Ms. Reeve-Gray said.
In part, institutional investors are starting to aim at managed futures funds as part of an overall diversification strategy, say industry analysts, especially because they often do well in down markets. Long-term investors tend to be less concerned about erratic returns in a single year.
''For a long time it was a stepchild,'' said Sol Waksman, president of BarclayHedge, referring to managed futures. ''As time goes on, I think the whole sector is increasing in acceptability.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Latest Drilling Rules Draw Objections

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Rules proposed recently by New York State for regulating a controversial form of natural gas drilling are drawing expressions of guarded optimism from the natural gas industry but objections from some environmentalists, who say they do not go far enough in protecting water supplies.
Environmental groups say that the state has moved toward a safer plan in its latest draft rules, especially by banning the drilling, known as horizontal hydrofracking, in state parks, wildlife preserves, and watersheds and aquifers that supply drinking water to New York residents. But it is still coming up short, some say, on issues like mapping buffer zones where drilling would be banned. 
Those zones may not be big enough to protect old water tunnels that carry water from the watersheds to New York City from drilling vibrations and drilling fluids, those groups argue. Hydrofracking involves blasting millions of gallons of water mixed with chemicals and sand into rock to extract natural gas.
And while the state plans to go further than elsewhere in the country in terms of disclosure -- companies will be required to specify the chemicals and formulas they use, even those considered proprietary, to state officials if not always to the public -- environmentalists point out that the draft does not prohibit the most toxic chemicals used in fracking, like benzene.
''It's disappointing,'' said Katherine Nadeau, the water and natural resources program director for Environmental Advocates of New York. ''New Yorkers have said repeatedly they don't want their drinking water exposed to toxic chemicals.''
The proposed rules, revised for the second time and issued this month by the State Department of Environmental Conservation, open the last stretch in a contentious three-year effort to open the way for horizontal hydrofracking drilling in New York State. After a consultant reports in a few weeks on the potential impacts on local communities, a two-month period of public comment will follow and then a final state review. Officials predict that the rules will then be issued and that the state will start issuing drilling permits next year.
Many New York residents and environmentalists have called for an outright ban on fracking. Supporters of drilling counter that it will unlock an abundant source of affordable energy and create thousands of jobs in economically moribund areas upstate.
Jim Smith, a spokesman for the Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York, said the watershed bans in the rules were not particularly troubling to the industry because the areas are not considered ''the sweet spot'' of the Marcellus Shale, the rich natural gas field where much of the drilling is planned. (Eliminating the watersheds still leaves more than 80 percent of the shale available for drilling.)
Dennis Holbrook, executive vice president of Norse Energy, a gas driller in New York, said one concern for the industry is that the state is requiring that drilling sites comply with local zoning laws, opening the possibility that some towns could prohibit drilling and in effect expand the ban beyond the areas that the state has already declared off-limits.
Some cities, like Buffalo, which sits on another untapped natural gas field known as the Utica Shale, have already passed a ban, and several municipalities are considering similar laws. But Mr. Holbrook said he was ''cautiously optimistic.''
''The optimism comes from the fact that after three years of waiting, we finally have a road map for how to proceed to develop the shale in New York State,'' he said. ''If this is what it takes to reassure the public and have this move forward, then my approach is, we'll find a way to make it work.''
Another major area of concern for environmentalists is the disposal of drilling waste. The draft calls for drillers to submit a disposal plan for state approval before a permit is issued and for instituting a tracking system so that the state can monitor where all liquids and solid wastes go. Critics say the state should go a step further and designate the waste as hazardous industrial waste, which would require testing it for hazardous materials and treating it at a hazardous waste site.
''Tracking is good, but you need more,'' said Kate Sinding, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council and a member of a new panel appointed by the state's environmental commissioner, Joseph Martens, to advise on the enforcement of the hydrofracking rules.
But Mr. Martens said that existing treatment sites for nonhazardous waste are more plentiful and could safely handle wastewater from drilling with ''modest'' modifications in their operations.
In an interview, Mr. Martens said his department's proposals reflected lessons learned from hydrofracking activity in states like Pennsylvania, including leaks and accidents, and will ensure that drilling is done safely.
He said the rules required layers of cemented well casings to prevent the migration of gas. And before using the most toxic chemicals, he said, companies will be required to prove they cannot switch to less toxic ones.
''I feel as if we've established a national standard for high-volume hydrofracking,'' Mr. Martens said.
The federal Environmental Protection Agency is also studying the safety of hydrofracking, but its initial findings are not expected until late next year. A full report is due from the agency in 2014.
Antidrilling groups contend that no matter what safeguards New York State or the federal government imposes, the drilling method carries an unacceptable level of risk. A coalition led by the consumer group Food & Water Watch opened a television advertising campaign this week in upstate New York asking people to ''tell Governor Cuomo to ban fracking.''
By contrast, the Natural Resources Defense Council and some other major environmental groups say they do not advocate a ban because it would prolong a dependence on coal-fired electricity, which produces more greenhouse gas emissions, and because they expect the state to come up with regulations strict enough to ensure safety.
Based on industry projections, the state expects to receive applications to drill 1,600 to 2,500 wells per year over an estimated 30 years in the Marcellus Shale.

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 15 about reactions to proposed New York State rules governing a type of natural gas drilling known as hydraulic fracking referred imprecisely to watersheds where such drilling will be banned. Drilling will be banned in watersheds and aquifers supplying drinking water to about 57 percent of the state's population; it will not be banned in all watersheds and aquifers in New York State.

HEADLINE: As Costs Fall For Energy, Prices Drop For Producers

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Producer prices declined in the United States in June, dragged down by a fall in energy prices like those for gasoline and electrical power, according to government statistics released Thursday.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics report showed that its index of wholesale prices fell 0.4 percent in June, after a rise of 0.2 percent in May. The decline last month was the steepest since February of last year and exceeded analysts' forecasts of a 0.2 percent drop.
The 2.8 percent decrease in energy prices was the largest drop in that category since a 4.7 percent decrease in July 2009. Prices for gasoline, which had been rising in the first part of the year partly because of turmoil in Arab oil-producing countries, moved down 4.7 percent, the department said. The decline in energy prices more than offset the rise in food, which was up 0.6 percent in June. 
When the volatile food and energy prices are extracted from the overall index, the core Producer Price Index rose 0.3 percent in June after a 0.2 percent increase in May, making it the seventh consecutive monthly rise.
The core index has risen 2.4 percent in the last year, the government report said.
That the core price index rose was ''somewhat of a relief,'' especially to the Federal Reserve, said Cliff Waldman, an economist for the Manufacturers Alliance. ''It is a sign we have gotten out of the deflationary danger zone.''
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said on Wednesday that a renewed threat of deflation was one condition that could cause the central bank to resume its economic aid campaign, called quantitative easing.
The data on producer prices was one in a series of reports on Thursday that showed the state of the economy.
In the week ended July 9, the number of initial claims for unemployment benefits was 405,000, a decrease of 22,000 from the revised figure of 427,000 in the previous week, according to the Department of Labor.
Economists said that over all the decline in the weekly number was a positive sign, at least for one week.
But a better gauge, they said, is the four-week average, which also fell but remained above 400,000, a benchmark for job growth.
''The rule of thumb is that whenever you have the four-week moving average that goes under that number, that usually is a sign associated with payroll growth,'' said Gregory Daco, the principal United States economist for IHS Global Insight.
So despite the most recent week's decline, the current numbers are ''still indicating some weakness in the unemployment market,'' he said.
The Department of Commerce reported that retail sales in the United States rose 0.1 percent in June, after a decline of 0.1 percent in May. The increase was partly a result of a rise in auto prices.
''On the auto retail sales side of things, it seems that the supply chain disruptions emanating from the mid-March earthquake in Japan are probably easing,'' said Chris G. Christopher Jr., the senior principal economist for IHS Global Insight, in a research note.
Over all, he said, the economy still has a number of pressure points. Unemployment rose to 9.2 percent in June, according to the latest government report. The stock market is volatile, consumer confidence is depressed and home prices are still scraping the bottom.
''Consumers are fatigued,'' he wrote. ''The only real good news on the consumer side of the economy is that gasoline prices started to fall, but are still relatively high.''

HEADLINE: Politics Gives Some U.S. Subsidy Programs Staying Power

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
JOHNSTOWN, Pa. -- It is called the airport to nowhere, and for years taxpayers have footed the bill.
On the outskirts of this faded steel town, the John Murtha Johnstown-Cambria County Airport boasts a modern runway, a high-tech security area and even a trendy restaurant. It lacks one thing: passengers.
Each year, Washington's Essential Air Service program pays about $1.6 million for three daily flights between here and Dulles International Airport outside Washington. Most flights have 10 or fewer people on board and the airport is virtually deserted. Many travelers drive two hours to Pittsburgh, where fares are often lower and flights are plentiful.
Governments have long financed wasteful or even unnecessary programs, but at a moment when both parties seem to agree that spending is out of control, the durability of small-town airport subsidies, which have outlasted four presidents who opposed them, underscores the political difficulties of cutting even the smallest projects. 
Subsidies for little-used airports and roads, special interests like peanut and cotton farmers and a plethora of other programs have survived thanks to powerful interest groups and strong bipartisan support in Congress. The Johnstown airport's name honors the late congressman who made sure his hometown got its fair share of Washington money.
The subsidy programs are as varied as warehouses that allow farmers to store cotton and peanuts at government expense until prices rise and an estimated $100 million tax break for owners of Nascar racetracks. Various private and government studies show that nearly $1.8 trillion over the next five years could be saved by eliminating or reducing spending on some of the subsidies.
''You can't blame the survival of these programs on just Democrats or Republicans, it's both,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who has proposed cutting several of the programs. ''But if we can't cut small programs worth millions of dollars that benefit a few, how are we going to make serious cuts and get this country on the right track?''
A close look at two programs highlights the age-old politics protecting government spending. The peanut and cotton storage program, which costs $1 million a year, has repeatedly survived cuts thanks to bipartisan support. Under the program, the government picks up storage costs for cotton and peanut farmers when they defer selling crops until prices rise. The peanut storage credits have been around since 2002. The cotton subsidy dates to the 1990s.
President George W. Bush tried to eliminate the storage credits in 2008, specifically mentioning them when he vetoed the farm bill. But his veto was overridden by a bipartisan coalition of rural lawmakers who supported farm programs and legislators from urban areas who backed food stamp and school nutrition programs.
The Obama administration has twice tried to kill the storage program, but the National Cotton Council and the American Peanut Shellers Association, as well as lawmakers from cotton and peanut producing states like Georgia and Florida, teamed up to save it.
The program's biggest champion has been Representative Sanford D. Bishop Jr., Democrat of Georgia, whose district has many of the state's nearly 3,000 peanut farmers. Mr. Bishop, a member of the Appropriations Committee, has for five years blocked efforts to cut the program, taking to the floor last month to denounce amendments to eliminate the credits.
''I'm in favor of making the necessary cuts needed to reduce our debt,'' he said in an interview. ''But it shouldn't be made off the backs of farmers, the people who produce our food.''
Mr. Bishop's allies include Representative Jack Kingston and Senator Saxby Chambliss, both Republicans from Georgia. When the program was due to expire in 2007, Mr. Kingston, who is chairman of an agriculture appropriations subcommittee, pushed to continue it. After the White House tried to scrap the payments last year, Mr. Chambliss, a member of the Agriculture Committee, said the administration was ''unfairly targeting farmers.''
But in an e-mail statement last week, Mr. Chambliss indicated that the program might not escape the Congressional ax.
''Everything must be on the table, and everyone must share in the budgeting pain,'' he said.
Like the cotton and peanut payments, the Essential Air Service program is a survivor. It began in 1978 as a $7 million effort for 10 years to help small towns keep air service when airlines were deregulated. By 1996 it was permanent, and now costs about $200 million a year covering 150 mostly small and rural communities.
After President Ronald Reagan failed to eliminate it in 1985, Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush tried, only to see Congress add money to the program. This year, Senators John McCain of Arizona and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, both Republicans, proposed ending the program, but the Senate voted it down by a wide margin.
A 2009 government report found that low-cost airlines gave travelers more options than they had decades ago. Surveys by the Transportation Department show that in more than 90 percent of the communities, travelers said they were willing to drive 150 miles or more for cheaper fares.
Still, William Polacek, vice chairman of the Johnstown-Cambria County Airport Authority, said the program was critical to growth and economic development in the area. ''Take away the flights and it would be really inconvenient for local businesses to get to other markets and for those who want to do business here,'' he said.
Airport and aviation groups have repeatedly rallied in opposition to any cuts in the program.
Roger Cohen, president of the Regional Airline Association, said the program was modest government investment.
''It's called essential for a reason,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''In many of these areas there is no other way to travel other than to drive for hours.''
A powerful coalition of rural and urban Democrats and Republicans agree, and have managed to save the program, even increase its financing this year to $200 million, up almost 50 percent.
When Mr. McCain proposed ending the program, he faced opposition from rural Republican lawmakers in Kansas and Mississippi who joined Democrats from Nebraska and West Virginia. The coalition drew support from senators like Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who said eliminating the subsidy would cost jobs and stifle growth. The Senate agreed to scale back the program to fewer cities. A House-approved bill would reduce financing for the program until 2013, before eliminating it except in Alaska and Hawaii.
The House and Senate will work out their differences but already a bipartisan effort lead by Representatives Adrian Smith, Republican of Nebraska, and Michael H. Michaud, Democrat of Maine, is under way to preserve the program.
Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group in Washington, predicted the subsidies might yet survive.
''These programs are like vampires, you just can't kill them,'' Mr. Bixby said. ''Just when you think they are dead, they manage to rise up.''

HEADLINE: Births Top Immigration For Mexican-Americans

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
The fast-growing population in the United States of people of Mexican origin increased far more in the last decade from births here than from immigration from Mexico, according to a report on Thursday by the Pew Hispanic Center.
After ''one of the largest mass migrations in modern history'' brought more than 10 million Mexicans to live in the United States from 1970 to 2007, the Pew report found, the number of immigrants arriving fell off sharply in recent years. 
At the same time, Mexican immigrants who settled here were a young group more likely to be in their child-bearing years than Americans over all, and with somewhat higher fertility rates than Americans, the center reported. From 2000 to 2010, about 7.2 million babies of Mexican origin were born in this country, the report found, while 4.2 million new immigrants arrived from Mexico.
About 31.8 million people of Mexican origin now make up 10 percent of the United States population, according to the report, and nearly two-thirds of all Hispanics in the country.
''The immigration of the last decades built up a relatively young population that is having births,'' said Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center, an author of the report. The figures, which are based on recent census data from the United States and Mexico, include Mexican-born immigrants living in this country and Hispanic Americans who trace their ancestry to Mexico. The Pew Hispanic Center is a nonpartisan research organization in Washington.
According to the report, about 39 percent of people of Mexican origin here, or 12.4 million people, are immigrants. No other country in the world has as many of its citizens living abroad as Mexico, the Pew report found.
Of those immigrants, about 6.5 million -- or nearly 6 in 10 -- are here illegally, according to Pew center research. About 227,500 children who were born in this country last year had at least one parent who was an illegal Mexican immigrant, the Pew center estimated.
In the decade from 1990 to 2000, Pew reported, the Mexican-origin population grew about equally from 4.7 million new immigrants and 4.7 million births in this country. But since 2006, as the recession took hold, the number of Mexicans coming in dropped by 60 percent, to about 404,000 new immigrants in 2010. Strong economic growth in Mexico recently may have reduced Mexicans' need to seek work in the United States, the Pew report suggests.
The surging numbers of Mexican-Americans born in this country could shift the focus of the acrimonious debate over immigration. Many illegal Mexican immigrants are part of families that include American citizens.
''The key to what kind of citizens those children will become is how they are being educated and incorporated now,'' said Robert C. Smith, professor of public affairs at Baruch College, part of the City University of New York.
If the new generation integrates successfully, Dr. Smith said, they will do the work and pay taxes to support a large generation of baby-boomer Americans who are retiring.
Along with economic stagnation, the last three years brought a far-reaching immigration crackdown here, with federal authorities deporting nearly 400,000 immigrants a year and some states adopting laws to punish illegal immigrants and force them to leave. Yet the Pew report finds that the number of Mexican immigrants leaving the United States declined, to 319,000 in 2010, from 450,000 in 2007.
These findings were confirmed by a study this week by the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research organization. It found that fewer Mexicans returned home in 2008 and 2009 than in the two years before the recession.

 BODY:
In early July, when Brian McSween caught wind of the stalled contract negotiations between the Joffrey Ballet's dancers and the administration, a development that threatens the beginning of the 2011-2 season, he had one thought: Again?
Mr. McSween, who danced in the company for 10 years and was a dancer's union representative part of that time, but who left in 2009 when his contract was not renewed, recalled a similar impasse in negotiations in the summer of 2008. Just days before a scheduled free show in Millennium Park, the dancers voted unanimously to strike. Avoiding a walkout at the 11th hour, management agreed to meet some of the dancers' requests on contentious issues like family health plans, longer rehearsal hours and wage increases, buying peace for another three years.
Now a last-minute settlement has happened again. Late Thursday, the Joffrey and its dancers reached a tentative agreement that seemed likely to allow the fall season to open on time. But it is not yet clear whether the settlement will erase the rancor that has built up for at least three years.
''Joffrey always comes back to the same topics,'' Mr. McSween, 34, said in an interview before the tentative settlement was reached. ''These types of things don't just sneak up on you.'' 
The agreement maintains health coverage as it was before the dispute, and dancers will be compensated for extra hours of work requested by management -- a key issue in the labor dispute. A ratification vote is expected by the end of next week.
On one level, the current clash between the dancers and the ballet is simply another labor dispute between an employer and its employees -- no different than Teamsters or plumbers squaring off with their bosses over the basics like pay, health care and pensions.
But the dispute, which has prompted a lockout, also focuses a spotlight on the inner workings of an artistic craft. As dancers engage in hard bargaining with their bosses, they raise issues often obscured by the marvel the public sees on stage. Along with sore muscles and gnarled feet are long hours and relatively paltry paychecks brought by the choice to work in the arts, a field known for low pay for the rank-and-file.
The Joffrey, which moved to Chicago from New York in 1995 has a total revenue that has hovered between $12 and $13 million since 2007, far below that of companies in other cities with smaller populations, like Boston and Houston. Records show that the average wage for Joffrey dancers also is below that of other midsize companies, while its managers receive six-figure salaries comparable to the companies with higher total revenues.
According to calculations based on the 2008 contract, the company's 42 dancers make an average of $829 a week for 38 weeks. The company's pension contribution, according the contract, is 5 percent.
Boston Ballet, which has total revenues of $30 million, pays its 42 dancers an average weekly salary of $1,204 for 38 weeks a year. Houston Ballet, with 53 dancers, has total revenues of $24 million and pays its dancers for 44 weeks at an average weekly salary of $1,036. Dancers at the Pennsylvania Ballet, which has $9 million in total revenues, are paid an average weekly salary of $883 for 34 weeks.
The Joffrey's most recent 2009 tax filings show that Ashley C. Wheater, the company's artistic director, is paid a base salary of $211,410. The salary of Christopher Clinton Conway, the executive director, is $169,851. By comparison, Boston's artistic director made $346,005 in 2009, Houston's made $182,205 in 2008, and Pennsylvania's made $162,000 in 2008.
When asked if Mr. Conway would speak to a reporter for this article, Beth Silverman, a Joffrey spokesman, said interviews were no longer being granted. Ms. Silverman said in an e-mailed statement: ''We are hopeful for a speedy resolution and the ability to proceed with our season uninterrupted.'' Bruce Sagan, a co-founder of the Chicago News Cooperative and a member of its board of directors, serves on the Joffrey board.
Consistent with the practices of most dance companies, the Joffrey's dancers are laid off during off weeks and usually file for unemployment compensation. When the company's season resumes, they are rehired. Joffrey dancers are idled three to four times a year, dancers said.
Few American Guild of Musical Artists, or AGMA, dance contracts include maternity leave, so sick leave is the alternative. Joffrey offers 21 days of paid sick leave for dancers with at least one year of service, the same as Pennsylvania and Boston Ballet. Houston Ballet offers 28 days followed by extended sick pay of $250 a week for a total of 52 weeks.
''Dancers having children -- it's becoming more regular in dance culture,'' said James Fayette, AGMA's dance executive for the New York area. But many contracts, he said, have yet to catch up to the trend.
As a result of the tentative agreement the guild canceled a leaflet distribution scheduled for Saturday outside Joffrey headquarters at Randolph and State Streets. Instead, dancers will resume their regular training schedule on Monday and rehearsals will begin July 25.
During labor negotiations dancers are bound by their expired contract not to speak to reporters. But the Chicago News Cooperative spoke with current and former dancers, with only the ex-Joffrey artists speaking on the record. They agreed that they expected a repeat of 2008's tumultuous negotiations.
''I am not surprised,'' said Megan McSween, Mr. McSween's wife and the dancers' union representative in 2008. Ms. McSween, 28, danced with Joffrey for eight years, leaving in 2010. ''As far as I heard, nothing had been ironed out -- it had just been slipped under the rug.''
In negotiations over a new five-year contract, the dancers were seeking a 3 percent wage increase; management offered a 2 percent raise and wanted to add five hours of rehearsal time, increasing it to 30 hours each week.
According to Barbara Hillman, the dancers' union lawyer, said the company had proposed to end its three family health plans. ''The company wants to take it all away,'' she said.
A low point in the negotiations occurred July 1, when negotiations foundered, and the company sent a letter to dancers informing them that they would be locked out and telling them to clean out their lockers and turn in their keycards.
''It would have been nice if they had told us that they had a deadline, which they didn't,'' Ms. Hillman said. ''They are just trying to scare them.''
But dancers say that years of push-and-pull have contributed to a change in the Joffrey work environment in which both sides lose.
''It's just a shame; it is certainly not the family it once was,'' Mr. McSween said. ''It's cost dancers the ability to be in a positive working environment. It's cost the company the opportunity to grow and be a cohesive unit.''
Ms. McSween added: ''The administration, they don't see the toll it takes on the dancers. They only see it from a dollar-sign perspective.''
The Joffrey is not alone in its labor strife. In the winter of 2005, ballet's most lucrative season with Nutcracker performances, the Washington Ballet locked out dancers after negotiations faltered.
''These labor disputes could happen to any company,'' said Wendy Perron, editor in chief of Dance Magazine.
Despite the Joffrey's labor problems, Ms. Perron said the company has shown improvement since Mr. Wheater's arrival in 2007.
''I think Ashley raised the level of the dancing and brought a more cogent program to the whole thing,'' Ms. Perron said. ''They're a company that's on their way back up to be one of the handful of great ballet companies in the country.''
Ms. Hillman said that in the history of her negotiations for AGMA, beginning in 1988, she has never witnessed a work stoppage, and she is optimistic that both the dancers and the administration will come to an agreement.
''The purpose of negotiations,'' she said, ''is getting to a 'yes.' ''
But even beyond the struggles on stage and in the negotiating room, the life of a dancer is trying, Mr. McSween said.
''Every day you're looking in the mirror, looking at what things you don't like about yourself and what needs to be fixed,'' he said. ''This life is not easy.''

HEADLINE: Outlaws Make Better Lunches

BYLINE: By ZACH BROOKS. 
Zach Brooks runs the Web site Midtown Lunch.

 BODY:
THE past few years have been a golden age for street food in New York City. You could get just about anything from a food truck in Midtown Manhattan -- from waffles and schnitzel to halal chicken and lamb over rice -- despite the fact that street vending is for all intents and purposes illegal there.
Last month police officers in Midtown cracked down and asked many trucks to leave their spots. Everyone is blaming a court case in May, in which a New York State Supreme Court justice reinforced a regulation saying that no ''vendor, hawker or huckster'' can sell merchandise from a vehicle parked in a metered space. But although enforcement was scattershot, that regulation has been used against Midtown food trucks for decades. 
The crackdown's real catalyst was the recent explosion of high-end food trucks in Midtown. For the first time, blocks were host to three or four trucks at once. And instead of the old-school food vendors, who are often immigrants used to navigating the gray areas of the business, most of these trucks were operated by a new breed of entrepreneur looking to capitalize on what (falsely) appeared to be the hippest, most profitable trend in the food business.
Food truck regulations have always been purposefully vague and selectively enforced in New York City. The government does not want to strip the city of one of its treasures (can you imagine a New York without hot dogs?) nor can it fully legalize street vending, because opening up hundreds of rent-free spots would damage the real estate economy.
So street vendors and the city long ago struck a tacit deal: the city allows vendors to sell food but reserves the right to kick them out of practically any spot at any time, and vendors keep their heads down, careful not to upset their relationships with the nearby brick-and-mortar businesses, with the police, and with each other. When disputes come up, vendors compromise or move.
Many of the new food trucks' operators have ignored these unwritten rules. Some early entrants onto the scene, like the Treats Truck and Wafels & Dinges, spent months cultivating spots and relationships, which allowed them to settle into areas that were previously unoccupied. But many new trucks have taken the quicker route, parking where others have found success rather than trying to create a space of their own.
As a result brick-and-mortar business owners who tolerated one truck out front one or two days a week started seeing more and more each day, and eventually got fed up and called the police. Even as an ardent food truck supporter, I find it hard not to sympathize. They pay high rents, only to see food trucks parking free on their doorsteps. There is no denying that the increase in food trucks is unsustainable.
Some are tempted to look to other cities, like Los Angeles, arguably the birthplace of the high-end food truck trend, for solutions. But it is facing an almost identical situation. Mexican vendors called loncheros spent years working out a compromise with the city that allowed them to sell food without interfering with brick-and-mortar businesses, but a wave of fancy food trucks parking in high traffic areas led to a similar crackdown.
Portland, Ore., which has become a mecca for street-food lovers, rents out spots in privately owned parking lots to vendors. But those food trucks operate more like restaurants than street vendors. New York is trying something similar in a Queens parking lot and under the High Line, an elevated park in Manhattan, but it won't do much good for trucks or lunchers in the city's more crowded areas.
Some vendors and food-truck fans are circulating a petition asking the city to change the parking rule. But even if it does, other regulations still make most Midtown parking spots off limits. As tempting as it is to try to change New York City's laws and establish clear rules for vendors, it's not likely to happen. And it shouldn't.
Vendors and fans are actually better served by the status quo. New York's street food scene is unique and vibrant precisely because it exists in that legal gray area. Traditionally only immigrant and small mom-and-pop businesses were willing to risk the city's intermittent crackdowns. The vague rules have long deterred any passionless big businesses looking for the next lucrative franchise. Turn street spots into legal real estate controlled by the city, and it will be only a matter of time before street food becomes just as bland and generic as that of any fast-food restaurant in Midtown.
So instead of fighting to change the laws, vendors who are passionately committed to their food trucks should do what street hawkers in New York have always done after big crackdowns like this one: wait for it to end and then return to Midtown bit by bit, in a way that is respectful to the rent-paying businesses. Or ditch the truck and open a brick-and-mortar business. It's the way New York street food has endured for the past 150 years, and the only way it will be here for 150 more.

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise listed. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.
Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Super Stars: Quilts From the American Folk Art Museum' (through Sept. 25) This location is featuring 20 quilts in which stars figure in some way, whether as pieced-together geometric forms or as little tufts of thread that suggest a distant galaxy. American Folk Art Museum Lincoln Square Branch, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) 
- Brooklyn Museum: 'Lorna Simpson: Gathered' (through Aug. 21) Much of Lorna Simpson's photo-based work has been about African-American identity approached from an oblique and elusive perspective. She returns to that theme in new ways in the two installations and video that make up this small show, which includes some 300 framed photographs hung in grid formation on a long gallery wall. Roughly half the pictures are vintage 1950s pinup images of young black women (and a few men) alluringly posed in domestic settings. The rest are of Ms. Simpson herself, posed and dressed like the figures in the photographs, as if to suggest overlooked connections between the present and the past. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
- Brooklyn Museum: 'Vishnu: Hinduism's Blue-Skinned Savior' (through Oct. 2) Hindu sculptures are no ordinary things. Concentrations of spiritual energy so dense as to turn physics inside out, they funnel light from other universes into our mundane world. The light takes a little time to penetrate this show, dauntingly crowded with objects, ideas and information. But it shines through in the end as we trace the many earthly forms taken by one of Hinduism's greatest gods and arrive at the spiritual matinee idol named Krishna. With his sapphire skin and sweet flute songs, he radiates devotional love, and everyone falls for him, including us. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Guggenheim Museum: 'The Hugo Boss Prize 2010: Hans-Peter Feldmann' (through Nov. 2) Mr. Feldmann, the septuagenarian German artist who was the surprise pick for the Boss Prize honors, has decided to exhibit his prize money in the form of 100,000 $1 bills, pinned to the wall of one of the Guggenheim's Tower galleries. What sounds on paper like a conceptual stunt or a riff on Warholian materialism becomes overpoweringly physical in person, thanks to the smell of the used bills and the traces of their circulation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
Guggenheim Museum: 'Lee Ufan: Marking Infinity' (through Sept. 28) This five-decade retrospective fills the museum with about 90 works in a Zen-Minimalist, be-here-now vein by a Korean artist who lives in Paris and Japan. Sculptures consist of ordinary, pumpkin-size boulders juxtaposed with sheets and slabs of dark, glossy steel. Paintings made of wide brush strokes executed in gridded order on raw canvas exemplify tension between action and restraint. In its always near-perfect composure, Mr. Lee's art teeters perilously between art and decor. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Ken Johnson)
- International Center of Photography: 'Elliott Erwitt: Personal Best' (through Aug. 28) Like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Mr. Erwitt seeks ''the decisive moment,'' an instant in real time when people, animals or objects appear before the camera in surprising, funny and illuminating ways. The Henny Youngman of photographic one-liners, he delivers visual humor with such economy and grace that it is easy to overlook just how excellent an artist he is. This show presents more than 100 of his favorite images from the past seven decades. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)
International Center of Photography: 'Hiroshima: Ground Zero 1945' (through Aug. 28) The contact prints and photographs in this show were made in connection with the 1947 United States Strategic Bombing Survey of Hiroshima and depict the cataclysmic devastation in unflinching detail. The survey texts that accompany the images may appear shockingly clinical. The caption on a picture of a library, or what remains of it, reads: ''Interior first story showing contents damage and spalling of cement plaster by fire. Note all books reduced to ashes.'' 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Rosenberg)
Jewish Museum: 'Collecting Matisse and Modern Masters: The Cone Sisters of Baltimore' (through Sept. 25) This exhibition samples the extraordinary trove of European art amassed by two American spinsters in the first half of the 20th century, work now owned by the Baltimore Museum of Art. Although some major collection highlights are absent, the pieces here -- presented in the order of acquisition -- generate a compelling portrait of the Cones as collectors. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Jewish Museum: 'Maira Kalman: Various Illuminations (of a Crazy World)' (through July 31) Like her fellow New Yorker magazine contributors Ed Koren and Roz Chast, Ms. Kalman offers gently humorous cartoon commentary on the trials and tribulations of modern metropolitan life. Ranging in style from faux-naive eccentricity to suave realism, the more than two decades worth of drawings and paintings on paper in this career survey make for an entertaining if not deeply provocative experience. With a flea market-like installation of nondescript objects from her personal collection, however, she tries too hard to be amazingly original. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Andean Tunic, 400 B.C.E.-1800 C.E.' (through Sept. 18) This small show celebrates the festive yet functional garments woven south of the equator. To the modern eye, they're wearable paintings; lovers of Keith Haring and Elizabeth Murray will find much to admire. So will anyone interested in the complex relationships among art, clothing, ritual and power. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Anthony Caro on the Roof' (through Oct. 30) No one in the 1960s produced groovier abstract sculpture than the British artist Anthony Caro, five of whose heavy metal assemblages grace the Met's Rooftop Garden. But only one of these works has that startling, newborn feeling. Sporting a new coat of shiny, taxicab-yellow paint, ''Midday'' (1960) has the look of a jaunty, industrial dinosaur. The others, dating from 1968 to 2010, show a development toward an increasingly conservative, ponderous monumentality. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty' (through Aug. 7) A triumph for this British fashion designer -- who died at 40, by his own hand, last year -- and for the curator Andrew Bolton of the Met's Costume Institute, this career retrospective is ethereal and gross, graceful and manipulative, and poised on a line where fashion turns into something else. The operatic spectacle is pushed along by soundtrack of wind, Handel and orgiastic moans, and has a holographic image of Kate Moss spinning like a moth in a flame at the center. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Mother India: The Goddess in Indian Painting' (through Nov. 27) Sculptures, paintings and drawings from the Met's collection represent various manifestations of Devi, the Great Mother goddess who is thought to be the most popular all Indian deities. Among works dating from the first millennium B.C. to 1990 are pieces of exceptional beauty, including a small, 12th-century argillite sculpture depicting the 16-armed Durga slaying her most fearsome opponent, Mahishasura, after he emerges from the lopped neck of his buffalo disguise. Carved in extraordinarily refined detail, it is a marvel of formal and metaphorical concentration. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Night Vision: Photography After Dark' (through Sept. 18) It wasn't until the gelatin dry-plate process was introduced in the late 1880s that exposure time was lowered enough for photographs to be taken regularly after dark. Alfred Stieglitz was among the first to photograph New York at night. His work is shown alongside Berenice Abbott's spectral ''Nightview, New York'' from 1932, taken from the window of a skyscraper; Brassai's nocturnal views of Paris; and Weegee's high-contrast picture of a crime scene. Diane Arbus, Bill Brandt, Robert Frank, Garry Winogrand and Kohei Yoshiyuki are among the other artists included in this modest, lovely show of 40 black-and-white photographs drawn from the museum's collection, which stops a couple of decades short of the present. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Poetry in Clay: Korean Buncheong Ceramics from Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art' (through Aug. 14) This beautiful exhibition presents bottles, vases, bowls and dishes made by 15th- and 16th-century Korean artisans. In shades of gray, from creamy and opalescent off-whites to deep, warm blacks, the anonymous craftsmen covered vessels with loosely rendered images of flora and fauna and fine-grained patterns of dots and tiny blossoms. These infectiously lively works look as if they'd been made not centuries but only decades ago. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Richard Serra Drawing: A Retrospective' (through Aug. 28) Few artists have pushed drawing to such sculptural and even architectural extremes as Mr. Serra, so it makes sense that his adamantine pursuit of the medium, surveyed in an installation that he largely designed himself, is not quite like anything seen at the Met before. There are moments of off-putting starkness on Mr. Serra's side and some of the usual architectural infelicities on the Met's, but as a demonstration of this august institution's willingness to engage with genuinely radical, physically unsettling art of recent vintage, the show is cause for hope.

MoMA PS1: 'Laurel Nakadate: Only the Lonely' (through Aug. 8) Laurel Nakadate might be on the cusp of a great new career. She is known for disconcerting, sad and sexually provocative videos that she enlisted older, worse-for-wear men to participate in, but in the past three years she has made two feature-length films. Included in this enthralling survey of her 10-year career, they focus with lingering, heart-aching care on adolescent girls, lost souls looking for love and only getting into trouble. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
- MoMA PS1: Ryan Trecartin: 'Any Ever' (through Sept. 3) This game-changing show of seven related videos, viewed amid eccentric seating arrangements procured mostly from Ikea, reflects the combined imagination of a supertalented young artist and his band of merry, cross-dressing pranksters. The results teeter giddily at the intersection of art, reality television and social networking; forge an integration of video and installation art, not to mention a blend of actual life and animation undreamt of by Walt Disney; and evince an aspirational faith in the potential of uninhibited self-expression, both individual and collective, to counter the mounting materialism of everyday life. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens; (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Smith)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'The Age of Elegance: The Joan Taub Ades Collection' (through Aug. 28) This small but engrossing exhibition presents about three dozen works dating from the mid-17th to the late 19th centuries by European artists, each in his own way a draftsman of consummate skill. Some names, like Boucher and Millais, are familiar; most will be known only to art historical specialists. Ranging from postcard to laptop size, including portraiture, still-life and mythological scenes, they exemplify the fine but now endangered art of drawing at its best. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Johnson)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Illuminating Fashion: Dress in the Art of Medieval France and the Netherlands' (through Sept. 4) Medieval illuminations -- so rich in narrative, embellishment and religious expression -- can display sartorial trends that can help experts date manuscripts and discern the subtleties of a figure's status or character. There are many examples here, as well as mannequins in full-scale model attire -- say, a splendid hunting ensemble of gold-embroidered blue velvet and lilac wool felt for the men, and for the women, a princessy gown of yellow silk trimmed in black crushed velvet, accessorized by a turret. This lively show will teach you to scrutinize centuries-old manuscripts as you would a style magazine. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- El Museo del Barrio: 'El Museo's Bienal: The (S) Files 2011' (through Jan. 8) Because of a long renovation of El Museo del Barrio's Fifth Avenue building, four years have passed since the museum's last biannual survey of new Latino, Caribbean and Latin American art. As if to make up for lost time, the new edition is the biggest so far, including work by 75 artists spread over seven shows in four boroughs, with the main event at El Museo itself. The ''S'' this year is for ''Street,'' which covers everything from graffiti to junk sculpture to painted cityscapes, and some of the work has problems with focus. Yet taking the street as a subject opens the possibility to at least think about other subjects, like money for artists, and the lack of it. Other segments of the show now on display are at Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, Queens, and Lehman College Art Gallery in the Bronx; a Brooklyn show is scheduled to start in November. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Arts and Design: 'Otherworldly: Optical Delusions and Small Realities' (through Sept. 18) In the age of the flat screen, a show about the diorama sounds charmingly naive. Yet ''Otherworldly'' circles back to the two-dimensional image in ways that feel very sophisticated. A good number of the show's more than 40 artists build model homes, cities and landscapes mainly to photograph them. At times the exhibition feels like a Hollywood film-studio tour in miniature. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Access to Tools: Publications From the Whole Earth Catalog, 1968-1974' (through July 26) Brainchild of the visionary techno-hippie artist Steward Brand, the Whole Earth Catalog did for counterculture youth in the '60s what the Sears catalog did for children of the Great Depression and what Google does for people of the Internet age: provide a way for ordinary citizens to connect with and make use of the global economy. This modest but stirring time capsule of an exhibition presents various editions of the catalog, along with a mind-expanding array of books, magazines and ephemera that influenced or exemplified its holistic mission. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Francis Alys: A Story of Deception' (through Aug. 1) This possibly premature, hit-and-miss survey of the quixotic, politically aware yet obstinately poetic art of this Belgian artist, who has lived in Mexico since 1986, whipsaws a visitor between engagement and boredom, serious consideration and dismissal. In the show, at MoMA and its PS1 site in Queens (closes Sept. 12), the best works are videos, but the split exhibition is garnished, you might say, with sometimes appealing paintings and sculptures and also dulled with extensive backup materials: studies, notes, texts and newspaper clippings pertaining to most of the works on view. Too often the result confirms this museum's blind faith in the wan, cerebral machinations of late-late-late Conceptualism. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'I Am Still Alive: Politics and Everyday Life in Contemporary Drawing' (through Sept. 19) This show of contemporary drawings (most acquired since 2005) is anchored by a group of telegrams sent by the Japanese artist On Kawara to friends and associates; each one bears the message ''I am still alive.'' The artists seem to be in a permanent state of wariness and suspicion, which is sometimes the result of political instability and at other times more innate. But their efforts to process matters of life and death in short bursts of creative activity feel very of the moment. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Boris Mikhailov: Case History' (through Sept. 5) This exhibition's visceral photographs of homeless people in Ukraine are not for the squeamish. The 19 photos, large-format examples from a series of more than 400 images produced in the late 1990s, portray people in grungy rooms or in wintry outdoor sites naked or pulling aside their clothes to expose parts of their bodies. Thus Mr. Mikhailov protests a society that allows people to fall into such substandard states and conditions. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Neue Galerie: 'Vienna 1900: Style and Identity' (through Aug. 8) One of history's more fraught fin-de-siecle efflorescences of art and thought is recounted in a shifting kaleidoscope of paintings, drawings, architectural models, posters and several species of decorative arts. Among paintings by Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele, there is also a re-creation of Freud's psychoanalytic couch, an eye-popping tribute to the Vienna Secession and a crowded face-off between the designer-theoreticians Josef Hoffmann and Adolf Loos. Over all, it resembles a tasting menu with enough rich and disparate flavors that the gaps and omissions can be overlooked. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Cory Arcangel: Pro Tools' (through Sept. 11) This solo turn from Mr. Arcangel, the digital wunderkind, artist-musician and inveterate hacker, seems a trifle scrubbed clean, sanitized and austere. Containing work almost entirely from 2011, it tells us little of his funkier early digital efforts or artistic development. A few pieces reflect his longstanding interest in television and video games; in others he tries too hard to establish his formalist bona fides with wry riffs on abstract painting and sculpture. Mr. Arcangel seems guided by a somewhat callow faith in the avant-garde, striving to perpetuate its tradition, dating from Duchamp, of laying claim to new areas of nonart for art's sake. Sometimes he succeeds, but not always. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Breaking Ground: The Whitney's Founding Collection' (through Sept. 18) In anticipation of its move to a new home in 2015, the Whitney is cooking up a series of six back-to-back experimental permanent collection shows at its present location. The first of them is a sampler of the earliest work in the holdings, and as a summary of the institution's initial view of American Modernism, what a curious thing it is. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
Galleries: 57th Street
Willem de Kooning: 'The Figure: Movement and Gesture' (through July 29) This artist's own words -- brilliant as usual -- set the stage for this riveting show: ''The figure is nothing unless you twist it around like a strange miracle.'' The 32 mutually illuminating paintings, drawings and sculptures ranging from the late 1960s through the '70s are full of such twists and miracles, emerging from and then slipping back into extravagantly lush, unstable masses of brushwork. The capacity of these marks to read alternately as real -- even anatomically correct -- and malformed and abstract is one reason for the continuing relevance of de Kooning's art. Pace Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, thepacegallery.com. (Smith)
- John O'Reilly: 'Recent Montage' (through July 29) Although the artist John O'Reilly is 81, his work hasn't been in the public eye all that long. He made his small, intricate photo montages in private for decades before he came to art-world notice in the 1995 Whitney Biennial. The recent works at de Nagy, including pieces dedicated to Hart Crane and Marsden Hartley, combine images from art history, gay pornography and found vintage photographs, supplemented by photographs taken by -- and of -- Mr. O'Reilly himself. The result is boldly self-effacing and self-insistent art. Tibor de Nagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 262-5050, tibordenagy.com. (Cotter)
Leo Villareal: 'Volume' (through Aug. 19) You might just want to sit and gaze in blissful stupefaction at ''Cylinder,'' the single-light sculpture featured here. It consists of 160 12-foot-long lengths of shiny stainless steel, each with 140 light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, along one edge, hanging in five concentric circles to create a cylindrical volume nine feet in diameter. The thousands of computer-controlled lights flicker in the darkness, generating all kinds of patterns and a fascinating beauty. Gering & Lopez, 730 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (646) 336-7183, geringlopez.com. (Johnson)
Galleries: Chelsea
Sol LeWitt: 'Arcs and Lines' (through Aug. 26) This extraordinary show features three gridded wall drawings by the eminent Conceptual-Minimalist Sol LeWitt (1928-2007), most prominently the airy and ebullient ''Wall Drawing #122'' from 1972, a spare work in blue crayon that wraps almost perfectly around the gallery's large central space. Featuring combinations of two straight, wavy, curved or broken lines in each compartment of the grid, its vaulting composition evokes Matisse's blue nudes, brisk Alpine views and even the blinking sweep of a radar screen, exemplifying both the economy and rich suggestiveness of LeWitt's art. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Smith)
'Perfectly Damaged' (through Aug. 17) The works by 20 artists in this evocative exhibition are only apparently damaged. Graham Collins subtly alters old, beat-up boards. Valerie Hegarty's portrait of George Washington looks as if it survived a house fire. Michael DeLucia pairs a real, much dented washing machine with a plaster simulation of its undamaged state, suggesting a comparison of the imperfectly real and the Platonic ideal. Derek Eller Gallery, 615 West 27th Street, (212) 206-6411, derekeller.com. (Johnson)
'The Phantasm' (through July 29) With galleries selling so many neat, cute, stylish things these days, it's tempting to say that art has become just a fancy version of interior decorating. This group show more or less does say that, but it adds a few kinks to the domestic picture, with dirt-smudged walls, a camouflage-patterned sari and a film of an Aboriginal welfare mom juggling at-home visits from a pesky social worker and a disabled relative. Foxy Production, 623 West 27th Street, (212) 239-2758, foxyproduction.com. (Cotter)
- Jason Polan: 'Living and Working' (through July 29) This solo debut introduces an artist who is more or less drawing his way through life, as well as his own show. He will continue adding works to the display, which includes, among much else, a ''life-size'' drawing of the head of King Kong, a decorated but useable table-tennis table and (my favorite) a wall covered with smudgy drawings of dense black circles, large, medium and small. Nicholas Robinson Gallery, 535 West 20th Street, (212) 560-9075, nrgallery.com. (Smith)
- Jo Ractliffe: 'Terras do Fim do Mundo (The Lands of the End of the World)' (through Aug. 13) At first glance, this South African photographer's black-and-white shots of sun-baked Angolan landscapes look random and bland: rocks, dirt, scrubby trees; some handwritten signs but no people. Only when you read some of the titles -- ''Mass Grave at Cassinga,'' ''Minefield Near Mupa'' -- do you learn where people are, or once were, and the pictures snap into expressive focus. The Walther Collection Project Space, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 718, (212) 352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)
Jessica Rohrer: 'Oakridge Road' (through July 23) In Ms. Rohrer's many small, meticulous paintings on panels and paper of her domestic environment, every element -- from a half-squeezed tube of toothpaste in a crammed medicine cabinet to leaves on trees outside bay windows -- is defined cleanly and exactly. There is something odd about how industrious she is. It is as if a mad hausfrau or a Stepford wife had become obsessed with conducting an inventory of every single thing in her fanatically groomed world. P.P.O.W., 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 647-1044, ppowgallery.com. (Johnson)
- Vladimir Tatlin: 'Monument to the Third International' (through July 29) Concocted by a founder of Russian Constructivism between 1915 and 1920, following close encounters with the Eiffel Tower and Picasso's guitar constructions in Paris, this tilting, spiraling, viaduct-like structure is one of early Modernism's most ambitious and best-known works of unrealized architecture, embodied by one of its biggest architectural models. Shown in the United States for the first time -- the oldest (1967) remake of the original model, which disappeared around 1932 -- it is dense with portents of 20th-century sculpture to come, from LeWitt's grids to Smithson's jetty. Tony Shafrazi, 544 West 26th Street, (212) 274-9300, tonyshafrazigallery.com. (Smith)
Richard Tuttle: 'What's the Wind' (through July 22) Working quite a bit larger than usual, this Post-Minimalist master of seeming trifles presents a series of deftly cobbled-together thingamajigs that charm and challenge. Each presents a kind of stage-set-like open volume of sculptural events patched together from colorful, lightweight materials and objects. The result is a somewhat slovenly, art-supplies Constructivism that is characteristically light, ephemeral and full of joy. Pace Gallery, 510 West 24th Street, (212) 255-4044, thepacegallery.com. (Smith)
- B. Wurtz: 'Works 1970-2011' (through Aug. 5) This wryly beautiful, morally invigorating retrospective highlights the playful, plain-spoken sculptures and wall pieces of the artist known by the gender-vague signature B. Wurtz. Cobbled together from carefully selected scraps of wood and wire, plastic grocery bags, food packaging, buttons, shoelaces and the occasional porcelain sink leg, his acts of ingenious recycling channel Duchamp and Calder while bringing existing materials and artistic thought into an unusually clear, mutually enhancing alignment. Against the profligacy of so much of today's art world, they constitute a quiet refusal, a rebellious act of abstinence that results in its own kind of fullness. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropictures.com. (Smith)
Galleries: SoHo
'The Atomic Explosion: A Collection of Vintage Photographs' (through July 29) This show gathers 66 images of American nuclear tests and detonations, most of them conducted at the Nevada Test Site and on the Marshall Islands during the 1940s and '50s. The massing mushroom clouds in these images, photographed from miles away, are made to seem benignly organic. A giant portobello rises over Bikini Atoll; slender enokis sprout in Nevada. The news-service captions on many of the prints feel just as innocuous; one compares a double-capped cloud to ''a giant dumbbell.'' Peter Blum SoHo, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, peterblumgallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Drew Heitzler (through July 29) This solo by a surf-obsessed, Los Angeles-based artist draws on source material both wet (surfer films and television shows) and dry (critical theory). The three-channel video installation ''Spiral Jetty/Crystal Voyager/Region Centrale (Bootlegged, Re-ordered, Combined, Sometimes More, Sometimes Less)'' appropriates 1970s classics by Robert Smithson, Michael Snow and George Greenough and finds the common ground in surfing, Land Art and structural film. Renwick Gallery, 45 Renwick Street, (212) 609-3535, renwickgallery.com. (Rosenberg)
'Wu Tsang' (through Aug. 5) Transgender identity, long the basis of a lifestyle, now the muscle behind a political movement, is finding a voice in mainstream art. The young artist Wu Tsang is one of its most visible representatives. Born in 1982, living in Los Angeles and self-identified as a ''butch queen in heels,'' he mixes art and politics in about equal proportions. A short film, set in a bar and called ''Damelo Todo'' (''Give Me Everything''), is the main event here. Clifton Benevento, 515 Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 431-6325, cliftonbenevento.com. (Cotter)
Galleries: Other
'North by New York: New Nordic Art' (through Aug. 19) Emotional restraint is the rule with this diverse selection of works by 15 contemporary Scandinavian artists. Gunnel Wahlstrand's big, black-and-white, photorealistic ink drawing of a boy in jacket and tie reading at his bedroom desk is technically impressive and coolly depressing. Most engaging is a half-hour video like a home-movie scrapbook called ''My Life'' by Marja Viitahuhta. In a laconic voice-over, a fictional female narrator mentions significant events for each of her 99 years, ending with the stoic statement, ''I die.'' Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 779-3587, scandinaviahouse.org. (Johnson)
- 'Paul Clay' (through July 30) The ever-lively ceramics arts -- so currently fashionable they may be the new video -- deserve more orderly and respectful attention than this jampacked show and its punning title. (Paul Clay? All Klee?) Still, with some 45 artists spanning from elder statesmen like Ken Price and Ron Nagle to newly minted Columbia University M.F.A.'s to unfamiliar talents from Japan and South Africa, and works that range from jewelry and tea bowls to large-scale sculpture, it is an achievement that will expand anyone's horizons. Salon 94 Bowery, 243 Bowery, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 979-0001, salon94.com. (Smith)
- 'Time Again' (through July 25) In this contest between curatorial imagination and curatorial pretension, imagination mostly triumphs, especially if you give a wide berth to the arcane discussions in the catalog and a belabored show-within-the-show. The efforts of 18 artists from different generations supposedly explore ''the language of repetition'' and its ability to change our experience of the present, but mostly the familiar strategies of appropriation, collage, assemblage and quotation prevail. Still, the selections are often strong, especially in photo-based works and films including those by Emily Roysdon, Laure Prouvost, Rosemarie Trockel, Rosalind Nashashibi, Aurelien Froment and Steve Roden, whose varied contributions make him the show's star. SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Smith)
Public Art
'Mark di Suvero at Governors Island: Presented by Storm King Art Center' (through Sept. 25) With 11 works spanning more than three decades, this show organized by Storm King Art Center, the 500-acre sculpture park in the Hudson Valley, is Mark di Suvero's biggest New York City survey since 1975. The all-outdoor exhibition works alongside the island's packed calendar of activities and festivals, offering bike riders and picnickers culture by osmosis. Plan to spend some time along the island's southern end, where four of Mr. di Suvero's best sculptures engage the waterfront and one another in invigorating ways. Governors Island, govisland.com. (Rosenberg)
Eva Rothschild: 'Empire' (through Aug. 28) At the southeast entrance to Central Park stands a colorful, tubular structure resembling a swing-set frame designed by spiders on LSD. Touching ground at 10 points on the cobbled plaza, its red, green and black striped posts rise at different angles into an airy web over 18 feet at its highest point. A playful riff on the ancient form of the triumphal arch, ''Empire'' will be a required photo-op for tourists and other visitors. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, Central Park, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Cotter)
Out Of Town
- Anacostia Community Museum: 'Word, Shout, Song: Lorenzo Dow Turner, Connecting Communities Through Language' (through July 24) Housed in a converted movie theater in a predominantly African-American neighborhood that is a cab ride's distance from the National Mall, the Anacostia Community Museum is one of Washington's cultural secrets. Its exhibition on the scholar Lorenzo Dow Turner (1890-1972), who documented surviving traces of African languages and customs in modern African-American culture, is both an archival homage and a well-paced drama of ideas. Smithsonian Institution, 1901 Fort Place SE, Washington, (202) 633-4820, anacostia.si.edu. (Cotter)
- The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery, Skidmore College: 'Environment and Object: Recent African Art' (through July 31) Contemporary African art can mean many things: art made in Africa, or by someone from Africa living elsewhere, or by someone not from Africa but of African descent. All definitions apply in this stimulating show, as do variant readings of the rest of exhibition title. This is very much a show of objects, with several environments or installations. At the same time, the environment itself, meaning the natural world, under dire threat, is the subject of much of the art. 815 North Broadway, Saratoga Springs, N.Y., (518) 580-8080, tang.skidmore.edu. (Cotter)
- Neuberger Museum of Art: 'Art in Cameroon: Sculptural Dialogues' (through Aug. 14) With 30 sculptures, two from the Neuberger's holdings, this show isn't large, but some of the pieces are spellbinders, given plenty of room to work their magic. Highlights are two figures, one of a man, the other of a woman, both elderly, found in the same area of Cameroon in 1910, taken to different collections in Europe and reunited here, in silent conversation, after some 75 years.

Last Chance
- Tom Fairs: 'Drawings' (closes on Friday) You might mistake the small, town-and-country drawings in this lovely show for the works of an early 20th-century follower of Pierre Bonnard. The truth is that the British painter Tom Fairs (1925-2007) did not begin producing art full time until after his retirement from teaching at age 60. Working with soft pencils, he drew the outdoor world with an almost shocking avidity. This show, the first solo ever devoted to Fairs's work, is inspiring. KS Art, 73 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-9918, kerryschuss.com. (Johnson)
- Picasso and Marie-Therese: 'L'Amour Fou' (closes on Friday) While falling short of the exhibition of late Picasso paintings and prints that filled this space two years ago, the latest Gagosian exegesis into Picasso land is a wonderfully motley, almost scattershot affair, brilliantly installed. It presents works, in all mediums and several styles, that Picasso made during the late 1920s and '30s, when he was under the spell of the voluptuous, Roman-nosed, level-eyed, full-limbed Marie-Therese Walter, arguably the love of his life. Anchored by this single if perpetually mutating subject, the art on hand confirms that when Picasso told Walter she had saved his life, he meant that she had also saved his art. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com. (Smith)
Tyson Reeder (closes on Friday) Mr. Reeder, an art-world multitasker in Milwaukee who paints and organizes special events, is back in Chelsea for his first New York solo show in five years. He brings some of that peripatetic energy to his new paintings of heads and landscapes, which dart from Picabia to Fautrier to the Post-Impressionists. The heads in particular are richly varied. A natty bow-tied figure with masklike features, shaped with firm strokes of the palette knife, builds on Dubuffet; a loosely contoured cranium, with its pastel palette and palm trees, suggests Polke in Key West, Fla. Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-4949, danielreichgallery.com. (Rosenberg)

HEADLINE: Taking a Look at the Governor, Back When He Was a Democrat

BYLINE: By JAY ROOT; Chris Hooks contributed reporting.. 
jroot@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Gov. Rick Perry, a no-apologies conservative known for slashing government spending and opposing all tax increases, is about as Republican as you can get.
But that was not always the case.
Mr. Perry spent his first six years in politics as a Democrat, in a somewhat forgotten history that is sure to be revived and scrutinized by Republican opponents if he decides to run for president.
A raging liberal he was not. Elected to represent a slice of rural West Texas in the State House in 1984, Mr. Perry, a young rancher and former Air Force pilot from Paint Creek, about 60 miles north of Abilene, gained an early reputation as a fiscal conservative. He was one of a handful of freshman ''pit bulls,'' so named because they sat in the lower pit of the House Appropriations Committee, where they fought to keep spending low.
But Mr. Perry cast some votes and took a few stands that seem to be at odds with his fiscal conservatism today. The most vivid example is his support of the $5.7 billion tax hike in 1987, signed by Gov. Bill Clements, a Republican, opposed by most Republican members. The bill passed the House by a 78-70 vote. 
Even without adjusting for inflation, the legislation triggered the largest tax increase ever passed in modern Texas, said Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association. Today, taking inflation into account, it would be worth more than $11 billion.
Mr. Craymer said the new taxes were used to plug a huge budget shortfall, with the money representing about 20 percent of the general revenue raised during that two-year budget period.
Almost a quarter-century later, Mr. Perry, as governor, was faced with a similar budget shortfall. But he took a markedly different tack this session, opposing any new taxes and signing a budget that made the first reduction in overall spending on public education since at least 1949.
Mark Miner, Mr. Perry's spokesman, said votes cast decades ago do not undermine the governor's overall record, which he said included the largest property-tax cut in state history, enacted in 2006.
''You can pull votes from the 1980s, but the overall track record is one of fiscal responsibility and conservatism,'' Mr. Miner said.
As a House Democrat, Mr. Perry was also the co-author of legislation aimed at tripling the amount of money state legislators are paid, House records show. In a 1989 interview with The Abilene Reporter-News, Mr. Perry cited the financial hardships Texas legislators faced trying to make a living back home while making a yearly salary of only $7,200 as part-time lawmakers. Voters rejected the proposal in a statewide referendum.
Mr. Miner said Mr. Perry no longer favored giving legislators a pay increase.
Another political move Mr. Perry made back then: he was a top Texas supporter and organizer in 1988 for Al Gore, who ran as a Southern conservative rather than the populist reformer he eventually became as the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee.
''I came to my senses,'' Mr. Perry likes to say when asked about his Gore days.
In 1984, fellow Democrats recruited Mr. Perry to run for a State House seat vacated by Representative Joe C. Hanna, according to interviews and news articles. John Sharp, a Democrat and the former state comptroller who was a college friend of Mr. Perry's, recalls getting a call from Clyde H. Wells, then the chairman of the Texas A&M System Board of Regents. Mr. Wells wondered who might make a good replacement for Mr. Hanna.
''I said: 'Yeah, there was a guy in my outfit who's from Haskell. Let's find out if he's still in the Air Force,' '' Mr. Sharp recalled saying of Mr. Perry. ''Three weeks later, he was in the race.''
Mr. Perry easily won and quickly became known as a rising star in the Texas House.
Gib Lewis, Democrat of Fort Worth, then the Speaker, decided to appoint several freshman lawmakers to the House Appropriations Committee -- members he knew he could count on to keep spending low.
''All of them were very conservative guys and had a good head on their shoulders, and that's how I picked 'em,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''When he first came to the Legislature it was predominantly white, Democratic, conservative. He was one of them, and I was, too.''
No matter the label beside his name, the news coverage of Mr. Perry's early years reveals the same ambition and enthusiasm for public office that the governor has brought to the national stage as a potential presidential candidate.
In one of the first lengthy newspaper profiles of Mr. Perry, in The Abilene Reporter-News, his fellow Representative Cliff Johnson, now a lobbyist and longtime friend, said of him: ''He's one of the top two or three (representatives) of the freshman class. I think the sky is the limit.''
At the beginning of his six years in the State House, Mr. Perry shot down the notion that he might switch parties, despite the conservative leanings that put him at odds with his party leaders.
After former United States Representative Kent Hance of Lubbock defected to the Republican Party in 1985, Mr. Perry told the Abilene paper he was ''disappointed,'' saying he planned to change his party rather than defect to the other side.
The gap was obvious by 1989, his last year in the Legislature, when Mr. Perry carried a workers' compensation insurance bill that angered Texas trial lawyers, then a powerful force in state politics. That same year, The Dallas Morning News named Mr. Perry one of the state's 10 best legislators, but he was criticized by another publication.
The liberal Texas Observer called Mr. Perry the ''Benedict Arnold of the Democratic Party'' for siding too often with Mr. Clements.
''If The Texas Observer ever says anything good about me, then I've been hit on the head and they can send me back home,'' Mr. Perry said.
Rumors that Mr. Perry would defect to the Republican Party -- and run against Jim Hightower, the populist Democratic agriculture commissioner -- picked up steam by late 1989. On Sept. 29, Mr. Perry made it official at a Capitol news conference. At his side were Fred Meyer, chairman of the Texas Republican Party, and Senator Phil Gramm, a former Democrat, who was aggressively courting would-be converts.
Mr. Perry's timing, now legendary, could not have been better. He was one of only two Republicans elected to nonjudicial statewide office in 1990. Eight years later, Republicans swept every one of them.
''Perry has been a risk taker,'' said Mr. Hance, the party switcher who became the chancellor of Texas Tech University. ''And if you look at Perry's timing in every race, he's been the golden guy.''

HEADLINE: Getting To Crazy

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
There aren't many positive aspects to the looming possibility of a U.S. debt default. But there has been, I have to admit, an element of comic relief -- of the black-humor variety -- in the spectacle of so many people who have been in denial suddenly waking up and smelling the crazy.
A number of commentators seem shocked at how unreasonable Republicans are being. ''Has the G.O.P. gone insane?'' they ask. 
Why, yes, it has. But this isn't something that just happened, it's the culmination of a process that has been going on for decades. Anyone surprised by the extremism and irresponsibility now on display either hasn't been paying attention, or has been deliberately turning a blind eye.
And may I say to those suddenly agonizing over the mental health of one of our two major parties: People like you bear some responsibility for that party's current state.
Let's talk for a minute about what Republican leaders are rejecting.
President Obama has made it clear that he's willing to sign on to a deficit-reduction deal that consists overwhelmingly of spending cuts, and includes draconian cuts in key social programs, up to and including a rise in the age of Medicare eligibility. These are extraordinary concessions. As The Times's Nate Silver points out, the president has offered deals that are far to the right of what the average American voter prefers -- in fact, if anything, they're a bit to the right of what the average Republican voter prefers!
Yet Republicans are saying no. Indeed, they're threatening to force a U.S. default, and create an economic crisis, unless they get a completely one-sided deal. And this was entirely predictable.
First of all, the modern G.O.P. fundamentally does not accept the legitimacy of a Democratic presidency -- any Democratic presidency. We saw that under Bill Clinton, and we saw it again as soon as Mr. Obama took office.
As a result, Republicans are automatically against anything the president wants, even if they have supported similar proposals in the past. Mitt Romney's health care plan became a tyrannical assault on American freedom when put in place by that man in the White House. And the same logic applies to the proposed debt deals.
Put it this way: If a Republican president had managed to extract the kind of concessions on Medicare and Social Security that Mr. Obama is offering, it would have been considered a conservative triumph. But when those concessions come attached to minor increases in revenue, and more important, when they come from a Democratic president, the proposals become unacceptable plans to tax the life out of the U.S. economy.
Beyond that, voodoo economics has taken over the G.O.P.
Supply-side voodoo -- which claims that tax cuts pay for themselves and/or that any rise in taxes would lead to economic collapse -- has been a powerful force within the G.O.P. ever since Ronald Reagan embraced the concept of the Laffer curve. But the voodoo used to be contained. Reagan himself enacted significant tax increases, offsetting to a considerable extent his initial cuts.
And even the administration of former President George W. Bush refrained from making extravagant claims about tax-cut magic, at least in part for fear that making such claims would raise questions about the administration's seriousness.
Recently, however, all restraint has vanished -- indeed, it has been driven out of the party. Last year Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, asserted that the Bush tax cuts actually increased revenue -- a claim completely at odds with the evidence -- and also declared that this was ''the view of virtually every Republican on that subject.'' And it's true: even Mr. Romney, widely regarded as the most sensible of the contenders for the 2012 presidential nomination, has endorsed the view that tax cuts can actually reduce the deficit.
Which brings me to the culpability of those who are only now facing up to the G.O.P.'s craziness.
Here's the point: those within the G.O.P. who had misgivings about the embrace of tax-cut fanaticism might have made a stronger stand if there had been any indication that such fanaticism came with a price, if outsiders had been willing to condemn those who took irresponsible positions.
But there has been no such price. Mr. Bush squandered the surplus of the late Clinton years, yet prominent pundits pretend that the two parties share equal blame for our debt problems. Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, proposed a supposed deficit-reduction plan that included huge tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, then received an award for fiscal responsibility.
So there has been no pressure on the G.O.P. to show any kind of responsibility, or even rationality -- and sure enough, it has gone off the deep end. If you're surprised, that means that you were part of the problem.

HEADLINE: China Urges U.S. to Be Responsible on Debt

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER and MATTHEW SALTMARSH; Bettina Wassener reported from Hong Kong and Matthew Saltmarsh from Paris.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China, one of the United States's biggest creditors, urged American policy makers on Thursday to act to protect investors' interests, highlighting rising concerns around the globe about the protracted budget talks taking place in Washington.
Officials in Washington are locked in tense negotiations over the government debt limit, which the Obama administration says must be raised from its current level of $14.29 trillion to allow the government to pay its daily bills and service any debt coming due. 
Any failure to pay due debt would effectively amount to a default, which, however briefly, could shake confidence in the American economy and unsettle global financial markets.
Late Wednesday, Moody's Investors Service sharpened attention on such an outcome by warning that it might cut its top rating for the United States. Moody's cited a ''rising possibility'' that no deal would be reached before the United States government's borrowing authority hits its limit on Aug. 2.
On Thursday, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, repeated a warning that a ''huge financial calamity'' would occur if President Obama and the Republicans could not agree on a budget deal that allowed the debt ceiling to be raised.
The authorities in Beijing added their voice of concern Thursday, though in more muted terms.
''We hope that the U.S. government adopts responsible policies and measures to guarantee the interests of investors,'' Hong Lei, a foreign ministry spokesman, said in response to questions about the Moody's report.
The comments echoed those made by officials in Beijing in April, when Standard & Poor's lowered its outlook on the United States from stable to negative because of the country's high budget deficit and rising government indebtedness.
China holds more than $1 trillion in United States Treasury securities, making it highly sensitive to any developments that could lower the value of those holdings.
Robin Marshall, director of investment management at Smith & Williamson in London, said the rating agencies were acting aggressively toward indebted sovereign nations, having failed to foresee the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, which foreshadowed the current debt explosion.
The current situation, he said, is creating headaches for governments -- worried either about where to invest or whether they themselves will be downgraded and face higher financing costs -- as well as for investors.
''It raises the question of what is the relevant benchmark?'' Mr. Marshall said. ''If the U.S. is downgraded, what about Germany, with its increasing liabilities? If you are looking solely at debt-to-G.D.P. levels, you may just be left with countries like Norway, Switzerland and Singapore as triple-A's.''
In Europe, reaction was muted on Thursday to the threat to the ratings as the European authorities struggled to contain their own debt crisis, which this week threatened to spread from Greece, Ireland and Portugal and engulf the larger economies of Italy and Spain.
European officials have responded to successive downgrades of euro zone ratings -- Ireland, for example, was downgraded to junk status this week by Moody's -- by criticizing the grip that the ratings agencies have over investors.
And longstanding plans to create a European rating agency have re-emerged. Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, said recently that the agencies might be showing ''bias'' against Europe.
Some Europeans sense double standards among the ratings agencies. A participant in the Internet forum of Der Spiegel, the German newsmagazine, said Thursday, ''It surprises me that the U.S.A. still has a top rating to begin with.''
But behind the rhetoric, European governments have united behind the idea that their debt positions are unsustainable and need to be rectified through spending cuts and revenue-raising measures. That leaves no room for the kind of brinkmanship being displayed in Washington regarding debt ceilings and defaults, even though European officials still remain reluctant to admit what investors have been saying for months, that Greece will default.
Mr. Marshall said the balance of opinion still suggested that the agencies should step back from downgrading the United States. ''In the end, size and reserve currency status matters,'' he said, adding the agencies were likely to ''pull back from the brink.''
In China, Dagong Global Credit Rating, a rating agency that downgraded its assessment of the United States last November, said Thursday that it had placed that rating on a negative watch list, citing the declining solvency of the American government, slow economic growth and high budget deficits.
Dagong is little known outside China, and its views have nowhere near the same effect as those of Moody's or Standard & Poor's on financial markets.
The warning by Moody's that a downgrade was possible was enough to send investors rushing to buy assets seen as safe. Gold for August delivery rose as high as $1,594.90 on Thursday, a record before adjusting for inflation.

HEADLINE: Deputy Mayor Eyes Overseas Investment Returns in Push to Alter the City's Pension System

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Calling the rising cost of city pensions ''unsustainable,'' Deputy Mayor Robert K. Steel said Thursday that New York City should move swiftly to overhaul its benefit system, including by investing more funds in overseas markets. 
Mr. Steel, who oversees economic development for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said moving retiree investments out of American stock markets and into international equities could bring higher returns, helping alleviate some pressure on the city's budget.
''We have an obligation to all New Yorkers to ensure that we are being responsible stewards of the public's resources,'' Mr. Steel said before an audience at the Princeton Club in Midtown. ''It's time for a clarion to action.''
The city's pension costs have risen by an average of almost 20 percent annually over the past decade, reaching an estimated $8.4 billion in 2012, compared with $1.2 billion in 2001.
Mr. Bloomberg, facing a dreary economic outlook, has said that overhauling the pension system is a priority of his third term. But labor leaders remain skeptical of his plans, which include raising the retirement age to 65 from 57 for some workers and ending year-end bonuses.
Mr. Bloomberg has found an ally in Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who said in an interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times on Wednesday that he would make limiting retirement benefits for new state and city workers his top priority next year.
The mayor is seeking to go further and hopes to persuade Albany lawmakers to restore the city's power to negotiate pensions as a part of collective bargaining discussions. (The state stripped the city of that ability during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s.)
In making the case for international investments, Mr. Steel said pension returns in the city had been mediocre. In the city's last fiscal year, from July through June, the return on the city's investments was 20 percent, he said, while the S.&P. 500 stock index rose 31 percent during that period.
Currently, 18 percent of the city's pension funds are invested in international equities. To invest more heavily in overseas markets, the city will need approval by the State Legislature.
Mr. Steel also called for consolidating the investment activities for New York's numerous pension funds to reduce costs and increase efficiency.
''We're spread across five funds with five sets of decision-makers and five sets of meetings and five sets of processes,'' he said. ''Consolidating the plan operations will allow New York City to realize the benefits of scale.''
Mr. Bloomberg shares oversight of the pension fund with the city comptroller, John C. Liu, who has a rocky relationship with the mayor. Mr. Steel went out of his way on Thursday to say he looked forward to working with Mr. Liu.
In a statement, Mr. Liu applauded Mr. Steel's ideas, saying his office had embraced many of them previously.
''We are encouraged by what we heard,'' Mr. Liu said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Another Dirty Water Act

 BODY:
Republicans in the House of Representatives -- with the support of some key Democrats -- seem determined to destroy the intricate and essential web of laws and regulations protecting the country's environment. Their latest target is the hugely successful 1972 Clean Water Act. 
On Wednesday, the House approved the cynically named ''Clean Water Cooperative Federalism Act,'' a bill that would strip the Environmental Protection Agency of its authority to oversee state water quality standards and to take action when the states fail to measure up. This bill is not about protecting states' powers. It is about allowing industries, farmers and municipalities to pollute.
Among its chief sponsors are John Mica, Republican of Florida, who is angry at the E.P.A.'s recent crackdown on the agricultural pollutants that are destroying the Everglades, and Nick Rahall, Democrat of West Virginia, who is furious at the agency's effort to stop mountaintop mining from poisoning his state's rivers and streams.
President Obama has rightly threatened to veto the bill if it survives the Senate. Absent federal oversight, states are likely to engage in a race to the bottom, weakening environmental rules to attract business.
This assault on the Clean Water Act reminded us, briefly, of 1995, when a Republican-controlled House under Newt Gingrich tried to undermine the same law. That effort enraged independent voters and energized moderate Republicans.
These days, moderate Republicans are as scarce as hen's teeth, and independent voters are preoccupied with the budget and the economy. This is all the more reason why the Senate and President Obama must ensure that this destructive legislation goes no further.

HEADLINE: 'Decision Time' on Budget, Obama Tells Leaders

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama threw the deadlocked budget negotiations back to Congress on Thursday, telling Republicans and Democrats to try to work out an agreement to avert a government default, and suggesting that more ambitious efforts to cut the deficit had hit a wall.
After a polite but inconclusive session that covered familiar ground and made no headway, Mr. Obama told the Congressional leaders to confer with their rank-and-file members over the next 24 to 36 hours to ''figure out what can get done,'' said a Democratic official briefed on the negotiations. 
The president said he might summon the leaders to the White House over the weekend if there was no progress; he has scheduled a news conference for Friday morning to argue his case publicly. On Capitol Hill, leaders of both parties were focused increasingly on a proposal by the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, that could provide a way out of the stalemate on the debt limit.
''The White House talks are irrelevant, a sideshow,'' said an aide to Senate Republicans involved in the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deliberations. ''They have been overtaken by events.''
Under the McConnell proposal, the president could request $2.5 trillion of additional borrowing authority in three installments -- enough to meet the government's needs through the end of next year. With each request, he would have to propose an equivalent amount of cuts in federal spending over the next 10 years.
Mr. Obama reiterated his refusal to sign a stopgap measure, a Democratic official said, but left the door open to Senator McConnell's plan as a fallback option. The president told the leaders he still believed there could be a landmark deal with savings of about $2 trillion over a decade, the official said.
Still, Mr. Obama, too, acknowledged that the daily high-level meetings at the White House had run their course. ''It's decision time,'' he said, according to the official. ''We need concrete plans to move this forward.''
Underscoring the growing urgency of the talks, the ratings agency Standard & Poor's warned Thursday that there was a 50 percent chance that it would downgrade the government's credit rating within three months because of the debt stalemate.
On Thursday, the leaders grappled with the most difficult issues politically for each party: cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, entitlement programs long defended by Democrats; and new revenues from the tax code, anathema to Republicans, who say they will not vote for anything resembling a tax increase.
Unlike the tone of previous meetings, which had gotten increasingly contentious, the atmosphere at the one-hour-and-20-minute meeting on Thursday was cordial, officials from both parties said. The House majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, who clashed with Mr. Obama on Wednesday, did not say a word, officials said. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, who had receded in recent days after his proposal for an ambitious deal was shot down by Republicans, spoke up more, they said.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Boehner also expressed some support for the compromise floated by Senator McConnell. It also drew favorable comment from the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, and the House minority leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California.
Mr. McConnell's proposal would establish a joint committee of Congress, with lawmakers from both parties and both chambers, to identify ways of reducing budget deficits and the resulting need for more federal borrowing.
The committee might be expected to offer its recommendations by the end of this year. The House and the Senate would take up-or-down votes on the package of proposed cuts and savings, but could not amend it.
Senator Reid said he was ''in discussions with Senator McConnell'' about his proposal. ''I told him I appreciated his work on this and I would do everything I could to try to be positive about it,'' Mr. Reid said.
For all the talk of the McConnell plan on Capitol Hill, Democratic officials said it did not figure prominently at the White House. The administration ran through proposed changes to the tax code that would affect a wide range of loopholes and other breaks for wealthy individuals and corporations.
Revenue raised from these changes would be used to extend a cut in payroll taxes that has increased take-home pay for millions of workers. But Republicans balked at the president's suggestion, repeating their opposition to tax increases, which they see as detrimental to economic recovery.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Hedges Remarks On Possible New Stimulus

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
A day after he helped lift markets with his testimony, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, tempered his words. And in reaction, the markets, too, pulled back.
In remarks before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, Mr. Bernanke said that the central bank was not currently ready to embark on a third round of government bond-buying to stimulate the economy.
''We're not proposing anything today,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''The main message I want to leave is that this is a serious situation. It involves a significant loss of human and economic potential.'' 
The new comments were interpreted by investors as a slight retreat from his testimony on Wednesday before the House, when Mr. Bernanke said the Fed still had tools to spur growth, and that ''we have to keep all the options on the table.''
The major indexes, which had been up on Wednesday and Thursday morning, fell after Mr. Bernanke's testimony.
''Bernanke walked the market back a bit'' by saying the Fed wasn't prepared to start another bond-buying program, said Michael Gapen, senior United States economist at Barclays Capital and a former Fed economist. ''The market overly interpreted the chairman's remarks yesterday.''
Still, Mr. Bernanke did not totally discount the prospect of such a program. Should the economy turn out to be weaker than expected, the central bank may provide more monetary stimulus, Mr. Bernanke said Thursday. A third round of quantitative easing, referred to as QE3, is an option if a recent economic slowdown persists and deflationary forces re-emerge, he said.
Mr. Bernanke said that the Fed faced different conditions today than it did last August, when he signaled a second round of large-scale asset purchases, which ended last month. At that time, the economy was in danger of stalling, he said, and the Fed was concerned the country might experience deflation, a widespread and prolonged drop in prices, wages and the values of assets like homes and stocks.
''Today the situation is more complex,'' Mr. Bernanke told lawmakers, adding: ''Inflation is higher. Inflation expectations are close to our target. We are uncertain about the near-term developments in the economy. We'd like to see if, in fact, the economy does pick up, as we are projecting.''
Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the committee's senior Republican, told Mr. Bernanke that he had concerns that additional bond purchases would fuel inflation.
''The last thing our weak economy needs right now is an inflation scare,'' he said.
Mr. Shelby had also criticized the Fed in November when it began a $600 billon bond-buying program to rejuvenate the economy, saying the purchases could lead to an inflation surge. Mr. Shelby suggested that bond-buying by the Fed could prompt a wave of speculative buying on Wall Street, leading to asset price bubbles.
Democrats, however, stressed the need to create jobs. Tim Johnson, a Democrat from South Dakota who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, asked Mr. Bernanke why the Fed was not immediately starting a new stimulus program given the weak economic recovery and rising unemployment.
The nation's unemployment rate rose to 9.2 percent in June, the third consecutive monthly increase. Employers added 18,000 new jobs, the fewest in nine months.
''We're not prepared at this point to take further action,'' Mr. Bernanke said, in response to Mr. Johnson's question.
Mr. Bernanke stressed the need to be flexible. The Fed might tighten credit if inflation were to rise more than anticipated, he said.
He also again urged Republicans in Congress and President Obama to come to an agreement to raise the nation's $14.3 trillion borrowing authority.
If a deal is not reached before Aug. 2, the government will not be able to pay its bills and the United States risks losing its top-notch credit rating.
''It's a very important asset and losing that credit rating is, again, I think a self-inflicted wound,'' Mr. Bernanke said.

HEADLINE: Markets Fall After Bernanke Tempers Stimulus Comments

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Thursday as Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, backed off hints that the Fed would provide additional near-term stimulus for the nation's struggling economy. 
In a second day of testimony, Mr. Bernanke said that the central bank would be ready to inject more money should the economy get worse. He said the time had not come yet, undercutting comments from a day earlier that spurred a late-day rally.
JPMorgan Chase rose 1.84 percent, to $40.35, after it reported higher-than-expected profit as it wrote off fewer bad mortgages and credit card loans. The Dow component was the only component of the Standard & Poor's financial index to close higher.
''You're seeing a push and pull, with earnings continuing to be strong on the micro level, but event-risk issues like Bernanke and global debt, on the other hand,'' said Wayne Lin, a money manager at Legg Mason in Baltimore.
''The market is volatile, trading off these one-line comments from Bernanke.''
The Dow Jones industrial average slid 54.49 points, or 0.44 percent, to 12,437.12. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 8.85 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,308.87. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 34.25 points, or 1.22 percent, to 2,762.67.
Stocks climbed on Wednesday as investors took Mr. Bernanke's remarks before a House panel as signaling the possibility of more stimulus for the economy if the outlook worsens. The central bank's most recent stimulative program contributed to strong equity gains since September.
Technology stocks led decliners on Thursday, extending a losing streak to a second day.
Shares of Google surged more than 12 percent in after-hours trading after reporting quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations. Google ended regular trading down. 1.73 percent, to $528.94.
Following Google's results, Nasdaq futures rose 0.2 percent.
During the regular session, the News Corporation fell 3.11 percent, to $15.44, on heavy volume after the F.B.I. said it would investigate allegations that the company hacked into the phone records of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
Worries about a deadlocked debate over federal budget cuts and the debt ceiling further soured investor sentiment.
Moody's announced late on Wednesday that it might cut the United States' triple-A credit rating. Moody's cited the increasing risk that Congress would not raise its $14.3 trillion debt ceiling in time to avert a default, which investors and experts say could roil financial markets.
''There could be further volatility -- which is code for going down -- as we near the deadline, but the market thinks the debt ceiling will be raised,'' said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management in Richmond, Va. ''If it didn't, we'd be down 5,000 points right now.''
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 19/32, to 101 15/32. The yield rose to 2.95 percent from 2.88 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Ways to Succeed in Today's Job Market

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Start-Up of You'' (column, July 13), Thomas L. Friedman has (again) hit the nail squarely on the head: job seekers need an entrepreneurial mind-set to compete. 
The dramatic shift in work -- away from the tradition of a 40-hour workweek and toward individuals' building of ''bodies of work'' (and maybe companies?) with lifestyles to match -- is happening because of the pressure on organizations to innovate and increase productivity, but also because of the increasing preference of people to work for themselves.
No doubt, the economic downturn was a factor in the rush to independent contractor and freelance status, yet no one should expect all those folks to go meekly back into the cubicles of giant corporations anytime soon.
This trend should put new pressure on educational aspirations at every level. Our future depends on having this generation of workers and the next well prepared for lifelong learning, adaptation to continuous change and a level of global awareness most of us can only begin to imagine.
KATHY TUNHEIM Minneapolis, July 13, 2011
The writer is senior adviser on jobs creation to Gov. Mark Dayton of Minnesota.
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman and Reid Garrett Hoffman, whose coming book ''The Start-Up of You'' is cited in the column, are no doubt correct about the changing landscape of employment in the United States.
They portray 35-year-old workers as being in ''midcareer,'' tell us that tech companies want ''talented engineers'' and advise workers to invest in themselves because they don't ''have a right to a job.''
Couple all that with the likelihood that the eligibility age for Social Security will almost certainly be raised in coming years, the continuing practice of offshoring jobs and the continuing loss of jobs to technology, and we are staring at a real problem down the road: what to do with those ''late career'' employees, those obsolete 40-, 50- and 60-year-olds who don't match the profile?
Not everyone is a ballerina or a golf pro. And not everyone is an entrepreneur. An economy that requires entrepreneurial skills of all workers is headed for real trouble.

HEADLINE: Reviewing the Ford Focus

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: In its effort to give the Focus excellent fuel economy, Ford programmed the dual-clutch transmission to change gears in odd and infuriating ways. 

 BODY:
In Sunday's Automobiles section, Christopher Jensen reviews the 2012 Ford Focus, the first all-new Focus since the 2000 model year.
Like the Ford Fiesta and the coming C-Max, the Focus is a global car, and its spirited demeanor befits a compact car developed largely in Europe, Mr. Jensen finds:The Focus can travel even the most convoluted mountain road, changing direction quickly and displaying impressive adhesion and confidence-inspiring composure. The steering is precise and predictable; the body, which benefits from the inclusion of high-strength steel, feels wonderfully rigid.Yet however impressive the car's composure and its evident build quality, a poorly calibrated dual-clutch automatic transmission fitted to Mr. Jensen's sedan undermines much of the progress made by Ford engineers elsewhere.The transmission is often in the wrong gear at the wrong time, resulting in jerks, pauses and lethargic acceleration. Putting the shifter in the Sport position delays shifts but creates its own problem. Touching the brake while in Sport causes the gearbox to downshift. It would take an utterly oblivious driver not to notice the PowerShift's problems.Read the entire review, check out the slide show and share your thoughts about the Focus in the comments below.

HEADLINE: Newark Museum Gets $1 Million Grant for African Art Collection

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: The money comes from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. 

 BODY:
The Newark Museum has received a $1 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support initiatives related to its African art collection. The grant will allow the museum to hire a new assistant curator, doubling the size of its African art department, and to engage additional scholars for research, the museum's director, Mary Sue Sweeney Price, said in a telephone interview. 
The museum is also planning an expansion and reinstallation of its African art galleries, which will open in 2015. It received a $500,000 challenge grant toward that project from the National Endowment from the Humanities, which requires the museum to raise an additional $1.5 million from private sources. Ms. Price said that the museum was making progress toward that goal and would announce some major gifts in the next few months. 
The Newark Museum, which has long received a major portion of its funding from the State of New Jersey, has had to cope with a more than 50 percent reduction in its state subsidy in recent years. Last year it let go 15 percent of its staff and closed for a month in the late summer. "The institution is doing what all institutions are doing, which is focus on your core strengths and bring those forward, and work with your community," Ms. Price said. "The result I hope will be a stronger and more vibrant museum that can survive the current economic downsizing in the wider cultural world."

HEADLINE: Lighting the Hopes of the Grid-less

BYLINE: FELICITY BARRINGER


HIGHLIGHT: A philanthropic group tries to marry financial capital with new energy technologies to introduce devices intended for the 1.4 billion people who live off the grid. 

 BODY:
From Lenin to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 20th-century political leaders made the provision of universal electricity a centerpiece of their programs and oratory. "Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country," one slogan went. Or, in the case of F.D.R.'s Tennessee Valley Authority, "T.V.A.: Electricity For All." 
In this century, the United Nations has updated the concept in addressing the problem that 1.4 billion people in the world are living without electricity. The new buzz phrase is "Sustainable Energy For All," but the approach is very different, because in many cases these people cannot be connected to a grid. Given that the vast majority of the unconnected live near the equator, where the sun is at its zenith, the solutions being tried are almost all based on solar power.
One of the chief proselytizers is Richenda Van Leeuwen, who oversees the energy-access efforts of the United Nations Foundation, a philanthropic organization that works to support many of the United Nations' humanitarian efforts. Like a Hollywood producer trying to bring together a script, a director, some actors and some financial angels, she spends her waking hours trying to assemble packages of financial resources, new technologies and new payment practices and to pinpoint willing recipients of the products.
"There are so many different targeted applications to help people solve problems on a daily basis," she said in an interview -- things like a solar-powered lantern that an Indian midwife can hang above the bed so that both of her hands are free, for example. Or the desk lamps made by the San Francisco-based company d.Light Design. Or solar-powered drip irrigation systems being used in Benin and India, or solar-powered lights for voting booths in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Ms. Van Leeuwen's goal is to provide emerging companies making these technologies with access to funds from socially conscious investors who are willing to tolerate higher risks and less financial reward. First she seeks to ensure that the price of the products is within the reach of the people who will be using them. Then there is a need for a supply chain that can distribute the devices, and a support system that ensures that there are spare parts and local people who can do repairs.
A lot of this would not have been as possible a decade or two ago, when solar power technologies were less robust and electrical lighting usually required energy-hungry incandescent bulbs. Now, Ms. Van Leeuwen said, advances in light-emitting diodes, which provide more light with less energy, and in small-scale solar power technology are spawning a new generation of devices for people who lack access to a grid.
The effort evokes the spread of cellular phones, swiftly adopted in places around the world that had no land lines. Ms. Van Leeuwen cited a recentprediction by the United Nations publication World Energy Outlook that said that if the goal of 100 percent access by 2030 is achieved, 70 percent of those with new access will get it either through a mini-grid or off-grid devices like those mentioned above.
If the prices of the new devices can be scaled to their means, these people will form a significant potential market. "If you can get a cellphone in the remotest village," Ms. Van Leeuven said, "you can get a small-scale energy solution, too." 
In 2010, she pointed out, more money was invested in renewable energy in the developing world (mostly China) than in the developed world.

HEADLINE: Are Parents Too Involved in Children's Sports?

BYLINE: LISA BELKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A recent controversy over an 8-year-old girl kickboxing, and what to do when coaches favor their own kids. 

 BODY:
One of the best parts of summer is getting children outside and active. The head-butting march of the United States women's soccer team this particular summer underscores the power of getting physical.
But modern parenting being what it is, the simple joy of sweat and motion can become complicated, with questions of danger and sportsmanship and teaching moments and parental over- or under-involvement.
Two notes from readers raise many of these issues. First up, Mike Adamick, who blogs at Cry It Out!, and who watched a recent dispute over girls and kickboxing in Australia with the growing feeling that he would like to kick some sense into someone.
Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy
In an e-mail he writes: I am outraged at the story of the dad who let his 8-year-old daughter enter a kickboxing fight. Seething. That might be a better word. I just watched the clip on the "Today" show, and I am sitting here with my fists clenched, ready to punch Matt Lauer.
Why?
Because a dad put his precious little gem of a wee girl in the ring? With pads? With a referee present? With another wee little angel baby as an opponent? No, of course not. Good for that dad. He's my hero.
I'm angry because this is apparently worthy of controversy, letting a girl who wants to get into the ring actually get into the ring with a girl her own age and size. Don't boys do this all the time, every day? All over the world? Why is it so special or "controversial" when a girl does it? I am simply appalled that the "Today" show would consider this worthy of coverage. O.K., fine, maybe they're just covering the controversy that's apparently all the rage in Australia, where this fight took place. As a father of a daughter, I'd have appreciated it if they covered this from the angle of "Can you believe Australia is all aflame over the idea of girls fighting in an organized, sanctioned event? It's the 21st century, Australia: get over it."
America is in the midst of some serious grrl-power love, with the American women's soccer team on the cusp of another World Cup final appearance. Women are fighting in cage matches. Women are rock-star jockeys in the country's most prestigious horse races.
How did these women ever become so amazing -- and how will future generations of girls embrace what makes them happy -- if every time they want to do something a little dangerous, the media goes into a Victorian-era fainting spell? Girls? Not sitting there, watching the boys box? Oh heavens!
This was an official, organized fight. There's training involved. There's strategy to learn. If my daughter wanted to train for a fight and enter the ring, you know, I'd be the first to say she could do it. People are arguing that kids could get hurt doing this activity, but I don't see the outrage when little boys box -- and they do it every single day. Where's the "concern" for them? This controversy is sexist, no two ways about it. Kids get hurt all the time. I broke my arm in three places falling out of a tree, but I'd never even consider telling my daughter she can't climb a tree. That's silly.
From the looks of this video, the girl is having a great time training with her dad. She's bonding with a positive role model and learning to defend herself. What's so wrong about that? In the clip, the "reporter" says the girl cried after Round 1 and then her dad urged her to keep going. You know, I cried after my first and only street fight at around the same age. It's not what girls do. It's what kids do. Now, in the end, the girl said she wasn't interested in getting into the ring right away. O.K., cool. Go back to it -- or not -- whenever you want. But kudos to you for trying. And kudos to your dad for letting you do what you want to do.
Next, a tangentially related note from another reader, a mother who, rather than struggling with what a parent should let a child do, is wondering how to intervene when a coach won't let the child do it.
She writes:
It is high summer, and our 11-year-old will be playing on a "travel" soccer team this fall, with practices to start sometime this month. Our son really loves to play soccer and is pretty good, but small for his age, which seems to work against his prospects.
Over the years we have found the whole youth sports culture a major disappointment. My husband coached when our sons were very young, but after they got to be around 9 he thought he did not have the expertise to continue coaching.
Our son has played on a team with his coach for a couple of years now, and if we had any other options we would find another team, but the possibilities around us are limited and we feel stuck. This is a coach who caters only to his own son and his son's friends. There was a tournament last fall in which the coach secretly invited half of the team to play, but did not invite the other half. Unfortunately he accidentally sent an e-mail about it to one of the "not invited" families, and word got out.
We did not tell our son that he was not invited, but the idea of "there is no 'I' in team" seems to be lost on this coach. He puts all emphasis on what he thinks will be a winning strategy of playing the same eight kids most of the time, no matter what, rather than developing all of the promising players on his team. When my husband spoke up to say that they were not playing all of the kids, they finally started to do that more, and the team actually started winning more games. Our son played half the minutes of the coach's son this spring, and scored almost as many goals as the coach's kid, but still it does not seem like the coach appreciates his potential. It is very frustrating to watch, and now that the team has gone "select," we are expecting the worst for this fall. We really don't have options. Our son loves soccer, so as much as I would like to just ditch the team, it does not seem viable for our son. Any readers have advice?
Use the comments to give whatever thoughts or advice you might have. Is a father pushing too hard to get his daughter into the kickboxing ring? Is a mother not pushing hard enough to get her son time on the soccer field? Aren't kids' sports supposed to be fun?

HEADLINE: Credit Suisse Discloses U.S. Inquiry Into Private Banking

BYLINE: CHRIS V. NICHOLSON


HIGHLIGHT: Credit Suisse said that it had been notified it was the object of an investigation by the Department of Justice, citing "a broader industry inquiry." 

 BODY:
4:03 p.m. | Updated 
Credit Suisse disclosed Friday that it was being investigated by the Justice Department to see whether its private banking unit helped Americans evade taxes, raising the possibility that the bank would face legal proceedings similar to those that led its Swiss rival, UBS, to pay a costly settlement and open its books to American tax authorities.
Citing "a broader industry inquiry," Credit Suisse said it had previously received subpoenas and other information requests from the Justice Department and other government agencies regarding the cross-border services that its private banking arm provided to its rich American clients. The bank also said it was told it was "a target" of the investigation on Thursday.
''Subject to our Swiss legal obligations, we will continue to cooperate with the U.S. authorities in an effort to resolve these matters,'' the bank said. 
Jeffrey A. Neiman, a former federal prosecutor who had been assigned to the UBS case, said called Credit Suisse's disclosure ''deja vu all over again.'' 
''The Justice Department could not signal more strongly to an individual entity that they consider them to be in gross violation of the law than by calling them the target of an investigation,'' he said. ''The bank, and its U.S. clients, should take that very seriously.''
 Four private bankers tied to Credit Suisse were indicted in the United States in February for helping American citizens evade taxes. The four - Marco Parenti Adami, Emanuel Agustoni, Michele Bergantino and Roger Schaerer - were also linked to Bank Leumi, the big Israeli bank; and Bank Frey and Maerki Baumann, two smaller Swiss private banks. They have been accused of conspiracy and fraud.
 The bankers, three of whom had left Credit Suisse before they were indicted, were accused of helping American clients set up offshore accounts under false names, and shifting money from Credit Suisse accounts to smaller Swiss private banks. 
At the time, Credit Suisse said it was not the object of an investigation by the Justice Department, and industry analysts thought the bank might be able to strike a deal with American authorities by paying a fine, much like UBS did in 2009.
 The announcement on Friday raises the stakes for Credit Suisse. UBS paid a $780 million fine and handed over data on thousands of clients to avoid a conviction in a similar case that could have cost it its banking license in the United States.
 On Friday, a Swiss court upheld the Swiss government's decision to force UBS to hand over client data, citing ''virtually uncontrollable economic repercussions for Switzerland'' if it had not done so. That decision implies that Credit Suisse, too, may be ordered to surrender information about customers' accounts to American authorities. 
''The U.S. government will most likely demand not just payment of back taxes but the disclosure of client data,'' Mr. Neiman said, suggesting that there could be no half measures because of Swiss banking secrecy laws. ''They don't reach resolution with a corporate entity unless they cooperate fully,'' he said.
 In March, an American citizen, Edward Gurary, pleaded guilty to tax evasion and admitted hiding assets not only at UBS, but also at Credit Suisse. The Justice Department began its investigation of Credit Suisse's private banking operations, along with those of HSBC, in 2008, as an outgrowth of the UBS investigation. 
The inquiry began by focusing on suspicions that the two banks held $30 billion in offshore accounts that American clients had not declared to the Internal Revenue Service.
 Last month, Steven Miller, the deputy commissioner for services and enforcement at the I.R.S., said during a conference on taxation in Washington that the authorities planned to take action against one or more banks soon, without mentioning any by name, an attendee at the meeting said. 
Credit Suisse has tangled with the Justice Department before and lost. In December 2009, Credit Suisse paid $536 million to settle charges that it had broken American sanctions by helping Iranian banks to hide the identity of their clients in international dealings.
 Representatives for the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Profit Up 24%, Citigroup Seeks Global Growth

BYLINE: ERIC DASH


HIGHLIGHT: The bank's return to health has meant more hiring and plans for more branches, but expenses have jumped and are expected to remain high this year. 

 BODY:
8:43 p.m. | Updated 
For two and a half years, Vikram S. Pandit was forced to hunker down to fix Citigroup's troubled businesses and fend off the bank's critics in Washington.
Now, after reporting a 24 percent profit increase for the second quarter, Mr. Pandit, Citi's chief executive, is starting to play offense.
Citigroup has been hiring dozens of investment bankers, dialing up advertising and drawing up plans to add several hundred branches from Buenos Aires to Bucharest, including more than 200 in major cities across the United States. The bank is in the middle of stitching together its disparate technology systems - a mammoth effort known internally as Project Rainbow - and spending more than $1 billion a year to keep up its prized global transaction services franchise.
As a result, expenses have shot up more than 9 percent from last year and are expected to remain elevated though the end of 2011. Investors may have to wait a year or longer to see the payoff.
Despite an earful from Wall Street analysts, Citi executives say that after several years of cutting back on investment spending, they need to loosen their purse strings to make up lost ground.
"Coming out of the crisis, there wasn't a lot of investing going on in 2008 and 2009," John C. Gerspach, Citigroup's chief financial officer, said during a conference call with journalists.
Stronger rivals like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo have been investing all along. Now, Mr. Gerspach added, "We are in investment mode."
How Mr. Pandit keeps close tabs on expenses while building out his global banking franchise is perhaps his next great challenge. After clawing Citi back from the brink of collapse during the financial crisis, he has been engaged in an ambitious plan to transform it from a sprawling financial supermarket to a leaner, more focused company.
Mr. Pandit has been successful shedding assets, improving risk management and severing the bank's ties with the federal government. His efforts, however, have not lifted Citi's share price. It has floundered since the completion of a reverse stock split in early May that took the price to around $45 from $4.50. On Friday, it closed at $38.38, down 1.64 percent.
Citi showed the inherent power of its franchise when it pulled off a second-quarter profit of $3.3 billion, up from $2.7 billion last year, despite a sluggish global economy. Many analysts were skeptical of that headline.
Despite modest loan growth and strong investment banking fees, almost half of the bank's pretax operating profit came from the reversal of more than $2 billion of funds the bank had set aside earlier to cover credit card and other loan losses.
And unlike the solid gains that JPMorgan showed on Thursday, revenue at Citigroup fell 7 percent from a year earlier, to $20.6 billion.
Profit in Citigroup's investment bank was down by almost one-third from a year ago, falling to $1.2 billion. Traders on the currency, interest rate and mortgage desks were hard hit, while Citi's equity derivatives group also reported lower revenues.
Its North American banking operations also struggled, with a litany of mortgage troubles continuing to weigh on its results. "I consider mortgages the biggest risk we run," Mr. Gerspach said.
Although tighter supervision and the smaller size of Citi's mortgage unit allowed it to avoid the charges that swamped Bank of America and Chase's results, Citi was still forced to set aside an extra $224 million to cover potential losses on securities backed by faulty loans that it had sold to investors. That brought its total reserves to $1 billion.
The bank also raised its projections of mortgage servicing cost increases to around $70 million a quarter - double its prior estimates, although nowhere near the billion-dollar charges taken by its larger peers.
Abroad, the news was mixed. For the last two years, the bank's consumer businesses in Asia and Latin America have been one of the few bright spots. Loan losses eased faster in those regions than in the United States, and corporate lending has been quicker to gain steam. That was true again in the second quarter, when nearly 60 percent of profit came from emerging markets.
But its European results were weak, particularly in its investment banking unit.
And then there is the expense problem. Operating costs for Citi's core operations rose to $10.1 billion, a 14 percent increase from a year ago. Bank executives said that about one-third of that cost could be attributable to unfavorable exchange rates and another third to increased legal expenditures tied to mortgages and other issues. The rest comes from technology investments, hiring and other expansion efforts, largely outside the United States.
"We don't like the idea that our expenses are going to be above guidance any more than anyone else does," Mr. Gerspach said. "You can either manage back down to the guidance by cutting investment programs, or you can agree to press on."
Some Citi analysts and investors, who have a long history of hearing the bank's executives make promises they cannot fulfill, were skeptical. Others say the bank has little choice.
"The company was on its death bed, and the investing they were doing was to make sure they survived," said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. "Now, they are looking to make up for that period of time."
Just as with investment spending, Citigroup will be playing catch-up to its main competitors when it comes to buying back its own shares. JPMorgan, for example, announced that it had repurchased about $3.5 billion of the company's stock in the second quarter. Mr. Pandit has said that the bank is unlikely to do so until sometime in 2012.
An earlier version of this article misstated the loss for Citi Holdings. The group's loss was $168 million, not $168 billion.
A photo caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the second quarter for Citigroup's earnings. It was this year, not last year.

HEADLINE: A Bad Economy Could Harm House Republicans

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Exploring the notion of whether a struggling economy is good for Republican lawmakers trying to keep their jobs in Congress. 

 BODY:
If you are a Republican trying to keep your job in Congress, your feelings about President Obama notwithstanding, would you rather the economy be better or worse?
The answer is actually not so obvious. In five election cycles in the last 60 years, a poor economy combined with a divided government. This is how they proceeded:
1948 (Democrats control presidency, Republicans control Congress). This is one precedent favorable to Democrats, and unfavorable to Republicans in the House. The economy sputtered throughout the term that Harry Truman inherited from Franklin D. Roosevelt and was headed back into recession just as the election took place. However, not only did Truman, who ran a highly partisan campaign criticizing the "do-nothing Congress," maintain the presidency, but Democrats also had a net gain of 75 seats in the House and 9 in the Senate, taking control of both chambers.
1960 (Republicans control presidency, Democrats control Congress). This election is not normally remembered as one driven by the economy, but the country was in recession at the time and had endured another recession early in Dwight D. Eisenhower's second term. Eisenhower, however, remained personally popular, and his vice president, Richard M. Nixon, was the Republican nominee. Democrats won, but not in impressive fashion, with John F. Kennedy defeating Nixon by one-tenth of a percentage point in the popular vote (although his margin in the Electoral College was more robust). Democrats kept control of Congress, but lost 22 seats in the House and 1 in the Senate.
1976 (Republicans control presidency, Democrats control Congress). Jimmy Carter, considered the heavy favorite, defeated the embattled incumbent, Gerald Ford, by only two percentage points. Democrats gained just one seat each in the House and the Senate.
1992 (Republicans control presidency, Democrats control Congress). Bill Clinton defeated George H.W. Bush, although with only 43 percent of the popular vote, as Ross Perot took 19 percent. Most research suggests, however, that Mr. Perot did not cost Mr. Bush the election, and may have even taken votes away from Mr. Clinton. Mr. Clinton's coattails were underwhelming, however: Democrats lost nine seats in the House, while gaining one in the Senate.
2008 (Republicans control presidency, Democrats control Congress). This was truly a clean win, as Barack Obama claimed the presidency and Democrats expanded their numbers in both chambers of Congress, gaining 21 House seats and 8 Senate seats.
If you're looking at this history from President Obama's perspective, the results do not seem so promising. In all five elections, one party swept both the presidency and Congress. And in four out of five cases, it was the party that controlled Congress -- not the presidency -- that did so. The situation is by no means completely hopeless: there is a reasonably clear precedent. In 1948, Truman succeeded in passing blame along to Congress, and Nixon in 1960 and Ford in 1976 might easily have won. But under normal circumstances, a president will take a hit for a poor economy, and a divided government will provide an insufficient buffer. (I would argue that a renewed economic crisis triggered by a debt default is not "normal circumstances," but let's leave that alone for now.)
On the other hand, the results also do not look so great if you're a Republican representative interested in keeping your job. In these elections, the party in control of Congress did not do particularly well at retaining its seats, actually losing an average of 17 seats in the House and breaking even on average in the Senate. The party in control of Congress also saw its share of the House popular vote decline in four of the five years, to an average of 50 percent of the vote from 54 percent in the previous midterm.
(One other oddity: the party completing the sweep in all five cases was the Democratic Party. This is probably meaningless, although it is at least theoretically possible that Democrats have an inherent advantage over Republicans in difficult economic times when voters might have reason to blame either party.)
So there is something of a tradeoff here. Certainly, a poor economy is liable to hurt the president -- and presidents normally have coattails, whether positive or negative. At the same time, Republicans might also share in some of the blame if the economy is poor: voters could split their tickets and vote against both their Republican lawmakers and President Obama.
One experiment predicts the number of seats that the party in control of the House of Representatives will gain or lose based on two factors: the performance of the economy and the share of the popular vote that its candidate receives for president. For the economic variable, we'll use per capita disposable income growth as defined by Douglas Hibbs, which I have calculated going back to 1924.
If you put each of these variables into a regression equation, you find -- unsurprisingly -- that the party in control of the House tends to do better when its presidential candidate performs well. But it also tends to do better when the economy is strong, other factors being equal. These effects appear to be statistically significant in cases in which the House and the presidency are controlled by different parties as well as those in which they are controlled by the same one, although the small sample sizes make it hard to know for sure.
Given my repeated admonitions against taking these sorts of models too literally, I'd digest the following with ample grains of salt, but here are the results from a somewhat fancier version of the equation that includes an interaction term between the two variables. The numbers reflect predictions about the number of seats that Republicans would gain or lose in the House based on various situations having to do with the performance of the economy and their presidential candidate. Values shaded in blue represent those cases in which the Republican Party would be projected to lose control of the House.
This chart, which looks something like the one used to calculate the wind chill factor, might give you a headache. But there are four basic possibilities:
The economy is reasonably strong and Obama wins. In this case, which is reflected in the values in the bottom left-hand corner of the chart, the most likely outcome is that Congressional Republicans lose a few seats in the House. But their majority would not necessarily be threatened: voters could be in a magnanimous mood and might want to keep their divided government, and Mr. Obama might attempt to coast to victory on a "Morning in America" theme rather than adopting a more partisan tone. If you look at the presidents who were re-elected with a divided government and a good economy -- Clinton in 1996, Reagan in 1984, Nixon in 1972 and Eisenhower in 1956 -- they produced few coattails, with their parties gaining an average of nine seats in the House, failing to take control of the chamber in all four instances, and losing one seat on average in the Senate.
The economy is poor and Obama loses. This is the converse of the previous possibility. Republicans would be likely to retain control of the House, but it isn't necessarily any kind of bonanza. The historical evidence suggests that the party in control of the House performs marginally when the economy is doing poorly, even if its president does well and wins. Under some circumstances -- for instance, if the Republican presidential candidate won by an extremely slim margin, or won with a plurality of the vote because third-party candidates took some votes off the table -- it's entirely possible that the Republican Party would lose the House while winning back control of the presidency.
The economy is poor and Obama wins anyway. This is the worst possibility for Republicans because it implies that, as in 1948, the public will have rendered a judgment about who is responsible for the state of the economy, and that judgment will have been made against them. If voters are willing to re-elect President Obama despite a lagging economy, it will almost certainly mean they'll also punish Republicans in Congress. The model argues that Republicans would be favored to lose the House in this eventuality, perhaps by a significant margin. Fortunately for Republicans, this possibility is relatively unlikely, although it could be triggered by some crisis -- like a debt default for which they shared in the blame, or by a poor Republican candidate who turned off independent voters and allowed Mr. Obama to manage a victory.
The economy is reasonably strong but Obama loses. This possibility is even less likely -- it takes a lot to beat an incumbent president, and if the economy is reasonably healthy it can be next to impossible. The closest thing to a comparison is probably something like 1952: the economy was doing quite well that year, but the Korean War had become fairly unpopular, Democrats had been in power for a long time, and Republicans nominated an exceptional candidate in Eisenhower, leading Truman to decline a chance at another term and Adlai Stevenson to do poorly in his place. Winning under these circumstances would imply that Republicans had really won the argument on the merits, and their presidential candidate would probably have substantial coattails in Congress, as Eisenhower did in 1952: Republicans won 22 seats in the House that year and 2 in the Senate, gaining control of both chambers.
The moral is that the Republicans in Congress -- as opposed to the Republican presidential candidate -- will not necessarily benefit from a poor economy.
But the particulars get a little more complicated, since when the other party controls the White House, two effects cut against one another. On the one hand, presidents get blamed for a bad economy, and that is likely to have some effects down the ballot. About a third of voters who participate in presidential election years do not vote in midterm years and may have little interest in Congressional races, often voting a straight party ticket. On the other hand, the historical record provides some suggestion that voters are sophisticated enough to spread the blame around and vote all the rascals out of office. The majority party in the House has lost seats on average when the economy is poor, even when the president is from the other party.
Which of these effects will prevail in any given year is hard to know. But the view that under a divided government, a bad economy is bad for the president's party, full stop, is probably too simplistic. A bad economy is almost certainly bad for the president himself. But it may be neutral or even favorable from the standpoint of his party's candidates for Congress.
And there is one prominent case, 1948, in which a president succeeded in transferring blame to the Congress. This is why, particularly if the economy worsens but this is not perceived as being entirely Mr. Obama's fault -- for instance, in the event of a debt crisis -- there is some downside risk for Republicans. Don't be surprised if you catch David Plouffe, the senior White House political strategist, reading press accounts of Harry Truman's campaign.

HEADLINE: Podcast: Sovereign Debt, Phone Hacking and Law Schools

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen. 

 BODY:
There has been a flurry of headline-grabbing developments in the slow-moving financial and fiscal crises on both sides of the Atlantic.In Europe, Italy's cost of borrowing rose to the highest level in many months, as traders worried that Greece's financial problems might not be contained. In the new Weekend Business podcast, Floyd Norris, chief financial correspondent for The Times, says that while the problems in Europe have roiled the markets, a major financial issue in the United States so far has not. That is the inability of Congress and the White House to agree on an increase in the debt ceiling of the United States. If such an agreement is not in place by Aug. 2, the Treasury secretary has warned that the government could default on its debt, with catastrophic consequences.
So far at least, Treasury yields remain extremely low and prices, which move in the opposite direction, are quite high, a sign that the markets are convinced that this crisis is a nonevent. We shall soon see whether this is true, Mr. Norris says. Other problems - the weakness of the United States economy, high unemployment, and a large and growing debt load - are also looming. For the moment, though, a benign summertime mood has prevailed, and domestic stock and bond markets have remained relatively calm.
In another portion of the podcast, I chat with Mr. Norris about the phone-hacking and bribery scandal that has shaken the Murdoch media empire. It has already led to the shuttering of one newspaper, numerous arrests, top-level executive changes and investigations in London and in New York.
The business of legal education in the United States is the focus of a cover article by David Segal in Sunday Business. In a podcast conversation with David Gillen, Mr. Segal says many law schools have sharply increased their fees, enrollment and capital spending, even as the job market for law school graduates has shrunk.And in the Economic View column, the economist Richard Thaler revisits the annuity puzzle - the unpopularity of annuities despite their economic advantages. Traditional pensions are a form of annuities, but as working people shift to defined-benefit plans like 401(k)'s, they are faced with a bewildering set of options upon retirement. Yet few of them choose to buy annuities.
As he says in a podcast conversation, Social Security is a form of annuity - and he suggests that by delaying the receipt of benefit checks, people can greatly increase their monthly payouts. This may simplify financial planning. It's advantageous, of course, only if you live long enough for your increased monthly benefits to offset the loss of the checks you are voluntarily giving up. Social Security could also be modified to allow recipients to "top off" their benefits by purchasing larger annuities, Mr. Thaler suggests.
I also discuss a contest between vice and virtue in mutual fund performance, the subject of my Strategies column in Sunday Business. The second-best performer among all general domestic mutual funds in the second quarter was the Vice fund, which focuses on tobacco, alcohol, gambling and military companies. The best performer, though, was the Virtus Small-Cap Sustainable Growth fund. Virtus is a Latin word for virtue. How virtuous is the Virtus fund? There are some answers in the podcast and in the column.

HEADLINE: The Cubicle Is a Canvas at a Midtown Art Show

BYLINE: ADRIANE QUINLAN


HIGHLIGHT: When a receptionist at a law firm in the Lipstick Building discovered abandoned office space, he convinced his employer to let him put on an art show. Then the fun began. 

 BODY:
David Muenzer, a receptionist at the law firm Latham & Watkins, was feeling bored and curious one day in February. He decided to explore the firm's storage space. 
Then, in a turn of events that would make for a recession-era "Alice in Wonderland," Mr. Muenzer, 24, discovered two vacant floors of 885 Third Avenue in Midtown. It was a ghost town of abandoned cubicles, complete with motivational posters, name plates and white boards with plans for another day at work. A bit of snooping revealed that the 32,000-square-foot space had been vacated by Morgan Stanley in 2008, amid the housing crisis. 
"Within seconds of being in here, I knew," said Mr. Muenzer. The space had a feeling, he said, that "underscores the absence of the worker." 
Mr. Muenzer, a receptionist by day and conceptual artist by night, convinced his employers to let him use the floors to host an art show. (The law firm had leased the space but would not begin renovating until the fall.) Rather than stripping the office to give it the conventional feel of the white cube galleries that dot Chelsea, he kept the office as was - complete with pale yellow walls, emerald carpet, pushpins and plants.
 The artist Rebecca Lieb filled an office with dirt. Trisha Baga hung a trophy around the neck of a potted tree. Mr. Muenzer stuffed the mail room with letters dyed with food coloring. Craig Kalpakjian placed a looped video of an endless hallway at the end of a hallway. Rachel Harrison overturned a cubicle wall and painted it with the name "Julie Taymor." 
"When you've been exhibiting for a long time, which I have now - yeah, this is a slightly unique situation," said Ms. Harrison, who surrounded a water cooler with hundreds of pounds of gray material, giving it the effect of being engorged in a stone cave. "It's not like we're in Nebraska and it's someone's father's law office." 
No, 885 Third Avenue is not someone's father's Midwestern law office. It is known as the Lipstick Building, for its design: a curving column of red marble designed by the Modernist architect Philip Johnson. More recently, it has become known for having housed Bernard Madoff's operations, on its 17th floor. In 2010, the building's owner filed for bankruptcy. 
Morgan Stanley's decision to leave in 2008 was also product of a tough economy. "It was too expensive," said Pen Pendleton, a Morgan Stanley spokesman.
The show, "14 & 15," could have been vengeful; after all, even artists were not immune to the effects of the economic meltdown. Instead it felt archaeological, with the artists casting themselves as explorers uncovering a foreign world. 
"I felt like we found things in there," Ms. Harrison said, describing her discoveries in the electrical room. "Nothing had moved in years."
On a recent tour, Mr. Muenzer pointed out USB cords left curled in a corner, a thumbtack lodged in a wall and black marks on the floor: Relics of an ancient world. "The scuffs are very interesting," he said. "Judicious cleaning was an important creative act." 
Jennifer Murray, administrator of the New York office of Latham & Watkins, wrote in an e-mail that the firm "readily agreed to the concept" of the gallery. 
 At the opening last month, twenty-somethings drank wine in front of a white board, artists peered into cubicles, a group of women chatted around the engorged water cooler. It was like an office, a real office, but with everything topsy-turvy. The bohemian sub-economy stomped on office carpets like astronauts walking on a soundless moon. One guest wondered if a dead plant - placed in a corner - was a piece, or wasn't. 
 It was. "There were some live plants," Ms. Harrison recalled. "So I found a dead plant to put there. I thought that was funny." 
"14 & 15" will be on display at 885 Third Ave through October 31 by appointment. Contact fourteenandfifteen@gmail.com for more information.

HEADLINE: They, Too, Sing America

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
Last week I spent a few days in the Deep South -- a thousand miles from the moneyed canyons of Manhattan and the prattle of Washington politics -- talking to everyday people, blue-collar workers, people not trying to win the future so much as survive the present. 
They do hard jobs and odd jobs -- any work they can find to keep the lights on and the children fed.
No one mentioned the asinine argument about the debt ceiling. No one. Life is pressing down on them so hard that they can barely breathe. They just want Washington to work, the way they do.
They are honest people who do honest work -- crack-the-bones work; lift-it, chop-it, empty-it, glide-it-in-smooth work; feel-the-flames-up-close work; crawl-down-in-there work -- things that no one wants to do but that someone must.
They are women whose skin glistens from steam and sweat, whose hands stay damp from being dipped in buckets and dried on aprons. They are men who work in boots with steel toes, the kind that don't take shining, the kind that lean over and tell stories when you take them off.
They are people whose bodies melt every night in a hot bath, then stiffen by sunrise, so much so that it takes pills for them to get out of bed without pain.
They, too, sing America. But they're the ones less talked about -- either not glamorous enough or rancorous enough. They are the ones without champions, waiting for Democrats to gather the gumption to defend the working poor with the same ferocity with which Republicans protect the filthy rich, waiting for a tomorrow that never comes.
People think of them as somehow part of America's past. But not so. No, most aren't STEM workers (science, technology, engineering and mathematics workers), who grow up high where all can see. But they are the root, underfoot and out of sight, growing just the same.
The Economics and Statistics Administration of the Department of Commerce issued a report this week that touted STEM jobs as ''driving our nation's innovation and competitiveness,'' having higher wages, and projected to grow ''by 17 percent from 2008 to 2018, compared to 9.8 percent growth for non-STEM occupations.''
But there's another side to that story.
As the Bureau of Labor Statistics points out, half of the top 30 occupations expected to see the largest job growth over the same period, and seven of the top 10, are low-wage or very low-wage jobs. Only eight even require a degree. Most simply require on-the-job training.
The people who work these jobs are the backbone of this country, and will continue to be. In fact, Washington could learn a lot about backbone from listening to them. We would all be better served by politicians who work as they do -- willing to do the things that no one wants to do but that someone must.

HEADLINE: How Clergy Helped a Same-Sex Marriage Law Pass

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN. 
Email: sgf1@columbia.edu

 BODY:
Early in the week that ended with New York enacting same-sex marriage, the Rev. Anna Taylor Sweringen stood in a hallway just outside the State Senate chambers. She wore her clerical collar and held a sign saying, ''Equality now.'' Around her gathered ministers and rabbis of similar sentiment, all in Albany to lobby and pray for the right of gay couples to wed.
As Ms. Taylor Sweringen looked down the corridor, she saw the mirror image of mobilized clergy members, all irreconcilably opposed. One held a placard declaring, ''God says no.'' Then the assemblage broke into a gospel song. ''I told Satan to get thee behind,'' it went. ''Victory today is mine.'' 
Among her allies, Ms. Taylor Sweringen responded with a spiritual from the civil rights movement, ''I'm Gonna Sit at the Welcome Table.'' Soon the dueling choirs were lining up along facing walls, barely inches apart, and the state police had to clear a path between them like a boxing referee.
It was a piquant and immensely revealing moment. The conventional -- and erroneous -- perception of the gay-marriage issue is that it pits secular forces against religious ones. From New York to California, wherever and whenever the battle has flared, news coverage has focused almost entirely on the religious groups who uniformly denounce it: Mormons, Roman Catholics, evangelical Christians and many Hispanic Pentecostals and African-American Protestants.
Yet the passage of same-sex marriage in New York last month, just two years after its defeat here, attests to the concerted, sustained efforts by liberal Christian and Jewish clergy to advocate for it in the language of faith, to counter the language of morality voiced by foes. In so doing, they provided a kind of political and theological cover to the moderate and conservative state senators who cast the vital swing votes for a 33-to-29 margin.
''It's like affirmation that this is a spiritual issue, and that it's integral to a person's faith,'' said Ms. Taylor Sweringen, 54, during an interview this week at her Brooklyn home. ''How can you be a person of faith and not be where the issues of justice are being debated?''
Julian E. Zelizer observed the New York vote from his perspective as a history professor at Princeton, a former faculty member at the State University at Albany and the son of a Conservative Jewish rabbi.
''If religious support is fractured, and supporters of the legislation can point to clergy who are on their side,'' he wrote in an e-mail, ''then it's easier to counteract the claim of religious conservatives who say there is only one answer to this question. As in previous examples, politicians draw on clergy to give themselves moral authority when taking on these kinds of social and cultural issues. We know more about how the right has done it, but liberals can do the same.''
Those previous examples, Dr. Zelizer noted, include the civil rights movement. For example, by putting their imprimatur on the cause, Roman Catholic bishops and the National Council of Churches helped persuade several conservative Republican senators to defy a Southern filibuster and ultimately pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the first of President Lyndon B. Johnson's series of landmark laws.
In the case of Ms. Taylor Sweringen and same-sex marriage, both personal history and political organization brought her to that Albany hallway. Her spiritual journey intersected with the strategy of the Empire State Pride Agenda, a lobbying group for gay issues, to develop a cohort of sympathetic, active clergy members.
After a ''born again'' experience in her late teens, Ms. Taylor Sweringen joined a house church and adopted its conservative theology about homosexuality. '' 'Hate the sin and love the sinner,' that was me,'' she recalled. ''Nobody was going to come out to me.''
As she began worshiping in a Presbyterian church, as she enrolled in seminary and especially as she studied and prayed alongside a gay colleague while interning with a Manhattan congregation, she struggled to reconcile her instinct for equality with her rigid dogma.
The answer emerged from a text she had committed to memory in her house-church days: Acts 10. In the passage, Peter dreams about being told to eat certain foods. He refuses, because they are forbidden. Then the voice explains that nothing God has made clean can be impure.
Ms. Taylor Sweringen, an African-American minister in both the Presbyterian and United Church of Christ denominations, was at the crossroads of the debate on gay rights. She associated those rights with the civil rights that blacks had fought and died to achieve. Yet black Christians, however liberal most are on economic issues, hold to a deep strain of social conservatism, particularly regarding homosexuality.
''There's a denial and a hiding behind tradition and teaching,'' Ms. Taylor Sweringen said. ''I see it as tied to the internalized racism of hating someone else to make yourself more acceptable to the larger society.''
By 2008, as an outspoken advocate for gay rights who was ordained in both denominations, Ms. Taylor Sweringen was recruited by Empire State Pride Agenda. Its Pride in the Pulpit initiative had begun in 2004 with the aim of identifying and enlisting clergy members as allies, most of them from mainline Protestant and Reform Jewish denominations.
A group that began as several dozen ministers and rabbis expanded to more than 700 by the 2011 legislative session. The ranks included the Episcopal bishop of Rochester, the executive director of the Long Island Council of Churches and the presidents of both Union Theological Seminary and Hebrew Union College -- an estimable amount of religious influence.
Ms. Taylor Sweringen went to work winning over local clergy members in Queens and Brooklyn, especially in the districts of two state senators with swing votes. At news conferences, she spoke of her own interracial marriage, one that would have been illegal in many American states before a 1967 Supreme Court decision. She arranged a meeting between an Empire State Pride Agenda organizer and a high-ranking Presbyterian official, who then joined the lobbying effort. And in the final hectic weeks, she worked the United Church of Christ e-mail list to get boots on the ground with collars around the neck in Albany.
Back home in Brooklyn on the night of June 24, Ms. Taylor Sweringen missed the historic vote. But she was not without a relevant text for it. ''What's that in Micah 6?'' she said the other day. '' 'Do justice. Love mercy.' ''

HEADLINE: No Vacancies, but Some Reservations

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
GULF SHORES, Ala. -- It seems like old times here on the Gulf Coast. The Flora-Bama Lounge is hopping, there's a two-hour wait for a table at the Original Oyster House, and the first complaints you hear among the charter boat operators are about the latest fishing limits -- not oil slicks.
The numbers tell a similar story, with many tourism-related businesses having their best summer in years.
BP felt obliged to note this officially. Last week, in a court filing that included a detailed list of indicators of ''the strength of the gulf economy,'' BP argued that ''there is no basis to assume that claimants, with very limited exceptions, will incur a future loss related to the spill.'' 
The response here: Hold on, it's not that good.
Since the spill last year, messages from the coast have been somewhat mixed, with some businesses arguing that it is continuing to hurt the coast and that more assistance is needed, and others, often led by tourism officials, emphasizing the positive to entice visitors and consumers.
This is not necessarily contradictory, as the effects of the spill were infuriatingly uneven, and a business does not have to be empty to be hurting. But the summer of 2011, a strong one by a variety of measures, has made this balance harder to strike.
BP has long taken issue with the formula created by Kenneth R. Feinberg, who oversees the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, which is dispensing BP's $20 billion compensation fund. Under the formula, settlements would generally be double the demonstrable losses from 2010, with money previously paid by the fund subtracted.
BP has been arguing that this ''future factor'' is too generous. That argument is revisited in its 29-page filing, pointing out the strong revenue figures for lodging in coastal tourism areas in the fall and spring, most surpassing figures from comparable times in 2009 and early 2010.
BP makes the same argument in regard to the strong performance of much of the seafood industry, though the filing devotes less attention to it -- possibly because unresolved questions about the long-term ecological effects of the spill, as well as a lingering nationwide skepticism about gulf seafood, have made its recovery more debatable.
Tourism, on the other hand, seems rather straightforward.
Taxable lodging revenues from rentals in Gulf Shores and its neighboring resort town, Orange Beach, fell by more than half last summer.
After months of aggressive marketing, largely paid for with the tens of millions of dollars that BP sent to states for that very purpose, tourism officials are now boasting of record, or near-record, numbers: going in to the Fourth of July weekend, tourism officials here reported vacation rental occupancy rates that hovered near 100 percent, all above -- and some far above -- rates at comparable times in 2009.
These figures would seem to bear out BP's assertion that the recovery has firmly set in, to the chagrin of some coastal residents.
''Our state and local leaders have been so quick to declare that the beaches, seafood and Gulf Coast are doing fine that we may have screwed up the chances of the remaining outstanding BP oil spill claims to be paid,'' Rick Outzen, publisher of the Independent News, an alternative weekly in Pensacola, Fla., wrote on his blog. Business owners here acknowledge that it has been for the most part a good summer. But they are quick to add that the effects of the spill are more complicated than they may appear.
The tourism business is a lot like farming; it is seasonal and involves managing a financial cycle between fat and lean seasons.
Up to 90 percent of the income for many Gulf Shores businesses is made during June, July and August; by winter that money is largely gone and businesses usually take out lines of credit to prepare for summer.
This was the case going into the summer of 2010, which was itself projected to be something of a recovery year after 2009, a down season of recession and high gas prices.
But in 2010, there was no summer. Hotels sat empty or filled rooms only by offering steep discounts. Smaller businesses like beach chair rentals went under; charter boat operators barely hung on. The whole spend-save-borrow cycle was thrown off.
''What happened last winter was a lot of lenders stopped the line of credit because they didn't know the impact of what the spill was going to be,'' said Sheila Hodges, owner of a real estate firm in Gulf Shores. ''We barely survived the winter. Some didn't survive the winter.''
While initial BP payments and a strong fall and winter helped, some business owners are still carrying around bad credit ratings from those lean days, or paying off loans, or working under franchise agreements that were renegotiated to their disadvantage.
Pedro Mandoki, the owner of Mandoki Hospitality, a management and development consulting firm, made another commonly heard argument: the effects of the recession, which made for a disappointing 2009, look to be fading. While the coast has returned to an upward trajectory, it is still further down than it would have been had this been the second good summer in a row.
The success of these arguments in negotiating settlements has been mixed at best, business owners and lawyers say.
But one concern about the future is raised more than any other.
It was the topic of another document sent out last week, this one to state and local officials from the command center of the spill cleanup operation in New Orleans. It is a draft version of a ''decision matrix,'' a list of several factors to consider in deciding when and when not to remove submerged mats of oil that are still being found, some even in recent days, sitting just offshore.
The prospect of not removing a mat for just about any reason is unacceptable to Taylor Kirschenfeld, an environmental officer for Escambia County, Fla. If a tropical storm or hurricane comes through and whips up those mats, sending tar patties onto the beach, ''it could be the whole thing all over again.''
Thus the gamble that really keeps business owners here on edge: if this happened, it could be devastating, and a business's final settlement with BP might fall far short.
Then again, if it did not happen, then that same settlement -- including a payment for future losses that never occurred -- would turn out to have been a pretty good deal.
Ms. Hodges, the real estate broker here, is mulling that same calculus right now.
Her summer is good and business is strong, and she is tired of negotiating. Still, she is reluctant to agree to a final settlement. It could be a while, she says, before it is known what the summer of 2010 really means.

HEADLINE: Talk of Passports, Not Passes, in Idled N.B.A.

BYLINE: By JORGE CASTILLO

 BODY:
This summer was supposed to be an opportunity for Jeremy Hazell to impress clubs with his play for an N.B.A. summer league team and earn an invitation to a training camp in the fall. From there, he would have worked to earn a spot on the team and the guaranteed contract that would go with it.
Instead, Hazell, a former star guard at Seton Hall, is at home in Harlem, locked out of the league he dreams of playing in, waiting and weighing his options as the N.B.A. heads into an uncertain future.
A job overseas could be Hazell's best option. 
''It is definitely frustrating just because when I come out my senior year, there's a lockout,'' said Hazell, who finished his four-year career at Seton Hall third on the program's career scoring list with 2,146 points but was not selected in the N.B.A. draft last month. ''But it's just the process you got to go through. I can't stop it, so whatever I got to do to get in the league or to go overseas, me and my agent are going to work on that.''
Just being able to pursue his basketball dream marks something of an achievement for Hazell. He was shot in the right armpit during an attempted robbery on Christmas night last year when visiting his family. He had already been out of the lineup after breaking his left wrist in Seton Hall's third game of the season on Nov, 18, but returned and still managed to play in 15 more games.
Recently, his agent, Seth Cohen, said that Hazell received positive feedback in the nine workouts leading to the draft and that Hazell was invited to a three-day workout with the Atlanta Hawks the Sunday after the draft. But because of the lockout, nothing beyond the workout was possible.
''Had it not been for the lockout, he would have played himself onto that roster and would be playing in the N.B.A. this coming season,'' Cohen said.
With the lockout in place, teams are not allowed to sign or make offers to free agents, leaving N.B.A. hopefuls in a peculiar position. Prospective players would typically have an opportunity to play in one of the N.B.A.'s two summer leagues, in Orlando, Fla., and Las Vegas. Both have been canceled.
This year, players have to make a decision: wait until the lockout is over, knowing it could extend well into the season -- as an earlier one did in the 1998-99 season -- or sign with a team overseas.
Since the lockout began on July 1, players from undrafted rookies to at least one established star, Deron Williams of the Nets, have signed agreements to play overseas.
By the Monday after the draft, Ben Hansbrough, a former Notre Dame star, had made his decision: he is going overseas after signing with Bayern Munich in Germany.
''I think with the lockout being what it is and so unpredictable, my best decision would be to go over and play for something that's comparable to an N.B.A. salary that's guaranteed,'' said the undrafted Hansbrough, who was last season's Big East player of the year after averaging 18.4 points. ''They had to know by Monday. I think it was a great offer, and I had time to think about it. With the N.B.A. being so unpredictable, I did it.''
Other undrafted players, like Ohio State's David Lighty and Washington's Matthew Bryan-Amaning, have followed suit. Lighty reportedly signed a two-year contract worth $300,000 with Cantu in Italy, and Bryan-Amaning came to terms on a one-year deal with Hacettepe in Turkey.
In a typical year, players would most likely resist signing with a team overseas until they did not make an N.B.A. team after training camp. Now the decision needs to be made earlier, when the best offers are available. Free agents and drafted players could also go overseas, although it is unlikely that first-round selections will.
But having a contract in the N.B.A. does not mean a player cannot make the jump. Since the league is locking out its players, the players are considered unemployed and can sign with teams overseas if they get clearance from FIBA, world basketball's governing body. On July 7, Williams, the Nets' All-Star point guard, became the first star player to agree to play overseas if the lockout continued into the season. The Turkish club Besiktas will pay him $200,000 a month.
''Even for players who are under contract, there's the possibility of losing the entire season,'' the N.B.A. agent Mark Bartelstein said. ''So do you want to take the risk of losing your entire salary this year versus getting a contract overseas you feel good about? It's a decision you have to make.''
With economies foundering in Europe, the opportunities for N.B.A.-level salaries have dried up considerably in the last couple of years, leaving less money to entice players and a more competitive market.
''There's going to be a bigger supply of players that are looking to go overseas, and so it obviously creates a rush to take jobs because there's more competition for those jobs,'' Bartelstein said, adding that there are ''5 to 10 teams, at the most'' overseas that can offer salaries comparable to those in the N.B.A.
Such was the reason for Nenad Krstic's decision to sign a two-year, $9.8 million contract with CSKA Moscow after starting 67 games with the Celtics and the Thunder last season.
''His decision was really based purely on if there wasn't a lockout, he would not have made that move,'' Krstic's agent, Marc Cornstein, said. ''He was very comfortable with the position he was in with the Celtics. I think he felt comfortable going forward, that he had a great opportunity to be their starting center, but he was very nervous about the lockout and realized that the contract that was offered him with CSKA Moscow was going to be a once-in-the-summer opportunity.''
For Hazell and other N.B.A. hopefuls, that kind of money is not an option. They are just looking to avoid losing a year of development and income.
Cohen said he was seeking only a one- or two-year deal with an N.B.A. out clause after the first year for the 6-foot-5 Hazell. He expects him to play his way into the N.B.A. next summer if he does play overseas this season.
For players like Hazell and Hansbrough, it is a waiting game.
As Hansbrough said, ''Who knows what's going to happen with the N.B.A.?''

HEADLINE: Small Gains on Wall St. Cap a Choppy Week

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Shares rose on Wall Street on Friday, easing the losses sustained over the week, as gains in energy and technology stocks were enough to overcome concern that an impasse over raising the federal debt limit was putting the nation's top credit rating in jeopardy.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.27 points, or 0.56 percent, to 1,316.14. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 42.61 points, or 0.34 percent, to 12,479.73. The Nasdaq composite index rose 27.13 points, or 1 percent, to 2,789.80. 
For the week, the S.& P. 500 lost 2.1 percent; the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.4 percent; and the Nasdaq dropped 2.45 percent.
''There's a lot more company-specific issues driving stocks now, even though there's still macro uncertainty about the debt negotiations in Washington and the European crisis,'' said Jeffrey S. Coons, president of Manning & Napier Advisors in Fairport, N.Y.
Stocks fell from their highs of the day after the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment declined to 63.8 in July from 71.5 in June. The gauge was projected to rise to 72.2, according to the median forecast of 62 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Estimates for the confidence measure ranged from 75 to 68.
Stocks briefly extended their advance after the European Banking Authority said eight banks failed the European Union stress tests with a combined shortfall in capital of 2.5 billion euros ($3.5 billion).
''The stress test results are coming in pretty much as expected, at least at the headline level,'' said E. William Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia. ''Everybody is waiting for more news on the U.S. debt ceiling and more about the E.U. sovereign debt situation, and nobody wants to get too far on one side or the other ahead of the weekend.''
Google stock rose 13 percent, to $597.62, after reporting sales that beat predictions, a sign that it was making progress expanding beyond search advertising. Sales, excluding revenue passed on to partner sites, rose to $6.92 billion. That topped the $6.57 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Clorox shares gained 8.9 percent, to $74.55, its highest price since at least 1980. Carl C. Icahn offered to buy the company for about $10.2 billion in a move intended to draw out other potential bidders.
Shares of Petrohawk Energy, an oil and gas company, rallied 62 percent, to $38.17, after BHP Billiton agreed to buy the company for $12.1 billion in cash, betting natural gas demand would rise in the United States.
As a group, energy companies rose 2.3 percent, the most among 10 industries in the S.& P. 500. Technology stocks added 1.6 percent.
Shares of Ralcorp Holdings fell 0.7 percent, to $86, dropping for a sixth consecutive day. The company, which makes Raisin Bran cereals and private-label food brands, plans to spin off Post Foods after failing to sell the unit to rival food makers or private-equity firms.
Flir Systems shares fell the most in the S.& P. 500, slumping 9.9 percent, to $28.92. Flir, a maker of night-vision cameras used by American combat forces, reported second-quarter profit excluding some items of 35 cents a share, trailing the average analyst estimate by 4 cents, according to Bloomberg data.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 12/32, to 101 27/32, and the yield fell to 2.91 percent from 2.95 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: House Votes to Hamper A Law on Light Bulbs

BYLINE: By SEAN COLLINS WALSH

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House voted on Friday to withhold funding to enforce part of a 2007 law that increases efficiency standards for light bulbs.
The new standards, which would require most light bulbs to be 25 to 30 percent more efficient by 2014 and at least 60 percent more efficient by 2020, have become a symbol of what conservatives see as an unnecessary intrusion into the market. 
''The federal government has no right to tell me or any other citizen what type of light bulb to use at home,'' said Representative Michael C. Burgess, Republican of Texas, who offered the measure as an amendment to a 2012 energy and water spending bill. The light-bulb provision was approved on a voice vote; later the House voted 219 to 196 to pass the energy bill.
Although the efficiency regulations do not specify what types of bulbs are allowed, the standards would effectively eliminate many of the most popular choices on the market beginning with the 100-watt incandescent bulb on Jan. 1. If it becomes law, the provision approved Friday would prevent the Energy Department from enforcing the regulation in 2012.
Republicans have complained about the cost of the more efficient bulbs. A Philips Halogena Energy Saver, for instance, costs more than $3, while traditional incandescent bulbs are about 35 cents.
The Energy Department has said the increased purchase prices will be offset by savings on consumers' energy bills, estimating savings of $6 billion per year by 2015 under the new guidelines.
Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan, who now heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, inserted the light bulb standards in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which President George W. Bush signed into law. Mr. Upton has since reversed his position on the standards he authored.
Democrats have seized on the reversal, saying it is a sign the G.O.P. is becoming more conservative.
Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and his party's whip, called the moves this week ''a political appeal to the far right wing of the Republican Party.''
In floor debates, Democrats contended that the efficiency standards would help the environment and the economy.
''It reduces the amount of energy that we have to think about importing from other countries,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. ''It's really a debate about whether or not we're going to continue to see an increase in the technologies in our society.''
Traditional incandescent bulbs, which use essentially the same design invented by Thomas Alva Edison more than 130 years ago, use only about 10 percent of the energy they consume to produce light, according to the Congressional Research Service. The other 90 percent is wasted as excess heat.
Since the regulations passed in 2007, manufacturers have been developing alternative technologies to decrease the amount of wasted energy, including halogen incandescent bulbs, compact fluorescent lamps and light-emitting diode or LED lights.
Energy Secretary Steven Chu told reporters last week that some of the new bulbs look like current bulbs, turn on instantly and can be used with dimmers, deflecting criticism by Republicans that the newer technologies were inferior.
Earlier in the week, the House rejected a bill to repeal the regulations, because it was brought up under special rules requiring a two-thirds majority. That vote, which largely followed party lines, was 233 to 193 in favor of repeal.

HEADLINE: Foreclosure Protesters in Spain's Cities Now Go Door to Door

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY; Rachel Chaundler contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MADRID -- When the police arrived recently to evict Maria Jose del Coto Maeso, 53, they found the street in front of her ground-floor apartment crowded with protesters, and they retreated.
''It was a day that for many people would have been depressing,'' Ms. del Coto said afterward. ''But for me it turned out to be a day of privilege. I met all these marvelous people. And I was very grateful.''
The young demonstrators who camped out by the thousands in Spain's major city squares for much of May and June, protesting government corruption and an economy that has left them jobless, have mostly gone home. 
But the movement has produced an army of volunteers who are making their presence felt in the tangled world of Spain's foreclosure system -- perhaps the harshest in Europe -- which usually leaves former homeowners in debt for the rest of their lives.
Organizing the protest in front of Ms. del Coto's modest home was Eloi Morte, 28, who was juggling several cellphones. Mr. Morte, a flight attendant, decided to help block evictions after he attended a neighborhood meeting organized by the protesters who had occupied the Puerta del Sol, the city's central square.
''This was something very concrete that I could do,'' he said. ''I wanted to see results, not just vague protests against the financial establishment, the banks. I wanted to do something constructive.''
Spain, like the United States, experienced a huge housing boom that came to a crashing halt in 2008. As the economy stalled, unemployment rates soared to the highest in the European Union, hovering at 40 percent for young people -- who until recently seemed apathetic. That changed on May 15, when young people began congregating across the country in peaceful protests that lasted weeks in some cities.
Now some of those protesters are using their Internet savvy to gather crowds on behalf of beleaguered homeowners. Hundreds of protesters are showing up at threatened evictions like Ms. del Coto's. They are getting press coverage as never before -- and, some say, results.
Since June, about 30 evictions have been blocked, according to a nonprofit housing advocacy group known by its initials, P.A.H. -- more than twice the rate than before. And eviction protests are taking place in more cities.
This month, the government and the opposition in Parliament, no doubt looking toward elections next year, issued statements saying they would overhaul the foreclosure laws.
''We are proud that today our demands have become a popular clamor,'' said Ada Colau, a human rights lawyer with P.A.H. ''This has forced the government to react, despite the pressure from the banks.''
When Spanish mortgage debtors cannot make their payments, Spanish law denies them two ways out that are common elsewhere: they cannot simply hand the keys back to the bank and walk away, and they cannot discharge their debt in bankruptcy. They remain personally liable for the full amount of the loan after foreclosure, and when penalty and interest charges and tens of thousands of dollars in court fees are counted, they can end up on the street facing a mountain of debt.
Housing advocates would like to see Spain move to a system that more resembles that of the United States. But the new proposals do not go nearly that far. Most are meant only to ease the current conditions. For instance, banks would still be allowed to take a percentage of a debtor's salary, but not quite so large a percentage. Similarly, if no one appears at a foreclosure auction and the bank buys the property itself, it will have to pay 60 percent of market value, up from 50 percent under current law.
Still, housing advocates say the proposals are a start.
Santos Gonzalez Sanchez, the president of a lender's trade group, the Spanish Mortgage Association, says some of the proposals are not well thought out and that the issues need further study. He dismisses the protesters as ''more anecdotal than effective.''
There were about 94,000 foreclosures in Spain last year, nearly four times the number for 2007. It can take more than a year to evict the occupants after a foreclosure, and banks sometimes agree to lease the homes back to their former owners.
The excesses in real estate and banking here were profound, with banks lending at an astonishing pace, often to customers who were poor risks and did not understand the fine print. People who signed mortgages as guarantors were often surprised to realize that they could lose everything they owned.
Ms. del Coto guaranteed a loan for a partner who has since left her and her children, including a disabled 26-year-old son who fell from a window as a toddler. She said she was looking for work as a maid again, but had not found any. Nor does she have a place to move if she is turned out of the tidy home she has been in for 25 years.
The protests block the evictions only temporarily. Advocates say that when the police and other officials involved in the eviction see the crowds, they usually walk away. It takes at least a month to organize another eviction effort, they said, and sometimes much longer.
Mr. Morte said the protesters hoped that in the meantime the bank would be persuaded to rent the house to Ms. del Coto at a price she could afford.
''That is our hope with all of these protests,'' he said, ''that a negotiation can keep people from being put out on the street.''

HEADLINE: Newark Museum Receives $1 Million Grant

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
The Newark Museum has received a $1 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support initiatives related to its African art collection. The grant will allow the museum to hire a new assistant curator, doubling the size of its African art department, and to engage additional scholars for research, the museum's director, Mary Sue Sweeney Price, said in a telephone interview. 
The museum is also planning an expansion and reinstallation of its African art galleries, which will open in 2015. It received a $500,000 challenge grant toward that project from the National Endowment for the Humanities, which requires the museum to raise an additional $1.5 million from private sources. Ms. Price said the museum was making progress toward that goal and would announce some major gifts in the next few months.
The Newark Museum, which has long received a major portion of its funding from the State of New Jersey, has had to cope with a more than 50 percent reduction in its state subsidy in recent years. Last year it let go 15 percent of its staff and closed for a month in the late summer. ''The institution is doing what all institutions are doing, which is focus on your core strengths and bring those forward and work with your community,'' Ms. Price said. ''The result, I hope, will be a stronger and more vibrant museum that can survive the current economic downsizing in the wider cultural world.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Consumer Sentiment Slumped in Early July

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Consumer confidence hit its lowest level in nearly two and a half years in early July while manufacturing rose slightly in June, damping expectations of a quick economic rebound in the second half of this year.
Worries about stubbornly high unemployment pushed the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment to 63.8, the lowest level since March 2009, a report showed on Friday. Economists had expected the index to rise to 72.5, from 71.5 in June. 
Separate data from the Federal Reserve showed that industrial production rose a modest 0.2 percent in June after two months of slight declines. Output was held back partly by supply disruptions in the auto industry related to the March 11 earthquake in Japan.
The reports were the latest in a series, including weak retail sales and employment, to suggest that an anticipated step-up in growth in the second half of the year might not be as strong as initially thought.
''We still expect an improvement in the second half, but the question is, How much can we grow?'' said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an economist at BNP Paribas in New York. ''Our view is the rebound is not going to be anything like in the prior cycles because we are growing at a lower potential rate right now.''
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said this week that the central bank was prepared to act if growth faltered further but made it clear that the Fed was not yet at that point.
The economy was hit by a combination of high commodity prices and bad weather, causing growth to slow sharply to a 1.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter after a brisk 3.1 percent in the final three months of 2010.
Disruptions to motor vehicle production and still-high gasoline prices are expected to have held growth to a rate of 1.5 to 2 percent in the second quarter. The government will release its initial second-quarter gross domestic product estimate on July 29.
Manufacturing in the second quarter posted its weakest rise since the recession ended in mid-2009. There are indications that manufacturing maintained its weak tone as the third quarter started.
The decline in consumer sentiment, which came even as gasoline prices dropped from a peak of more than $4 a gallon in May, does not bode well for consumer spending.
The debate in Washington over raising the country's debt ceiling is adding to economic uncertainty.
Hard-pressed consumers could get a reprieve from declining commodity prices. Labor Department data showed that the Consumer Price Indexfell 0.2 percent in June as gasoline prices tumbled 6.8 percent. Despite declines in the last two months, gas prices are up 35.6 percent over the previous 12 months.
The drop in consumer prices was the first in a year. Prices increased 0.2 percent in May.
Stripping out food and energy, however, the core index rose 0.3 percent after a similar gain in May. The rise in core inflation reflected a lagged pass-through from high commodity prices, and economists saw no threat of an upward spiral in price pressures.
In the 12 months to June, core inflation rose 1.6 percent after increasing 1.5 percent in May. This narrower measure of prices was pushed up by rises in housing, new vehicles, used trucks and apparel. Apparel prices recorded their biggest jump since March 1990, while the rise in used cars and trucks was the biggest in more than one and a half years. Fed officials would like to see core inflation closer to 2 percent.
Wage growth remained benign, with average hourly earnings flat in June. In the 12 months through June, average hourly earnings rose 1.9 percent. In addition, capacity use at factories was unchanged at 76.7 percent in June, pointing to slack in the economy.

HEADLINE: Only a Few More Yards To Go in N.F.L. Talks

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
After a flurry of deal-making over a two-day span, the N.F.L. is on the verge of a new labor agreement with its players, with just a few ancillary issues left to be settled, a person briefed on the negotiations said Friday. ''It was a good day,'' the person said. 
With the economic system all but set, negotiators broke for the weekend, leaving lawyers and staff members to continue drafting the agreement. Commissioner Roger Goodell and the players' leader, DeMaurice Smith, are also expected to talk over the weekend, and the sides will meet with the mediator, Judge Arthur Boylan, early next week. The owners plan to meet in Atlanta on Thursday, when they hope to ratify an agreement.
Left to be decided in the coming days, though, is a potentially problematic issue: how the antitrust litigation filed by players in March will be resolved. The league wants the matter withdrawn. But lawyers for the players could press for a class action settlement, which could take months to resolve and which would keep alive the decertification-antitrust litigation strategy for future use. That, said a second person briefed on negotiations, is a deal-breaker for the league.
Still, as owners and players departed for the weekend, they released an upbeat joint statement.
''The discussions this week have been constructive and progress has been made on a wide range of issues,'' the statement said.
The biggest of those was settling the rookie wage system, which feeds into the larger revenue split between owners and players. First-round draft picks will sign four-year deals with a team option for a fifth year. For the top 10 picks in the draft, their fifth-year salary, if the team picks up the option, will be equal to the average of the top 10 highest paid players at their position. The rest of the first-rounders will have their fifth-year salary be the average of the third- to 25th-highest-paid players at their position. Over all, players are expected to receive 46 percent to 48 percent of revenue each year.
Retired players, who have asked for a voice in recent negotiations, are expected to talk with league representatives this weekend. But their benefits could be settled after the overall agreement is ratified. It is a solution that the lawyer for some retirees, Michael Hausfeld, had hoped for when he filed a complaint saying the players association had no right to negotiate benefits on the retirees' behalf after the union dissolved itself.
Once all the details are worked out, it will still take several days before the N.F.L. can reopen for business. Players will have to agree to the deal, and will probably have to recertify their union, and the owners will vote. The discussion among owners may be freighted with revenue-sharing issues. That is particularly so for lower-revenue teams that will be concerned about the mandatory ''cash spend'' figure included in the new deal, which is expected to be at least 90 percent of the salary cap -- which will probably be around $120 million.
After the sides vote to ratify an agreement, free agency is likely to start a few days later. That could preserve the entire preseason, including the Hall of Fame game, which is scheduled for Aug. 7.

HEADLINE: Credit Suisse Discloses U.S. Inquiry Over Taxes

BYLINE: By CHRIS V. NICHOLSON

 BODY:
7:50 p.m. Updated
Credit Suisse disclosed Friday that it was being investigated by the Justice Department to see whether its private banking unit helped Americans evade taxes, raising the possibility that the bank could face legal proceedings similar to those that led its Swiss rival, UBS, to pay a costly settlement and open its books to American tax authorities.
Citing ''a broader industry inquiry,'' Credit Suisse said it had previously received subpoenas and other information requests from the Justice Department and other government agencies regarding the cross-border services that its private banking arm provided to its rich American clients. The bank also said it was told it was ''a target'' of the investigation on Thursday. 
''Subject to our Swiss legal obligations, we will continue to cooperate with the U.S. authorities in an effort to resolve these matters,'' the bank said.
Jeffrey A. Neiman, a former federal prosecutor who had been assigned to the UBS case, called Credit Suisse's disclosure ''deja vu all over again.''
''The Justice Department could not signal more strongly to an individual entity that they consider them to be in gross violation of the law than by calling them the target of an investigation,'' he said. ''The bank, and its U.S. clients, should take that very seriously.''
Four private bankers tied to Credit Suisse were indicted in the United States in February for helping American citizens evade taxes. The four - Marco Parenti Adami, Emanuel Agustoni, Michele Bergantino and Roger Schaerer - were also linked to Bank Leumi, the big Israeli bank, and Bank Frey and Maerki Baumann, two smaller Swiss private banks. They have been accused of conspiracy and fraud.
The bankers, three of whom had left Credit Suisse before they were indicted, were accused of helping American clients set up offshore accounts under false names, and shifting money from Credit Suisse accounts to smaller Swiss private banks.
At the time, Credit Suisse said it was not the object of an investigation by the Justice Department, and industry analysts thought the bank might be able to strike a deal with American authorities by paying a fine, much like UBS did in 2009.
The announcement on Friday raises the stakes for Credit Suisse. UBS paid a $780 million fine and handed over data on thousands of clients to avoid a conviction in a similar case that could have cost it its banking license in the United States.
On Friday, a Swiss court upheld the Swiss government's decision to force UBS to hand over client data, citing ''virtually uncontrollable economic repercussions for Switzerland'' if it had not done so. That decision implies that Credit Suisse, too, may be ordered to surrender information about customers' accounts to American authorities.
''The U.S. government will most likely demand not just payment of back taxes but the disclosure of client data,'' Mr. Neiman said, suggesting that there could be no half measures because of Swiss banking secrecy laws. ''They don't reach resolution with a corporate entity unless they cooperate fully,'' he said.
In March, an American citizen, Edward Gurary, pleaded guilty to tax evasion and admitted hiding assets not only at UBS, but also at Credit Suisse. The Justice Department began its investigation of Credit Suisse's private banking operations, along with those of HSBC, in 2008, as an outgrowth of the UBS inquiry. The investigation began by focusing on suspicions that the two banks held $30 billion in offshore accounts that American clients had not declared to the Internal Revenue Service.
Last month, Steven T. Miller, the deputy commissioner for services and enforcement at the I.R.S., said during a conference on taxation in Washington that the authorities planned to take action against one or more banks soon, without mentioning any by name, an attendee at the meeting said.
Credit Suisse has tangled with the Justice Department before and lost. In December 2009, Credit Suisse paid $536 million to settle charges that it had broken American sanctions by helping Iranian banks to hide the identity of their clients in international dealings.
Representatives for the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service declined to comment.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fallback Moving To Fore as Talks On Budget Stall

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and CARL HULSE; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With talks on a big budget deal at a stalemate, Congressional leaders turned Friday to negotiating a fallback plan for raising the debt limit as President Obama and House Republicans intensified their efforts to win over public opinion for the long battle ahead.
Given the impasse, House Republicans scheduled a vote for Tuesday on a measure that would cut deeply into the federal budget, cap government spending for the years ahead and approve a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. The Democratic-controlled Senate may vote Wednesday on a balanced budget amendment. 
While neither measure will become law, given Democrats' opposition, Republicans are eager to show their conservative base that they are not retreating, and that they will press their case for vastly shrinking the government through the 2012 elections.
Mr. Obama signaled that he would support the fallback plan, proposed by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, which would allow for the debt limit to be raised and defer the bigger budget fight.
But the president used his third news conference in two weeks to call again for a ''big deal'' of up to $4 trillion in 10-year savings from spending cuts and tax increases on the wealthy and corporations. And he claimed to have public opinion -- including a majority of Republicans -- on his side in supporting tax increases as part of the solution.
Such a deal seemed out of reach; Republicans refuse to consider tax increases, and without them Mr. Obama will not agree to deep reductions in Medicare.
But top advisers -- William Daley, the White House chief of staff, and Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary -- were on Capitol Hill to meet with Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, given Mr. Boehner's continued interest in a deficit-reduction compromise despite some Republicans' resistance.
Publicly, Mr. Boehner gave no hint of accord. ''We're in the fourth quarter here,'' he said, adding: ''We asked the president to lead. We asked him to put forward a plan -- not a speech, a real plan -- and he hasn't. We will.''
Both sides are eager to avert a crisis, and the blame that would go with it, if the government breaches a $14.3 trillion borrowing ceiling on Aug. 2.
''So now the debate will move from a room in the White House to the House and Senate floors,'' Mr. McConnell said.
He was in talks with the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, on Mr. McConnell's proposal, which is intended to clear the way for an increase in the debt limit over Congress's disapproval, and without the equal spending cuts that Republicans had demanded.
The McConnell plan hinges on the certainty that Congress could not muster a two-thirds vote to override Mr. Obama's veto of any disapproval measures, but it continues to draw opposition from many Republicans.
Mr. Obama gave the plan his back-handed blessing as a last-gasp option for avoiding a government default. ''It is constructive to say that if Washington operates as usual and can't get anything done, let's at least avert Armageddon,'' he said.
Mr. McConnell and Mr. Reid were also discussing the creation of a bipartisan panel of 12 lawmakers to develop a deficit-reduction package. Senior senators would also like to impose spending caps for the next two years, to ease the threat of government shutdowns through 2012.
The administration and many lawmakers saw the Senate deliberations between Mr. McConnell and Mr. Reid as the most likely avenue for achieving an increase in the debt limit.
And in contrast with Mr. Obama's interest in the McConnell plan, the president was quick to oppose the ''cut, cap and balance'' proposal that House Republicans are to vote on next week.
The House proposal would prohibit raising the debt limit unless Congress sends to the states a proposed balanced-budget constitutional amendment. It would also cut federal spending more than $100 billion in 2012. And it would cap future annual spending at a level equal to 18 percent of the total economy; spending for decades has averaged about 20 percent of the gross domestic product and is projected to rise for years as the government faces higher costs for the health and retirement benefits of the aging baby boomers.
House Republicans cheered their leaders' decision to push the proposal, saying it could put them back on the offensive after a week in which many felt out-flanked by the White House.
But Mr. Obama said the proposed spending cap ''would require cutting Social Security or Medicare substantially.'' As for a balanced-budget amendment, he said, ''We don't need a constitutional amendment to do our jobs.''
Mr. Obama attacked Congressional Republicans for rebuffing ''shared sacrifice and a balanced approach'' in their zeal to cut spending while refusing to raise taxes on the wealthy or close corporate tax loopholes.
Without citing specific polls, he told reporters at the White House: ''The clear majority of Republican voters think that any deficit reduction package should have a balanced approach and should include some revenues. That's not just Democrats -- that's the majority of Republicans.'' He also cited support from ''a whole slew of Republican officials from previous administrations'' and bipartisan commissions for higher revenues along with spending cuts.
Polls consistently show that a majority of Americans favor higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations to help reduce federal debt, but results for Republicans vary depending on the wording of poll questions.
A New York Times/CBS News poll in April showed 55 percent of Republicans supporting an increase in federal taxes for households with incomes of more than $250,000 a year, starting in 2013, as Mr. Obama proposes. In May, the Pew Research Center found 49 percent of Republicans approving.
In 2012, Mr. Obama said: ''We're going to have a big, serious debate about what we believe is the right way to guide America forward and to win the future. And I'm confident that I will win that debate, because I think that we've got the better approach.''
But the president also acknowledged differences within his party, given liberal Democrats' opposition to some of his proposed concessions to Republicans on entitlement programs like Medicare. In his news conference, Mr. Obama endorsed means-testing for Medicare so that higher-income beneficiaries pay more, but he stopped short of endorsing a gradual increase in the eligibility age to 67 from 65.

HEADLINE: From Honus to Derek, Memorabilia Is More Than Signed Bats

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
THE best birthday present I ever received came from my wife. She gave me a baseball from the 2009 World Series signed by Derek Jeter, the New York Yankees shortstop. I treasure it because he's my favorite player but also because my newborn daughter slept in my arms while I watched the Yankees win that World Series.
Like many Yankees' fans, I spent last Saturday watching the coverage of Jeter getting his 3,000th hit over and over. And then, I thought of all the memorabilia that was coming -- all the balls, bats, jerseys, photos and anything you could imagine signed by Jeter.
Three days later, I actually saw some of that memorabilia in the making, at the headquarters of Steiner Sports in New Rochelle, N.Y. The Steiner warehouse looked like a cross between a Home Depot and Santa's workshop, with shelves stacked to the ceiling with sports merchandise. I saw a half-dozen men framing photographs Jeter had signed Sunday night. There were boxes of balls he had also signed, stacked like crates of oranges. Blown-up Sports Illustrated covers of Jeter were in the back, out of the way for the time being. 
I had gone to Steiner Sports to see more than just the Jeter memorabilia, though. I also wanted to understand the broader market for baseball collectibles. What types of things appreciate? Can a collector expect to profit from his hobby? Most important, how do you know if what you have is valuable or just an expensive tchotchke? Here is some of what I learned:
STRIKEOUTS Chances are pretty good that the sports memorabilia most people have is not worth much. All the balls, bats and pictures being sold at retail stores and online to commemorate Jeter's milestone fit into that category.
Brandon Steiner, who in 1987 founded Steiner Sports, which is now owned by Omnicom, said there were different levels of collectors, ranging from those who save programs and tickets to people who buy things that were used in a game.
In between is the market for so-called authentic collectibles. A day after his 3,000th hit, Jeter signed 500 balls and 400 photos for Mr. Steiner's company. Those balls are selling for $699.99; the photos range from $599.99 to $799.99.
Mr. Steiner said this was a relatively small signing to meet the immediate demand. He has scheduled two more for Jeter to autograph game-used memorabilia as well as things fans send in and pay a fee to have autographed.
And that's just for one moment in baseball history, awesome though it was. Retired baseball greats and not-so-greats have been signing memorabilia, for a fee, for 30 years at baseball card shows, flooding the autograph market.
The worst offender may be Pete Rose, who holds the record for the most hits ever, 4,256. Since he was caught betting on baseball and banned from the sport, he has been a prolific signer. Balls inscribed ''I'm sorry I bet on baseball -- Pete Rose'' are being sold on Walmart.com for $189.99 and on Amazon.com for $159.95. (A ball with just his name costs $69.99.)
This segment of the memorabilia industry is an easy target for purists. ''I have total disdain for the manufactured memorabilia market,'' said Richard Simon, a baseball autograph dealer and authenticator. ''That is what is going on right now, as opposed to Babe Ruth signing an autograph book or a photo of himself 70 years ago.''
But Mr. Steiner is unapologetic. ''The last three or four years, I've been thinking, how do we get to the average fan who can't afford authentic, let alone game-used?'' he said. He cited ballpark dirt and the bricks from the old Yankee Stadium as affordable keepsakes. ''People laugh at me about the dirt, but I've sold over $10 million worth of dirt.''
Howie Schwartz, chief executive of GrandStandSports.com and a competitor to Steiner, said the relative affordability of Jeter memorabilia -- ranging from $400 to $1,000 -- matches up well with the huge market for him.
''Look at how many people watch baseball and how many kids play baseball,'' he said. The average consumer may think 900 items is a lot. But there were 50,000 fans at Yankees Stadium that day.''
Still, while 50,000 people buying identical signed baseballs may be good for the seller, it is not good for anyone who expects the collectible to increase, or even hold, its value.
HOME RUNS The market for high-end sports memorabilia is different.
The most famous baseball collectible of all time is a baseball card known as the T206. It depicts Honus Wagner, a Hall of Fame shortstop from the early 20th century, and there are only about 60 still around. (Wagner ordered the maker, the American Tobacco Company, to stop production, legend has it, because he was not paid enough for his image or feared that children would buy cigarettes to get it.) The T206 once owned by the hockey legend Wayne Gretzky was sold in 2007 for $2.8 million to Ken Kendrick, owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks.
At the other end of the scale is the baseball Mark McGwire hit for his record-setting 70th home run in 1998. Todd McFarlane, a Hollywood producer and toymaker, bought it in 1999 for $3 million. Mr. McGwire has since admitted steroid use, and Roger Ponn, president of Roger Ponn Associated Appraisers, said he would be surprised if Mr. McFarlane could get six figures for it now.
Mr. Ponn's advice to avoid getting caught with a lemon is morbid but practical. ''Dead sports stars' event-used memorabilia will rarely go down in value,'' he said.
Scarcity is also a key. Jerry Zuckerman, president of Tary Enterprises, a dealer in Oradell, N.J., said he sold a New York Yankees jersey that Lou Gehrig wore for away games for $363,000 in 1992. Today, he said, it was worth $750,000. A similar jersey worn by Babe Ruth would be worth slightly less, he said, because there are many more of them.
''It's an up and down market depending on the economy,'' Mr. Zuckerman said. ''But if you buy quality, that tends to fluctuate less. Game-worn uniforms of exceptional Hall of Famers will always be a valuable item.''
The worst investments come from athletes who played from the 1970s to the present. Many became fixtures at card-collecting conventions and have devalued their signature by signing too many things.
''Sometimes a promoter will have a sports star sign, say, jerseys in a limited edition of 300, but then another couple months later, the sports star will sign another 300 in a limited edition,'' Mr. Ponn said. ''The market for it is nil.''
But for those collectors with something unique, there are other questions. There will only be one 3,000th hit ball from Derek Jeter. And it, like all one-of-a-kind items, needs to be insured. But just as important for collectors is how they care for what they have.
''A faded signature is not a covered loss,'' said Robert Courtemanche, president of ACE Private Risk Services. ''That's a wear and tear thing. We cover it from an unexpected act -- flood, fire, theft.''
Mr. Courtemanche is also an avid collector of sports memorabilia. He said he focused on the teams from when he was growing up on Long Island in the 1960s: the Mets, Jets, Knicks and Rangers. He said he has every Tom Seaver baseball card issued, and some Super Bowl memorabilia signed by Joe Namath.
While he knows what his collection is worth for insurance purposes, he said he did not think about it in terms of its value. ''I'd never contemplate selling it,'' he said. ''I enjoy the stuff for what it is.''
And that's what memorabilia was once meant to be, a connection to a particular time. While I now know that my signed Jeter baseball will not finance my retirement, it will remind me of watching the 2009 World Series with my daughter on my lap.

HEADLINE: Citigroup, Profit Up, Increases Investment

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
8:43 p.m. Updated
For two and a half years, Vikram S. Pandit was forced to hunker down to fix Citigroup's troubled businesses and fend off the bank's critics in Washington.
Now, after reporting a 24 percent profit increase for the second quarter, Mr. Pandit, Citi's chief executive, is starting to play offense.
Citigroup has been hiring dozens of investment bankers, dialing up advertising and drawing up plans to add several hundred branches from Buenos Aires to Bucharest, including more than 200 in major cities across the United States. The bank is in the middle of stitching together its disparate technology systems - a mammoth effort known internally as Project Rainbow - and spending more than $1 billion a year to keep up its prized global transaction services franchise. 
As a result, expenses have shot up more than 9 percent from last year and are expected to remain elevated though the end of 2011. Investors may have to wait a year or longer to see the payoff.
Despite an earful from Wall Street analysts, Citi executives say that after several years of cutting back on investment spending, they need to loosen their purse strings to make up lost ground.
''Coming out of the crisis, there wasn't a lot of investing going on in 2008 and 2009,'' John C. Gerspach, Citigroup's chief financial officer, said during a conference call with journalists.
Stronger rivals like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo have been investing all along. Now, Mr. Gerspach added, ''We are in investment mode.''
How Mr. Pandit keeps close tabs on expenses while building out his global banking franchise is perhaps his next great challenge. After clawing Citi back from the brink of collapse during the financial crisis, he has been engaged in an ambitious plan to transform it from a sprawling financial supermarket to a leaner, more focused company.
Mr. Pandit has been successful shedding assets, improving risk management and severing the bank's ties with the federal government. His efforts, however, have not lifted Citi's share price. It has floundered since the completion of a reverse stock split in early May that took the price to around $45 from $4.50. On Friday, it closed at $38.38, down 1.64 percent.
Citi showed the inherent power of its franchise when it pulled off a second-quarter profit of $3.3 billion, up from $2.7 billion last year, despite a sluggish global economy. Many analysts were skeptical of that headline.
Despite modest loan growth and strong investment banking fees, almost half of the bank's pretax operating profit came from the reversal of more than $2 billion of funds the bank had set aside earlier to cover credit card and other loan losses.
And unlike the solid gains that JPMorgan showed on Thursday, revenue at Citigroup fell 7 percent from a year earlier, to $20.6 billion.
Profit in Citigroup's investment bank was down by almost one-third from a year ago, falling to $1.2 billion. Traders on the currency, interest rate and mortgage desks were hard hit, while Citi's equity derivatives group also reported lower revenues.
Its North American banking operations also struggled, with a litany of mortgage troubles continuing to weigh on its results. ''I consider mortgages the biggest risk we run,'' Mr. Gerspach said.
Although tighter supervision and the smaller size of Citi's mortgage unit allowed it to avoid the charges that swamped Bank of America and Chase's results, Citi was still forced to set aside an extra $224 million to cover potential losses on securities backed by faulty loans that it had sold to investors. That brought its total reserves to $1 billion.
The bank also raised its projections of mortgage servicing cost increases to around $70 million a quarter - double its prior estimates, although nowhere near the billion-dollar charges taken by its larger peers.
Abroad, the news was mixed. For the last two years, the bank's consumer businesses in Asia and Latin America have been one of the few bright spots. Loan losses eased faster in those regions than in the United States, and corporate lending has been quicker to gain steam. That was true again in the second quarter, when nearly 60 percent of profit came from emerging markets.
But its European results were weak, particularly in its investment banking unit.
And then there is the expense problem. Operating costs for Citi's core operations rose to $10.1 billion, a 14 percent increase from a year ago. Bank executives said that about one-third of that cost could be attributable to unfavorable exchange rates and another third to increased legal expenditures tied to mortgages and other issues. The rest comes from technology investments, hiring and other expansion efforts, largely outside the United States.
''We don't like the idea that our expenses are going to be above guidance any more than anyone else does,'' Mr. Gerspach said. ''You can either manage back down to the guidance by cutting investment programs, or you can agree to press on.''
Some Citi analysts and investors, who have a long history of hearing the bank's executives make promises they cannot fulfill, were skeptical. Others say the bank has little choice.
''The company was on its death bed, and the investing they were doing was to make sure they survived,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ''Now, they are looking to make up for that period of time.''
Just as with investment spending, Citigroup will be playing catch-up to its main competitors when it comes to buying back its own shares. JPMorgan, for example, announced that it had repurchased about $3.5 billion of the company's stock in the second quarter. Mr. Pandit has said that the bank is unlikely to do so until sometime in 2012.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: No Matter How Debt Debate Ends, Governors See More Cuts for States

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
SALT LAKE CITY -- The rancorous debate in Washington over whether to raise the federal debt ceiling is alarming many of the nation's governors from both parties, who fear that whatever the outcome, much-needed money will almost certainly be drained from their states.
If the federal debt limit is not raised, several governors said as they gathered here on Friday for the semiannual meeting of the National Governors Association, the ensuing default will harm the economy, make it difficult for states to borrow money and delay some of the vital federal payments that states count on for everything from Medicaid to unemployment benefits.
But even if the debt ceiling is raised, as many governors expect it ultimately will be, states could still pay a high price. Both Democrats and Republicans in Washington want to pair any increase in the debt limit with deep new spending cuts -- cuts that many governors fear will hurt their states as they are still recovering slowly from the Great Recession. 
''If I can use a whitewater analogy here, the two rocks we need to shoot between is, on the one side, being needlessly driven into default, which will kill the jobs recovery,'' said Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Commission. ''The other rock is massive public sector cuts, by whatever name, that would also kill the jobs recovery.''
Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, a Republican, said that a default stemming from a failure to increase the borrowing limit would be ''terrible'' for states. But he said that states must also brace themselves for managing a new set of cuts even if the limit is raised. ''No matter what happens, states are going to get less money from the federal government,'' he said.
The uncertainty for states, coming just two weeks after most put new budgets into effect, was a new black cloud on the horizon for governors just when many thought they would have a moment's respite. State tax collections are improving, but are still below their pre-recession levels, and this month the federal stimulus aid that has helped states balance their budgets in recent years dried up. Now states, already struggling to pay for Medicaid for the many people who lost their jobs and health care in the downturn, face the prospect of less federal money for it.
The impact of the standoff in Washington is already being felt in states.
Moody's Investors Service warned more than a dozen states this week that their credit ratings would be re-evaluated in light of the uncertainty in Washington, which could saddle them with higher borrowing costs. Governor O'Malley learned that Maryland was one of them when he stepped off the plane here. ''This happens at a time when we're about to go out for a bond sale,'' he said.
Governors from around the country -- including Christine O. Gregoire of Washington, a Democrat, and Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican -- said that employers in their states had been reluctant to hire new workers because of the uncertainty. And Gov. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, an Independent, said that the threat of dwindling federal aid gave him pause last week before he signed a bill in which his state agreed to pay for heating assistance for the poor that the federal government was expected to cut.
''My argument -- and I did sign it -- was that this was the first of many,'' he said. ''I don't know how much Rhode Island taxpayers can do that.''
Behind the scenes, governors have been trying to avert the worst cuts by twisting the arms of their Congressional delegations and working nervously with their budget directors. Some even held a conference call with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Governors in both parties said they were most worried by talk that both President Obama and Congressional Republicans wanted to cut Medicaid payments to the states by $100 billion over the next decade.
The leaders of the governors association -- its chairwoman, Governor Gregoire of Washington, and its vice chairman, Gov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska, a Republican -- wrote to Mr. Obama and Congressional leaders in both parties last week urging them to reconsider, warning that such a cut would ''result in reduced Medicaid expenditures, in increased state taxes or reductions in K-12 education, transportation and public safety funding.''
But deep partisan divisions remain among the governors. The Democratic Governors Association held a news conference calling for the debt ceiling to be raised, and saying that any accompanying plan to reduce the federal deficit should include tax increases as well as service cuts. And they complained that moderate Republicans were failing to speak up to avert catastrophe.
''We want this deficit solved, and we want it solved in a bipartisan way, but we don't want it solved on the backs of states,'' said Gov. Beverly Perdue of North Carolina, a Democrat. ''Because at the end, it's just another pass down to us, which results in state unemployment, state layoffs.''
Some Republican governors, though -- including Rick Perry of Texas and Nikki Haley of South Carolina, neither of whom are members of the association -- have said that the debt limit should not be lifted without also moving toward a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget. Such an amendment is unlikely to pass in Washington.
Other Republicans -- including Mr. Barbour and Mr. Walker -- said that they hoped that a default could be averted but opposed raising taxes and said that Washington should seize the moment to cut spending significantly.
The normally outspoken Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, declined to take a position on the debt ceiling. ''I'm not doing any press today,'' he said, when asked about it here.
Some states are already weighing contingency plans. Governor Walker said that he had asked his administration this week to study what would happen if the federal government did not raise its borrowing limit, and also what to expect in the way of likely cuts if it did.
Massachusetts could face a ''serious cash flow issue'' if the federal debt limit is not raised and the state stops receiving the $200 million in federal reimbursements it counts on each week for programs like Medicaid and food assistance, Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, wrote Friday in a letter to Congress. He wrote that ''state governments are still reeling from the recession and can ill afford to bear the brunt of such a preventable crisis.''
Most governors here said that while the talk of not raising the debt ceiling was alarming and irresponsible, ultimately not raising the ceiling was unlikely. Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana, who wore his trademark bolo to a news conference held by the Democratic Governors Association, used a Western analogy to explain why he thought a federal default would be averted.
''Aw, hell, they're not going to do it,'' he said. ''Listen: remember 'Blazing Saddles'? Remember the scene where the sheriff holds the pistol to his own head?'' Ultimately, he said, ''They've got to come together and put together a deal.''

HEADLINE: Blundering Toward Recession: Urgency and common sense don't penetrate the House

 BODY:
The increasingly urgent cries to resolve the debt-ceiling stalemate -- from Wall Street, bond rating companies, the Federal Reserve chairman, the White House, the Senate and pretty much everyone else -- seem unable to penetrate the soundproof bunker built by House Republicans. Their leaders announced on Friday that they would waste precious days next week on a hopeless crusade for spending caps and a balanced budget amendment. 
The measure they propose would make a radical cut of $111 billion in 2012, then limit federal spending to 19.9 percent of the gross domestic product by 2017, far less than the current 25 percent and not nearly enough for Americans' needs. It says the debt ceiling could go up only if Congress approved a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, a meaningless proviso since Republicans don't have the necessary two-thirds majority even in the House, let alone the Senate.
At this late stage, this plan is a dangerous delusion suggesting that the House leadership regards the gravity of a default as seriously as it does global warming. Perhaps it didn't notice that Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, said on Thursday that the failure to raise the debt ceiling would most likely have ''detrimental and long-lasting'' effects on economic growth.
President Obama took to the microphone yet again on Friday to plead for his overly generous offer to the Republicans to cut up to $3 trillion in federal spending over the next decade -- including disturbing reductions in entitlement spending -- in exchange for modest increases in tax revenues, which he noted that most Americans supported. It remains astonishing that Republicans spurned an offer that would have drawn cries of protest from many Democrats. (We don't like it either.)
They did so in order to proudly reject the slightest hint of tax increases, but as the president pointed out on Friday, the interest-rate jump produced by a default would end up being a more onerous tax on everyone.
Mr. Obama dismissed the coming House vote as ''a political statement,'' and even Speaker John Boehner suggested that the real action would come after his members waved their balanced budget flags. Senate leaders are working on a plan that would lift the ceiling in exchange for a more modest package of cuts. Though the proposal seems to lack necessary tax revenue increases, it remains the most likely vehicle to end the crisis. But first the crush of reality will have to persuade the House to vote for it.

HEADLINE: Stalemate In Syria Chips Away At Assad

BYLINE: By ANTHONY SHADID; Hwaida Saad and Nada Bakri contributed reporting from Beirut, and an employee of The New York Times from Damascus.

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Even as the now-familiar ritual of Friday protests raged across Syria, activists, diplomats and some government officials suggest that a staggering economy, a better-organized though still divided opposition, and a fumbling government response are recasting Syria, even if President Bashar al-Assad manages to survive in office.
The four-month-old uprising remains locked in a stalemate with a government that still enjoys support. But even government officials believe that there is a transition under way from four decades of authoritarian rule by the Assad family, though to what is unclear.
''We're more or less at a stalemate, but the status quo is not sustainable,'' said Peter Harling, a Damascus-based analyst with the International Crisis Group. 
While the protests appear to have gained momentum, with unprecedented numbers in Hama, in central Syria, and Deir al-Zour, in the northeast, the demonstrations have yet to make decisive inroads into Damascus and Aleppo, the country's two largest cities and the focus of the government's attention.
Security forces on Friday killed 27 people and wounded scores more in clashes at several locations.
The government has rallied its base -- religious minorities and, less successfully, the middle class and business elite -- through what amounts to a negative claim of legitimacy: If we go, the country could fragment, fall into civil war or be seized by Islamists.
But its reform has proven tentative. Officials seem to offer little more than the model of Egypt under President Hosni Mubarak -- a tame but legal opposition, a measure of freedom of the press and expression.
Even that model seems uncertain, as a government with pretenses of modernizing Syria has fallen back on security forces to impose its control in restive regions. It claims that hundreds from the forces have died in fights with Islamist insurgents, backed from abroad.
Activists contend that their protests remain peaceful and that 1,400 people have died needlessly.
''I am pessimistic,'' said Muntaha al-Atrash, a member of Sawasiah, a human rights group in Damascus. ''I feel like it's going to be a long, long journey.''
She added, ''This regime won't easily submit to people's demands.''
But in past weeks, the most potent forces in the uprising have shifted ground again: an evolving public and an indecisive government that failed to make what it celebrated as a national dialogue more than a conversation largely with itself.
''Every week, it becomes more and more apparent that not only can it not return to where it was before, but it's already in the middle of transitioning anyway, and it's going to be a really bumpy road,'' an administration official in Washington said on the condition of anonymity. ''It's going to be ugly, and I think that's what scares people.''
Activists said the turnout Friday was perhaps the biggest yet, though still concentrated in regions that have proven most restive: Homs and Hama in central Syria, Deir al-Zour, and Qaboun and other suburbs of Damascus. The degree of organization in several of the rallies was striking, especially in Qaboun.
There, dozens of protesters protected local government buildings and the Baath Party headquarters from vandalism, to deny security forces a pretext to crack down. A crowd that one witness estimated at 20,000 carried balloons, flags inscribed with mottos and banners. Activists relentlessly documented the scenes.
''We are more organized now,'' said a 40-year-old shopkeeper in Qaboun who gave his name as Abu Khalid. ''We've reached the point of no return.''
When security forces opened fire -- after they were provoked, according to the government -- protesters built barricades to block their way. In marked contrast to the fear that long reigned in Syria, the scenes in Qaboun evoked similar, recent scuffles in Hama with security forces that no longer inspire terror in the people they are meant to control.
''The people will not stop after all these sacrifices,'' said a 30-year-old farmer who gave his name as Abu Mohammed and lives in another Damascus suburb, Kisweh.
In Hama, the center of the revolt, residents said they agreed to dismantle some barricades they built in past weeks as long as security forces let them demonstrate peacefully. In Deir al-Zour, where the momentum of the uprising seems to be shifting, tens of thousands turned out in the biggest protests yet, many of them gathering in a traffic circle formerly known as President Square and now renamed Freedom Square.
''A big and clear message,'' one activist called the rally.
Syrian officials have acknowledged that some protesters have legitimate grievances, but still cast the uprising in terms used for another rebellion in the late 1970s and 1980s: Islamist insurgents carrying out foreign agendas.
While the protests seem overwhelmingly peaceful, signs have emerged of more violence lately, underscoring a familiar theme of conflicts in Algeria and Iraq. In the absence of a genuine political process, opponents resort to arms to press their demands. Residents speak of more people buying weapons, in places like Homs, and the prices of guns rising.
A banner hung two weeks ago in a Damascus neighborhood listed names of government informers and threatened revenge. Human rights activists say they have reports of nearly a dozen informers killed and many more wounded, often gravely.
Diplomats say they believe a gas pipeline that exploded in the east this week was probably an act of sabotage and not, as Syrian officials have portrayed it, an accident.
Opposition figures plan to meet Saturday in Damascus and in Istanbul, and they hope to link the meetings through the Internet. But activists concede that the opposition is deeply divided, over ideology and personalities, threatening to scuttle the meeting in Istanbul.
Though the government allowed a rare opposition meeting last month, some fear it may seek to prevent the gathering in Damascus.
The economy is still reeling, with the Syrian pound losing value, growth slowing and the economy possibly contracting, tourism devastated and capital flowing out. One economist said the government had until the end of the year before facing the collapse that Mr. Assad mentioned in a speech last month. Others say he has far less time.
While Mr. Assad suggested the Constitution would be rewritten -- a groundbreaking step, had it occurred four months ago -- activists, and even those sympathetic to the government, see the much-touted national dialogue as an empty exercise.
''The situation is too far now from dialogue,'' said Nabil Samman, director of the Center of Research and Documentation in Damascus. ''The state can do something now, but if it doesn't and if it doesn't do it in the next week or so, I'm very pessimistic.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Watchdog Is All Ears For Ideas

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER. 
twitter.com/ronlieber

 BODY:
If you want to try your hand at playing regulator, now's your chance.
The new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau officially opens for business on Thursday, but for several months it has been soliciting ideas from the public.
In response, there was the predictable sniping, with some people taking to Twitter to ask if the bureau can protect people from the increasing federal debt caused by the creation of new agencies.
And there were the plaintive requests from people looking for help far beyond the bureau's turf in financial services. Someone wondered about gym memberships, while somebody else asked the bureau to give pornography sites their own domain name suffixes.
But in the earliest Twitter posts, which I read end to end in a 140-character binge this week, there were also some thought-provoking ideas with real potential. 
They may never come to fruition, if the Republicans succeed in stripping power from the bureau and running Elizabeth Warren -- who has been overseeing the bureau but is probably not going to be its official director -- out of town.
For now, however, the bureau is for real, and in an avalanche of Twitter messages, e-mails and blog comments on its Web site, consumers have shown a hunger for a financial cop on the beat.
Meanwhile, its openness thus far suggests the tantalizing possibility that it could be the nation's first open-source regulator. So I picked the four most interesting ideas that people on Twitter suggested and took them to the bureau this week to see just how open it was to provocative suggestions.
SIMPLICITY Perhaps the most reasoned call to action came from Bill Mitchell (Twitter handle: @zipflash), an investment newsletter publisher and soon-to-be hedge fund manager in Irvine, Calif.
''My politics don't really align with Elizabeth Warren's,'' he said. ''But I sensed that she had a legitimate interest in trying to, at a minimum, improve efficiencies.''
So he took his best shot at helping her do that in a couple of Twitter messages. ''Create standardized contract for credit cards for issuers to incorporate by reference, merely adjusting specific rates and fees.''
And then: ''Limit the total number of words in consumer financial contracts. Disclosures are not transparent if their length is unlimited.''
Mr. Mitchell said he worried that credit card agreements had become like the software and Web agreements that so many people mindlessly speed through.
''We are actively working toward simplifying credit card contracts,'' said Gail Hillebrand, associate director of consumer education and engagement for the bureau.
At the moment, the bureau is in the midst of an overhaul of mortgage disclosure forms, something Congress demanded. Congress hasn't ordered the bureau to revise card agreements, though, and it is not clear how much authority the bureau would have to force card issuers' hands if it decided to try.
Still, it's clear that Ms. Warren is a believer in the religion of simplicity. ''We are opposed to complicated forms and fine print,'' she said Thursday in a hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.
HUMORMatt Stoller (@matthewstolller), a former Democratic Congressional staff member, just wants a good laugh. ''Hold a weekly public complaint essay contest called 'Why You Should Fine My Bank,' '' he said in a Twitter post.
In all seriousness, this would have its advantages once the bureau's novelty wears out, since it would keep consumers coming back looking for the most outrageous sins. Mr. Stoller, in an interview this week, added that the bureau should have a bank-as-hero letter of the week, too, as an incentive for good behavior.
''I think humor and interestingness are not used by government nearly enough,'' he said. ''To the extent that you do that, you create a situation where if you get a malevolent politician in there trying to kill these programs, then they have to kill something that the public likes.''
The bureau's Ms. Hillebrand wouldn't go near the self-preservation angle but got a good chuckle out of Mr. Stoller's contest notion. ''We have to learn from the most effective techniques that people inside and outside of government are using to reach the public,'' she said. ''If it's funny, it gets forwarded.''
Then again, she added, financial troubles are no laughing matter. ''It's painful,'' she said. ''We need to be respectful of that while still communicating our message.''
BANKRUPTCY Right around the time the bureau started soliciting ideas earlier this year, Bryan Lucas (@bryanlucas) was clearing away his debts in bankruptcy court. Almost immediately, the loan solicitations came pouring into his Littleton, Colo., mailbox. So he was moved to reach out to the bureau. ''Stop predatory lawyers and car dealers from sending letters offering car loans to people waiting for their bankruptcy to discharge,'' he said via Twitter.
To people who experience this, it's almost as if they've checked out of rehab only to find drug dealers lined up on the nearest corner. ''Give me a cooling-off period to not have that temptation,'' he said in an interview. ''Because not everyone can say 'I don't need that.' ''
This sort of request puts the bureau in a tough spot. On one hand, pushing sky-high interest loans on the bankrupt would meet plenty of people's definition of predatory. But politically, the bureau can't support anything that reduces access to credit, given that many Republicans insist the bureau's very existence is already slowing economic activity.
The bureau declined the opportunity to endorse Mr. Lucas's proposal.
FIDUCIARY As Mr. Lucas's situation suggests, it isn't always easy for every lender to know what's best for any given customer. But Jillayne Schlicke (@jillayne) argues that it's within the realm of the possible for mortgage lenders, so much so that they ought to figure it out and act on it.
''Make all loan originators owe fiduciary duties to their clients,'' she wrote on Twitter, using the financial industry's term for acting solely in a customer's best interest.
This isn't the first time Ms. Schlicke has made this suggestion. She makes a living doing continuing education for real estate salespeople and lenders in the Seattle area and started the National Association of Mortgage Fiduciaries to push for this view.
''It was horrifying to learn that people were using government forms designed to teach borrowers about loans to trick people and deceive them,'' Ms. Schlicke said in an interview this week. So she sent off another Twitter message, addressing how loan officers see the Truth in Lending Act-mandated form: ''Replace the TILA disclosure form. Most LOs can't explain it and consumers can't figure it out by themselves.''
The bureau posted a supportive video response from its policy adviser, Pam Blumenthal, to the second message right away, something Ms. Schlicke had not seen until I pointed it out to her. ''Ha!'' she said, as she watched it play. ''Hey, she agrees with me. That's cool.''
As for the fiduciary issue, however, the bureau did not want to comment. To Ms. Schlicke, the connection between her two suggestions is obvious. ''Put the duty of care on the person sitting across the table. Make them take care of the client,'' she said. ''Instead of the opposite, which is to give them a two-inch stack of paper and say, 'You take care of everything in it.' ''
It is still early in the life of the bureau, a time when employees work late trying to read everything and almost anything seems possible.
''There is a lot of powerful information out in the public that we need to hear and a lot of good ideas in this building'' said Ms. Hillebrand of the bureau. ''And the two of them are going to add up to three.''
But whether this open-source effort adds up to more than the sum of its parts will depend on a couple of things.
First, there is the possibility that all of this openness is just window dressing aimed at generating public support as the bureau and Ms. Warren continue to come under regular attack from politicians. Once it is up and running and utterly overwhelmed, the bureau could easily slip toward behaving like any other faceless regulator.
Consumers could lose interest, too. You'll have your next shot at proving how much you care next Thursday, when the bureau will begin taking complaints about credit card issuers.
Then there are those politicians. Because the bureau has no official director yet, it can't regulate most nonbank institutions. And given the rancor around everything from the budget on down, there is simply no telling when -- or if -- your elected officials may ever be willing to confirm someone for the job.

HEADLINE: Bachmann Off to Fast Start on Funds, but Plays Catch-Up

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Representative Michele Bachmann collected nearly as much money in two weeks as several of her rivals for the Republican presidential nomination raised in more than two months, according to financial reports filed Friday, but President Obama outpaced all candidates by activating a network of high-dollar donors and grass-roots supporters.
With six months until the nominating contest begins, Mitt Romney holds a commanding lead over his fellow Republicans in the amount of money at his disposal. He ended June with $12.7 million in the bank, records show, compared with $3.4 million for Mrs. Bachmann. 
The unsettled nature of the Republican presidential race was illustrated anew on Friday as candidates filed disclosure reports with the Federal Election Commission. Mr. Romney led the way by raising $18.4 million, but the amount was far less than a goal set by his campaign earlier this year, which Republicans said reflected a tough economic climate and uncertainty among the party's top contributors.
''I believe that major donor money is going to be more cautious this year,'' said Al Cardenas, a former chairman of the Florida Republican Party who leads the American Conservative Union.
The reports, which covered a period from April to June, provided the best snapshot yet of the health and viability of the Republican candidates. Newt Gingrich acknowledged that his campaign was $1 million in debt, nearly half of which is owed to a company that charters private planes. Tim Pawlenty raised $4.5 million, but had only $1.4 million in available cash as of June 30. Ron Paul raised $4.5 million and has $4 million in the bank, after transferring $1 million from his Congressional account.
The Obama campaign revealed its army of top fund-raisers for the first time, identifying a group of 244 lawyers, business executives and celebrities, including Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue magazine, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, a Hollywood mogul. The donors included 27 people who collected more than $500,000 each in donations to the president and the Democratic Party.
The top contributors accounted for raising $35 million, out of the record-setting $86 million total, to help finance the re-election of Mr. Obama and other Democratic candidates.
The reports, which federal law requires candidates to file, also offered a glimpse into the lifestyles and the habits of the candidates. Mr. Gingrich, for example, often flew on private planes, while Mr. Pawlenty took commercial flights, without loyalty to a specific airline.
Rick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, reported raising $582,000, and ended June with $229,000 in the bank. Herman Cain, a former business executive, raised $2.5 million, including a personal loan of $500,000. Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former governor of Utah, has said he raised $4.1 million, including a personal investment, but he did not file a report on Friday because he opened his campaign at the end of the month.
The records also provided a window into the potential fund-raising ability of a campaign. Mrs. Bachmann, for example, has largely raised her money through low-dollar donors. She declared her candidacy on June 13 and raised $2.2 million in the final two weeks of last month, along with transferring about $2 million from her Congressional account.
But as Mrs. Bachmann seeks to vault into the first tier of Republican candidates, she faces a major challenge: To build a fund-raising network that can sustain her campaign through the grueling series of contests.
That effort began in earnest last week with Ms. Bachmann's hiring of two established operatives to serve as finance directors: Mary Heitman, who previously ran finance operations at the Republican National Committee and Republican Governors Association, and Jody Thomas, a onetime political director and fund-raiser for former Representative J. C. Watts. In recent days, they have begun to comb Mrs. Bachmann's considerable donor list and begun sounding out supporters who could lead finance organizations in key states.
''Having gotten into the race a little over a month ago, we are pleased with the progress of our fund-raising numbers,'' Mrs. Bachmann said in a statement on Friday. ''I am especially proud of our grassroots fund-raising efforts which indicate we are receiving the bulk of our contributions from the average hard-working American.''
She was one of the most prolific fund-raisers in the House. During her last campaign for Congress, she raised $13 million, much of it from small donors across the country drawn to her uncompromising style, staunchly conservative politics and frequent cable-show clashes.
Such supporters can write checks again and again without exceeding federal donation limits, and Mrs. Bachmann, a Tea Party favorite, is expected to expand that base by tapping the organizational lists of such groups as Americans for Prosperity and its state affiliates. Her average contribution during the opening weeks of her campaign, according to reports, was about $48.
She also spent a significant amount of money on producing her campaign events, her report showed, including more than $43,000 for music, signs and staging on her announcement tour, along with a catering bill of $5,400 for the dinner she provided guests at a homecoming rally in her native Waterloo, Iowa.

ITALY'S PARLIAMENT PASSES BILL
TO ELIMINATE DEFICIT BY 2014
The Italian Parliament gave final approval to a package of austerity measures that aims to eliminate the country's budget deficit by 2014. The passage comes amid worries in the financial markets that Italy would become the next euro zone nation to suffer a sovereign debt crisis like those in Greece, Portugal and Ireland. PAGE A7
SPAIN'S FORECLOSURE PROTESTS 
Young people battling Spain's harsh foreclosure system have moved their protests from city squares to individual homes, securing some promised changes in the process. PAGE A4
MARCHERS BEATEN IN JORDAN
Riot police officers wielding wooden clubs broke up a peaceful demonstration near a square in downtown Amman, beating protesters and journalists. The crackdown on the protest, which was organized by youth groups and attended by members of labor unions and the Muslim Brotherhood, was a sign of rising tension over the slow pace of political reform in the kingdom.

PUTIN PLAYS REFORMER'S ROLE
Speaking at a factory in what appeared to be a calculated pre-election appearance, Prime Minster Vladimir V. Putin reflected on his 11 years in power and said that authority in Russia had become too concentrated. With a presidential election looming in March, Mr. Putin seemed to be sketching a portrait of himself as a leader. PAGE A7

TERM EXTENSION HELD UP FOR DIRECTOR OF F.B.I.
The Obama administration's plans for Congress to smoothly extend the tenure of Robert S. Mueller III as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are derailing, raising an outside chance that he may have to temporarily step down early next month. Some Senate Republicans object on constitutional grounds, while Senator Rand Paul has some other questions. PAGE A13
CLERGY'S GAY MARRIAGE HELP
The passage of same-sex marriage in New York attests to the concerted, sustained efforts by liberal Christian and Jewish clergy to advocate for it in the language of faith which provided a kind of political and theological cover to the moderate and conservative state senators who cast the vital swing votes.

N.S.A. LEAK SUSPECT FREE
A former spy agency official accused of leaking classified information about alleged N.S.A. mismanagement to The Baltimore Sun walked out of court a free man after Judge Richard D. Bennett of Federal District Court excoriated the government for its handling of the case. PAGE A13
U.S. VISA LOTTERY REPEATED
The State Department published the results of a new lottery to give residents' visas to 55,000 foreigners around the world, running the drawing for the second time. A computer error forced officials to cancel the first one. The State Department had to tell 22,000 foreigners they were not necessarily eligible for permanent residency after all. PAGE A13

AT BIRTHPLACE OF SCRABBLE,
A PROBLEM IS RESOLVED
That the crisscrossing word game Scrabble was invented in Jackson Heights, Queens, made local residents proud, and for a long time a street sign commemorated the site. The sign vanished in 2008, but after much urging by the community and the clearing of some bureaucratic hurdles, it is being replaced.

COMPANIES ACT TO PROTECT
CONSUMERS FROM E. COLI
The federal government has spent years considering whether to take steps to help keep dangerous strains of E. coli bacteria out of the food supply. Now, two major American companies, Costco Wholesale and Beef Products Inc., have gotten tired of waiting for regulators to act. They are proceeding with their own plans to protect customers. PAGE B1
MORE THAN SIGNED BATS
After the Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter got his 3,000th hit, the memorabilia machine went into action, churning out bats, balls, jerseys and more. But not all signed batting helmets are created equal. The market for high-end sports memorabilia is different. Scarcity is crucial, and the worst investments come from athletes who played from the 1970s to the present. Paul Sullivan, Wealth Matters.

HEADLINE: Growing Up, Then Going Home

BYLINE: THE EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: Unemployment rates are high, and starting salaries are low. Not surprisingly, many young people are moving back in with their parents after college. Some recent graduates offer their dispatches from the home front. 

 BODY:
Since 2009, unemployment among recent college graduates has risen, while starting salaries have fallen. The median student debt load for those who graduated from 2006 to 2010 is $20,000. Not surprisingly, 40 percent of 20-somethings move back in with their parents at least once. Here are some dispatches from the home front.

My Tragic Starring Role 
Park Slope, Brooklyn
The first thing I see when I wake up in the morning is my name in lights. Specifically, I see a giant sign that hangs over my bed. Smothered in glitter and festooned with stars and Christmas lights, it spells out my name in cardboard letters. It was commissioned for my bar mitzvah, and was later used to decorate my childhood bedroom - the bedroom in which I now sleep. 
I would have moved it, but I was planning on staying here only temporarily. Then "temporarily" became "indefinitely," "indefinitely" became "for the foreseeable future," and finally, I began marking the time spent in my parents' home retrospectively: three months, six months, a year. If I move that sign now, it means I'm committing to permanent residence, an idea that is far too depressing to seriously contemplate.
In any case, there's nowhere to put it. My Little League trophies are still on my bookshelves. My drawers are filled with clothes I long ago outgrew, while the clothes I wear today are piled in stacks on the floor. The posters and paintings that decorated my college apartment - items that express the person I am at 23 instead of the child I was at 7 - remain in boxes hidden in the corners of my room. 
I don't spend a lot of time pitying myself. Moving back home was the rational choice to make, under the circumstances. I had little work experience and few marketable skills when I graduated, and I knew I would have to take a series of unpaid internships before I could find the publishing job I've always wanted. 
But the fact that a choice is responsible doesn't make it pleasant. My parents provide me with home-cooked meals and don't charge me rent. But I'd kill to put five miles between myself and their unsolicited job and dating advice.
Worst of all is their inability to understand why I'm unhappy to be living at home. As far as they're concerned, it's paradise: I've got everything I need. I get a lot of that from people their age. Everyone keeps saying things like: "You'll be fine, it'll all work out" and "You just need to pound the pavement." 
I don't think they know or remember what it's like to send off resume after resume, to finally get a job and still not make it out of your parents' house. I don't think they've tried to imagine waking up every morning in stars and spaceship sheets (the only set that fits my child-size bed). The feeling of failure. The feeling that the natural order of life - that you become an adult and then you leave home - has been disrupted.
At least my peers understand. A lot of them are in the same situation, and the rest face bigger challenges: bouncing from sublet to sublet, working seven-day weeks just to pay the rent. 
We were encouraged to dream of having our names in lights. Admittedly, that dream was a little grandiose. But, at least for now, in an economy that offers precious little opportunity, those aspirations seem like just another childhood relic - good for hanging on the wall, and not much more.

Elevated by the Train
Brownsville, Brooklyn
Despite having roots grounded deep in Brooklyn and even deeper in the Dominican Republic, I have always felt disconnected from my home. 
As a child, I was constantly being shuttled to some better place. My parents sent me to Catholic school in Bushwick, then high school in Manhattan, to keep me away from the local kids and their precocious knowledge of malas palabras - bad words. We went to distant neighborhoods to buy vegetables because the ones they sold in our bodegas were hardly edible. The adults commuted across the city for work. The message was clear: the good stuff was outside of our neck of the concrete jungle. The direction to go was outward, away from Brownsville. 
In high school, each day began at 7:48 a.m. on the dark, empty, urine-stained, elevated platform for the No. 3 train. The only high rises on the horizon were public housing towers, all red brick and small windows. It took only 30 minutes to pull into the mosaic-tiled, less urine-stained station in lower Manhattan, below the banks and skyscrapers, with all the commuters in nice suits and majestically colorful socks. 
In the evenings the trip was reversed. I rode the train past scrap metal yards, lonely lots and railroad tracks - the return seeming almost clandestine. 
Those rides back into Brownsville weren't supposed to last into my 20s. I went to college, and I wasn't really supposed to come back. But here I am. 
It was fine at first; most of my friends had moved home too. But, like each stop on a light-up subway map, they disappeared one by one, moving away from their ethnic enclaves to join the rank and file of people who had made it. I stayed behind, philosophizing about what to do with a philosophy degree. While unemployed. And still in Brownsville. 
I don't mean to suggest that my degree hasn't served me well. It didn't get me a job, but it changed the way I saw the world. From Plato's rhetorical "myth of the metals," in which gold-souled men become rulers and bronze-souled men laborers, to W.E.B. DuBois's color line, philosophy inspired me to question my assumptions. Where I once saw only poverty, I learned to see systemic inequality and the possibility of change.
Now, instead of always looking out toward somewhere else, I'm beginning to look around here, wondering how I can make this neighborhood the better place my parents always sought for me. I'm still hoping, planning, to move out. But I know now I'll stay close to the elevated train, somehow.

Deja Vu in My Parents' Kitchen
TriBeCa, Manhattan
Exactly a week after I graduated from college, I found myself sitting at my parents' kitchen table practicing SAT math problems, in the same seat where I studied for the SATs the first time, five years ago. 
I'm not trying a second run at school - though now that I mention it, it doesn't seem like a bad idea. I've spent the last few weeks sleeping in what usually serves as a storage room in my parents' home, before I leave for a job as an SAT tutor in Central America. Although I am living here, the term "my parents' house" is one I carefully use, a verbal distinction that keeps me distanced. It's mine no longer. 
My mom turned my bedroom into a painting studio at the start of my sophomore year. I didn't fight to keep it; I actually pushed for the change. Maybe I thought it would keep me from moving home, which I saw as a sign of total failure. Obviously it didn't quite work.
My parents are former hippies who never bothered to enumerate house rules. I've always tried to stay out of trouble so they never have to. If I stay out late, I close the front door quietly on my return. I'll drink the white wine my parents leave in the refrigerator, but never finish the bottle. I'll never ask for money, but eagerly take any that's offered. (Not that that's actually happened yet, but I'm still hopeful.)
They haven't told me anything I'm not allowed to do, and I am looking to keep it that way. 
There's much to enjoy about living at home. Here I have a refrigerator with food in it and a physical copy of the newspaper to read at breakfast. I get to spend unplanned time with my family and there's none of the pressure of a short visit. My parents seem to like it as well: for my mom, my stay is an extended visit from technical support. Whenever I came home for breaks, she would lament that I never stayed long enough to figure out what was wrong with the remote controls. 
While I'm not living with my parents indefinitely I no longer see moving home as a failure. I spent a semester studying in Mexico during my sophomore year, and it surprised me how confounded people were when I said I went to school in New Hampshire even though my family lived in New York. "Why would you ever go to school so far from home?" my friends would ask. "Aren't there colleges in New York City?" These kids were absolutely modern, but still they assumed that they would live with their parents until marriage. 
When family or finances make living at home after college the most appropriate choice, there is no need to mythologize moving out. In other words, I learned during college how to move home (even if I didn't learn any more SAT algebra). 
But I'll still be happy to give up my seat at my parents' kitchen table.

Spoiled, and Sick of It
Park Slope, Brooklyn
My day inevitably begins with a serious moral quandary involving Corn Flakes. 
I eat Corn Flakes for breakfast each morning. When I am finished, I rinse off my spoon and bowl, place them in the sink and attempt to leave the kitchen. But each day, without fail, I freeze at the room's threshold, paralyzed by guilt. What kind of jerk leaves a dirty dish in his mother's sink?
At school, I always cleaned up after myself, but now that I'm home from college, I frequently find myself leaving a mess and then agonizing about it. Suddenly, I'm a kid again. I don't shop for myself, I don't make my bed, I don't do the laundry. 
The fridge is always stocked with cold cuts, lox and orange juice, available free of charge. But the food comes at a cost. My mother nags me - my flip flops will ravage the arches of my feet and I'll regret that I ignored her pleas to buy sandals, but only if the radiation from my cellphone doesn't kill me first - and I respond, in perfectly passive-aggressive fashion, by forgoing all responsibility. The more she does for me, the less I am willing - or able - to do for myself. 
I'm being spoiled rotten. 
This isn't the first time I've been spoiled at home: I spent a semester here last spring, while undergoing treatment for testicular cancer. Those were miserable, enervating months - all of which I spent stuck inside my mother's house. It was a warm and well-appointed place to be trapped. But I was still trapped.
Now I'm home again - still a few credits short of graduating - in a house that is a constant reminder of being sick. I sit on the same couch, watch the same TV, sleep in the same bed. This is the house with toilets I spent hours kneeling in front of and stairs I sometimes could barely climb.
The most unpleasant memory is of utter helplessness, of having my every need attended to because I was incapable of doing anything for myself. At 22, being taken care of is a crippling thing. You've spent four years at college learning how to live on your own, and suddenly that disappears. 
Now, when I'm lounging around aimlessly on a Saturday afternoon, I feel a twinge of that same helplessness.A lot of my friends are also back home now and I see them struggling to figure out what they're doing with their lives. They have jobs or internships and aspirations, but they're troubled by their loss of independence. 
That is a substantial loss, one that turns something as simple as washing a dish into an existential event and makes motherly advice feel like character assassination.
It brings all the latent neuroses and insecurities to the surface. In the words of Groucho Marx, "Home is where you hang your head." 
I like to imagine that living at home is the only thing that stands in the way of my complete maturation. In the fall, I tell myself, I will start work and find an apartment and then I'll be a genuine adult. I'll wake up early, cook and pay all my own bills. 
But I know that growing up involves more than moving out. In a few months, will I really be more mature than I am today? Do I have what it takes to live out in the world?
I'm sure I want to move out. I'm unsure about pretty much everything else.

Life in the Pleasure Palace
Upper West Side, Manhattan
I've always had a plan for life after college: driving away, the campus fading from sight, I would put on Abbey Road and skip to "You Never Give Me Your Money." There's a line in that Beatles song that would perfectly sync up with the moment: "Out of college, money spent, see no future, pay no rent, all the money's gone, nowhere to go." 
When I finally got the chance to live out this fantasy a few months ago, it wasn't what like I imagined. I didn't know how to drive; I never had any money to begin with; and I did have somewhere to go: Manhattan. John Lennon and Paul McCartney were right about one thing though - I'm not paying any rent. 
When I first realized I'd be moving back in with my parents, I did what anyone would do: I booked a ticket to Southeast Asia. But after a few wonderful weeks of eating an astonishing range of noodles and praying to local deities for a studio apartment in the Village, I knew it was time to face my fears. 
I've been living here for a while now, and you know what? It's not bad. This apartment has it all. Zabar's chocolate croissants for breakfast and a seemingly unlimited supply of Pellegrino. The laundry is fresh, the bathtubs are pristine and there's even a treadmill and a TV with HBO. My parents must have worked thousands of unpaid internships to pay for all this! How can I complain? It's not like the dismal job market has forced me to move back to Wasilla, Alaska. 
But I can't stay in this pleasure palace forever. I want to be a writer - to grow a beard someday and move to Queens, to sleep on the floor and let the cockroaches crawl into my ears and lay eggs in my brain. 
In order to realize this dream, I keep a rigid schedule. From 10 a.m. to noon I work on my sitcom pilot. At noon I realize it's not that funny. Then I begin scouring the Internet for actual jobs. Honestly I'm enjoying this whole job search thing, except for the part where no one ever responds. There are eight million people in this city; someone must have something for me to do, right? By 4 p.m. I'm not so sure. 
I move on to devising get-rich-quick schemes. What if I offer to clean the spacious apartments that my friends in finance have moved into? And then I'll rob them while they're at work! That could be lucrative! 
At 6 p.m. I watch "Game of Thrones." At 7 it's time to welcome home my benefactors. By 8 I'm jetting downtown on the 2 or 3 train to meet my friends and explore the hip neighborhoods they've moved to. The employed ones always pick up the tabs (especially if you run to the bathroom when the check comes). 
Of course, my life isn't all croissants and Pellegrino. Sometimes I'm concerned my parents are trying to push me out the door. A few days ago my mom e-mailed me a series of articles about the "boomerang generation": young adults who move home and never become financially independent. Was that some kind of hint? Then during dinner, she said, "I would never have dreamed of going home after college. It's amazing that this is a palatable option for you." I apologized profusely for not hating her and Dad more. 
Despite its many pleasures, I can't help but think that home is like a parachute - it doesn't stop the fall; it just stops it from killing you. When I start feeling down, I play "You Never Give Me Your Money." There's a line there I never paid attention to before, but which I now understand is the point of the whole song: "But oh that magic feeling, nowhere to go." That feeling can be kind of nauseating, especially if it lasts longer than a year. For now though, it feels O.K.

HEADLINE: Use a Bigger Fork and You'll Eat Less

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A study published in The Journal of Consumer Research finds that the size of your utensils affects how much you consume. 

 BODY:
By now you've probably heard -- from nutritionists, diet books and TV personalities -- that bigger plates encourage people to eat more food. A new study, published in The Journal of Consumer Research, finds that the size of your utensils has the opposite effect: using a bigger fork leads people to eat less.
The study, by researchers at the University of Utah, was conducted at a "popular, locally owned Italian restaurant in the southwestern United States that has been in business for 40 years and offered a typical menu."
Two sets of forks were distributed for each of four meals, two lunches and two dinners. The larger fork held 20 percent more food and the smaller fork 20 percent less food than the regular restaurant fork.
Dishes were weighed before and after they were served to customers, so that the researchers could determine how much people ate. They found that people who used the larger fork left significantly more food on their plates (7.91 ounces versus 4.43 ounces).
The authors theorize that this difference may be due to a "goal-oriented" way in which people approach mealtime:In sum, we find that when people have a well-defined hunger goal to satisfy and put forth effort to reach the goal, they consume more from a small fork rather than from a large fork. The bite size becomes the medium that helps them satisfy their goal and also influences the quantity consumed. The small fork gives a feeling that they are not making much progress in satiating their hunger, which results in more consumption compared to when they have a large fork.I now await the creation of a new multibillion-dollar "Big Fork Diet" franchise.

CORRECTION APPENDED
Miranda July stood in her living room in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, apologizing for the sunflowers. It really was a copious amount of sunflowers.
They sprouted from Mason jars and vases, punctuating the austere, Shaker-like furniture in the sunny home that July, who is 37, shares with her husband, the filmmaker Mike Mills, who's 45. Noticing me noticing the sunflowers, she interjected: ''We just had a party. We don't usually have sunflowers everywhere.''
In person, July was very still, with ringlets of curly hair falling over her wide blue eyes like a protective visor, and she seemed perceptively aware of the ''precious'' label that is often attached both to her and to her work. At a different point in our time together, I followed her into a hotel room in San Francisco, where Mills had left her a knitted octopus wearing a scarf and hat on the couch. She laughed when she saw it but also appeared a bit mortified: ''Oh, God,'' she said. ''It's kind of a joke. . . . It's not. . . . Really, this isn't us at all.'' 
At their house, Mills emerged from his office; in contrast to July's measured composure, Mills seemed in constant motion, often running his hands through his Beethoven hair. Both he and July have directed new films being released this summer. His film, ''Beginners,'' is loosely based on the true story of his father's coming out at age 75. July's film, ''The Future,'' is her second feature as a director, and it's a funny, sad portrait of a couple at a crossroads. Sophie, played by July, works at a children's dance school, and Jason, played by Hamish Linklater, provides tech-support by telephone from their sofa. The couple is weeks away from adopting Paw-Paw, an injured cat and a symbol of impending adulthood who is also the film's narrator. A talking cat is exactly the kind of detail that might endear people who are endeared by Miranda July and infuriate people who are infuriated by her. There are plenty of both.
''You've met us at a weird time,'' Mills said. ''We're usually just two workaholics in our separate corners.'' July and Mills first crossed paths in 2005, when July's debut feature, ''Me and You and Everyone We Know,'' made its premiere at Sundance at the same time as Mills's film ''Thumbsucker.'' They met at a party -- ''She wore a yellow dress,'' he recalls -- and he watched her do a Q. and A. the next day. ''She was so strong and declarative. I fell in love instantly.'' They married in the summer of 2009 at Mills's house in the Nevada hills.
In one sense, July has been enjoying the Platonic ideal of creative success in the age of the hyphenate artist. She publishes short stories in The New Yorker. The seven-year Web project, ''Learning to Love You More,'' which she produced with Harrell Fletcher -- in which more than 8,000 people submitted material in response to online assignments like ''Make a protest sign and protest'' and ''Take a picture of your parents kissing'' -- was recently acquired by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. ''Me and You and Everyone We Know'' won the Camera d'Or at Cannes and was named by Roger Ebert as one of the best films of the 2000s. She inspires a devotion among her fans that is positively swoony: ''I love Miranda July, and everything she does is so subtle and sweet and bizarre and necessary,'' is a fairly typical sentiment. July is preoccupied with intimacy -- she habitually uses the words ''you'' and ''we'' in her titles -- and this demands, and inspires, an intense engagement from her followers. After a screening of ''The Future'' at the San Francisco Film Festival, a small crowd surrounded July, pinning her against the back wall of the movie theater, wanting to tell her, with palpable urgency, how much her work mattered to them. Her office has an entire room filled top to bottom with boxes of letters and objects from fans around the world. One man printed every e-mail he ever wrote and sent them all to July, because only she would understand.
Yet despite this (or perhaps because of it) she has also become the unwilling exemplar of an aggravating boho archetype: the dreamy, young hipster whose days are filled with coffee, curios and disposable enchantments. ''Yes, in some ways Miranda July is living my dream and life, and yes, maybe I'm a little jealous,'' wrote one Brooklyn-based artist on her blog. ''I loathe her. It feels personal.'' To her detractors (''haters'' doesn't seem like too strong a word) July has come to personify everything infuriating about the Etsy-shopping, Wes Anderson-quoting, McSweeney's-reading, coastal-living category of upscale urban bohemia that flourished in the aughts. Her very existence is enough to inspire, for example, an I Hate Miranda July blog, which purports to detest her ''insufferable precious nonsense.'' Or there is the online commenter who roots for July to be exiled to Darfur. Or the blogger who yearns to beat her with a shoe.
I understand this, at least in theory. The urban bohemian irks precisely because his or her quirky individuality is just part of a different kind of uniformity, where the uniform happens to be a bushy beard or Zooey Deschanel bangs rather than country-club khakis. Twee fascinations with childhood innocence can mask an unwillingness to tackle life's darker quandaries. Who wouldn't be annoyed by a guy who, say, finds a cracked milk bottle, makes a film about it, then silk screens it on a T-shirt and names his band Milk Bottle? The stakes are low. The results are soon forgotten.
But is Miranda July the archenemy of seriousness? She has an affinity for surface detail, like the childlike scrawl on her sculptures that appeared in the Venice Biennale or the matching haircuts of her two main characters in ''The Future.'' But unlike certain directors who fixate on marginalia, creating art in which the engraving on a character's belt buckle takes precedence over the story, July's seemingly superficial gestures service something greater: a pulsing emotional center. It's odd that she has come to represent, for some, a kind of soulless hipster cool, because in July's work, nobody is cool. There's no irony to it, no insider wink. Her characters are ordinary people whose lives don't normally invite investigation. So her project is the opposite of hipster exclusion: her work is desperate to bring people together, forcing them into a kind of fellow feeling. She's unrelentingly sincere, and maybe that sincerity makes her difficult to bear. It also might make her culturally essential.
On a spring California weekend, I drove while July rode shotgun, navigating on her iPhone and guiding me through the Berkeley of her youth. The city was in full splendor, with cedar-sided cottagy houses shaded by magnolia trees in bloom. We pulled over in front of the Arts and Crafts home where July lived between the ages 7 and 14. A big purple sun was painted above the picture window, as if the house were a magic bus.
''It didn't look like that when we lived in it,'' she said quickly.
The house is just off Telegraph Avenue, Berkeley's central thoroughfare, where the homeless co-exist, sometimes uneasily, with students and yuppies. The house's living room once served as headquarters for the family business, a New Age publishing company called North Atlantic Books. (The company is still a going concern -- its current list includes books on crystals and raw foods, as well as more fringy philosophical meanderings like ''Manifesto for the Noosphere: The Next Stage in the Evolution of Human Consciousness.'') As children, July and her older brother, Robin Grossinger, packed Jiffy bags with books for shipment and occasionally tiptoed past a writer finishing a draft on a typewriter in the living room. The Grossingers were a D.I.Y. family; July cut her father's and her brother's hair, guided by an article she remembers clipping from Seventeen magazine called ''A Trim for Him.'' When July began to have recurring eye trouble, her mother sewed her an eye patch out of a floral print -- from the same material as the curtains, as a friend pointed out to her, to July's dismay. ''When I was very little, I probably wanted to be more normal,'' she told me. ''I probably wanted the Laura Ashley bedroom, and instead I got thrift-store everything.''
We moved on, driving past a cinder-block apartment building. ''That's where I lost my virginity,'' she said casually. ''I was 16. He was a 27-year-old grad student at Berkeley.'' This revelation seemed in line with how July uses sex in her films: as both a sudden surprise and a way to illuminate the inner lives of her characters. ''I was always interested in sex, even as a kid. Sex includes shame and humiliation and fantasies and longing. It's so dense with the kinds of things I'm interested in.''
After dropping out of college, July left California in her early 20s and took off to Portland, Ore. Her photo albums from that time are Riot Grrrl artifacts, with Kill Rock Stars fliers for her old band, photos of a ''queercore'' event and snapshots with postpunk heroines like Kathleen Hanna and the band Sleater Kinney. Describing a false ID she used at the time, July wrote in The New Yorker, ''The student it had belonged to looked sort of like me, in the sense that she, too, was probably giving lesbianism a whirl and had cut off all her hair.'' In the art scene, July was a prolific polymath making lauded performance and video pieces, but when ''Me and You and Everyone We Know'' came out, she was handed an immediate international identity as a filmmaker. With her film debut, she emerged as a less angry, more spiritual Todd Solondz or a more tender, more libidinous Noah Baumbach. At the same time, she, and her film, seemed unlike anything that was percolating elsewhere, leading Roger Ebert to praise the movie's ''fragile magic'' and to say, ''July's film fits no genre, fulfills no expectations, creates its own rules and seeks only to share a strange, lovable mind with us.''
In ''Me and You and Everyone We Know,'' July plays a lovestruck video artist pursuing a damaged single dad. (The film is gently comic; July's unblinking stare and reedy, slightly strangled voice can come off as high comedy on screen.) One of the man's sons, a 7-year-old, ends up in an accidental relationship with a haughty art dealer after proposing in a chat room that they ''poop back and forth, forever.'' All of her characters crave connection -- and rarely get it. Still, the film is buoyant, popping with a hopeful California brightness: the Japanese version's title translates as ''A Rainbow-Colored World for You and Me.''
''One of the bravest things in that film was trying to have a frank exploration of children's sexuality, which is really taboo,'' says Julia Bryan-Wilson, an associate professor of art history at the University of California, Berkeley, and an old friend of July's. She views July's work as playing with the idea of the uncanny, which Freud defined as deriving ''its terror not from something externally alien or unknown but -- on the contrary -- from something strangely familiar which defeats our efforts to separate ourselves from it.''
When we first met, I asked July which filmmakers inspired her, and she drew a blank, answering apologetically: ''I'm not a cinephile. My films don't reference films. I'm more interested in rhythm and feeling.'' Later, in L.A., she followed up with a story. Her house is filled with Mills's DVDs -- lots of Criterion Collection -- but one night, at home alone, July wasn't in the mood for avant-garde. She picked up a copy of ''Bowfinger,'' the 1999 comedy starring Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy. She was about to watch it when, she says: ''I thought: Come on, Miranda, really? Let's try something between 'Bowfinger' and the Czech New Wave.''
That compromise proved to be ''Magnolia,'' by Paul Thomas Anderson, one of her favorite directors. She listed similarly inspiring peers: ''Todd Solondz's 'Happiness,' David Gordon Green. Jane Campion, Andrea Arnold, Spike [Jonze]. I sometimes get painted as so 'in my own world,' but I probably wouldn't even want to make films if there weren't this world of people who I'm waiting for the next film from.'' As a young artist, she was interested in connecting with other women, so she started an influential project that became ''Joanie 4 Jackie,'' a video chain letter for female filmmakers to share their work. ''It sounds really altruistic,'' she says, ''but I was also lonely. 'Joanie 4 Jackie' saved me, because I felt like I was part of something. That was my film school.''
Even though July is often lumped in with directors like Wes Anderson, Jonze or Baumbach, the face of independent film -- really, the face of film -- remains distinctly male. Her work is highly personal, delving into the emotional, inner life -- in other words, it's girl stuff. Criticism of July often carries a whiff of sexism. ''Precious,'' ''light,'' and ''twee'' all describe conventionally feminine qualities, and all have been tossed July's way as insults.
Of male directors, she said: ''They become kind of brands. It's much harder to do that if you're a woman. That's crucial for longevity.'' The fact that she appears in her films helps give her work a recognizable face -- the Miranda July brand.
She admires directors like Baumbach and Wes Anderson, but she said: ''All those men are also personal. I don't mind that, but I do mind that it's not really questioned, whereas I or another woman is looked at as so self-obsessed. Men are just not being judged in the same way. They're never going to be annoying in the same way.''
July turned out to be an excellent road-trip companion; she laughed often, gave great directions and constantly worried if I had enough to eat. She generously offered to share her peanut-butter cookie, then navigated us to her parents' current house, which sits high in the hills of Berkeley.
If you were to try to recreate the hothouse of familial circumstances that might grow a Miranda July, it would look like this: Richard Grossinger and Lindy Hough, both in their 60s with 45 years of marriage behind them, drinking herbal tea in a living room lined with books and Oaxacan wooden animals in bright colors staring out from every surface.
Hough, cross-legged on a throw cushion on the floor, offered me her recently published book of poetry (blurbed by Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore). July's brother, Robin, a 42-year-old environmental scientist, sat on the couch. In one corner of the living room stood a tall wooden cabinet he built when he was 16. It housed behind its glass doors many rows of creatures he made from fruit pits and pine cones. ''Look what's in here!'' July said as she showed me the secret compartments in the cabinet's drawers -- one hidden drawer held a key that led to another interior chamber. In the cabinet's heart lay a Nike shoebox filled with envelopes marked in children's writing: '' 'Muppet Movie' stuff.'' ''Mimi's drawings.'' Her brother had kept a file of July's crayon pictures of stick people with their hands over their heads. ''Robin could make things out of nothing,'' July said. ''That feeling of 'we can come up with something!' -- you've got to believe that was really formative. You felt like you could do anything.''
Richard Grossinger is a writer, too, with several books, including a self-published memoir charting his absurdly dramatic childhood. July's father grew up near Central Park in New York City, under the name Richard Towers. When he was 9, a psychiatrist told him that his real father was actually a Grossinger, which explained his summer visits to the luxurious Grossinger's resort in the Catskills. So he took the name Grossinger -- then learned, years later, that in fact he was the product of an affair between his mother and an entirely different man.
All of this made it easy for July, at 16, to adopt a new name based on a story in a zine, by her high-school friend Johanna Fateman (who was later a co-founder of the band Le Tigre), about two buddies named Ida and July. She changed her name legally in her early 20s. ''It was part of being self-authoring. And it was vanity. I wanted a name that I liked. July looked good on everything and seemed edible. But it's a 15-year-old's idea of a great name.''
I asked Grossinger if he minded his daughter's changing her name. ''My kids are their own people. Their stories are their own.'' Nonetheless, he handed over a sheaf of papers, stories of July, starting with her birth.
''They'll be filled with inaccuracies,'' July said of the papers later. Really? Like what? ''Stigmata,'' she said. When July was a kid, she cut her foot and somehow, in family lore, this became stigmata. ''I'm sure I played into it, but basically my dad thinks I'm magic.''
The family seemed open to magic. Her dad was born Jewish -- there was ''the occasional Hanukkah candle,'' she says -- and her mom was raised Protestant, but the family trade was New Age. ''There was no one specific belief but a kind of looser spiritual believing in just about everything,'' July says. ''I think there's something spiritual in a very day-to-day, mundane existence. It's impossible to articulate, and it's happening now, almost like a perverse secret. . . . That's always sort of fascinating to me.''
These fascinations first emerged in a play she wrote in high school, inspired by her correspondence with a prisoner who was jailed for murdering a man who had repeatedly robbed his gas station. (She found him through an ad for a prisoner-correspondence program in the back of a magazine.) ''I was very existential. It was the first time I had a feeling like: I can't bear this. I have to do something to understand these feelings,'' she says. ''That we could be friends at all and know each other and be living such different lives and that he might die in there -- it shook me.''
The play was called ''The Lifers.'' She held auditions and cast a 20-something Latina woman to play the role of the teenaged Miranda July. ''I had to call the actors to say, 'The good news is you got the part, but the bad news is I'm 16 and we'll be rehearsing in my parents' attic.' ''
She wasn't interested in performing the play at her preppy private high school, so she approached 924 Gilman, a local punk club. ''I remember thinking: I have to do this [play]. If I don't, I might as well not exist.'' But the process was grueling. The night before the opening, July remembers wandering out of her house in a kind of daze. ''I was so overwhelmed, feeling like I could barely pull it off. I remember going outside and getting under a car parked in front of our house, some random car, just lying under that car, which seemed like the lowest thing you could do,'' she says. Then she walked around Berkeley, into the backyard of a friend, took off her clothes and climbed into a lukewarm hot tub.
''I'm pretty much exactly the same now,'' she says. ''I'm planning on working on that, by the way.''
Despite the success of ''Me and You,'' July found herself broke after the film's release. But given that her life seems disproportionately abundant with strange, otherworldly moments, it makes perfect sense that one day she opened her mail and found an unexpected check for $25,000. Years before, in Portland, she was hired as a tastemaker by an ad agency; Coca-Cola later realized that a name chosen for a new Coke product had also been suggested by her, so the company sent her a check. (''Coke II -- genius, huh?'' she says.) That $25,000 bought her time to turn her attention to writing, shaping the short stories she had been tending for years.
July sent some early pages to Rick Moody, who had met her after seeing her perform a piece called ''The Swan Tool'' at the Kitchen in New York. ''She knew how to spell, but other than that I'm not sure she had a single conventional writer trick in her arsenal,'' Moody told me in an e-mail. ''The weirder she was, the better I liked it.'' July had left the University of California, Santa Cruz, after her sophomore year, and though she reads voraciously -- she will often dip into Lydia Davis or Steven Millhauser before sitting down to write -- she has no formal artistic training. She admits she had to learn the difference between first and second person, and she's still not confident on how to use quotation marks around dialogue, which is why there aren't any quotation marks in her first book.
''No One Belongs Here More Than You'' won the Cork City-Frank O'Connor short story award, along with a 35,000 euro prize, and also became a best seller. July then set about adapting ''Things We Don't Understand and Definitely Are Not Going to Talk About,'' an interactive performance piece about relationships in crisis that would become the basis of ''The Future.'' In 2008, she went knocking on doors for financing in the midst of a recession, when many studios were shuttering their independent divisions. ''The Future'' ended up largely backed by Film4 and a German company called Razor Film. A condition of the financing stipulated that many of the smaller parts be filled with German or European actors, which adds to the film's off-kilter mood: it's set in L.A., but only sort of.
''I had a lot of anxiety,'' she says of the 21-day shoot. ''I was like, I can't do this. I can only make one movie. But in truth, it was pretty great. It doesn't mean it was fun, because I drove myself crazy the whole time, worrying that it wouldn't come together.''
July set out to write a tighter, more controlled story than her first film, with fewer characters. She was also in her 30s, and she was feeling older and less rainbow colored.
''It's kind of about letting go of that feeling of my 20s, that feeling that I will do absolutely everything, I will have sex with everyone, I will go to every country,'' she says. ''In your 30s, it's obvious that a finite amount of things will happen.'' In ''The Future,'' the characters sum it up. Sophie: ''We'll be 40 in five years.'' Jason: ''Forty is basically 50. And then after 50, the rest is just loose change.''
The midlife crisis is usually a male response to mortality terror, but in ''The Future,'' it's July's character, Sophie, who takes up with a single dad, leaving her bohemian surroundings for an affair in a nice house in the suburbs. For July, the story of a woman fleeing her life was a personal purging.
''I think I was afraid; I was committing to someone forever,'' she says. ''That [idea] that you might just defect from your life, I've been carrying around for so long. You don't want that to be a constant threat. So I think I was like: O.K., what would happen? So you leave. Then what happens? Then I realized: You're probably haunted by yourself. Your soul follows you.''
In the film, the soul takes the shape of a yellow T-shirt, which literally creeps out to the suburbs and back to Sophie. Then Sophie climbs inside the shirt for a kind of dance of suffocation and rebirth.
O.K., no doubt July dissenters are now experiencing ear smoke. They probably also won't like the fact that July does, in real life, have a ratty T-shirt that she takes with her everywhere for comfort, carefully placing it in her suitcase in hotels so the maids don't think it's garbage.
And they definitely won't like this: Paw-Paw, the narrating cat, came into existence when July saw a cat hit by a car and, while bagging the dead body, announced to her producing partner, Gina Kwon, ''We must redeem this cat.''
But here's the part they will like the least: ''The Future'' is really good, a film that's not only tighter than the free-ranging ''Me and You'' but also more mature and tonally darker. (It's literally darker, too: July shot it in a pastel-free palette of beiges and browns.) It may not convert all her critics, and it might shock some of her fans. But ''The Future'' should definitively dispel the lingering notion that her art is some gossamer, transient confection. The film is devoted to the only truths worth engaging, about love, sex and death, all questions unasked in the neutered, cutesy world of, say, ''Napoleon Dynamite'' and the like. ''I do believe my work should be of service,'' she told me. ''The Future'' is not just a rebuke to the idea that her work is somehow shallow; it actively attacks the idea of shallowness. July wants you to feel a part of something larger than yourself and, in ''The Future,'' you do.
And Paw-Paw, that cat with the bandaged paw, who narrates the movie?
I swear that talking cat will make you cry.
''The Future'' features a small role played by an elderly man, Joe Putterlik, whom July met through the PennySaver. (She was interviewing and photographing people who advertise in the PennySaver, for a book titled ''It Chooses You.'') Putterlik plays a stranger selling a hair dryer (which he was doing when July met him) and also, in the magic-realist spirit of the film, provides the voice of the moon.
Back at her office, July showed me a few of his things, which had been photographed for the book. There were his wedding-cake figurines and a stack of old, bawdy handmade holiday cards he'd given to his wife. The couple met at a place called Paw Paw Lake, an uncanny coincidence that July discovered only after creating her own Paw-Paw. She began to think of Putterlik's marriage as a parallel for Sophie and Jason, and all young, vulnerable love, a subject that was on her newly married mind.
The day after ''The Future'' was completed last fall, Putterlik died at age 81. In the spring, his wife died, too. July found out that most of their things were being tossed in a Dumpster, and so, in a panic, she drove over to their house and rescued as many objects as she could.
The tableau -- July rifling through a box of poignant mementos, including a plastic-cow diorama that she placed gently on its side -- could well have been a scene in one of her films. It could even, at first glance, have seemed like the kind of moment her critics accuse her of: a boxful of curiosities passed off as profundity.
But when she showed me the construction-paper card, holding it very carefully, she was clearly touched by this man's love for his wife. With her film, she's trying to understand and excavate something of that love. There was no fetishizing of the oddball, no crippling nostalgia, no lack of gravitas, either in that desire or in its result.
Maybe not everyone will believe this about her. I asked her what, if anything, she would like to say to those people. ''I would just say I'm totally not kidding,'' she said. ''Life is too short. This is all too hard to do to actually be kidding about the whole thing.''

HEADLINE: Ethnic Music Tests Limits In China

BYLINE: By JONATHAN KAIMAN and ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- They have toured Europe, played alongside marquee names like the band Coldplay and earned plaudits in the international press. But here in China, the growing popularity of the Mongolian rock band Hanggai has not exactly inspired adulation from the authorities.
During a recent music festival the band organized in the suburbs of Beijing, Hanggai stacked the roster with musicians who, like the band's members, are known for combining traditional ethnic music with contemporary genres. There were performances by Mamer, an experimental musician from the Kazakh border region of China who plays a long-necked lute, and Zhang Quan, a peripatetic folk singer from the arid northwestern plains.
The event, undiminished by the erratic sound quality and overpriced food, attracted a swarm of state security officers who monitored the crowd with suspicion, impatience and a hint of curiosity.
A growing roster of alternative performance sites and music festivals has allowed Chinese ethnic minority musicians like the members of Hanggai to enjoy an unusual degree of financial security and cultural prominence. 
But in China, where the central government maintains a firm grip on popular media and cultural events, minority musicians walk a fine line: play it safe and they may lose their audience; go too far and they may lose their stage.
About 8 percent of China's population, or more than 100 million people, belong to 55 state-designated ethnic minority groups. Centuries of isolation and autonomy have made many of them linguistically and culturally distinct from the majority Han.
But over the past 30 years, a variety of social, economic and political forces have pushed them toward assimilation into mainstream Chinese culture. The lure of well-paid work in the cities draws young people away from traditional village life. Television and popular music have eclipsed traditional forms of entertainment.
Moreover, many groups feel marginalized by Beijing's policies that regulate minorities. Economic incentives that have lured millions of Han Chinese to the country's western, southern and northern fringes have created socioeconomic rifts along ethnic lines.
''There's a widespread belief among minorities that Han have an unfair advantage in terms of getting better employment and opportunities in minority areas,'' said Dru Gladney, an expert on Chinese minorities at Pomona College in California. Such resentments, he added, were an underlying factor in recent uprisings in Tibet and the western region of Xinjiang, where rioting by ethnic Uighurs claimed hundreds of lives, most of them Han Chinese.
In its official media, the Communist Party seeks to paint a very different picture.
At the forefront of state-sponsored minority representation are the ''song and dance troupes'' that appear regularly on television. These shows portray minorities as exotic and unthreatening -- with bright clothes and wide smiles and who are fanatical about singing and dancing. Many disparate minority groups often perform on stage together to symbolize ethnic harmony. Songs are often performed in Mandarin.
The lyrics are frequently apolitical paeans to the rugged allure of China's borderlands. In 2009, the Mongolian singer Wulan Tuoya had a major hit with the crisp, karaoke-friendly ''I Want to Go to Tibet.'' The song's music video looks like a public relations campaign for Tibetan tourism, juxtaposing government-financed group dances with video clips of the Beijing-Lhasa express train.
The status quo poses a challenge to those who wish to perform traditional songs as they are, with lyrics often describing less salubrious aspects of minority life.
''About 80 percent of my songs are about hardship,'' said Aojie a Ge, a Beijing-based musician from the Yi minority of southwest China. ''But can I perform these songs? Of course not. I still need to survive.''
Mr. Aojie rose to national fame in the late 1990s with the pop trio Mountain Eagle. Although he grew up in the Liangshan Prefecture of Sichuan Province, one of the country's poorest regions, he has largely assimilated to city life. He wears shoulder-length dreadlocks and designer jeans. His celebrity has earned him a prestigious job directing programs for a performance group affiliated with the All China Federation of Trade Unions, a government institution.
Many such programs are political in nature: Mr. Aojie recently returned from a week in Yunnan Province, where he helped local entrepreneurs develop a program promoting patriotic songs.
While Mr. Aojie enjoys the stability and prestige associated with his position, he is aware of the artistic limits imposed by the authorities. The government, for example, ultimately decides where he can perform, as well as the language of his songs.
''Of course, I have objections,'' Mr. Aojie said. ''In other countries, you can raise them. Here, you can't.''
But some minority musicians have succeeded in carving out an alternate path.
Take, for example, Shanren, or ''mountain people,'' another band that has become known for its eclectic style -- songs move fluidly from electronica to reggae to metal -- and arrangements inspired by traditional music from the country's ethnically diverse southwest, a melange of loose falsetto harmonies and twangy pentatonic lutes.
Growing up in a poor and mountainous village in southwest Guizhou Province, said the band's lead multi-instrumentalist, Xiao Budian, a music career was beyond imagination. The son of a cow herder and member of the tiny Buyi minority, Mr. Xiao left home on his 19th birthday, spending his high school tuition fees on a one-way train ticket to Beijing. ''I wanted to see what was on the other side of the mountain,'' he said.
Mr. Xiao initially lived with his older brother, a rock musician who had amassed a collection of foreign music and movies during his years in the capital. One day, Mr. Xiao heard Bob Dylan singing ''Blowin' in the Wind'' in a documentary about World War II. ''It was so simple, just a voice, a guitar and a harmonica,'' he said. ''But its power was tremendous. It was like an atom bomb.''
From their vantage point outside government channels, Shanren can breach subjects off limits to musicians like Mr. Aojie.
For example, ''30 Years'' is a Shanren song based on a Yi folk tune. Qu Zihan, the band's frontman, changed the lyrics to reflect the difficulty of finding good work and love in the big city.
''Even though we have rebellious things in our music, they're really not so obvious,'' Mr. Qu said. ''We just want to approach things from a different angle, to make people think.''
Last month, a few hundred foreigners and young Chinese packed a popular bar to see Hanggai play a final set in Beijing before embarking on a national tour. Projectors washed the stage with glimpses of lush grass hills, blue skies and galloping horse -- a subtle reminder of what many Mongolians say is being destroyed by a coal boom orchestrated by Han mining companies.
After each song, fans from the band members' hometowns in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region climbed on stage to present multicolored silk scarves to the band, a traditional gesture of respect. When Huricha, one of the band's vocalists, growled, ''We will bring you to the grasslands,'' the audience burst into applause.
But such flourishes of ethnic pride are counterbalanced by moments of uncertainty. At a Hanggai show in Shanghai the following week, one night after Shanren played on the same stage to a sold-out crowd, the police stopped the show after the opening act, saying there had been complaints about the noise.
The band was disappointed but forbearing. ''They don't need to control everything the way they do,'' Ilchi, the band's leader, said later. ''Rock concerts are very safe. It's only music after all.''

HEADLINE: Such a Slick Package, But Gearbox Is a Drag

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
TO the long list of things that have gone awry despite the best of intentions, add the 6-speed automatic transmission in the 2012 Ford Focus -- an otherwise admirably redesigned compact car.
In its effort to give the car exceptional fuel economy, Ford programmed the PowerShift dual-clutch transmission to change gears in odd and infuriating ways, rather effectively undermining the first all-new Focus since the 2000 model year.
The Focus is no longer Ford's smallest car in the United States. The Mexican-built Fiesta now holds that spot, sliding the Michigan-built Focus upscale in features and size. The latest model is available as either a sedan or a four-door hatchback.
With an overall length of 178.5 inches, the sedan is about 3.5 inches longer than the old model. The four-door hatchback is 171.6 inches long, 3.1 inches longer than the hatchback that Ford discontinued after the 2007 model year. 
The least expensive Focus is the S sedan with a 5-speed manual transmission, which has a starting price of $17,295. The SE hatchback, also with the manual, starts at $18,995. The top Focus is the Titanium hatchback at $23,495, but a self-indulgent buyer can pile on options all the way to $28,000.
Ford boasts that it is offering some features not available from competitors like the Chevrolet Cruze, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Toyota Corolla. The most notable is a system that automatically parallel-parks the car. The least expensive model on which this is available is the SEL, on which it is a $695 option, but because it requires buying other options the total cost is $3,085.
I tested an SE sedan, which is reasonably well equipped for the base price of $18,195. But the test car had more than $5,000 in extras, including cruise control, heated front seats, a 6-speed automatic transmission and a sport package. The window sticker totaled $23,195.
Like the original Focus, the 2012 models were developed in Europe. However, most of the work on the PowerShift automatic and the 4-cylinder engine was done in the United States.
Greg Burgess, the Focus vehicle engineering manager, said the American model handled almost identically to its Euro-sibling. One difference: all-season tires replaced the high-performance ''summer'' tires used in Europe.
The vehicle I tested had a sport package that includes higher-performance tires and replaces the rear drum brakes with discs. It also had optional 17-inch wheels with 215/50R17 tires. ''The suspension tuning is pretty much the same,'' Mr. Burgess said.
Two things are remarkable about the sport package. One is how quickly the Focus can travel even the most convoluted mountain road, changing direction quickly and displaying impressive adhesion and confidence-inspiring composure. The steering is precise and predictable; the body, which benefits from the inclusion of high-strength steel, feels wonderfully rigid.
The other notable benefit is that the ride quality -- even on bad roads -- remains quite good. Typically, sport suspensions make a car's passengers suffer for the driver's fun, but that's not the case with the Focus.
So just as it seems that Ford has hammered a gee-whiz home run, we come to the automatic transmission, expected to be chosen by 90 percent of buyers.
Dual-clutch designs are revered for sporty, fast shifts rivaling those of manual transmissions. But Ford has calibrated the PowerShift to maximize fuel economy by seeking the highest gear possible as quickly as possible, which keeps the engine speed low.
The gearing is not a problem on the Interstate, but can be aggravating on back roads or in stop-and-go traffic. The transmission is often in the wrong gear at the wrong time, resulting in jerks, pauses and lethargic acceleration.
Putting the shifter in the Sport position delays shifts but creates its own problem. Touching the brake while in Sport causes the gearbox to downshift.
Some automatic transmissions are programmed to shift to a lower gear if they receive a signal from the steering that the driver is turning. The idea is to provide better acceleration through the turn and onto a straight. But PowerShift doesn't receive any steering input, so when set to Sport it mindlessly downshifts whenever the driver brakes.
The driver can manually select gears by pushing a button on the side of the shift lever. This works reasonably well, but is not convenient and cannot offset the pervasive misbehavior.
It would take an utterly oblivious driver not to notice the PowerShift's problems. And because the Focus's handling is so good, the car will attract enthusiasts; I suspect that only the most bizarrely charitable enthusiast would find this transmission acceptable.
''It is quite a challenge to deliver something that is very, very fuel-efficient and yet feels just like a conventional automatic, and there are some balances and some tradeoffs that we make,'' said Mr. Burgess, the engineer.
Ford has talented powertrain engineers, so the logical explanation is that they were given a fuel economy target and no option but to meet it. One might wonder why a top executive didn't step in to keep the transmission from reaching market, but remember that this same company allowed the overcomplicated, confusing and sometimes inept MyFord Touch controls -- also available on the Focus -- to go into production.
I didn't have a chance to drive a Focus with the 5-speed manual transmission, an alternative worth exploring. It is not available on fancier trim levels.
The engine is a new 4-cylinder with direct injection, designed to provide more power and improved fuel economy. The 2-liter engine is rated at 160 horsepower at 6,500 revolutions per minute and 146 pound-feet torque at 4,450 r.p.m. When the transmission eventually found the right gear, the 4-cylinder moved the Focus (weighing a substantial 2,935 pounds) along briskly.
Car and Driver magazine clocked a Focus similar to the one I tested at 8.1 seconds from 0 to 60 miles per hour. The model I drove was rated at 27 m.p.g. in town (2 m.p.g. better than the 2011 model with a 4-speed automatic) and 37 m.p.g. on the highway (a gain of 3). In about 400 miles of cruising at around 65 m.p.h. I averaged close to 37 m.p.g.
A higher-mileage version, the SFE, is offered, but it could take many years of ownership to offset its higher price.
Most of the interior is pleasing. Many of the surfaces, including the steering wheel, use soft-touch plastic, literally a nice touch in the compact-car segment. The vehicle I tried had easy-to-use knobs for climate control. One odd thing was that the top of the storage bin impinges a bit on one of the cup holders, which are situated a bit too far back.
The sedan's 13.2 cubic feet of cargo space is competitive. Although the hatchback is shorter over all, it offers 23.8 cubic feet of storage (and as much as 44.8 with the backseat folded) and has roughly the same amount of headroom and legroom as the sedan.
Even the least expensive Focus has all the latest safety features. The Focus received a Top Safety Pick rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which tested it for front and side-impact crashes and for roof strength.
Alas, Ford has created a Focus in conflict with itself. The energetic handling will appeal to enthusiasts, but the automatic transmission won't cooperate.
INSIDE TRACK: A great car stuck in

Miranda July stood in her living room in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, apologizing for the sunflowers. It really was a copious amount of sunflowers.
They sprouted from Mason jars and vases, punctuating the austere, Shaker-like furniture in the sunny home that July, who is 37, shares with her husband, the filmmaker Mike Mills, who's 45. Noticing me noticing the sunflowers, she interjected: ''We just had a party. We don't usually have sunflowers everywhere.''
In person, July was very still, with ringlets of curly hair falling over her wide blue eyes like a protective visor, and she seemed perceptively aware of the ''precious'' label that is often attached both to her and to her work. At a different point in our time together, I followed her into a hotel room in San Francisco, where Mills had left her a knitted octopus wearing a scarf and hat on the couch. She laughed when she saw it but also appeared a bit mortified: ''Oh, God,'' she said. ''It's kind of a joke. . . . It's not. . . . Really, this isn't us at all.'' 
At their house, Mills emerged from his office; in contrast to July's measured composure, Mills seemed in constant motion, often running his hands through his Beethoven hair. Both he and July have directed new films being released this summer. His film, ''Beginners,'' is loosely based on the true story of his father's coming out at age 75. July's film, ''The Future,'' is her second feature as a director, and it's a funny, sad portrait of a couple at a crossroads. Sophie, played by July, works at a children's dance school, and Jason, played by Hamish Linklater, provides tech-support by telephone from their sofa. The couple is weeks away from adopting Paw-Paw, an injured cat and a symbol of impending adulthood who is also the film's narrator. A talking cat is exactly the kind of detail that might endear people who are endeared by Miranda July and infuriate people who are infuriated by her. There are plenty of both.
''You've met us at a weird time,'' Mills said. ''We're usually just two workaholics in our separate corners.'' July and Mills first crossed paths in 2005, when July's debut feature, ''Me and You and Everyone We Know,'' made its premiere at Sundance at the same time as Mills's film ''Thumbsucker.'' They met at a party -- ''She wore a yellow dress,'' he recalls -- and he watched her do a Q. and A. the next day. ''She was so strong and declarative. I fell in love instantly.'' They married in the summer of 2009 at Mills's house in the Nevada hills.
In one sense, July has been enjoying the Platonic ideal of creative success in the age of the hyphenate artist. She publishes short stories in The New Yorker. The seven-year Web project, ''Learning to Love You More,'' which she produced with Harrell Fletcher -- in which more than 8,000 people submitted material in response to online assignments like ''Make a protest sign and protest'' and ''Take a picture of your parents kissing'' -- was recently acquired by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. ''Me and You and Everyone We Know'' won the Camera d'Or at Cannes and was named by Roger Ebert as one of the best films of the 2000s. She inspires a devotion among her fans that is positively swoony: ''I love Miranda July, and everything she does is so subtle and sweet and bizarre and necessary,'' is a fairly typical sentiment. July is preoccupied with intimacy -- she habitually uses the words ''you'' and ''we'' in her titles -- and this demands, and inspires, an intense engagement from her followers. After a screening of ''The Future'' at the San Francisco Film Festival, a small crowd surrounded July, pinning her against the back wall of the movie theater, wanting to tell her, with palpable urgency, how much her work mattered to them. Her office has an entire room filled top to bottom with boxes of letters and objects from fans around the world. One man printed every e-mail he ever wrote and sent them all to July, because only she would understand.
Yet despite this (or perhaps because of it) she has also become the unwilling exemplar of an aggravating boho archetype: the dreamy, young hipster whose days are filled with coffee, curios and disposable enchantments. ''Yes, in some ways Miranda July is living my dream and life, and yes, maybe I'm a little jealous,'' wrote one Brooklyn-based artist on her blog. ''I loathe her. It feels personal.'' To her detractors (''haters'' doesn't seem like too strong a word) July has come to personify everything infuriating about the Etsy-shopping, Wes Anderson-quoting, McSweeney's-reading, coastal-living category of upscale urban bohemia that flourished in the aughts. Her very existence is enough to inspire, for example, an I Hate Miranda July blog, which purports to detest her ''insufferable precious nonsense.'' Or there is the online commenter who roots for July to be exiled to Darfur. Or the blogger who yearns to beat her with a shoe.
I understand this, at least in theory. The urban bohemian irks precisely because his or her quirky individuality is just part of a different kind of uniformity, where the uniform happens to be a bushy beard or Zooey Deschanel bangs rather than country-club khakis. Twee fascinations with childhood innocence can mask an unwillingness to tackle life's darker quandaries. Who wouldn't be annoyed by a guy who, say, finds a cracked milk bottle, makes a film about it, then silk screens it on a T-shirt and names his band Milk Bottle? The stakes are low. The results are soon forgotten.
But is Miranda July the archenemy of seriousness? She has an affinity for surface detail, like the childlike scrawl on her sculptures that appeared in the Venice Biennale or the matching haircuts of her two main characters in ''The Future.'' But unlike certain directors who fixate on marginalia, creating art in which the engraving on a character's belt buckle takes precedence over the story, July's seemingly superficial gestures service something greater: a pulsing emotional center. It's odd that she has come to represent, for some, a kind of soulless hipster cool, because in July's work, nobody is cool. There's no irony to it, no insider wink. Her characters are ordinary people whose lives don't normally invite investigation. So her project is the opposite of hipster exclusion: her work is desperate to bring people together, forcing them into a kind of fellow feeling. She's unrelentingly sincere, and maybe that sincerity makes her difficult to bear. It also might make her culturally essential.
On a spring California weekend, I drove while July rode shotgun, navigating on her iPhone and guiding me through the Berkeley of her youth. The city was in full splendor, with cedar-sided cottagy houses shaded by magnolia trees in bloom. We pulled over in front of the Arts and Crafts home where July lived between the ages 7 and 14. A big purple sun was painted above the picture window, as if the house were a magic bus.
''It didn't look like that when we lived in it,'' she said quickly.
The house is just off Telegraph Avenue, Berkeley's central thoroughfare, where the homeless co-exist, sometimes uneasily, with students and yuppies. The house's living room once served as headquarters for the family business, a New Age publishing company called North Atlantic Books. (The company is still a going concern -- its current list includes books on crystals and raw foods, as well as more fringy philosophical meanderings like ''Manifesto for the Noosphere: The Next Stage in the Evolution of Human Consciousness.'') As children, July and her older brother, Robin Grossinger, packed Jiffy bags with books for shipment and occasionally tiptoed past a writer finishing a draft on a typewriter in the living room. The Grossingers were a D.I.Y. family; July cut her father's and her brother's hair, guided by an article she remembers clipping from Seventeen magazine called ''A Trim for Him.'' When July began to have recurring eye trouble, her mother sewed her an eye patch out of a floral print -- from the same material as the curtains, as a friend pointed out to her, to July's dismay. ''When I was very little, I probably wanted to be more normal,'' she told me. ''I probably wanted the Laura Ashley bedroom, and instead I got thrift-store everything.''
We moved on, driving past a cinder-block apartment building. ''That's where I lost my virginity,'' she said casually. ''I was 16. He was a 27-year-old grad student at Berkeley.'' This revelation seemed in line with how July uses sex in her films: as both a sudden surprise and a way to illuminate the inner lives of her characters. ''I was always interested in sex, even as a kid. Sex includes shame and humiliation and fantasies and longing. It's so dense with the kinds of things I'm interested in.''
After dropping out of college, July left California in her early 20s and took off to Portland, Ore. Her photo albums from that time are Riot Grrrl artifacts, with Kill Rock Stars fliers for her old band, photos of a ''queercore'' event and snapshots with postpunk heroines like Kathleen Hanna and the band Sleater Kinney. Describing a false ID she used at the time, July wrote in The New Yorker, ''The student it had belonged to looked sort of like me, in the sense that she, too, was probably giving lesbianism a whirl and had cut off all her hair.'' In the art scene, July was a prolific polymath making lauded performance and video pieces, but when ''Me and You and Everyone We Know'' came out, she was handed an immediate international identity as a filmmaker. With her film debut, she emerged as a less angry, more spiritual Todd Solondz or a more tender, more libidinous Noah Baumbach. At the same time, she, and her film, seemed unlike anything that was percolating elsewhere, leading Roger Ebert to praise the movie's ''fragile magic'' and to say, ''July's film fits no genre, fulfills no expectations, creates its own rules and seeks only to share a strange, lovable mind with us.''
In ''Me and You and Everyone We Know,'' July plays a lovestruck video artist pursuing a damaged single dad. (The film is gently comic; July's unblinking stare and reedy, slightly strangled voice can come off as high comedy on screen.) One of the man's sons, a 7-year-old, ends up in an accidental relationship with a haughty art dealer after proposing in a chat room that they ''poop back and forth, forever.'' All of her characters crave connection -- and rarely get it. Still, the film is buoyant, popping with a hopeful California brightness: the Japanese version's title translates as ''A Rainbow-Colored World for You and Me.''
''One of the bravest things in that film was trying to have a frank exploration of children's sexuality, which is really taboo,'' says Julia Bryan-Wilson, an associate professor of art history at the University of California, Berkeley, and an old friend of July's. She views July's work as playing with the idea of the uncanny, which Freud defined as deriving ''its terror not from something externally alien or unknown but -- on the contrary -- from something strangely familiar which defeats our efforts to separate ourselves from it.''
When we first met, I asked July which filmmakers inspired her, and she drew a blank, answering apologetically: ''I'm not a cinephile. My films don't reference films. I'm more interested in rhythm and feeling.'' Later, in L.A., she followed up with a story. Her house is filled with Mills's DVDs -- lots of Criterion Collection -- but one night, at home alone, July wasn't in the mood for avant-garde. She picked up a copy of ''Bowfinger,'' the 1999 comedy starring Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy. She was about to watch it when, she says: ''I thought: Come on, Miranda, really? Let's try something between 'Bowfinger' and the Czech New Wave.''
That compromise proved to be ''Magnolia,'' by Paul Thomas Anderson, one of her favorite directors. She listed similarly inspiring peers: ''Todd Solondz's 'Happiness,' David Gordon Green. Jane Campion, Andrea Arnold, Spike [Jonze]. I sometimes get painted as so 'in my own world,' but I probably wouldn't even want to make films if there weren't this world of people who I'm waiting for the next film from.'' As a young artist, she was interested in connecting with other women, so she started an influential project that became ''Joanie 4 Jackie,'' a video chain letter for female filmmakers to share their work. ''It sounds really altruistic,'' she says, ''but I was also lonely. 'Joanie 4 Jackie' saved me, because I felt like I was part of something. That was my film school.''
Even though July is often lumped in with directors like Wes Anderson, Jonze or Baumbach, the face of independent film -- really, the face of film -- remains distinctly male. Her work is highly personal, delving into the emotional, inner life -- in other words, it's girl stuff. Criticism of July often carries a whiff of sexism. ''Precious,'' ''light,'' and ''twee'' all describe conventionally feminine qualities, and all have been tossed July's way as insults.
Of male directors, she said: ''They become kind of brands. It's much harder to do that if you're a woman. That's crucial for longevity.'' The fact that she appears in her films helps give her work a recognizable face -- the Miranda July brand.
She admires directors like Baumbach and Wes Anderson, but she said: ''All those men are also personal. I don't mind that, but I do mind that it's not really questioned, whereas I or another woman is looked at as so self-obsessed. Men are just not being judged in the same way. They're never going to be annoying in the same way.''
July turned out to be an excellent road-trip companion; she laughed often, gave great directions and constantly worried if I had enough to eat. She generously offered to share her peanut-butter cookie, then navigated us to her parents' current house, which sits high in the hills of Berkeley.
If you were to try to recreate the hothouse of familial circumstances that might grow a Miranda July, it would look like this: Richard Grossinger and Lindy Hough, both in their 60s with 45 years of marriage behind them, drinking herbal tea in a living room lined with books and Oaxacan wooden animals in bright colors staring out from every surface.
Hough, cross-legged on a throw cushion on the floor, offered me her recently published book of poetry (blurbed by Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore). July's brother, Robin, a 42-year-old environmental scientist, sat on the couch. In one corner of the living room stood a tall wooden cabinet he built when he was 16. It housed behind its glass doors many rows of creatures he made from fruit pits and pine cones. ''Look what's in here!'' July said as she showed me the secret compartments in the cabinet's drawers -- one hidden drawer held a key that led to another interior chamber. In the cabinet's heart lay a Nike shoebox filled with envelopes marked in children's writing: '' 'Muppet Movie' stuff.'' ''Mimi's drawings.'' Her brother had kept a file of July's crayon pictures of stick people with their hands over their heads. ''Robin could make things out of nothing,'' July said. ''That feeling of 'we can come up with something!' -- you've got to believe that was really formative. You felt like you could do anything.''
Richard Grossinger is a writer, too, with several books, including a self-published memoir charting his absurdly dramatic childhood. July's father grew up near Central Park in New York City, under the name Richard Towers. When he was 9, a psychiatrist told him that his real father was actually a Grossinger, which explained his summer visits to the luxurious Grossinger's resort in the Catskills. So he took the name Grossinger -- then learned, years later, that in fact he was the product of an affair between his mother and an entirely different man.
All of this made it easy for July, at 16, to adopt a new name based on a story in a zine, by her high-school friend Johanna Fateman (who was later a co-founder of the band Le Tigre), about two buddies named Ida and July. She changed her name legally in her early 20s. ''It was part of being self-authoring. And it was vanity. I wanted a name that I liked. July looked good on everything and seemed edible. But it's a 15-year-old's idea of a great name.''
I asked Grossinger if he minded his daughter's changing her name. ''My kids are their own people. Their stories are their own.'' Nonetheless, he handed over a sheaf of papers, stories of July, starting with her birth.
''They'll be filled with inaccuracies,'' July said of the papers later. Really? Like what? ''Stigmata,'' she said. When July was a kid, she cut her foot and somehow, in family lore, this became stigmata. ''I'm sure I played into it, but basically my dad thinks I'm magic.''
The family seemed open to magic. Her dad was born Jewish -- there was ''the occasional Hanukkah candle,'' she says -- and her mom was raised Protestant, but the family trade was New Age. ''There was no one specific belief but a kind of looser spiritual believing in just about everything,'' July says. ''I think there's something spiritual in a very day-to-day, mundane existence. It's impossible to articulate, and it's happening now, almost like a perverse secret. . . . That's always sort of fascinating to me.''
These fascinations first emerged in a play she wrote in high school, inspired by her correspondence with a prisoner who was jailed for murdering a man who had repeatedly robbed his gas station. (She found him through an ad for a prisoner-correspondence program in the back of a magazine.) ''I was very existential. It was the first time I had a feeling like: I can't bear this. I have to do something to understand these feelings,'' she says. ''That we could be friends at all and know each other and be living such different lives and that he might die in there -- it shook me.''
The play was called ''The Lifers.'' She held auditions and cast a 20-something Latina woman to play the role of the teenaged Miranda July. ''I had to call the actors to say, 'The good news is you got the part, but the bad news is I'm 16 and we'll be rehearsing in my parents' attic.' ''
She wasn't interested in performing the play at her preppy private high school, so she approached 924 Gilman, a local punk club. ''I remember thinking: I have to do this [play]. If I don't, I might as well not exist.'' But the process was grueling. The night before the opening, July remembers wandering out of her house in a kind of daze. ''I was so overwhelmed, feeling like I could barely pull it off. I remember going outside and getting under a car parked in front of our house, some random car, just lying under that car, which seemed like the lowest thing you could do,'' she says. Then she walked around Berkeley, into the backyard of a friend, took off her clothes and climbed into a lukewarm hot tub.
''I'm pretty much exactly the same now,'' she says. ''I'm planning on working on that, by the way.''
Despite the success of ''Me and You,'' July found herself broke after the film's release. But given that her life seems disproportionately abundant with strange, otherworldly moments, it makes perfect sense that one day she opened her mail and found an unexpected check for $25,000. Years before, in Portland, she was hired as a tastemaker by an ad agency; Coca-Cola later realized that a name chosen for a new Coke product had also been suggested by her, so the company sent her a check. (''Coke II -- genius, huh?'' she says.) That $25,000 bought her time to turn her attention to writing, shaping the short stories she had been tending for years.
July sent some early pages to Rick Moody, who had met her after seeing her perform a piece called ''The Swan Tool'' at the Kitchen in New York. ''She knew how to spell, but other than that I'm not sure she had a single conventional writer trick in her arsenal,'' Moody told me in an e-mail. ''The weirder she was, the better I liked it.'' July had left the University of California, Santa Cruz, after her sophomore year, and though she reads voraciously -- she will often dip into Lydia Davis or Steven Millhauser before sitting down to write -- she has no formal artistic training. She admits she had to learn the difference between first and second person, and she's still not confident on how to use quotation marks around dialogue, which is why there aren't any quotation marks in her first book.
''No One Belongs Here More Than You'' won the Cork City-Frank O'Connor short story award, along with a 35,000 euro prize, and also became a best seller. July then set about adapting ''Things We Don't Understand and Definitely Are Not Going to Talk About,'' an interactive performance piece about relationships in crisis that would become the basis of ''The Future.'' In 2008, she went knocking on doors for financing in the midst of a recession, when many studios were shuttering their independent divisions. ''The Future'' ended up largely backed by Film4 and a German company called Razor Film. A condition of the financing stipulated that many of the smaller parts be filled with German or European actors, which adds to the film's off-kilter mood: it's set in L.A., but only sort of.
''I had a lot of anxiety,'' she says of the 21-day shoot. ''I was like, I can't do this. I can only make one movie. But in truth, it was pretty great. It doesn't mean it was fun, because I drove myself crazy the whole time, worrying that it wouldn't come together.''
July set out to write a tighter, more controlled story than her first film, with fewer characters. She was also in her 30s, and she was feeling older and less rainbow colored.
''It's kind of about letting go of that feeling of my 20s, that feeling that I will do absolutely everything, I will have sex with everyone, I will go to every country,'' she says. ''In your 30s, it's obvious that a finite amount of things will happen.'' In ''The Future,'' the characters sum it up. Sophie: ''We'll be 40 in five years.'' Jason: ''Forty is basically 50. And then after 50, the rest is just loose change.''
The midlife crisis is usually a male response to mortality terror, but in ''The Future,'' it's July's character, Sophie, who takes up with a single dad, leaving her bohemian surroundings for an affair in a nice house in the suburbs. For July, the story of a woman fleeing her life was a personal purging.
''I think I was afraid; I was committing to someone forever,'' she says. ''That [idea] that you might just defect from your life, I've been carrying around for so long. You don't want that to be a constant threat. So I think I was like: O.K., what would happen? So you leave. Then what happens? Then I realized: You're probably haunted by yourself. Your soul follows you.''
In the film, the soul takes the shape of a yellow T-shirt, which literally creeps out to the suburbs and back to Sophie. Then Sophie climbs inside the shirt for a kind of dance of suffocation and rebirth.
O.K., no doubt July dissenters are now experiencing ear smoke. They probably also won't like the fact that July does, in real life, have a ratty T-shirt that she takes with her everywhere for comfort, carefully placing it in her suitcase in hotels so the maids don't think it's garbage.
And they definitely won't like this: Paw-Paw, the narrating cat, came into existence when July saw a cat hit by a car and, while bagging the dead body, announced to her producing partner, Gina Kwon, ''We must redeem this cat.''
But here's the part they will like the least: ''The Future'' is really good, a film that's not only tighter than the free-ranging ''Me and You'' but also more mature and tonally darker. (It's literally darker, too: July shot it in a pastel-free palette of beiges and browns.) It may not convert all her critics, and it might shock some of her fans. But ''The Future'' should definitively dispel the lingering notion that her art is some gossamer, transient confection. The film is devoted to the only truths worth engaging, about love, sex and death, all questions unasked in the neutered, cutesy world of, say, ''Napoleon Dynamite'' and the like. ''I do believe my work should be of service,'' she told me. ''The Future'' is not just a rebuke to the idea that her work is somehow shallow; it actively attacks the idea of shallowness. July wants you to feel a part of something larger than yourself and, in ''The Future,'' you do.
And Paw-Paw, that cat with the bandaged paw, who narrates the movie?
I swear that talking cat will make you cry.
''The Future'' features a small role played by an elderly man, Joe Putterlik, whom July met through the PennySaver. (She was interviewing and photographing people who advertise in the PennySaver, for a book titled ''It Chooses You.'') Putterlik plays a stranger selling a hair dryer (which he was doing when July met him) and also, in the magic-realist spirit of the film, provides the voice of the moon.
Back at her office, July showed me a few of his things, which had been photographed for the book. There were his wedding-cake figurines and a stack of old, bawdy handmade holiday cards he'd given to his wife. The couple met at a place called Paw Paw Lake, an uncanny coincidence that July discovered only after creating her own Paw-Paw. She began to think of Putterlik's marriage as a parallel for Sophie and Jason, and all young, vulnerable love, a subject that was on her newly married mind.
The day after ''The Future'' was completed last fall, Putterlik died at age 81. In the spring, his wife died, too. July found out that most of their things were being tossed in a Dumpster, and so, in a panic, she drove over to their house and rescued as many objects as she could.
The tableau -- July rifling through a box of poignant mementos, including a plastic-cow diorama that she placed gently on its side -- could well have been a scene in one of her films. It could even, at first glance, have seemed like the kind of moment her critics accuse her of: a boxful of curiosities passed off as profundity.
But when she showed me the construction-paper card, holding it very carefully, she was clearly touched by this man's love for his wife. With her film, she's trying to understand and excavate something of that love. There was no fetishizing of the oddball, no crippling nostalgia, no lack of gravitas, either in that desire or in its result.
Maybe not everyone will believe this about her. I asked her what, if anything, she would like to say to those people. ''I would just say I'm totally not kidding,'' she said. ''Life is too short. This is all too hard to do to actually be kidding about the whole thing.''

HEADLINE: The Wages Of Virtue and Vice

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
VICE and virtue are engaged in a titanic struggle on many fronts, and vice often appears to have the upper hand. Just read the headlines. Scandals in politics, sports, business and journalism seem to be popping up everywhere.
But how reassuring it is to see virtue beating vice in at least one statistically verifiable contest -- mutual fund performance.
There, at the top of the charts for general domestic mutual funds published in Sunday Business last week, was a fund that wears its virtue on its sleeve: the Virtus Small-Cap Sustainable Growth fund. The Virtus fund gained 8.43 percent in the three months through June, making it No. 1 for the second quarter of 2011.
If your Latin is rusty, ''virtus'' is a form of virtue, specifically the ''kind of integrity and strength'' that was prized in the ancient Roman republic, according to Joe Fazzino, a spokesman for Virtus Investment Partners, the fund's parent company, a 2008 spin-off from the Phoenix life insurance group in Hartford, Conn. ''When we rebranded, we chose the name 'virtus' to emphasize those qualities.'' 
But if mutual fund branding is a kind of morality play, this is no time to be complacent. Vice is nipping at virtue's heels.
Second on the mutual fund list stood the Vice fund, which was founded in 2002 with the proud intention of devoting itself to ''socially irresponsible stocks,'' specifically those in the tobacco, alcohol, gambling and military industries. Dan S. Ahrens, the firm's first manager (he's now executive vice president of AdvisorShares, a sponsor of exchange-traded funds) said he realized that these ''vice stocks'' were ''nearly recession-proof.''
The strategy has been working. The Vice fund gained 6.64 percent in the second quarter. Over the 12 months through June, it returned 39.32 percent, compared with 39.39 percent for the Virtus fund. Over five years, Vice edged out Virtus, with an annualized return of 3.44 percent vs. 3.28 percent for the Virtus fund.
In August 2002, in a brief report on the fund's creation, I noted the Vice fund's cheeky slogan: ''When it's good, it's very, very good ... and when it's bad, it's better.''
After a series of management changes, the fund's approach remains much the same. ''The name suggests some salacious options, but we don't invest in all vices,'' said Gerald Sullivan, manager since June 1. ''We don't invest in bordellos; for one thing, they're not publicly traded,'' he said. Its definition of vice is actually quite limited. It doesn't invest in jewelry, furs or reality television shows either, for example.
Top holdings include Philip Morris and Altria, which make cigarettes; General Dynamics, Raytheon and Northrup Grumman, which build weapons; Carlsberg, Diageo and SABMiller, which distill alcoholic beverages; and the Galaxy Entertainment Group, which owns Macao casinos.
The fund has thrived despite the legal problems of its original adviser, Mutuals.com and several executives, including Richard Sapio, Mutuals.com's former chief executive.
In a 2008 settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Sapio said that he had helped to ''facilitate improper trading practices'' like market timing that hurt mutual fund shareholders and enriched hedge funds and other deep-pocketed investors. The Vice fund was not implicated.
Mr. Sapio remains a major shareholder of Mutual Capital Alliance, the holding company that controls USA Mutuals, the fund's current adviser, according to Jerry Szilagyi, the president of USA Mutuals. The settlement barred Mr. Sapio from involvement in the mutual fund's operations for five years. Mr. Sapio could not be reached for comment.
The fund's core stocks are often shunned on ethical grounds, a stigma that tends to depress prices, Mr. Sullivan said, but that gives the stocks some immunity from volatile swings induced by manias and panics. ''These stocks are really never entirely in fashion,'' he said. Over the long run, he added, ''these companies just aren't going to go away. They are very solid, very reliable, and they produce very good returns.''
So vice investing has a formidable record. As for the Virtus Small-Cap Sustainable Growth fund, how much virtue is in it? As far as corporate governance goes, the Virtus family appears to be solid, although Morningstar has not graded it. Communications to shareholders seem to be models of candor. One recent report said that the fund's performance was hurt by ''poor stock selection,'' a straightforward admission. ''We've been doing well lately, but sometimes we'll make a bad choice,'' said Jon K. Christensen, one of the fund's managers.
But don't let the name fool you. The virtue of ''sustainable growth'' to which the fund aspires has nothing to do with environmentalism, Mr. Christensen said. It refers to profits built on a sound base and that can be expected to keep growing. ''We don't invest in renewable energy companies,'' he said. ''Frankly, right now, those companies are unprofitable. We don't invest in anything that hasn't been profitable for many, many years, in good times and bad, and that we think can be counted on.''
He said he looks for smaller companies with long-term ''competitive advantages,'' often based on ''proprietary'' qualities that provide high profit margins and free cash flow and require relatively little capital investment. Its holdings are eclectic and include Hansen Natural, which sells Monster Energy drinks; Hittite Microwave, which builds semiconductors for the communications industry; Cohen & Steers, which runs real estate investment trusts; and Copart, which he called ''the eBay of the salvage vehicle industry.''
The fund isn't listed as a ''socially responsible fund'' by US SIF -- The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment. That group advocates ''investing practices that consider environmental, social and corporate governance criteria to generate long-term competitive financial returns and positive societal impact,'' according to Meg Voorhes, its research director.
But she said that many of the organization's members believed that profits could only be sustainable with ethical business practices, and that the richest profits were not always the most admirable. An example in the news lately, she said, is provided by the News Corporation, the media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch that has been embroiled in a scandal over phone hacking and bribery in London. ''Many of our members say that News Corp.'s profits aren't sustainable because they're based on practices that are reprehensible,'' she said.
There may, in other words, be virtue in old-fashioned, long-term investing, even it isn't always obvious. Vice, on the other hand, is its own reward.

HEADLINE: Getting the Most Out of Social Security

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. THALER. 
Richard H. Thaler is a professor of economics and behavioral science at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. He is also an academic adviser to the Allianz Global Investors Center for Behavioral Finance, a part of Allianz, which sells financial products including annuities. The company was not consulted for this column.

 BODY:
SOCIAL SECURITY may be the most beloved of all the government's programs, partly because it requires so little thinking. You pay taxes while you work, then you and your spouse collect until you die.
This description oversimplifies things, of course. Social Security, as it's currently constituted, is refreshingly straightforward but you do have to make one important choice, and many people could make their lives after retirement better if they chose differently.
As I discussed in a previous column, most economists and financial advisers say that in retirement, Americans would do well to increase the proportion of their wealth that pays a guaranteed income for life, much as Social Security does. The technical word for the financial instrument that accomplishes this feat is an annuity. 
Traditional pensions are a form of annuity, and people who have them usually seem to love them. What's odd is that people with retirement plans like 401(k)'s generally do not buy annuities, even though annuities would simplify and stabilize their financial lives. Economists call this state of affairs the annuity puzzle.
Several readers wrote to explain why they did not own (or recommend) annuities. Three major worries stood out:
Most annuities are not inflation protected, so what happens if high inflation returns?
How can a buyer be sure that the company selling the annuity will be able to make the payments 20 or 30 years from now?
Annuities can be complicated and are sometimes sold with large fees. How can buyers know whether they are getting a good deal?
All of these concerns are legitimate. I wish I had found a simple recipe to solve all of these problems, but they are tough ones. Still, the federal government could help matters. For example, it might create rules to encourage more employers to offer safe and fairly priced annuities within their 401(k) plans. There is interest in Washington in doing this, but the details are tricky. Employers would like a clear-cut rule absolving them from the responsibility of choosing an annuity provider, say, by granting a safe harbor if the insurance company has a satisfactory credit rating, but given the recent track record of rating agencies, this particular rule is unlikely to be adopted.
In light of these difficulties, let's focus on the one source of annuities that is fully inflation protected, is fairly priced, and, because it is run by the government, is reasonably safe: Social Security benefits. Claiming that Social Security benefits are safe may sound naive, but my view is actually quite cynical. I believe that as long as the elderly continue to vote in large numbers, no Congress will renege on promised payouts for those already eligible to receive benefits.
Of course, the system has to be tweaked to keep it self-sufficient, but economists of every stripe agree that this is a relatively easy fix, unlike, say, trimming the rising cost of Medicare. The fix might trim benefits in some way, perhaps through a less generous indexing formula, but I believe that anyone already eligible to claim benefits can safely count on getting them.
If you think this premise is preposterous, stop reading here, and complain to your representatives in Congress. (While you're at it, you might also tell them to get the debt ceiling raised, or better yet, simply eliminate it, so we do not frighten people into thinking we would actually default on our debts, even to ourselves.)
So here is a bit of good news. There is a simple, easy way to convert a portion of your wealth into a fairly priced, inflation-adjusted annuity. Simply delay when you start receiving Social Security benefits.
Participants are first eligible to start claiming benefits at age 62. For those who wait, the monthly payments increase in an actuarially fair manner until age 70. The claiming formula is designed to make the economic value of the stream of benefits the same, regardless of when you start. The longer you wait, the greater your monthly benefits when you start getting checks, because you will not receive them for as long a period. If you wait from 62 to 66 to start, your payments go up by at least a third, and if you wait all the way until 70 to start claiming, your benefits go up by at least 75 percent. (I say ''at least'' because if you delay claiming and keep working it is possible that you can qualify for an even higher benefit level.)
With these rules, waiting is the cheapest way to buy more annuity coverage. However, few take advantage of this opportunity. Currently, about 46 percent of participants begin claiming at 62, the first year in which they are eligible, the government says. Less than 5 percent of participants delay past age 66. This is unfortunate. If you are in good health and you can afford to wait, my advice is that you should wait as long as possible. The greater is your guaranteed lifetime income, the easier it will be to organize your retirement budget, and the less you will worry about living ''too long.''
The Social Security Administration could take some steps to encourage people to delay. First, change some confusing terminology. For historical reasons, Social Security labels an intermediate age between 62 and 70 as the ''Full (normal) Retirement Age.'' Yes, the parenthetical ''normal'' is part of the official language. The age had traditionally been 65, but it is slowly being raised to age 67. For anyone born between 1943 and 1954, for example, the age is set at 66.
Let's get rid of this awkward and misleading term. Benefits at that age are not ''full'' and retiring at that age is not ''normal.'' Research shows that the designation of a full retirement age can serve as an anchor that influences people's choices, and may help explain why so few people delay claiming past age 66.
THERE is a bolder step that could make additional Social Security benefits available for many people. Pamela Perun of the Aspen Institute suggests that participants be able to ''top up'' their Social Security benefits. Participants could buy up to $100,000 in additional annuity benefits by sending a check to the Social Security Administration. The $100,000 cap is arbitrary, but the idea behind having a cap is to leave the high-end market to the private sector. Payments would just be added to the usual Social Security check, so the administrative costs would be small.
These reforms will not solve everyone's problems, but they would make household budgeting easier and less worrisome. With baby boomers starting to reach retirement age, now is a great time to take these steps.

HEADLINE: The Appeal of Adjustable Rates

BYLINE: By MARYANN HAGGERTY

 BODY:
THE 30-year fixed-rate loan has earned its reputation as the sensible, conservative move in the aftermath of the financial crisis, especially with near-low interest rates. But despite risks, some borrowers still are getting or keeping adjustable-rate loans, which have even lower rates.
In the first quarter of 2011, while the volume of ARMs sagged along with the mortgage market, their market share actually rose to the highest point since mid-2008, to 12 percent, according to the trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance. 
Adjustable rate mortgages generally attract borrowers when rates are high. The rate is set for a specific time -- generally one, five or seven years -- and then it adjusts to prevailing rates within boundaries. That means payments can go up. Payment shock has caused plenty of problems over the years. Rates can also go down, as borrowers who took out ARMs five to seven years ago are finding now. But it's tough to imagine how rates could get much lower than now, short of Japan-style negative rates.
''If a person is debt-averse and has a history of paying off his or her mortgage within 5 to 10 years, then he or she would definitely consider an ARM,'' said Sari Rosenberg, a managing director of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, a loan broker. ''I have another client who knows he is selling his home within the next few years and even with the closing costs he will be saving money,'' so he took out a three-year ARM.
Some borrowers, Ms. Rosenberg said, are choosing seven-year ARMs at around 3.5 percent, for up to $1.5 million, an amount typically set by lenders, versus 5.25 percent for a 30-year loan of that size. But, she said, ''on a $1.5 million loan, that is a difference of $1,548 a month or $18,576 year. That pays for half a year of private school tuition in Manhattan.''
Keith Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a financial publisher in Pompton Plains, N.J., said, ''ARMs are good for borrowers with short-term time frames, usually seven years or less.''
''This can include certain first-time borrowers who expect to trade up,'' Mr. Gumbinger continued, ''such as a single person buying a studio apartment; folks who get transferred, or expect to be, within that time; folks refinancing with just a few more years expected in the old suburban mansion; jumbo mortgage seekers looking for a lower-cost alternative, and even folks who are approaching retirement age who want to seriously improve their cash flow to maximize their retirement accounts.''
Conversely, ARMs aren't wise for borrowers who plan to stay put, Mr. Gumbinger said, or those who would have trouble managing rising payments. That includes people who expect cash-flow strains, such as those starting a family.
Another choice faces borrowers whose five or seven-year ARMs are resetting now, said Gary Schatsky, a financial planner at ObjectiveAdvice.com in New York City. Rates may drop to 2.25 percent to 3.25 percent from about 5 percent. That compares with around 4.5 percent, on average, for 30-year fixed-rate loans now. But that super-low rate is good for only a year.
''It's very seductive,'' Mr. Schatsky said, especially because keeping that ARM rather than refinancing into a fixed-rate loan avoids closing costs.
In that case, he said, know how much your rate could jump after a year -- ARMs generally have caps on increases -- and whether you can handle that. ''I want you to have a Plan B,'' he said.
IN the meantime, he counsels clients to consider using the savings to pay down the loan, rather than spending it.
And borrowers who are nervous about higher future payments should consider forgoing the alluring new rate, he said.
''If you have no room subjectively for the risk,'' Mr. Schatsky said, ''it's not a bad time to say it's been a good ride, but it's time to go from adjustable to fixed.''

HEADLINE: Arab Spring, Start-Up Summer?

BYLINE: By HANNAH SELIGSON

 BODY:
LIKE so many other young people in Cairo, Yasmine el-Mehairy saw no future in Egypt. What she saw was a dead end.
Then came Tahrir Square.
Six months after an uprising led by people like her ousted Hosni Mubarak and overturned the established order of the Arab world, Ms. Mehairy has joined the ranks of Egypt's newest business class: the entrepreneurs of the revolution. Instead of leaving Egypt as she had planned, she is staying to nurture a start-up called SuperMama, an Arabic-language Web site for women that has 10 local employees.
''The revolution really made my generation believe in ourselves,'' Ms. Mehairy, 30, says. If Egyptians can topple Mubarak, she wonders, what else might they accomplish?
That is a sobering question for educated, affluent Egyptians like Ms. Mehairy -- people who, unlike most Egyptians, have other options. She has a master's degree in interactive media from the University of Westminster in London and hoped to move to Britain or Canada. 
The revolt now known as the Arab Spring placed Egypt on an uncertain course. After years of corruption, its hidebound economy is reeling. Tourism and investment have plunged. Mass unemployment -- which fed Egyptians' anger -- has worsened and protests in Tahrir Square continue. The nation will elect a new government in September, and it's anyone's guess what will happen then.
Yet for all the uncertainties, some of those who embraced Facebook and Twitter during those heady days in Tahrir Square are now busily trying to start or continue working on Web sites and Web applications that they hope will yield profits and jobs.
''This is an unusual revolution in that it was led by a very educated and economically conversant, forward-looking group of people,'' says Khush Choksy, executive director of the United States-Egypt Business Council, which is part of the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''But to secure what they really went into Tahrir Square for, there needs to be economic growth, a modern set of thinking, and a more diversified economy.''
Ms. Mehairy wants to seize the moment, and she and Zeinab Samir, the co-founder of SuperMama, have been on the move.
In June, the pair applied for a spot at the NextGen IT Boot Camp, which took place in Cairo in late June. The program was sponsored by the Global Entrepreneurship Program, a collaboration between the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development.
During the five-day program, which was also sponsored by the Danish and Egyptian governments, six American entrepreneurs -- including Jeff Hoffman, co-founder of Priceline.com; Ryan Allis, chief executive of the marketing site iContact; Shama Kabani, chief operating officer of Marketing Zen; and Scott Gerber, founder of the Young Entrepreneur Council -- helped 38 Egyptian entrepreneurs hone their business plans. On the last day, four winning teams were chosen. Two will go to North Carolina this fall for a three-week internship at iContact, and two will attend a three-month training program in Denmark. (Ms. Mehairy and Ms. Samir will be heading to Denmark.)
Most of the entrepreneurs in the program are well educated, have jobs, and are from middle- and upper-middle class families. But they still face much uncertainty.
''Everyone is worried about what will happen next,'' said Marwan Roushdy, 20, a student at the American University of Cairo who is developing an app called Inkezny to locate hospitals anywhere in the world. The name means ''rescue me'' in Arabic.
Despite the political situation, Mr. Roushdy, who participated in the boot camp and won an internship at iContact, is working on his app. He is trying to block out his worries about the future and focus on his business. After all, what else can he do?
''Part of being an entrepreneur is being an optimist,'' says Steven R. Koltai, senior adviser for Global Entrepreneurship at the State Department, who has visited Egypt a dozen times in the last year. ''Entrepreneurs are like the crab grass that grows up in the city: they are going to make it through the cracks in the sidewalk.''
Still, these young entrepreneurs eventually will have to navigate the bureaucratic hurdles of registering their company with the Egyptian government, a notoriously difficult step that Ms. Mehairy says she won't take until a client or business partner insists.
''The paperwork is a nightmare,'' she said. ''And in the past, prerevolution, you needed bribery to get your paperwork through.''
Ms. Mehairy has heard some encouraging stories, however. ''My friend finished the registration for his company in a day and half,'' she says, ''because the person handling it was 'all fueled up with the values of the revolution,' as we say.''
Mohamed Rafea, 30, and his cousin Ali Rafea, 23, are also optimistic. They along with three other young relatives co-founded Bey2ollak, an app that lets users warn each other about congested traffic routes. ''We are lucky that we don't need the support of anything except good wattage, as opposed to manufacturing goods or opening a store. Those kinds of businesses need the support of the government,'' Ali Rafea explained.
In a city where commutes can average two hours each way, their app found an instant audience. As of this month, it had more than 50,000 subscribers and a strategic marketing and advertising partnership with Vodafone, one of the largest mobile phone operators in Egypt.
Like many in their cohort, Mohammed and Ali Rafea, who won one of the internships at iContact, are trying to solve some of Egypt's problems through technology -- and hope to turn a profit in the process. After the revolution, they said, Egyptians were turning to Bey2ollak to pass along information about the safety of the roads. ''We added a new status to say that a road is a danger zone and there are protests and thugs,'' Mohamed Rafea said.
Mr. Roushdy is trying to solve another problem with his app -- unreliable medical services. ''In Egypt, even if you dial the emergency number 123, it is not always a guarantee that an ambulance will come,'' Mr. Roushdy explained. ''So I thought an app that showed the nearest hospital and phone number would be a useful service.''
For some of the six American entrepreneurs who visited Cairo in June, it came as a surprise that there was such a vibrant start-up community in Egypt.
''Reading the newspapers and seeing the news, the observation coming in was that there really wasn't a culture of entrepreneurship here,'' said Kevin Langley, who was part of the American delegation and is global chairman of the Entrepreneurs' Organization, a network of business owners.
The goal of the Global Entrepreneurship Program is pragmatic, explained Mr. Koltai, who came up with the idea for it.
''The point is to create jobs,'' he said. ''Jobs are the single most important underpinning for civil society and economic growth, and that is true whether you are in Ohio or Egypt, and the biggest driver of job growth is entrepreneurship.''
Egypt is certainly no stranger to the relationship between civil unrest and joblessness. Youth unemployment, which still hovers in the double digits but is more of an issue for those without a college degree, was one of the underlying forces that led to the revolution.
FOR some of the Web entrepreneurs, there are already some success stories. In January, through a delegation organized by the Global Entrepreneurship Program, a group of United States investors and entrepreneurs traveled to Cairo to meet with Egyptian entrepreneurs. During that visit, organizations like the Chamber of Commerce, the American University in Cairo and Sawari Ventures, a Cairo-based venture capital firm, hosted a business plan competition that awarded two companies $20,000. One of the winners was Kngine, a search engine, which was started by two brothers, Ashraf el-Fadeel, 30, and Haytham el-Fadeel, 23.
The competition helped persuade Ahmed el-Alfi, the founder Sawari Ventures, to bankroll Kngine. He had connected with the founders on Twitter.
''Having eight outside people look at the company, and the fact that they won, helped with my decision,'' Mr. Alfi said. Kngine now has 12 employees. The company recently met with a number of investors in Silicon Valley. For investors, there is certainly a case to be made to look at this new crop of companies: there's an opportunity to get in early in a much less saturated Internet market because only a third of Egyptians use the Internet at home, according to the Ministry of Information and Technology. In other words, these young entrepreneurs have the first mover advantage in spaces that are already crowded in other parts of the world.
Seeing the potential in Egypt, Mr. Alfi left Southern California in 2006 to move to Cairo. ''Most of my friends questioned my sanity for making that move,'' Mr. Alfi said. ''But I was very encouraged by what I saw.''
At SuperMama, Ms. Mehairy and Ms. Samir, 29, who financed their venture with personal savings, are positioning themselves to be one of the first Arab-language Web sites focused on mothers. The site, plus a smartphone application, is to be introduced in September, and will offer information on child care, pregnancy, nutrition, cooking and health. They are hoping to capitalize on the fact that women make up almost half of Internet users in Egypt.
Those in the entrepreneurial trenches are certainly aware of the challenges to being on the forefront of a movement. The lexicon has not even caught up with the times yet. ''We went to a training camp and they were calling us 'businessmen.' We are not businessmen, we are entrepreneurs,'' Ms. Mehairy said.
The hope is that with a little money and a lot of hard work, Egypt could leverage its huge population of young people -- over half the population is under 29 -- and a strong pool of technical talent. Low start-up costs for Internet businesses could turn Egypt into one of the region's entrepreneurial hot spots.
That is the dream, anyway. But Mr. Allis, the co-founder of iContact and an investor in East African tech companies, said he was encouraged by what he saw in Cairo.
''These entrepreneurs are thinking big and globally, and they are creating Web apps that you could see in Dumbo or Palo Alto,'' he said, referring to the neighborhood in Brooklyn. ''They are building companies and products that can be very influential. I would invest 30, 40 or 50 thousand dollars in these young entrepreneurs.''
And, actually, he will buy into these ventures.
At the end of the boot camp, the six American entrepreneurs and one member of the Danish delegation decided to create a $125,000 fund of their own money to invest in Egyptian tech companies.
As Mr. Gerber, one of the American delegates, put it: ''We were just so amazed by the business acumen we found in Egypt.''

HEADLINE: Battle Over Charter Schools Shifting to Affluent Suburbs

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
MILLBURN, N.J. -- Matthew Stewart believes there is a place for charter schools. Just not in his schoolyard.
Mr. Stewart, a stay-at-home father of three boys, moved to this wealthy township, about 20 miles from Midtown Manhattan, three years ago, filling his life with class activities and soccer practices. But in recent months, he has traded play dates for protests, enlisting more than 200 families in a campaign to block two Mandarin-immersion charter schools from opening in the area.
The group, Millburn Parents Against Charter Schools, argues that the schools would siphon money from its children's education for unnecessarily specialized programs. The schools, to be based in nearby Maplewood and Livingston, would draw students and resources from Millburn and other area districts.
''I'm in favor of a quality education for everyone,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''In suburban areas like Millburn, there's no evidence whatsoever that the local school district is not doing its job. So what's the rationale for a charter school?'' 
Suburbs like Millburn, renowned for educational excellence, have become hotbeds in the nation's charter school battles, raising fundamental questions about the goals of a movement that began 20 years ago in Minnesota.
Charter schools, which are publicly financed but independently operated, have mostly been promoted as a way to give poor children an alternative to underperforming urban schools -- to provide options akin to what those who can afford them have in the suburbs or in private schools.
Now, educators and entrepreneurs are trying to bring the same principles of choice to places where schools generally succeed, typically by creating programs, called ''boutique charters'' by detractors like Mr. Stewart, with intensive instruction in a particular area.
In Montgomery County, Md., north of Washington, the school board is moving toward its first charter, a Montessori elementary school, after initially rejecting it and two others with global and environmental themes because, as one official said, ''we have a very high bar in terms of performance.''
Imagine Schools, a large charter school operator, has held meetings in Loudoun County, Va., west of Washington, to gauge parental interest in charters marketed partly as an alternative to overcrowded schools.
In Illinois, where 103 of the current 116 charter schools are in Chicago, an Evanston school board committee is considering opening the district's first charter school.
More than half of Americans live in suburbs, and about 1 in 5 of the 4,951 existing charter schools were located there in 2010, federal statistics show. Advocates say many proposed suburban charters have struggled because of a double standard that suggests charters are fine for poor urban areas, but are not needed in well-off neighborhoods.
''I think it has to do with comfort level and assumptions based on real estate and not reality,'' said Jeanne Allen, president of the Center for Education Reform in Washington, which studies and supports charter schools. ''The houses are nice, people have money, and therefore the schools must be good.''
Ashley Del Sole, a founding member of one of the rejected charters in Montgomery County, said that regardless of how well a district performed, children benefited from choice because not everyone learned the same way. She added that competitive pressure would invigorate schools that had grown complacent.
''There's sort of this notion that if it's not broken, why fix it,'' Ms. Del Sole said. ''But there are people who are not being served.''
With high test scores and graduation rates to flash around, suburban school officials have had an easier time than their urban counterparts arguing that charters are an unnecessary drain on their budgets. In some states, including Virginia, where only local school boards authorize charters, suburban boards have all but kept them out.
''It's like you're Burger King and you have to go to McDonald's to get a license -- in most cases you won't get a friendly reception,'' said Roy Gamse, executive vice president of Imagine Schools.
District school boards in Georgia have rejected so many charters that lawmakers created a commission that approved 16 schools over local objections. But after several boards sued, the law was overturned in May, leaving in question the fate of some of those schools.
In New Jersey, where the State Education Department approves charters, school boards and parents have been fighting a proposed school in another suburb, Montclair, north of Millburn, and another Mandarin-immersion school in the Princeton area that was approved last year but has yet to open. Statewide, 15 of 73 charter schools are in the suburbs.
The latest battle, over Hua Mei and Hanyu International -- which would start in 2012 with 200 kindergarten through second-grade students drawn from Millburn, Maplewood, Livingston, South Orange, West Orange and Union -- has divided neighbors and has spurred calls for legislation to require voter approval to open charters.
Jutta Gassner-Snyder, Hua Mei's lead applicant, said some of the school's 12 founders had received threatening e-mails.
''This is not just about the education of my child,'' said Ms. Gassner-Snyder, who sends her daughter, Kayla, 4, to a private Mandarin-immersion preschool. ''If we just sit back and let school districts decide what they want to do without taking into account global economic trends, as a nation, we all lose.''
Millburn's superintendent, James Crisfield, said he was caught off guard by the plan for charters because ''most of us thought of it as another idea to help students in districts where achievement is not what it should be.'' He said the district could lose $270,000 -- or $13,500 for each of 20 charter students -- and that would most likely increase as the schools added a grade each year.
''We don't have enough money to run the schools as it is,'' Mr. Crisfield said, adding that the district eliminated 18 positions and reduced bus services this year.
Millburn offers Mandarin only in high school, fueling the arguments of those seeking the new charters. ''Kids are like sponges,'' said Yanbin Ma, a Hanyu founder. ''There are so many things they can absorb and become good at, and I feel that our public schools haven't done enough to take advantage of that.''
But to Mr. Stewart, a leader in a growing opposition that includes Livingston mothers who have helped collect more than 800 petition signatures, this sounds ''selfish.''
''Public education is basically a social contract -- we all pool our money, so I don't think I should be able to custom-design it to my needs,'' he said, noting that he pays $15,000 a year in property taxes. ''With these charter schools, people are trying to say, 'I want a custom-tailored education for my children, and I want you, as my neighbor, to pay for it.' ''

9 P.M. (13, 49) ZEN Rufus Sewell, above, stars as Detective Aurelio Zen, an honest cop in modern-day Italy whose superiors are on the side of the lawbreakers in this ''Masterpiece Mystery!'' adaptation of the novels by Michael Dibdin. In ''Vendetta,'' the first of three installments, a frazzled Zen, 40 years old, separated from his wife and living with his mother, finds himself ducking a killer on a rampage against those he believed wrongly imprisoned him, while grappling with a politically charged murder -- never mind the affections of his office mate Tania Moretti (Caterina Murino). ''There is nothing of the morose in this trilogy, which makes it a welcome antidote to the craze for the grimness and melancholy of the unstoppably popular Scandinavian crime genre,'' Ginia Bellafante wrote of the series in The New York Times. ''The films deploy a light comic sensibility and graphics that suggest a '60s caper. 
They situate us in a Rome where the weather always seems heavenly, blouses are always unbuttoned suggestively, and no lunch transpires without multiple courses and repeated instances of sexual innuendo. Risotto is eaten; cigarettes are smoked; espresso is consumed; public displays of lust are evident. There is little resistance to cliche in all this, but the cliche is so visually appealing that you'll feel like a spoiled child if you complain. And you're given such a treat that you'll also feel like one, begging for more.''

HEADLINE: Time to Pull Up Stakes

BYLINE: By JOYCE COHEN

 BODY:
NOT all that long ago, rental prices were low enough for Jeni Aron to afford an alcove studio in a luxury doorman building, Hudson Crossing, on Ninth Avenue and 37th Street. She enjoyed a nicely furnished lobby, a landscaped patio, a storage room for her bicycle and a 24-hour gym that she used early in the morning.
She had never before lived in a place so nice.
''It was my first big-girl apartment,'' said Ms. Aron, who is now 35. Two years ago, she signed on for $1,801 a month. At the time, ''I was able to get a steal, not in my mind but in the market's mind,'' she said. 
The building compensated for the neighborhood, southwest of the Port Authority bus terminal and near the Lincoln Tunnel ramp. ''It didn't feel like a fully formed neighborhood,'' Ms. Aron said. ''It was bare bones in terms of amenities,'' with few shops and services, but plenty of traffic.
When the one-year lease expired, she negotiated another one, this time for $1,880 a month.
This past spring, a renewal lease was slipped beneath her door. Her new rent would be $2,266 a month. ''I was floored when I saw it,'' Ms. Aron said. ''I really thought I was going to do a whole Norma Rae situation and fight the man.'' But in a tighter rental market, her landlord was not interested in negotiation. She learned that, in a market-rate rental like hers, there was no limit to the amount the rent could rise.
''I could not physically write that check every month for $2,266,'' she said. So she chose to hunt for a more affordable place in Brooklyn.
Ms. Aron, who comes from Long Island, had a history of moving. After graduating from Emerson College in Boston, she shared a co-op in Park Slope, but her roommate, who was unemployed and divorcing, soon sold the place. Unsettled, Ms. Aron moved to Brooklyn Heights, becoming one of three roommates. That's where she was living in 2003, when she started her organizing business, Clutter Cowgirl(cluttercowgirl.com). ''Decluttering is like weight management,'' she said. ''You have to keep up with it every day.''
Needing cheaper rent, she moved to Union City, N.J., paying $350 a month. She had a male roommate who used her towels and wandered into her room when she was away. ''I felt like I was serving time,'' Ms. Aron said. Then it was on to Midtown and an apartment that had roaches and a sound track of galloping horses, thanks to the upstairs neighbor's treadmill. Her move to Hudson Crossing was ''a drastic upgrade,'' she said.
Her next apartment might not be so nice, but at least she could live in her favorite neighborhood, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. ''I missed going home to somewhere, as opposed to just walking past the Port Authority,'' she said. From Cobble Hill, the commute to Midtown, where she works in the research department of Showtime, would be relatively quick. (Ms. Aron serves her cluttered clientele evenings and weekends, and also occasionally does standup comedy.) She hoped to find a one-bedroom costing no more than $1,900.
In April, she read an article in Time Out New York about a couple who had a small but classic one-bedroom in Cobble Hill. Their rent, when they signed the lease last fall, was $1,450 a month. Ms. Aron put down the magazine and contacted their agent, Margaret Ragosta of Joan Natale Real Estate, in Carroll Gardens.
Ms. Ragosta showed her the one suitable Cobble Hill place she had: a one-bedroom for $1,800 on Wyckoff Street near the F train.
''It was very Brooklyn,'' Ms. Aron said, with a classic interior and an astonishing three closets. As the clutter cowgirl, she could get by without them -- she advocates hanging things on walls and doors -- but she of course appreciated what she calls the ''luxury'' of great closet space.
Still, she said: ''I needed to see what else in the price range was available. I couldn't compare everything I saw to my doorman building. I knew I couldn't. I had to wash that away.''
Ms. Ragosta told her to take her time deciding. ''I don't push anybody,'' she said. ''I told her to go and look, make sure this is what you want. I don't want you to come back and say: I don't know, I'm not sure.''
Another agent showed Ms. Aron a three-unit building on Carroll Street. But the one-bedroom, for $1,850, did not appeal to a clutterphobe. People's belongings -- ''an entire shoe collection,'' she said -- lined the stairs.
A $1,650 studio in a 10-unit building on Clinton Street in Brooklyn Heights was on the ground level and was dark. The outgoing tenant was there, and ''I didn't feel I could look around,'' Ms. Aron said. ''You want to open closets and ask questions, and he was sitting there playing online poker.''
She knew the first place would go quickly -- possibly within hours. It had everything she needed. ''I was not in the mood to do an enormous, comprehensive search,'' she said. ''I wanted to find something, lock it down and move on with my life.''
So she contacted Ms. Ragosta and was able to negotiate a rent of $1,700 a month. The broker's fee was nearly $3,000.
Ms. Aron arrived in mid-May. For the first time, she had a big-girl move. It was well worth the price, she said, to use hired movers instead of friends.
Her new home is large enough that she has not needed to employ all of her organizing techniques. Her walk-in closet includes shelves all the way to the ceiling.
She has had a few maintenance problems -- some roaches, a broken buzzer, suds backing up into the bathroom drain. ''I was used to having a whole team of maintenance people,'' she said. ''If there was one little thing wrong, they would fix it within an hour.'' Still, she prefers having a mom-and-pop landlord rather than an impersonal management company. ''I feel more protected,'' she said. ''I feel they know me.''
For the price, she doesn't mind putting up with such small hassles. And the neighborhood is as nice as she expected. She grabs tea from Dunkin' Donuts before work and, despite having laundry facilities in her building's basement, drops her laundry off. ''It is more convenient to outsource it,'' she said. ''Every amenity I want is here.''

HEADLINE: At Two-Year Colleges, Less Scrutiny Equals Less Athletic Equality

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
Los Angeles Southwest College has a new athletic field house and football stadium, but almost no female athletes.
Women make up more than two-thirds of students at this community college in the city's South Central neighborhood, but less than a quarter of its athletes. The college's decision to suspend the track team this year left women who wanted to play a sport with a single option: basketball.
Henry Washington, the college's athletic director and head football coach, acknowledges that his program is most likely violating federal law by failing to offer enough roster spots to women. But he said many of the female students are also juggling jobs and child care, and do not have time to play sports. Then there is the question of money. ''I just keep my fingers crossed that we can keep what we have,'' he said.
Pensacola State College in Florida has suffered through its share of budget cuts, and athletic officials have long faced the thorny question of how much interest there is at a college that devotes an entire campus to health sciences programs, where students tend to be older, overwhelmingly female and, supposedly, less eager to play sports. 
But there is no shortage of women playing sports at Pensacola. The college invests about $1 million a year in the athletics program, and coaches scour the state and beyond for talented female players. The women's basketball team won the state championship this year.
Bill Hamilton, the Pensacola athletic director, said his success had not come without struggle. But abiding by the law is a priority. ''We don't do things around here because it's easy,'' he said. ''We do things because it's right.''
The situation at Los Angeles Southwest, without question, more closely represents the norm among community colleges around the country. Even as they play an increasingly vital role in American higher education -- enrolling more than eight million students nationwide last fall, a 20 percent jump since the fall of 2007, just before the start of the recession -- community colleges are routinely failing to provide enough athletic opportunities to women, as required under Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in education. Many community colleges offer an array of options for men but just a single team for women. And dozens of colleges over the years had no women on their athletic rosters, according to federal education statistics.
No one disputes that community colleges face distinct challenges, with a lack of money paramount. But Pensacola, one of the rare exceptions among community colleges, offers evidence that the demands of the law can be met.
In many ways, Los Angeles Southwest's struggles -- and Pensacola's success -- echo the conversations that took place decades ago at elite four-year colleges and major public universities.
''People who say they can't find students who are interested or they can't recruit, it sounds very much like what I heard 30 years ago, 40 years ago in the 1970s,'' said Carol Kashow, the athletic director at Hostos Community College in the Bronx. ''That's the reason for Title IX, so there can't be an excuse to not give opportunities.''
But community colleges have rarely been scrutinized. That may change as an influx of recent high school graduates have entered community colleges, seeing them as an affordable alternative to four-year universities. This shift in the student body -- already majority female -- could lead to heightened demands from students who could well expect and even legally demand the opportunity to participate in sports.
''While some of our states and regions have seen the handwriting on the wall, many are still sitting in the dark,'' Karen Sykes, a former president of the National Junior College Athletic Association, warned officials at a meeting several years ago. Sykes said ''it was only a matter of time'' before community colleges would come under scrutiny for their shortcomings.
Because community colleges have a mandate to educate all comers, they have a special obligation to offer women a legitimate shot at playing sports, said Jaime Lester, an assistant professor at George Mason University who has studied gender issues at community colleges. ''It's crucial to hold these democratic institutions -- these bastions of people's colleges -- up to that level of scrutiny,'' Lester said. ''If we don't hold them up, why should we hold anyone else up?''
Nontraditional Students
Henry Washington has served as athletic director at Los Angeles Southwest College for 27 years, and each year, he said, women's basketball faces the same challenge: the team starts out with a roster of 12 players only to dwindle to five or six by the end of the season.
''Sometimes they're not motivated, they may have a child,'' he said. ''There are all kinds of obstacles that are getting in the way of trying to even keep teams.''
It is a common refrain among athletic directors at community colleges: women, they say, do not sign up for sports. While the economic recession has expanded the pool of traditional-age students, men and women who attend community colleges do not fit the typical mold of student-athletes. They tend to be older, and almost half of all community college students work more than 25 hours a week, according to federal education statistics.
But federal statistics show few differences between the men and women who attend these colleges: the men work, too, and tend not to be any younger.
And yet the men, despite similar hardships or responsibilities, still manage to play sports in significant numbers.
Those who lament the lack of athletic options for women at community colleges note that women are losing out on something that is more than some idealistic abstraction. A growing body of research has shown that participating in athletics can have a positive effect on health and self-esteem as well as academics and one's professional career, benefits as valuable to community college students as to those at more affluent four-year colleges.
Sykes, the former junior college athletic association president, questioned whether some members were making a genuine effort. Some community colleges ''were willing to make a halfhearted effort and then willing to accept the consequences,'' she said.
Some argue that community colleges should do more to market their athletic programs to their demographic, either by rearranging practice schedules or by offering sports, such as bowling, golf or tennis, that might appeal to older students.
''If institutions and community colleges wanted to really provide those opportunities to women, and if there was some value in that from their perspective, they would find a way to do it,'' said Frank Harris III, an assistant professor at San Diego State University.
Even Washington, the Los Angeles Southwest athletic director, said he did not accept the excuse that women at his college and others like it were not interested in sports. ''One thing I did learn is that if you hire a woman full time to recruit women,'' he said, ''then the outcome would probably be a little different.''
But because of his college's financial situation, he said, all of his coaches work part time.
Washington said surveys of local high schools have shown that potential students are interested in playing women's soccer and softball, but that his plan to add softball had been delayed by budget troubles. California has cut nearly $400 million in aid to community colleges over the past two years, and recently cut another $400 million in financing for the next academic year. The reductions led Los Angeles Southwest to cancel 200 classes over the past two years.
Jack E. Daniels III, the president of Los Angeles Southwest, said he was aware of the need to add women's teams. But the college's financial situation is so dire, he is considering eliminating the entire athletic program, which currently costs about $300,000 a year.
''Right now, it's probably a 50-50 proposition,'' Daniels said. The new field house and football stadium were built using bonds approved by voters several years ago, when the economy was flush and ''there was no indication of any financial downturn,'' he said.
Community colleges indisputably have struggled in recent years as they deal with the dual challenges of increased enrollment and cuts by state legislatures. But critics note that the colleges' problems predate the economic downturn.
''Before the downfall, everybody had lots of money and lots of students,'' said Diane Milutinovich, who has filed several federal complaints against community colleges alleging violations of Title IX. ''Why didn't they do the right thing then? Now, when times are tough, it's the women who are bearing the brunt.''
Finding a Balance
In many ways, Pensacola fits the profile of a typical community college. More than 40 changed according to correction by president Meadows/ktpercent of its students receive federal student aid, most have jobs outside school, and many of the college's female students are single parents, said Ed Meadows, the president of the college. And like other community colleges, Pensacola has struggled in the economic downturn. Its budget has been cut about 18 percent over the past three years because of decreases in state financing.
''It's tough,'' Hamilton, the athletic director, said, adding, ''We're losing some positions and tightening our belts.''
Still, Pensacola has found a way to preserve sports programs, and women at the moment make up some 56 percent of the college's athletes.
The athletic budget of $1 million, for example, pays for men's and women's basketball teams as well as baseball, softball and women's volleyball. Many athletes receive scholarships for tuition and books. Some are given housing and stipends for meals.
Hamilton's coaches visit tournaments across the country, attend camps at four-year colleges and pore over scouting reports. Filling female rosters ''isn't something we do by luck, it's by design,'' Hamilton said.
Brenda Pena, the softball coach, sent her assistant to Colorado in June to recruit at a tournament that drew more than 100 teams nationwide. Although her team finished last in its conference this year, she said, Pensacola has a reputation for fielding strong teams and for helping its students transfer to four-year colleges. As a result, Pena said, she is able to avoid the obstacle of attracting players from an older, less engaged student body by instead recruiting students straight from high school.
''We have plenty of people,'' she said. ''We have girls that are dying to play.''
In addition to being bound by Title IX, a Florida law holds all public schools to a high standard of providing equal opportunities to men and women, and the issue is closely monitored by the state community college system, Hamilton and other athletic officials said. ''My president wants to know when he goes home tonight that athletics won't be a problem,'' Hamilton said. ''That's the rules, and we play by the rules.''
Still, Hamilton is not necessarily a fan of Title IX. He blames the law for the elimination of the men's golf team in the 1990s, because one way of complying is showing that the percentage of female athletes is proportionate to the women's share of the student body. Even today, Hamilton said, he must keep the rosters of men's teams small because women make up more than half of Pensacola's enrollment.
But despite his misgivings about the application of the law, he said colleges must provide opportunities to women if they hope to fulfill their mission to educate students through participation in sports. That is especially true at community colleges, he said.
''The kids down here, they are trying to crawl up on that first ledge of success in society's eyes,'' Hamilton said. ''The more people of either gender that you can get into athletics, I think you help society tremendously.''
Gender Games: This series is examining how colleges have approached compliance with Title IX since 1972 and the obstacles to enforcing the law. Previous articles have focused on deceptive tactics, the effect on men's sports, and cheerleading.

THE BIG ROADS
The Untold Story of the Engineers, Visionaries, and Trailblazers Who Created the American Superhighways
By Earl Swift
Illustrated. 375 pp.Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $27.
When ''On the Road'' was published, in 1957, it may have seemed a rousing dawn chorus for an awakening generation of postwar seekers, but it was also an encomium of sorts -- for the year before, construction had begun on the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. ''You can't do what I did anymore,'' Kerouac would later say. And as noted in ''Why Kerouac Matters,'' by the New York Times reporter John Leland, even as Kerouac was writing, the author glimpsed that his kind of rambling ''may soon be obsolete as America enters its High Civilization period and no one will get sentimental or poetic anymore about trains and dew on fences at dawn in Missouri.'' 
In place of poetry we had standardized efficiency, not just the new Esperanto of green highway signs speaking to us at 65-mile-per-hour Highway Gothic -- the same tongue from Maine to Montana -- but the whole experience of travel itself. ''With the modern car on the modern freeway,'' Earl Swift writes in ''The Big Roads,'' ''the modern traveler was left with practically nothing to celebrate but the ever-briefer time he had to devote to getting from one place to another.'' Or, in John Steinbeck's famous remark, one could now drive from ''New York to California without seeing a single thing.''
Swift, a former journalist with The Virginian-Pilot and the author of ''Where They Lay: Searching for America's Lost Soldiers,'' among other books, knows the feeling. ''Big Roads'' begins, appropriately, with a cross-country road trip, Swift at the wheel, his young daughter and one of her friends in tow. Later, flipping through digital pictures from the journey, Swift finds he has images mostly from days he didn't travel on the Interstate. Whole states had been relegated to vague blurs of asphalt. ''The minivan's windshield became a proscenium through which we watched the countryside pass without actually experiencing it; we were in it, but not of it.'' Yet Swift had made the bargain we all do: the Interstate highways ''carried us without incident, without drama. They offered up food and lodging with minimal fuss. They carved the shortest path all the way home.'' And, most important, ''we made very good time.''
Even if, as the highway era dawned, Sal Paradise was somewhere weeping into his beer, for most people, the new promise of the Interstate System was more than fine. The word ''travel,'' after all, comes from the Old French travaillier -- to labor, or suffer -- and drivers were happy to trade the longueurs of the road for something fast, safe and predictable. Out went the hit-or-miss ''Kumfy Kabins'' of ''Lolita,'' with their implied seediness; in came the Holiday Inn chain, nationally franchised, as it happens, the same year ''On the Road'' was published. (By 1968, Swift notes, there were a thousand Holiday Inns, half found no farther than the end of an exit ramp.)
One must remember what it used to mean to drive in the United States. Before the Interstate knitted together the country, before it became a metaphor for the nation's collective mobility for intellectuals homegrown and imported (''this sense of space and thus of time passing,'' writes Bernard-Henri Levy, traveling Interstate 94, ''which is the real sixth sense one has to acquire when traveling in America''), America's roads were, as Swift notes, an ''anarchic jumble.'' Improvements meant grading dirt tracks, way-finding was a fiction, and a State Department report, circa 1916, judged road conditions here ''far worse than any other major nation except Russia and China.''
And although it wasn't until the eve of the Sputnik launch that the system we know today actually began to take shape, it was, as Swift argues, a long time coming. The system enabled by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 simply codified a network with Jazz Age contours. The 1921 Federal Highway Act, Swift writes, ''remains the single most important piece of legislation in the creation of a national network -- far more so than the later Inter/state highway bill.'' The highway future was sold in spectacles like Norman Bel Geddes's Futurama exhibit at the 1939 World's Fair, the smoke-and-mirrors nature of which was suggested by another Bel Geddes exhibit, a bit of reflective wizardry in which ''a single dancing girl appears to be a whole chorus of World's Fairettes.'' But well before 1956, any number of issues needed settling, including, Swift notes, the question of whether ''to build a national system of highways or a system of national highways.'' This was not merely a semantic difference; as one highway promoter said, ''the highways of America are built chiefly of politics.''
It's not easy to write about infrastructure: how does one bring to life vast, many-tentacled, technically abstruse and almost unknowable systems, particularly those, like the Interstate, that took decades to build? Swift, though he occasionally delves into the wonders of macadam, wisely swaps bitumen for biography, building his narrative around, essentially, a triumvirate of men who at different periods were central to the highways' creation. Carved into this Mount Rushmore of mobility are Carl Fisher, an Indianan who helped make the Lincoln Highway a ''real road,'' as its sponsors boasted, that would ''permit a traveler to average 20 miles per hour''; Thomas MacDonald, an intense engineer from Iowa who helped devise the nation's proto national highway system; and, most prominent, Frank Turner, an engineer from Texas who tamed Alaska before overseeing the Interstate program.
Writing about the people who build infra/structure can have its own chal/lenges. Turner, for example, was a shy Baptist teetotaler, a man who, on a trip to the Taj Mahal, was moved to remark in his diary, ''Road fairly well aligned.'' The highway builders tended to be conservative, ramrod-straight men who, as one wit once put it to me, had the whiff of concrete and polyester about them. But Swift commendably humanizes them, drawing out their polyvalent selves and hinting at their contradictions. In one speech, Turner, a strident mass-transit advocate, linked the 1960s urban opposition to the highway program to wider social unrest and ''the breakup of the home,'' even as his Interstate project was leveling urban neighborhoods -- many of which were quite stable, contrary to the usual depiction.
''The Big Roads'' is not quite the ''untold'' story its subtitle promises: Tom Lewis's ''Divided Highways'' (1997) covers a lot of the politics and development of the Interstate System, Phil Patton's ''Open Road'' (1986) explores its cultural impacts and Matt Dellinger's recent ''Interstate 69'' provides what may be its obituary. Still, Swift has added texture and nuance, as well as narrative economy, to a story containing volumes, and he makes for an ideal travel companion -- engaging, not too didactically chatty.
In the end, the view ahead is not as bright as that in the rearview; where congested roads would once be treated with the short-term inoculation of more lanes, a state highway official says, ''We don't have enough money for that approach anymore.'' Cities now look to tear down urban highways, not build new ones. The road of ''the future,'' as first envisioned in 1912 and brought to fruition decades later, is carrying the usual strains of middle age; the nips and tucks are giving way to full reconstructive surgery, all paid for with a series of maxed-out credit cards (the federal fuel tax hasn't been raised, even to keep pace with inflation, since 1993, and has been increasingly eroded by improvements in fuel economy). The future, it seems, is getting away from us, even as we keep asking, with a plaintive cry from the back seat: ''Are we there yet?''

HEADLINE: Law School Economics: Ka-Ching!

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
WITH apologies to show business, there's no business like the business of law school.
The basic rules of a market economy -- even golden oldies, like a link between supply and demand -- just don't apply.
Legal diplomas have such allure that law schools have been able to jack up tuition four times faster than the soaring cost of college. And many law schools have added students to their incoming classes -- a step that, for them, means almost pure profits -- even during the worst recession in the legal profession's history.
It is one of the academy's open secrets: law schools toss off so much cash they are sometimes required to hand over as much as 30 percent of their revenue to universities, to subsidize less profitable fields.
In short, law schools have the power to raise prices and expand in ways that would make any company drool. And when a business has that power, it is apparently difficult to resist. 
How difficult? For a sense, take a look at the strange case of New York Law School and its dean, Richard A. Matasar. For more than a decade, Mr. Matasar has been one of the legal academy's most dogged and scolding critics, and he has repeatedly urged professors and fellow deans to rethink the basics of the law school business model and put the interests of students first.
''What I've said to people in giving talks like this in the past is, we should be ashamed of ourselves,'' Mr. Matasar said at a 2009 meeting of the Association of American Law Schools. He ended with a challenge: If a law school can't help its students achieve their goals, ''we should shut the damn place down.''
Given his scathing critiques, you might expect that during Mr. Matasar's 11 years as dean, he has reshaped New York Law School to conform with his reformist agenda. But he hasn't. Instead, the school seems to be benefitting from many of legal education's assorted perversities.
N.Y.L.S. is ranked in the bottom third of all law schools in the country, but with tuition and fees now set at $47,800 a year, it charges more than Harvard. It increased the size of the class that arrived in the fall of 2009 by an astounding 30 percent, even as hiring in the legal profession imploded. It reported in the most recent US News & World Report rankings that the median starting salary of its graduates was the same as for those of the best schools in the nation -- even though most of its graduates, in fact, find work at less than half that amount.
Mr. Matasar declined to be interviewed for this article, though he agreed to answer questions e-mailed through a public relations representative.
Asked if there was a contradiction between his stand against expanding class sizes and the growth of the student population at N.Y.L.S., Mr. Matasar wrote: ''The answer is that we exist in a market. When there is demand for education, we, like other law schools, respond.''
This is a story about the law school market, a singular creature of American capitalism, one that is so durable it seems utterly impervious to change. Why? The career of Richard Matasar offers some answers. His long-time and seemingly sincere ambition is to ''radically disrupt our traditional approach to legal education,'' as it says on his N.Y.L.S. Web page. But even he, it seems, is engaged in the same competition for dollars and students that consumes just about everyone with a financial and reputational stake in this business.
''The broken economic model Matasar describes appears to be his own template,'' wrote Brian Z. Tamanaha, a professor at Washington University Law School in St. Louis, in a blog posting about Mr. Matasar last year. ''Are his increasingly vocal criticisms of legal academia an unspoken mea culpa?''
A PRIVATE, stand-alone institution located in the TriBeCa neighborhood of downtown Manhattan, New York Law School was founded in 1891 and counts Justice John Marshall Harlan among its most famous graduates. The school -- which is not to be confused with New York University School of Law -- is housed in a gleaming new 235,000-square-foot building at the corner of West Broadway and Leonard Street.
That building puts N.Y.L.S. in the middle of a nationwide trend: the law school construction boom. As other industries close offices and downsize plants, the manufacturing base behind the doctor of jurisprudence keeps growing. Fordham Law School in New York recently broke ground on a $250 million, 22-story building. The University of Baltimore School of Law and the University of Michigan Law School are both working on buildings that cost more that $100 million. Marquette University Law School in Wisconsin has just finished its own $85 million project. A bunch of other schools have built multimillion dollar additions.
N.Y.L.S. has participated in another national law school trend: the growth in the number of enrollees. Last year, law schools across the country matriculated 49,700 students, according to the Law School Admission Council, the largest number in history, and 7,000 more students than in 2001. N.Y.L.S. grew at an even faster clip. In 2000, the year Mr. Matasar took over, the school had a total of 1,326 full- and-part-time students. By 2009, the figure had risen to 1,596.
The jump seems to contradict one of Mr. Matasar's core tenets.
''Can class size be increased without damaging quality?'' he asked in a 1996 Florida Law Review article. ''Can class size be increased without assurances that jobs will be available for the increased number of graduates? Can class size be increased without also providing more staff, faculty, books and service? Increase class size? No!''
Did Mr. Matasar change his mind? In an e-mail, he cited the unpredictability of yield rates, which is the percent of students who accept an offer of admission. There was more than one year of yield surprises under Mr. Matasar, the largest of which came in 2009, when the incoming class leapt by 171 students.
It was a very profitable surprise, worth about $6.7 million in gross revenue. Mr. Matasar would not discuss the added costs of teaching what became known at the school as ''the bulge class.'' But faculty members, some of whom were offered the chance to take on additional courses, estimate that, at most, the school had to spend about $500,000 more that year on teaching.
This windfall, it turns out, was perfectly timed. Because as all those students were signing up for their first year at N.Y.L.S., a little-noticed drama was unfolding that involved the financing for that brand-new building.
THREE years earlier, in 2006, the school had floated $135 million worth of bonds to finance construction of the new building, at 185 West Broadway. At the time, Moody's rated the bonds A3, placing them squarely in the ''come and get 'em'' category for investors. The rating reflected N.Y.L.S.'s strong balance sheet and the quality of its management, Moody's said.
Equally important, N.Y.L.S. was -- and is -- in a very lucrative business. Like business schools and some high-profile athletic programs, law schools subsidize other fields in universities that can't pay their own way.
''If my president were to say 'We'll never take more than 10 percent of your revenue,' I'd say 'God bless you,' and we'd never have to talk again,'' says Lawrence E. Mitchell, the incoming dean of the Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland. ''But having just come from a two-day meeting of new and current deans organized by the American Bar Association, I can tell you that some law schools pay 25 or even 30 percent.''
Among deans, the money surrendered to the administration is known informally as ''the tax.'' Even in the midst of a merciless legal downturn, the tax still pumps huge sums into universities, in part because the price of a law degree continues to climb.
From 1989 to 2009, when college tuition rose by 71 percent, law school tuition shot up 317 percent.
There are many reasons for this ever-climbing sticker price, but the most bizarre comes courtesy of the highly influential US News rankings. Part of the US News algorithm is a figure called expenditures per student, which is essentially the sum that a school spends on teacher salaries, libraries and other education expenses, divided by the number of students.
Though it accounts for just 9.75 percent of the algorithm, it gives law schools a strong incentive to keep prices high. Forget about looking for cost efficiencies. The more that law schools charge their students, and the more they spend to educate them, the better they fare in the US News rankings.
''I once joked with my dean that there is a certain amount of money that we could drag into the middle of the school's quadrangle and burn,'' said John F. Duffy, a George Washington School of Law professor, ''and when the flames died down, we'd be a Top 10 school. As long as the point of the bonfire was to teach our students. Perhaps what we could teach them is the idiocy in the US News rankings.''
For years, it made economic sense for smart, ambitious 22-year-olds to pay the escalating price for a legal diploma. Law schools have had a monopolist's hold on the keys to corporate lawyerdom, which pays graduates six-figure salaries.
But borrowing $150,000 or more is now a vastly riskier proposition given the scarcity of Big Law jobs. Of course, that scarcity hasn't been priced into the cost of law school. How come? In part, it's because schools have managed to convey the impression that those jobs aren't very scarce.
For instance, although N.Y.L.S. is ranked No. 135 out of the roughly 200 schools in the US News survey, it asserts in figures provided to the publisher that nine months after graduation, the median private-sector salary of alums who graduated in 2009 -- which is the class featured in the most recent US News annual law school issue -- was $160,000. That is exactly the same figure cited by Yale and Harvard, the top law schools in the country.
Mr. Matasar stood by that number, but acknowledged that it did not give a complete picture of the prospects for N.Y.L.S. grads. He noted that the school takes the over-and-above step of posting more granular salary data on its Web site.
''In these materials and in our conversations with students and applicants,'' he wrote, ''we explicitly tell them that most graduates find work in small to medium firms at salaries between $35,000 and $75,000.''
Determining exactly how many graduates make even those relatively modest salaries isn't easy. The information posted online by N.Y.L.S. about the class of 2010 says that only 26 percent of those employed reported their salaries. The nearly 300 students who reported being employed but said nothing about their salaries -- who knows?
Like all other law schools, N.Y.L.S. collects this job information without anyone else looking at the raw data or double checking the math. Which gets to another dimension of the law school business that other companies might envy: a lack of independent auditing, at least when it comes to these crucial employment stats. It's kind of like makers of breakfast cereal reporting the nutrition levels of their products, without worrying that anyone will actually count the calories.
THOUGH astoundingly resilient as businesses, law schools have always had a glaring liability: they generally sell just one product, legal diplomas. This lack of diversification means that if enrollment drops, a school's balance sheet will suffer.
Like all stand-alone institutions, N.Y.L.S. is even more dependent on student tuition than those attached to universities, and Moody's highlighted this fact in its 2006 appraisal of the school's bonds. Under a section about potential ''challenges'' that could lead to a downgrade, Moody's cited ''significant and sustained deterioration of student market position.''
A downgrade would be expensive for the school because it would mark the bonds as riskier, which would force the school to pay higher interest rates in the future.
In May of 2009, a month before the official end of the recession, Moody's issued a new report and suddenly, a downgrade seemed like a real possibility. One problem was that applications to the school for the upcoming class of 2009, Moody's reported, were down 28 percent compared with the volume the year before. The rating agency changed its outlook on the bonds from ''stable'' to ''negative,'' which is bond-speak for ''If current trends continue, a downgrade is coming.''
But just three months later, the enrollment scare was over. In the fall of 2009, the incoming class was N.Y.L.S.'s largest ever -- 736 students. (Only one law school in the country, Thomas M. Cooley in Michigan, matriculated a greater number.)
Some faculty members were happy to enhance their salaries by teaching another course. Others were appalled at what the super-sized class would mean for students.
''At a school like New York Law, which is toward the bottom of the pecking order, it's long been difficult for our students to find high-paying jobs,'' said Randolph N. Jonakait, a professor at N.Y.L.S. and a frequent critic of Mr. Matasar's. ''Adding more than 100 students to an incoming class harms their employments prospects. It's always been tough for our graduates. Now it's tougher.''
Was Mr. Matasar more worried about bond ratings than the fortunes of his new students? Several faculty members said, and he confirmed, that the bonds were part of discussions about the financial health of the school in 2009.
''However,'' Mr. Matasar wrote, ''N.Y.L.S. never promised (nor needed to promise) anyone that it would increase enrollment to meet debt service obligations.'' The size of the 2009 class, he went on, was ''unplanned,'' again referring to a surprise in yield.
But given that interest in graduate school typically spikes during economic slumps, wasn't a sharp rise in yield foreseeable? It was to N.Y.L.S.'s rivals. There are about 40 other schools in what US News has long categorized as its third tier, and the average increase in class size at those schools in 2009 was just 6 percent. (At 10 of those schools, enrollment declined.) That is dwarfed by the 30 percent uptick at N.Y.L.S.
Whether Mr. Matasar had bond ratings in mind at the time, Moody's liked what it saw. In August of 2010, the company issued a new report that included news of the 736-student class, which was described, in the classic understated style of bond reporting, as ''particularly large.'' The Moody's outlook for the N.Y.L.S. bonds changed once again -- this time from negative to stable.
THE incoming class of 2009 won't hit the job market until next year, but if the experience of recent N.Y.L.S. graduates is an indication, many of them are in for a lengthy hunt. Mr. Matasar offered an inventory of N.Y.L.S.'s career services office, which he says includes 15 employees and provides development and mentoring programs and oversees a series of networking events.
There are those, he wrote, ''who rave about the career services office.'' But he added that a recent poll of law schools found that a little more than half of third-year students were unsatisfied with the job search help. ''We have a similar experience,'' he wrote.
Among the unsatisfied is Katherine Greenier, of N.Y.L.S.'s class of 2010. As she neared graduation, she organized an informational meeting for students interested in public-interest law, the kind of get-together she thought the career services office should have offered. To her amazement, a rep from that office showed up, took a seat and asked questions.
''She was asking about the process, like how you go about applying for public-interest fellowships,'' Ms. Greenier says. ''Things that you would have hoped she already knew.''
Ms. Greenier, who wound up with a job at the American Civil Liberties Union in Richmond, Va., ultimately decided that the school had what she called a ''factory feel.''
The size of the incoming class of 2009 only sharpened that conclusion.
''There were people wondering, why did the school take on this many people in a job market this terrible?'' she asked. ''How many of these folks are going to find jobs? And what does it say about the school?''
IN April, Mr. Matasar stood in a lecture hall on the third floor at N.Y.L.S. and delivered the keynote at Future Ed, the third of three conferences about legal education that he'd helped organize, in partnership with Harvard Law School. A few dozen professors and deans were in attendance as he argued for a more student-centric approach to education.
''The focus shifts from us -- we the faculty, we the administration, we the permanent employees of the school -- to those we serve, our students,'' he said. ''Things are seen through a lens that says 'What will this do for the students?' ''
Nearly all the people who have worked with Mr. Matasar say he means what he says about reforming legal education. N.Y.L.S. professors recall meetings where he urged the faculty to be more responsive to students -- to return calls faster, meet more often, whatever would help.
''He put a huge, beautiful student dining area in the top floor of that new building,'' says Tanina Rostain, a former N.Y.L.S. professor, now at Georgetown University Law Center. ''But it doesn't have a faculty lounge. We were a little nonplussed, but it was clear that the students were Rick's priority.''
How does one square that priority with the inexorable rise of N.Y.L.S.'s tuition, its population growth, its eyebrow-arching job data?
The question has puzzled more than a few academics and has produced a variety of theories. Perhaps the most compelling is that as both a crusader and a dean, Mr. Matasar has conflicting, even incompatible missions. The crusader thinks that law school costs too much. The dean has to raise the price of tuition or get murdered in the US News rankings. The crusader worries about the future of all those unemployed graduates. The dean has interest payments to make on a gorgeous new building.
''I'm 100 percent convinced that Matasar believes in his reformist agenda,'' says Paul F. Campos, a professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder School of Law and a Future Ed attendee. ''But all reformers discover that they can't change a system by themselves. And by trying to survive in the current structure, he has ended up participating in the perpetuation of its most indefensible elements.''
The tale of Mr. Matasar's career is not primarily about a gap between words and actions. Rather, it is a measure of how all-consuming competition in the legal academy has become, and how unlikely it is that the system will be reformed from within.
To be clear, there is little about the way N.Y.L.S. operates that is drastically different from other American law schools. What's happened there is, for the most part, standard operating procedure. What sets N.Y.L.S. apart is that it is managed by a man who has criticized many of the standards and much of the procedure.
In fact, Mr. Matasar has been quoted about wanting to upend legal education for so long it is impossible to believe he is doesn't mean it. But he can't act unilaterally. And what industry has ever decided that for the good of its customers, it ought to charge less money, or shrink?
''My salary,'' Mr. Campos said, ''is paid by the current structure, which is in many ways deceptive and unjust to a point that verges on fraud. But as a law professor, I understand that what is good for me is that the structure stay the way it is.''
DECRYING a business and benefitting from it at the same time -- it puts you in a tough spot, Mr. Campos said, and one he speculated is even tougher for a dean. But it is not a spot that Mr. Matasar will be in for much longer.
Several weeks ago, Mr. Matasar sent an e-mail to his faculty stating that he would step down in the next academic year. He was considering a few different job options, he explained, all of them ''outside of legal education.''

HEADLINE: Aliya McLendon, Aaron Horne Jr.

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
Aliya Mariama McLendon and Dr. Aaron Horne Jr. were married Saturday evening at Old St. Mary's Catholic Church in Philadelphia. The Rev. Stephen D. Thorne, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony, with the Rev. Leo M. Griffin, an African Methodist Episcopal minister and an uncle of the bridegroom, taking part. 
The bride, 31, is taking her husband's name. She is an associate at the law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in Washington. She graduated from Florida A&M University, from which she also received an M.B.A. She received a law degree from Columbia.
She is a daughter of Wandra L. McLendon and Jewel McLendon of Philadelphia. The bride's father retired from the Exelon Corporation of Chicago, the utility company. He worked in Philadelphia as a ferrographer, analyzing fluids for evidence of damage to machines. Her mother, also retired, worked in Philadelphia as a director of staffing and classification for civilian human resources for the Navy.
The bridegroom, 34, is a clinical fellow in the cardiology department of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He graduated with honors from the University of Chicago, from which he received a medical degree and an M.B.A. Next month, he is to begin studying for a Master of Health Science in health economics at Johns Hopkins.
He is the son of Myrtle A. Horne and Mr. Horne Sr. of Advance, N.C. The bridegroom's mother retired as a social worker at Evanston Township High School in Evanston, Ill. His father retired as the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Winston-Salem State University. He is the author of ''Brass Music of Black Composers: A Bibliography'' (Greenwood Press, 1996).
The couple met in April 2005 when they were introduced by a mutual friend -- who had promised Dr. Horne he would be meeting his future wife -- at a Columbia Law School event.
At the time, Ms. McLendon was an associate at Sullivan & Cromwell, the New York law firm, and Dr. Horne was an internal medicine resident at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital.
''Aaron had this amazing amount of charisma and charm, and he was one of the most well-dressed men in the room,'' recalled the bride, whose initial conversation with Dr. Horne lasted about an hour.
By the time the night had ended, they had made plans, via text-messaging, to meet for dinner the next night -- in the intensive care unit of Columbia hospital. Dr. Horne treated Ms. McLendon to a Salisbury steak from the hospital's cafeteria.
''She never lets me live that Salisbury steak thing down,'' Dr. Horne said.
Though the food was unimpressive and the choice of location, to say the least, odd, Ms. McLendon happily agreed to a second date, again in the intensive care unit. This time, she treated him -- to cupcakes.
''He was just really great to hang out with,'' she said. ''He hadn't slept at all, but he was still funny and enthusiastic -- he was just somebody I wanted to be around.'' VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

HEADLINE: Chevy Convertibles: He Collected the Full Set

BYLINE: By TUDOR VAN HAMPTON

 BODY:
Ankeny, Iowa
WHAT started with a '57 Chevy has, at last count, turned into 147 Chevys.
It may not be apparent on a walk through Dennis Albaugh's sprawling garage here, but this array of rolling Americana had modest enough beginnings: he wanted Chevrolets from the mid-1950s, when he was a young boy on the family farm.
After buying a '57 Bel Air convertible from a golfing buddy in 1998, Mr. Albaugh's next Chevy purchase was a '58. He then decided to complete the set of the so-called Tri-Five Chevrolets, the models built for 1955, 1956 and 1957.
''I told my wife I was just going to get the tri-series,'' Mr. Albaugh said this month during a tour of his private Chevy collection -- it is open to the public only for fund-raising events -- housed near the unassuming headquarters of his agricultural chemicals business. The office parking lot doubles as the roof of his 28,000-square-foot garage. 
A look down the rows of parked cars inside this Chevy treasury makes it clear that Mr. Albaugh, 61, did not stop with the Tri-Fives, or even the '50s. His quest expanded backward and forward. He hit the muscle cars of the 1960s and the land yachts of the 1970s. He moved into the 1920s, '30s and '40s, and he gathered up the teens.
All the while, Mr. Albaugh focused on convertibles -- a model his father would not let him buy, for safety reasons.
In a span of just 13 years -- most actively in the last five -- Mr. Albaugh has amassed what may be the definitive compilation of open-top Chevrolets.
''He's got a fabulous collection,'' said Murl Randall, 83, a Chevrolet historian and collector from Houghton Lake, Mich., who is known as Pinky. ''It's probably the best assemblage of convertible Chevys in the country.''
True to his instincts as a businessman, Mr. Albaugh set some limits on his acquisitions. The main collection starts with a 1912 Little Four -- the year Chevrolet began making cars -- and ends with a 1975 Caprice, when the company, reacting to new safety regulations, said it would stop making convertibles. (The body style returned later.)
''I thought, if I am going to put a collection together, I'm looking for a stopping point,'' Mr. Albaugh said.
This showcase of six decades of Chevy convertibles includes some duplicates, and it skips 1943-45, when production was diverted to the war effort.
In addition to the main collection, there is a separate set of convertible Corvettes (1953-75) as well as Chevelles (1964-72) and Camaros (1967-69). Specialty vehicles -- Yenko performance models, antique pickups and others -- share the space along with an impressive accumulation of signs, books, sales brochures and other automobilia.
The collection serves as something of an index to the history of Chevrolet, which will celebrate its 100th anniversary this fall. The company was started by William C. Durant, the ousted founder of G.M., who established the Chevrolet Motor Car Company in November 1911 in Flint, Mich., with Louis Chevrolet, the racecar driver; William H. Little; and Edwin Campbell.
In 1912, they began producing cars under the Little nameplate. Powered by a 20-horsepower 4-cylinder engine, the Little roadster sold for $690, galvanizing the Chevrolet brand as an economical choice -- and an aspiring competitor to the mass-produced Ford Model T, which then cost just $575.
''Those cars were gutless wonders, really,'' said Mr. Randall, who sold a Little Four to the Alfred P. Sloan Museum in Flint.
With Chevy's centennial approaching, Littles have gained interest from collectors despite their austere fittings. A Little is currently listed for sale at the Volo Auto Museum in Volo, Ill., for about $42,000.
A walk down the aisles of Mr. Albaugh's collection reveals lesser-known branches of the Chevrolet family tree. For instance, there is an example of Chevy's first V-8, which was introduced in 1917 -- not, as commonly cited, in 1955, when the 265-cubic-inch ''small block'' engine arrived. The 1917 V-8, a crude 288-cubic-inch, 36-horsepower engine, was discontinued the next year.
Most cars built in the early years had soft tops, but by the 1930s the market's preference had flipped to closed bodies. In 1939, Chevrolet did not offer a convertible, at least not in North America. But Mr. Albaugh recently located a rare '39 Standard roadster, made by G.M.'s Holden division in Australia, where the long-neglected car was found.
''We paid $37,000 for it in real tough condition,'' Mr. Albaugh says, noting that the car ''completes my collection.''
Its restoration nearing completion, the '39 will be on display, along with the 1918 V-8, at a Sloan Museum event on July 20 to be held in conjunction with the company's centennial.
For Mr. Albaugh, collecting cars is an investment as much as a hobby, so he prefers to buy cars already restored.
''Bottom line, Dennis is still a businessman,'' said Andy Snetselaar, 49, the collection's caretaker, who has done the restorations on five of the cars.
''If that car is worth $30,000, he's going to hold back,'' he said, explaining the collection's strategy. ''It only makes sense. You don't want to spend $40,000 restoring a car that's only worth $30,000.''
Mr. Albaugh is particular when attending auctions or buying from a private collection. ''We are trying to find a 100-point car if we can,'' he said. ''We literally check out all the serial numbers.''
When an overhaul is needed -- and when he has time -- Mr. Albaugh rebuilds engines himself. Some cars are driven more than others. ''We try to get all of them running once a year,'' he said.
It may come as a surprise that his favorite car in the vast collection is not a convertible but an orange 1969 Camaro coupe built by Yenko, a muscle car tuner shop of the era. The Camaro still has the correct 427-cubic-inch V-8 and 4-speed Muncie transmission.
''It's real rare to find a Yenko with its original engine,'' he said. ''It's real fast, real showy, and every time I take that to a show the crowds are around it.''
While an authentic Yenko Camaro like this can bring more than $300,000 at auction, Mr. Albaugh said he believed that the most valuable of his cars was a 1953 Corvette, one of only 300 made.
''It was very hard to find,'' said Mr. Albaugh, who purchased the roadster in 2008 from a restorer in Indiana for $325,000.
Mr. Albaugh's employees regularly refer to the showroom as a garage or a car barn. Very few call it a museum, though Mr. Albaugh himself did make that slip a few times when we spoke.
''I don't know how you couldn't consider it a museum,'' said Mr. Snetselaar, who added a caveat -- that the collection was private, and few people were granted access. ''They are his toys; it's his hobby,'' he said. ''We don't have full-time staff, we don't sell tickets and we don't have total handicap accessibility.''
Even so, Mr. Albaugh's office receives about a dozen requests a week.
''You know, everyone that comes and looks always has a story to tell me,'' Mr. Albaugh said. ''If there is a downfall, it's the amount of time it takes to show them.''
The museum was built in 2008, when the collection stood at about 60 cars, scattered around Ankeny in various garages and sheds. ''I couldn't enjoy them,'' Mr. Albaugh said.
Today, the garage, which was designed to hold 120 cars, is filled well beyond capacity. It sits on a 19-hole golf course that Mr. Albaugh uses for company outings and charity events, including a car show he is hosting on July 23.
On that day, collectors are invited to park their cars on the fairways. The event is open to all brands.
Even with such extensive holdings of vintage Chevys, Mr. Albaugh has an item or two left on his shopping list.
''I'd like to find a Vega Yenko,'' he said, adding that he also is interested in buying a Futurliner, one of 12 custom buses that G.M. built for its ''Parade of Progress'' road show in the '40s and '50s. One sold at a Scottsdale, Ariz., auction in 2006 for $4.3 million, and another is offered on eBay through July 18.
Space is a problem, however, especially with the Futurliner.
''It wouldn't fit in my car museum.''
The Albaugh collection will be open to the public on July 23 for a fund-raiser to benefit Ankeny High School. The event takes place at Albaugh Inc., 1525 N.E. 36th Street, Ankeny, Iowa 50021. Admission is $10 with free entry to children 12 and under. Entries for the car show are $20. Web site: thealbaughclassic.com.

HEADLINE: Poverty Posse

BYLINE: By DAVID BORNSTEIN. 
David Bornstein is the author of ''How to Change the World'' and the founder of Dowser.org, a Web site focused on social entrepreneurship.

 BODY:
Shortly after Candace Keshwar immigrated from Trinidad to Boston in 2002, her life took a difficult turn. Her dream had been to go to college and have a career where she could help others. But her first daughter was born with cerebral palsy and Keshwar spent the next seven years caring for her at home. She grew isolated. Her husband worked in construction, but jobs were sporadic, and the family relied on government assistance. ''It was a real dark space for me,'' Keshwar said. ''I kept thinking, 'This cannot be my life. I know I have the potential to do so much more.''' 
A turning point came when Keshwar was asked to join a group of families who had self-organized as part of an initiative that helps people in low-income communities achieve their goals. Called the Family Independence Initiative (FII), its approach is radically different from the American social service model. Although it is still quite small - working with a few hundred families - its results are so striking that the White House has taken notice. What FII does is create a structure for families that encourages the sense of control, desire for self-determination, and mutual support that have characterized the collective rise out of poverty for countless communities in American history.FII is not a ''program'' in a traditional sense. It doesn't seek to implement changes, but to elicit them from others. It was launched as a research project by Maurice Lim Miller in Oakland in 2001. Lim Miller, whose mother was an immigrant from Mexico who worked multiple jobs to support her children, had previously spent 22 years building Asian Neighborhood Design, a youth development and job training program, for which he was honored by President Clinton during the 1999 State of the Union address.
Lim Miller had come to believe that the American social welfare system focused too much on poor people's needs and deficits, while overlooking - and even inhibiting - their strengths. A safety net is crucial when people are in crisis, he said. But most poor families are not in free fall. They don't need nets to catch them so much as they need springboards to jump higher. In a conversation with Oakland's mayor Jerry Brown (now California's governor), Brown challenged Lim Miller to try something different and gave him broad scope to be creative.
Lim Miller wanted to see what families would do if they came together in a context that supported their initiative. He began by identifying families in low-income communities who were surviving, but who had ''given up hope'' of aspiring to more. He asked them to pull together six to eight other families. He offered them a challenge. The country had been waging a war on poverty for 40 years, he said, but the problem remained unsolved. ''What we're going to do is give you some resources and connections and we're going to trust that you'll do something,'' he said. ''You guys are in the power position. If you do nothing we'll fail. If you do something we'll all learn.''
They started with 25 families in three cohorts - eight African American families, six Salvadoran refugee families and 11 Iu Mien families from Laos. The latter were all on welfare. FII asked them to write down their goals, gave each a computer and enlisted them to fill in a questionnaire each month that tracked changes in things like income, assets, debts, health, education, skills, social networks and civic engagement.
They offered families $30 for every success they reported up to a maximum of $200 per month. (FII pays for reporting, not for specific actions, a different anti-poverty approach known as ''conditional cash transfers'' that we have reported on in Fixes.) Lim Miller reasoned that if he were to hire a consultant to collect this data, it would cost three or four times more. The families agreed to meet with an FII liaison every three months for an audit. Anything they reported - a pay increase, a doctor visit, an improvement in a child's grades - had to be documented.
Most important, families had to agree to meet as a group at least once a month in a confidential setting to discuss their goals and any issues they deemed important. FII didn't guide the agenda and its liaisons did not act as facilitators. They established the structure and backed off, creating a vacuum for families to take the lead. Lim Miller gave his staff strict instructions that they could not offer any advice - not even friendly suggestions. For some, this proved too difficult; he had to fire people who couldn't help but be helpful. Lim Miller was convinced that the assumption of incapacity behind the helpfulness was a big part of the problem.
''When you come into a community that is vulnerable with professionals with power and preset ideas, it is overpowering to families and it can hold them back,'' he said. ''Nobody wants to hear that because we're all the good guys. But the focus on need undermines our ability to see their strengths - and their ability to see their own strengths.''
At first, families waited for direction from FII. Some grew frustrated. But soon people began sharing their goals, publicly declaring things like: ''I need to get out of debt.'' ''I need to spend more time with my kids.'' ''I need to stop smoking.'' ''I need to get my G.E.D.'' Group members offered encouragement, as well as advice and contacts. In follow up meetings, people would talk about steps they had taken. The group members would hold one another to account: ''Didn't you say you were going to get your G.E.D.? Where are you with that?''
One Salvadoran couple, Jorge and Maria Elena, decided to borrow money from friends and take out a mortgage to purchase a home. It was a predatory loan - and when it became clear that they were in danger of losing the home, friends helped them renovate it and fix up the yard so they could refinance at better terms. Today, the couple are still in the home. Shortly after, other group members - who had historically sent extra money to El Salvador - began saving here, believing that home ownership might be a possibility for them in America. ''That's when we saw how strong the ripple effect was,'' recalled Lim Miller.
Of the initial 25 families, FII found that, after two years, household incomes had increased 27 percent (excluding the payments offered by FII). People got promotions, pay raises, worked extra hours, and built up informal side businesses. After FII's payments stopped, incomes continued to increase. After another year, they were 40 percent higher than the baseline. ''Nobody believed it,'' Lim Miller recalled. ''The stereotype is that they can't do it. People said, 'You have to be creaming [picking the easiest people to help].' They can't believe that this capacity exists and that it can be brought forth.''
He extended the work to Hawaii and San Francisco. After two years, FII reported that incomes across all its sites had increased, on average, by 23 percent and savings were up 240 percent. In San Francisco, 30 percent of families established side businesses - everything from lawn maintenance to making pupusas to cutting people's hair - to cope with the recession. A quarter of the families that had been receiving government income or housing subsidies - CalWorks or Section 8 - dropped them. Families reported improvements in health care, children's grades, reductions in debt, enrollment in training programs and home ownership - all audited. Word rippled outward and within six months, 200 families applied to join FII. ''Something viral had happened,'' explained Mia Birdsong, FII's vice president. ''We still trying to track how it spread. We think it has to do with the trust factor.''
Last year, FII started working in Boston. Within six months, family incomes were up by 13 percent. At her first meeting, Candace Keshwar saw new possibilities for her life. ''There were a bunch of people who had stories that were very similar to mine in terms of the struggles,'' she said. ''But I saw that people were still managing some accomplishments. One girl went to college with her babies. The stories made me realize that I could go after some of the things that I wanted.''
Keshwar's goals were to get a job, buy a car that could accommodate her daughter's wheelchair, enroll in college and buy a home. She found that tracking her progress was helpful in this process. ''When you actually see on paper what you've done, it allows you to think further,'' she said. The networking was also critical. One of her group members helped her re-write her resume. Another arranged an appointment with a friend who offered credit counseling. ''It's much better than having to call an office and get the runaround,'' she said.
Today, Keshwar works as a family partner at Boston Health Care for the Homeless, owns a 2007 Pathfinder, has enrolled in Springfield College and is building a credit history. She is working toward a degree in human services with a concentration in mental health counseling and also plans to pursue a nursing degree. She has also encouraged her husband to get his contractor's license.
Lim Miller is clear that FII is not trying to lend comfort to people who want to dismantle the social service system. He wants to fix it: to make it more about incentives. Today, 85 percent of the $400 billion that the government spends to encourage things like home ownership, college attendance, investment and small business ends up in the pockets of the top 20 percent of earners (and half goes to the top 5 percent). Very little ends up helping the working poor. On the other hand, many social benefits cut off when a family's income rises roughly 30 percent above the poverty line - which is still a far cry from being out of poverty.
For the middle class, resources are linked to initiative; for the poor, they are linked to problems. ''We're not advocating for this gravity defying 'pull yourself up by your bootstraps idea,''' adds Birdsong. ''We're saying: invest in families when they take initiative. We need to take what works for middle and upper income families and extend it to the whole income spectrum.''
FII's budget is only $2.5 million. It is still to be seen if its approach will work with much larger numbers of families. But its experience with a few hundred reveals ways that social services could work better. Lim Miller offers three suggestions as a starter: 1) Where possible, replace case managers with peer families who have succeeded; 2) Make it easier for small scale entrepreneurs to start businesses and raise capital; 3) Solicit regular feedback from the clients. ''These families have opinions about what works and what doesn't work,'' he explains. ''Our system would work better if it responded to their feedback. And it would be very empowering to them if they knew their voices were heard.''
On Wednesday, I'll respond to comments, explain how FII's work draws on the idea of ''positive deviance,'' and explain how the organization plans to expand its reach by tapping the leadership that has emerged within the families in its network.

HEADLINE: Seeing Promise and Peril in Digital Records

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
TECHNICAL standards may seem arcane, but they are often powerful tools of economic development and social welfare. They can be essential building blocks for innovation and new industries. The basic software standards for the Web are striking proof.
Safety is also a potent argument for standards. History abounds with telling examples, like the Baltimore fire of 1904. That inferno blazed for 30 hours, destroying more than 1,500 buildings across 70 city blocks. Fire engines from other cities came to help, but could not. Their hose couplings -- each a different size -- did not fit the Baltimore fire hydrants. Until then, cities saw little reason to adopt a standard size coupling, and local equipment manufacturers did not want competition. So competing interests undermined the usefulness of, and investment in, the technology of the day.
Today, the matter of standards for electronic health records is raising similar concerns, prompting heated debate in recent meetings of representatives from medicine, industry, academia and government. The stakes, they say, could scarcely be higher. They agree that, when well designed and wisely used, digital records can deliver the power of better information to medicine, improving care and curbing costs. But computer forms, they add, can also be difficult to use, cluttered and distracting, causing more harm than good in health care. 
''This is an issue that potentially affects the health and safety of every American,'' says Ben Shneiderman, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland.
The controversy points to the delicate balancing of interests involved when creating technical standards that inherently limit some design choices yet try to keep the door open to innovation. It also raises the question of the appropriate role for government in devising such technology requirements.
At issue is the Obama administration's plan to develop standards to measure how effective and easy digital patient records are to use -- applying a research discipline known as human-computer interaction or human factors. (The International Organization for Standardization, which is based in Geneva, defines the usability of a product by three attributes: ''effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction.'')
The need to improve the usability of computerized records is clearly evident -- and has been for some time. A 2009 study by the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, found that electronic health record systems were often poorly designed, and so could ''increase the chance of error, add to rather than reduce work flow, and compound the frustrations doing the required tasks.''
At a government-sponsored gathering last month, Dr. David Brick, a pediatric cardiologist in New York, demonstrated how it took eight mouse clicks on a digital record to find the patient information presented comfortably on the single sheet of a paper chart. Hearing such complaints, countless times, from doctors and nurses is what prompted the administration to put usability on its policy agenda.
The main users of electronic health records are doctors and nurses. And the uses are tasks like recording a patient's basic information, ordering lab tests, electronically prescribing medications and checking for possibly dangerous drug interactions. For example, taking the blood thinner warfarin (Coumadin) with aspirin, which also inhibits clotting, increases the risk of internal bleeding. The most important early measurement, officials say, will be to ensure that the electronic records are designed to avoid errors, embracing the physician's dictum, ''First, do no harm.''
The administration's initiative takes on particular significance because this year is when the government begins spending billions of dollars to accelerate the adoption of computerized patient records.
The incentive payments, typically as much as $44,000 a physician, begin this year. But those payments require doctors to make ''meaningful use'' of ''certified'' electronic health records. The payments are staggered over five years, and to get the money physicians must use the technology for increasingly extensive record-keeping and reporting. The administration has not said whether a usability standard will be in the next stage of requirements, due by early next year.
The government says it is committed to working with technology companies, medical professionals and academics, to adopt the best approach. Yet common ground has been elusive so far.
At a meeting last month at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md., Janet Campbell, a software developer at Epic Systems, a supplier of electronic health records, expressed the industry's concerns. Doctors are discriminating consumers, she said, and companies like hers work on improving their products in the marketplace every day.
''What's taken as fact is that the industry has failed,'' Ms. Campbell told the audience of health specialists and government officials. ''I'm here to challenge that assumption.''
She added, ''I don't believe that introducing government into this will produce better outcomes.''
Mary Kate Foley, vice president of the user experience at Athenahealth, a health technology company, expressed similar sentiments at the meeting last month.
Later, she explained that she thought the government should confine its efforts to analyzing the methods companies deploy to improve usability, like field studies in doctors' offices. It should monitor and promote industry ''best practices,'' she recommended, but not do comparative measurements of different health record vendors or product features.
''What scares me is design details mandated from on high,'' Ms. Foley said. ''That's going to prevent me from making my electronic health records more usable. It will hurt innovation.''
The administration's health technology officials say they have no intention of dictating what electronic health records should look like, and they say the industry's worries are overstated. ''If we standardize the right things, we can promote innovation rather than stifle it,'' says Dr. Douglas Fridsma, director of health information technology standards in the Department of Health and Human Services.
The industry's stance, some health and computer professionals say, understates the progress made in human factors and human-computer interaction research over decades. They cringed at the summary of a hearing held by a government advisory group in April, which began: ''Usability is in the eyes of the beholder.''
THERE is, to be sure, an element of art to designing the look and feel of computing objects that intuitively please users. Consider the iPad.
But software design specialists point to ample research showing, for example, that changing the size, color and placement of graphic icons on a screen can reduce the time it takes to perform computing tasks. Searching from one digital page after another, they say, devours time and increases the chance of user errors. Each click to another screen to find information is another cognitive excursion, a tax on the brain.
Doctors and nurses, specialists say, work in complex decision-making settings. But a lot of research, they note, has been done on how to improve human performance working in complex systems, including jet plane cockpits, air traffic control towers and nuclear power plant controls. Some of that expertise, they say, can surely be applied to doctors' offices and hospitals.
''There is no doubt about this being measurable and a science,'' says Lana Lowry, who leads the human factors project for health information technology at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. (The institute, a federal agency, is working on usability measurements for the administration.)
What is also beyond doubt is that the promise of digital records will be unfulfilled if doctors refuse to adopt them, because they regard the technology as cumbersome, time-consuming and possibly dangerous.
''Usability is going to be the single greatest impediment to physician acceptance,'' says Dr. Edward H. Shortliffe, a professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston.

HEADLINE: Condos Steal A Page (Or 20) From Co-ops

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
AT first glance, 255 Hudson Street looks like a typical SoHo condominium, with a soaring glass facade, million-dollar listings and a chic designer lobby. But despite having housed entertainment figures like Bethenny Frankel and Kirsten Dunst, this building has more in common with a conservative Park Avenue co-op than a celebrity-friendly downtown high rise.
The condominium, just north of Canal Street, has a 13-page application that requires buyers to provide multiple years of tax returns, bank statements, and personal and business references. ''Tell me how this is much different than buying in a co-op?'' said Edward E. Longley, a senior vice president at City Connections Realty, who represented an Italian man who bought a one-bedroom in the building earlier this year.
As a foreigner, the buyer lacked much of the necessary documentation and had to spend weeks having his paperwork translated into English and converted into dollars before he could close. 
''I now tell all my clients that condo applications are simply co-op applications with the word 'condo' slapped on them,'' Mr. Longley said.
David Adler, the board president at 255 Hudson Street, who is also the chief executive and founder of BizBash Media, defended the building's vetting process. ''Our board application is as standard as they come for condos right now,'' he said. ''We do best practices and our management company advises us if they see any red flags.''
In the wake of the recession, an increasing number of condominium boards are hoping to weed out financially questionable buyers by requiring extensive application packages. Demands can include years' worth of federal tax returns, detailed lists of all assets and liabilities, several letters of references, and even board interviews. These buildings are waging a war of attrition, forcing potential residents to supply extensive documentation in the hopes that those who appear to be a financial risk will walk away of their own volition.
Existing condominiums -- buying in a new building is still a relatively simple process -- are turning to this strategy because they have no real power to reject an applicant. The only tool at their disposal is the right of first refusal, which allows condominium boards that are unhappy with a buyer to purchase the unit themselves or designate a buyer for the same price. But few buildings can afford to do so.
''It is a bullying strategy -- condominium bullying,'' said Adam Leitman Bailey, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. ''If a condominium has a questionable buyer, they'll just keep asking for more and more information, dragging things out, until the buyer walks away.''
But condo boards say they are merely defending the interests of existing residents. In the downturn, many owners stopped paying common charges, and condominiums had little recourse to recoup their money. In case of a default, the city is first in line to recover outstanding real estate taxes or other charges, followed by the mortgage lender. The condominium is third in line, and usually all it can do is file a lien against the property and hope that it will be repaid when the apartment is sold.
Because the condominium's power is limited, it is a matter of fiduciary duty to find strong buyers, said Carl Seligson, the board president of Carnegie Hill Tower, at 40 East 94th Street. In any given month, about three apartments in the 180-unit building have not paid their monthly charges on time; none have defaulted, he said.
Among the building's application requirements are tax returns, reference letters and a full description of all bank accounts and assets. It used to request board interviews, but ''we eliminated the interview process because we didn't think it was necessary,'' Mr. Seligson said. To limit transient residents, the building also requires that sublets be for at least one year.
Condo board requirements run the gamut. At the Time Warner Center, where many buyers are foreign, it is not necessary to submit federal tax returns. The building does require that in addition to general liability insurance of $1 million, owners have a $5 million umbrella policy to cover any unforeseen costs, like an accidental fire or damage incurred during a renovation. On the Upper East Side, 215 East 80th Street has a 67-page application that requires three business reference letters and three personal reference letters for each applicant. And at Towers on the Park, a condominium at 110th Street and Central Park West, the application packet requires potential owners to list all assets and two years' worth of tax returns, to be certified by an accountant.
Some condo owners purchase through a limited liability company or other business entity, and in those cases a number of buildings require that the principal personally guarantee some expenses, such as monthly common charges and assessments. In other cases a condo may require a security deposit, said Ronald H. Gitter, a real estate lawyer.
''In the past, condominiums would just ask for a simple financial statement,'' said Tamir Shemesh, a senior vice president at Corcoran, ''but now, due to the financial crisis, even the most exclusive luxury buildings are asking for supporting documents.''
Dani Bar-David was surprised that he had to submit reams of financial information when he bought two Manhattan condominiums as investments. Mr. Bar-David, who lives and works in New Jersey, bought units at 360 East 88th Street and 372 Central Park West, where the applications were 40 pages and 60 pages, respectively. ''They wanted so much information, you would think they were the ones who were going to own the apartments, not me,'' he said.
Vivek Kukar, a senior vice president at Rutenberg Realty who represented Mr. Bar-David in the purchases, agreed. ''The paperwork was extensive, especially given these were condominiums,'' he said.
It is the condo boards, and not the management companies, that decide on the extent of the application package, said Dan Wurtzel, the president of Cooper Square Realty, which manages 372 Central Park West and 360 East 88th Street. ''Some buildings are very particular, while others that are mostly investor-owned have very general requirements,'' he said. On the whole, ''the general flavor right now is that condominiums are growing more cautious.''
While it is still the exception, some condominiums are executing the right of first refusal more readily, said Stuart M. Saft, the chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, a trade organization. ''In the last 12 to 18 months, I've seen at least 10 situations where the board bought the apartment or designated another buyer to buy it,'' said Mr. Saft, who is also the chairman of the law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf's global real estate department.
Jacky Teplitzky, a managing director at Prudential Douglas Elliman, said, ''The brokerage community is in la-la land if they think that just because it's a condo, that every deal will go through.''
When she is representing sellers, Ms. Teplitzky makes potential buyers submit a detailed offer form, to ensure that they are financially secure. ''And every time, without fail, where the property is a condominium, the first thing we get is an angry telephone call'' from the buyer's broker ''telling us how dare we ask all this information.''
But it isn't just condos that are being more cautious. ''Co-ops also are strengthening their requirements,'' said Barbara Fox, president of Fox Residential Group. In fact, the only building types that don't have excessive application processes are new developments, brokers say.
''Right now in New York City, the only place that you are not being asked questions is when you buy in new construction,'' Ms. Teplitzky said. ''All they ask is for your name and your money.''
