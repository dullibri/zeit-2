PERSON: Dyab Abou Jahjah 

HEADLINE: THE SATURDAY PROFILE; 
An Outspoken Arab in Europe: Demon or Hero?

BYLINE:  By MARLISE SIMONS

DATELINE: ANTWERP, Belgium 

 BODY:
HE is pacing the room like a trapped panther, lithe and restless, as calls are coming in from the street. Thirty miles away, a large protest march is under way, but its organizer is stranded.
 This is the man known as Belgium's Malcolm X, the country's most famous immigrant who is frightening many Belgians, including the government, with his radical plans and fast-growing following. 
 He is Dyab Abou Jahjah, 31, born in Lebanon, the founder of the Arab European League, a new immigrant protest movement.
On this day in February, he is working his cellphone inhis sparsely furnished home in Antwerp because by order of a judge he is banned for three months from public events. But the news from the street cheers him. Marchers carry his photograph, some wear masks that show his face. 
"I hate this, being stuck here," he said. "The police probably wished I was there so they could arrest me."
Well, perhaps not. In November he was held for five days on charges of incitement to riot but released for lack of evidence. Belgium's prime minister, Guy Verhofstadt, called him a "threat to society." 
It quickly turned him into a demon, and a hero. The result has been a flood of television appearances, newspaper articles, magazine covers and new recruits for his Arab European League. 
"Recruiting is not hard," he said. "We're a civil rights movement, not a club of fundamentalist fanatics who want to blow things up. We're different because we are neither apologists nor extremists. We have such an appeal because we are filling a gap."
Mr. Abou Jahjah says he is part of a new generation of Muslim activists who are speaking out, frustrated with what they call discrimination, the lack of hope of finding a job, the problems of renting outside immigrant ghettos and, since Sept. 11, the distrust and even Islamophobia they feel.
Older immigrants who arrived from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey some 30 years ago, these activists say, have been too meek, too passive, co-opted by government funds or divided by ethnic or nationalist infighting. 
The Arab European League, founded by Mr. Abou Jahjah two years ago, aims to empower Muslim immigrants. He demands affirmative action in schools, in the workplace, in housing. His premise: Arabs in Europe will only be taken seriously if they are proud and strong. 
"In Europe, the immigrant organizations are Uncle Toms," he said. "We want to polarize people, to sharpen the discussion, to unmask the myth that the system is democratic for us."
The league's program calls on Muslim immigrants to resist pressures to integrate. "Assimilation is cultural rape," he said. "It means renouncing your identity, becoming like the others."
He finds inspiration in Malcolm X and his movement in the United States for racial pride. "Of course the context is different," he said, "but Malcolm X was also against assimilation. He fought for civil rights and he was also inspired by Islam."
Mr. Abou Jahjah's followers are hard to quantify. Hundreds of young men and women have shown up at street rallies. A few dozen have participated in the so-called video patrols to film the Antwerp police, who the league says abuse Arab youths verbally and physically. They have distributed fliers saying: "Bad cops, the Arab European League is watching you." There is no headquarters; regulars meet at an Antwerp Internet cafe. 
Critics say the prime minister and the minister of interior have overreacted. Mr. Abou Jahjah's influence is overrated, they argue, yielding more publicity than sting. 
But Mr. Abou Jahjah says his Arab pride movement is already echoing elsewhere. His group has recently set up chapters in three Dutch cities, and he says he has been invited to France and Britain to start chapters.
Articulate, fast-talking, self-assured, he is indeed different from many Muslims here, who have largely come from the interior of Morocco, Turkey and Algeria. 
Growing up in Lebanon, the son of university teachers, Mr. Abou Jahjah said he joined the Hezbollah resistance against Israel. "I had some military training, I'm still very proud of that," he said. In 1991, at age 19, he left. "I wanted to go abroad like a lot of Lebanese young people." He said he was accepted at the University of Michigan, but because of the Persian Gulf war, he did not get an American visa. He tried France, then Belgium, where he applied for political asylum. 
"Most asylum seekers invent a story and I said I had had a conflict with the Hezbollah leaders," Mr. Abou Jahjah said. "It was just a low political trick to get my papers. Now they want to use this against me." 
His marriage to a Belgian woman was brief, but it gave him Belgian citizenship. His wife said later that she was tricked into the marriage and tried unsuccessfully to sue him. It is hard to know the truth.
Now he has a degree in political science and speaks five languages. He has done odd jobs for a trade union and an immigrant organization. His chief lieutenant, Ahmed Azzuz, is studying law. There are others who are well-versed in law and politics. The group's manifesto says, "You do not receive equal rights, you take them."
Mr. Abou Jahjah's demands -- Islamic schools, bilingual education for Arab children, hiring quotas for immigrants -- are resented in this small nation of 10 million that struggles with its own identity. 
Belgium's long linguistic conflicts have been tentatively settled in the Constitution, which recognizes Dutch, French and German as official languages, though they still coexist uneasily. So there was an outcry when Mr. Abou Jahjah demanded that Arabic be added to the mix. 
"People freaked out over that," he said. "Why not," he added, with a quasi-innocence. "There are 70,000 German speakers and more than 300,000 Arab speakers." That mix, he has been told, grew historically. "I say history is not over." 
Indeed, Mr. Abou Jahjah makes a point of causing consternation, above all in Antwerp, the country's second largest city, where he lives. Depending on who is talking, this city of half a million people is either an exemplary ethnic mix, a cauldron or a wake-up call for Europe.
Antwerp is the base of the far-right Flemish Bloc, a party that won one-third of the seats on the City Council with the slogan, "Our people first." It is also home to Belgium's largest group of Jews, many of them linked to the diamond trade. 
Add to this a large immigrant population, up to one-third of them unemployed, said Mr. Abou Jahjah.
After unruly anti-Israel protests last April and more riots in November, when shops and a synagogue in the Jewish quarter were vandalized, the mayor warned that the Arab protesters were importing the Middle Eastern conflict and threatening the peace.
Filip Dewinter, the outspoken leader of the Flemish Bloc, said Mr. Abou Jahjah must be stripped of his Belgian citizenship and deported "because he lied about his refugee status and had a phony marriage." Mr. Dewinter regards Mr. Abou Jahjah as "a foreign agent, directed and paid from abroad."
At home, with his brother Ziad, a businessman, Mr. Abou Jahjah said the police had recently searched their homes and taken their computers, bank statements, "even Ziad's wedding pictures." There is nothing to hide, he said. Money comes from members in Belgium and several private donors in Egypt, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose names he has posted on the League's Web site, arabeuropean.org.
In May, he will run in the Belgian parliamentary elections. No, he will not support any of the six Muslims -- Turks and Moroccans -- already in Parliament. "They never defended the rights of immigrants," he said. "They don't want to rock the boat. We do. We're not guests here. We are citizens."

HEADLINE: The New AIDS Fight; 
Generic Drugs Can Make the Money Last

BYLINE:  By Mamphela Ramphele and Nicholas Stern; Mamphela Ramphele and Nicholas Stern are, respectively, a managing director and the chief economist of the World Bank.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Money is vital in combating the global AIDS epidemic, but diplomacy is key as well. Many lives hang in the balance as the world's trade ministers debate allowing poor countries continued access to cheap generic drugs. Last month, officials left a meeting in Tokyo without resolving the issue, and the stalemate has continued at talks in Geneva. President Bush's request for an additional $10 billion over the next five years to fight AIDS in Africa is great news, but the money will go much farther if poor countries can get affordable drugs. 
 This is the problem: Patent rules adopted by the World Trade Organization in 1996 and set to come into effect gradually over the next decade will limit trade of generic drugs that compete with patented products. 
 Under the new laws, poor countries that are able to manufacture the generics themselves will continue to be able to market them domestically. However, these tend to be the larger and (relatively) better-off states like Brazil, India and Thailand. Countries that can't manufacturing their own -- typically the poorest and most disease-ravaged places -- could be barred from importing generic versions of patented drugs. Thus a poor person in Brazil would legally be able to obtain treatment with generic versions of a new AIDS drug, while a much poorer person in Bolivia, Cambodia or Uganda would not. 
One day's supply of patented antiretrovirals for an AIDS patient typically costs $30. This is of course out of the question for the nearly three billion people who live on less than $2 a day. Generics are usually much cheaper than patented drugs, and the threat of competition has reduced prices of both in some places. Hetero, a manufacturer of generics in India, offers H.I.V. drugs for just 55 cents a day. 
The United States is right to point out that pharmaceutical companies have a legitimate interest in protecting their patents. Because patents give temporary monopolies on new drugs, they are the main incentives for new research. However, allowing these very poor countries to import generics would hardly erode incentives for Western conglomerates. 
These poor states form only a tiny portion -- likely less than 1 percent -- of the global pharmaceuticals market. They are so insignificant to the bottom line that some companies, acting out of compassion, are selling their H.I.V. drugs in such countries at or near the cost of production; some important drugs are even being provided free.
America also has a reasonable concern that generics produced in developing countries could be smuggled into rich countries, undermining patent protection in the drug companies' most lucrative markets. But there are other ways to guard against illegal trade, such as prohibiting generic manufacturers from mimicking the packaging of patented drugs.
In principle, Washington has endorsed loosening some rules on importing drugs to help poor countries. Unfortunately, it wants to limit any trade in generics to treatments for a selected list of infectious diseases like H.I.V., malaria and tuberculosis.
These limits may seem reasonable, but developing countries see them as a retreat from the rich countries' promises that trade talks would address their needs. After all, half of the premature deaths in poor countries are from noninfectious causes like heart attacks and cancer. Does a child dying of leukemia have less right to low-cost medicine than a child with AIDS? 
To be sure, an agreement on generics would not solve these countries' health problems. In many places poor roads, inadequate clinics and a lack of doctors and nurses are greater barriers than the costs of pills. 
But ensuring continued legal access to generics for the poorest countries is vital to improving their health care systems, and the lack of an agreement is becoming a serious impediment to the success of the broader trade talks. American leadership in resolving the issue would be a fitting complement to President Bush's generous pledge.

HEADLINE: The New AIDS Fight; 
A Plan as Simple as ABC

BYLINE:  By Edward C. Green; Edward C. Green, a medical anthropologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, is author of the forthcoming "Rethinking AIDS Prevention."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
There have been suggestions that President Bush was able to promise $10 billion in new money to fight the AIDS pandemic in part because there is now a way to spend the prevention part of this sum (about half) in a way that is acceptable to conservatives. It's true that conservatives favor this approach, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work.
 The initiative is based on what is called the "ABC approach." People might well wonder what this model is and what evidence supports it. Here is a summary of Uganda's experience. 
 We now know that the rate of new H.I.V. infections in Uganda started to decline in the late 1980's. But foreign experts began showing up in force in Uganda only in the early 1990's. Moreover, there were very few condoms in Uganda when the epidemic began to slow; they became widely available only after the experts appeared. Weren't "we" supposed to teach "them" how to prevent AIDS?
What happened was that beginning in 1986, Uganda tried to bring about nothing less than fundamental change in sexual behavior. It developed a low-cost program whose message, delivered by everyone from President Yoweri Museveni on down, was this: Stop having multiple partners. Be faithful. Teenagers, wait until you are married before you begin sex.
This is what has become known as the ABC model: Abstain, Be faithful, use Condoms if A and B fail.
By 1995, according to a survey financed by the United States, 95 percent of Ugandans were reporting either one or zero sexual partners in the past year. Moreover, the proportion of sexually active youth declined significantly from the late 80's to the mid-90's. The greatest percentage decline in H.I.V. infections and the greatest degree of behavioral change occurred in those 15 to 19 years old. This was also the group with the fewest AIDS deaths -- showing that it was most likely behavior and not death rates that reduced infection rates.
Though only 8 percent of Ugandans aged 15 to 49 reported using condoms recently -- this according to the 2000 Demographic and Health Survey, which is conducted for the United States Agency for International Development -- the important thing is that those 8 percent engaged in practices that put them at the highest risk of H.I.V. infection.
Why wasn't condom use more of a factor in Uganda's success in fighting AIDS? Partly it was Mr. Museveni's skepticism that in a country where it was difficult even to find aspirin, condoms could be supplied in adequate numbers. So the priority in the ABC approach is on A and B. Elsewhere, prevention typically begins and ends with C, in practice if not design.
But because the ABC approach is starting to be embraced by conservatives in the United States, some AIDS groups have been reluctant to believe it could be effective. Too often I've started to explain how the Ugandan H.I.V. rate began to drop after people started having fewer sexual partners, only to be met with a look of suspicion or condescension and informed that abstinence doesn't work.
Yet, when Africans are asked how they have changed their behavior in the face of AIDS, the great majority don't talk a lot about condoms. They talk about becoming monogamous, says a 2002 United Nations study that summarized years of research. Furthermore, young people report waiting until they are older to begin sex.
The ABC approach is not about that great conversation-stopper, "abstinence only." It is about providing people with more options for preventing AIDS. Some people cannot or will not change their behavior, and so of course they need to use condoms. But while condom use was one of the options Uganda has promoted, faithfulness to one partner is probably the major contributor to the country's success. We need to develop a balanced approach by recognizing that Africa and the West have different types of epidemics and going beyond the fruitless battle between the abstinence and condom camps.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Most Shares Post a Third Consecutive Monthly Decline

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Investors vacillated between jitters about a possible war with Iraq and optimism from upbeat economic news for much of the day yesterday, finally sending the market's gauges higher in the final minutes of trading. The gains were not enough to save most stocks from their third consecutive monthly decline. 
 Analysts remain dubious of Wall Street's ability to forge an upward path in the face of uncertainty about Iraq. And despite yesterday's advances, the major indexes ended the week lower, snapping a two-week winning stretch. 
 "I don't think there are any bits of good news sufficient enough to really drive the market higher on a sustained basis," said Richard A. Dickson, senior market strategist at Lowry's Research Reports in Palm Beach, Fla. 
Rallies have been short-lived so far this year, often lasting only a day or fizzling out midway through a session. Investors are expected to continue holding back until it is clearer if and when there will be a war with Iraq and what impact it will have on the United States economy. 
The Dow Jones industrial average inched up 6.09 points, to close at 7,891.08. Earlier, the Dow had risen as much as 80.81. For the week, the Dow lost 1.6 percent. 
The broader market also rose yesterday, but posted weekly declines. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 13.58 points, or 1 percent, to 1,337.52. For the week, it fell 0.9 percent. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 3.87 points, or 0.5 percent, to 841.15, but had a weekly loss of 0.8 percent. 
Most stocks ended the month with their third consecutive monthly declines as the Dow shed 2 percent and the S.& P. fell 1.7 percent. However, the Nasdaq managed to gain 1.3 percent in February. 
Wall Street was encouraged by news that the economy, as measured by gross domestic product, grew at a 1.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter, twice as fast as the government first estimated last month. While the performance, reported by the Commerce Department, is still considered below par, it showed that the economic recovery did not languish as much as previously thought. 
But two other pieces of economic news were more lukewarm. 
The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago reported that its index of business activity fell to 54.9 in February on a seasonally adjusted basis from 56.0 in January. Still, a reading above 50 indicates growth. 
The index is considered a harbinger of the Institute for Supply Management's national survey on manufacturing, expected to be released Monday. 
A third report showed softening of consumers' attitude, but to a lesser degree than had been expected. The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 79.9 in February from 82.4 in January, but it was better than the 79.2 level economists had expected. 
Investors were also faced with new reasons to be concerned about Iraq, among them uncertainty about how much a war would cost, and that caused the market to fight hard for the gains it made. The defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, said there were so many variables that estimating the cost was impossible. 
Technology was the market's strong suit yesterday with winners like I.B.M., up 67 cents, at $77.95, and Intel, up 56 cents, at $17.26. 
Among the decliners, Gap fell $1.78, to $13.04, after the company, the clothing retailer, reported late Thursday that fourth-quarter profit met Wall Street's forecast, but it warned that its performance for February missed expectations. 
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note increased 12/32, to a price of 101 17/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.69 percent from 3.74 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond jumped 25/32, to 110 30/32. The bond's yield dipped to 4.67 percent from 4.72 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Revised Data Double Rate Of Growth In 4th Quarter 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
The United States economy grew at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the closing quarter of last year, the government said today, twice the previously estimated pace, as businesses rebuilt inventories and consumers spent more. 
 While the Commerce Department report showed growth in gross domestic product remained modest in the fourth quarter and another report showed consumer confidence in a shaky state this month, the data were not as soft as feared and implied underlying economic strength once worries lift about the threat of war with Iraq. 
 Bill Cheney, an economist with John Hancock Financial Services in Boston, said the report lent "credence to the belief that, absent that Iraq crisis, businesses would likely be spending more vigorously and helping shift the economy into a higher gear." 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management said today that its index of manufacturing activity in the Midwest softened slightly in February to 54.9 from 56.0 in January. But that, too, painted a mixed picture, with new orders and inventories firming, a positive signal for the future, but order backlogs weaker in February. 
 In addition, the University of Michigan said today that its closely watched survey of consumer confidence dipped to its lowest level in nine years. 
 Fears about potential war, terror attacks and job losses helped push the consumer sentiment index down to 79.9 in February -- the lowest reading since September 1993 -- from 82.4 in January. Since economists assume fearful consumers may rein in spending, a prolonged dip in consumer confidence would be a worrisome portent for expansion. 
 The pattern of growth in 2002 was uneven, rising at a brisk 5 percent annual clip in the first quarter, falling to 1.3 percent in the second quarter, back to 4 percent in the third quarter and slowing once more in the closing quarter. 
 During the full year 2002, gross domestic product expanded 2.4 percent after anemic growth of 0.3 percent in 2001 when the economy was in recession. Gross domestic product measures the value of all goods and services produced within the borders of the United States. 
 The revised fourth-quarter figures on gross domestic product showed businesses spent at the fastest rate in two years to rebuild inventories. 
 Inventory spending was at a $24.7 billion annual rate from October to December -- the strongest since a $59.9 billion addition in the fourth quarter of 2000 -- and a huge upward revision from the $3.3 billion gain estimated a month ago.

HEADLINE: Fed Official Says Rate Cuts Have Not Created Bubbles 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
A top Federal Reserve official tonight provided the central bank's most extended defense yet against critics who have warned that its policy has fostered a bubble in housing prices and auto purchases that might pop as abruptly as the stock market bubble did nearly three years ago.
 "It makes sense to build the houses and cars now, when the cost of doing so is relatively low, rather than waiting," Donald L. Kohn, a Fed governor, said in remarks prepared for delivery tonight at a conference in San Francisco. 
 Though acknowledging that housing prices have soared, largely because of the Fed's drastic reduction of interest rates, Mr. Kohn argued that neither the supply of housing nor home prices were "out of line with what might be expected." 
Mr. Kohn's remarks came on the heels of similar but more generalized comments by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, with whom Mr. Kohn has close ties.
Tonight, Mr. Kohn seemed intent on reassuring investors that a market meltdown was unlikely and also on rebutting criticism that the Fed's attempt to prop up a weak economy with low interest rates might be creating other problems down the road.
The Fed has lowered interest rates 12 times over the last two years, bringing the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks to 1.25 percent, the lowest level in 41 years.
That policy has created a surge in the purchases and prices of homes as lower interest rates allowed people to borrow much more than they would otherwise be able to afford. It also helped shore up consumer spending, which has been the only real source of economic growth for some time as car companies offered zero percent financing deals and homeowners pulled cash out of their homes through home-equity loans.
But at least some analysts have been worried that housing prices could be poised to crash, if only because they have been rising much faster than either inflation or personal income.
Another worry is that both home-building and car production could stall badly once interest rates begin to climb back to more typical levels.
Mr. Kohn acknowledged that higher interest rates could dampen the purchases of both houses and durable goods like cars and appliances, but he added that interest rates would head higher only in response to more buoyant economic growth.
"The question is whether the stimulus to household investment, while cushioning the economic cycle in the near term, is setting the stage for greater instability in the longer run," Mr. Kohn said.
The answer, he contended, is probably not. The boom in car sales, he said, has not required the construction of factories and has thus not led to overinvestment in machinery or equipment.
And while acknowledging that the prices of existing homes have "skyrocketed" much faster than personal income in most markets, he said the lower interest rates had kept homeowners' monthly mortgage payments at manageable levels.
"Although house prices outpaced income through much of the 1990's, housing remained quite affordable by historical standards," Mr. Kohn said. And while spending on houses and cars might well moderate in the future, he said, "they do not appear set to replicate the experience of fiber optic cable."

HEADLINE: Tight U.S. Job Market Adds To Jitters Among Consumers 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Americans are now more worried about their job prospects than at any time since 1993, raising the risk that consumer spending, the cornerstone of the economy, will slow even if the United States quickly resolves its standoff with Iraq.
 Concern about the job market is only partly reflected in the unemployment rate, which fell to 5.7 percent in January from 6 percent in December. Each month, the Conference Board, a private research group, asks people whether they view jobs as plentiful, not plentiful or hard to get. In February, 11 percent of people said jobs were plentiful, while 59 percent said they were not plentiful and 30 percent said they were hard to get, the group announced this week. 
 Those are the bleakest assessments since December 1993, and a sharp decline since President Bush took office two years ago. Then, 49 percent of Americans viewed jobs as plentiful, while 38 percent said they were not plentiful and only 13 percent said they were hard to get.
Those estimates probably reflect the reality of the job market as well as or better than the unemployment rate does, said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley. Respondents may not know the inflation rate or the size of the federal budget deficit, but most people intuitively sense whether jobs in their field and their city or state are hard to come by, Mr. Roach said.
The United States has lost more than two million jobs since March 2001, the worst slump in the last two decades, according to statistics from the Labor Department.
Broad measures of consumer confidence have also plunged in the last two years. Yesterday, the University of Michigan said that its consumer sentiment index had fallen to its lowest level since September 1993. Still, many forecasters discount the impact that general consumer confidence has on spending. Except for the richest Americans, most people spend almost every dollar they make, whether they are feeling confident or not.
But simply ignoring consumer confidence is a mistake, Mr. Roach and other economists argue. Overall consumer confidence does not much affect spending, they said, but the perception people have of their job security does.
"The minute they become apprehensive about their jobs, which is the primary source of income, it tends to produce a curtailment in spending," said Lynn Franco, director of the consumer research center at the Conference Board. "The labor market must improve to build a sustainable recovery."
If the United States quickly defeats Iraq or ousts Saddam Hussein, broad measures of consumer confidence may soar, Mr. Roach said. But if people continue to perceive jobs as difficult to come by, they are likely to cut back on discretionary spending even if they claim they are generally more confident, he said.
"If we win a war, confidence will soar, the stock market will rally, it'll look really nifty, but will it change the underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy?" he said. "I don't think so." 
As a result, the economy, which grew about 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter, according to a revised report released yesterday by the Commerce Department, is at risk of slipping back into recession for the second time in three years, said Douglas R. Cliggott. Mr. Cliggott, the chief executive of Brummer & Partners, a Swedish money manager, said the labor market appeared to be weakening. Initial unemployment claims rose steadily in February after staying flat for months, he said.
Since the technology stock bubble burst in 2000 and business investment plunged, consumer spending, which accounts for almost 70 percent of all economic activity, has largely carried the economy. Even with unemployment rising and wages hardly increasing, low interest rates have encouraged individuals to keep spending, especially on new homes and cars.
But even if interest rates stay low, the weak job market could leave consumers increasingly fearful of making big commitments.
Anxiety about the job market may become a self-fulfilling prophecy, economists say. If consumers cut back on spending, companies will have to cut production and lay off more workers, further depressing confidence and damping the economy. Eventually, of course, new technologies and rising productivity will spur new investment and hiring by businesses and demand will rise again, but that process could take years.
Mr. Roach said the situation reminded him of January 1991, just before the gulf war began. The Conference Board's survey showed then that 11 percent of consumers thought jobs were plentiful, 56 percent thought they were not plentiful, and 33 percent thought they were hard to get -- percentages similar to those today.
After a coalition led by the United States easily defeated Iraq in the gulf war, consumer confidence soared. The Conference Board's general confidence index rose to 81.1 in March 1991 from 59.4 in February, its biggest increase ever.
But that increase did not translate into a change in consumers' perceptions of the job market, which steadily worsened as the economy grew weakly and many big companies announced mass layoffs. By February 1992, only 4 percent of consumers said jobs were plentiful, while 47 percent said they were not plentiful and 49 percent said they were hard to get -- the worst figures since 1982.
In November 1992, the first President Bush lost his bid for a second term. "Jobless prosperity -- that's what cost George Bush No. 1 his job, and it's sort of ironic that his son is facing the same thing," Mr. Roach said.
Smaller businesses are also cutting back on hiring. In a survey by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, only 8 percent of small businesses said they were planning to expand in January, down from 12 percent a year earlier and 16 percent in January 2001. Just 19 percent said they had one or more jobs open, the same level as a year earlier but down from 31 percent in January 2001.
Michael P. Niemira, a vice president of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, was slightly more optimistic. Hiring tends to trail the business cycle, because companies do not want to take on new workers until they are sure the economy is expanding. And consumer perceptions of the job market also tend to lag behind the actual strength or weakness of the market.
So it is possible that the economy and job market are stronger than consumers understand, Mr. Niemira said. He expects the economy to grow 2.3 percent this year.
Still, Mr. Niemira said the United States could easily slip into recession, especially if oil prices remain near $40 a barrel. "I'm worried about the direct impact of higher oil prices on spending," he said. "I'm very concerned in the short term."

HEADLINE: G.M. to Add Hughes Shares to Benefit Plans 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said today that it would contribute 150 million of its Hughes Electronics Corporation shares to its employee benefit plans, which are underfunded because of declining stock markets and soaring health care costs.
 The contribution, worth about $1.5 billion at current market prices, will cut G.M.'s operating expenses for its benefit plans in 2003. 
It will also reduce G.M.'s economic interest in its wholly owned Hughes unit, to about 20 percent from 30.7 percent, G.M. said. 
 With the transfer of the additional 150 million Hughes shares, expected to be completed in March, G.M.'s employee benefit plans will hold about 330 million shares in Hughes. The allocation of Hughes shares has not been determined yet, G.M. said. G.M.'s United States pension plan ended 2002 underfunded by $19.3 billion because of three years of stock market declines.
Separately, G.M. said that it set new vehicle sales incentives of up to $2,000 cash back.

HEADLINE: Pataki Abandons Plan to Share Costs of Empire Zone Tax Breaks 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
After weeks of opposition by state lawmakers and local officials, Gov. George E. Pataki today retreated from his proposal to bill local governments for half the costs of property tax breaks offered to businesses in state economic development zones.
 Mr. Pataki, a Republican, made the proposal in his executive budget last month, saying that it would save the state about $4 million annually. Currently, the state pays $250 million every year to local governments to cover the cost of a variety of tax breaks in 72 specially designated Empire Zones across the state. 
 But the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and the Senate Majority Leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, opposed the change. This week, Mr. Bruno proposed expanding the program by adding 18 more zones, mostly in counties that have none.
Many state and local government officials also lobbied against Mr. Pataki's plan, saying it would not only cost local governments money but would also discourage them from participating in one of the state's most successful economic development programs.
Mr. Pataki withdrew his proposal today as part of a series of mostly technical amendments to his $90.8 billion budget for the 2003-2004 fiscal year, which begins April 1. Under the state Constitution, today was the last day he had to submit his amendments to the Legislature.
Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for the State Division of the Budget, said the governor's decision "resulted from his understanding that while "the state is facing a severe fiscal crisis, so are the local governments."
"We're going to continue working with them and the Legislature to make sure the Empire Zone program continues to be implemented in the most cost-effective manner possible."
Assemblyman Robin Schimminger, a Democrat and chairman of the Assembly's Economic Development Committee, said the governor's proposal had been "ill-conceived."
"It would have gutted the program because local governments would have been reluctant to pick up half the costs," he said.
In other changes, the governor reduced his revenue projections by about $200 million this year. He also factored in another $5 million for extra antiterrorism measures.
State budget officials said that personal income tax receipts were lower than estimated, and a new computer system that was expected to generate more money through tax audits had not been installed as quickly as planned. At the same time, state officials said that they expected to pay about $25 million less to local governments for school aid claims this year, partially offsetting the decrease in revenue. The governor also proposed adding a surcharge to the registration fee for boats.
The governor's amendments also projected an additional $213 million in savings for next year, largely as a result of revised spending and revenue estimates. These savings included lower welfare costs, spending reductions at various agencies, and an influx of federal money for Medicaid payments.

HEADLINE: Financing Plan Adds Complexity to Remaking of New York's West Side 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration's financing plan for redeveloping the far West Side of Manhattan is every bit as ambitious as the network of parks, subways, cultural buildings, commercial towers, housing and stadiums it plans to build there.
 At a conference yesterday at the Newman Real Estate Institute at Baruch College, Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff clearly dazzled the real estate executives who attended with plans for transforming the low-slung, semi-industrial neighborhood from 28th to 42nd Streets, west of Ninth Avenue. 
 Mr. Doctoroff showed off renderings of new tree-lined streets, commuter rail connections and a new business district with skyscrapers along the avenues. The plans also call for spending $1 billion to double the size of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. 
Mr. Doctoroff said the administration would pay for the $2.68 billion plan "without using existing city resources."
Instead, the city would issue bonds that would be paid back with revenues from rising property values in the neighborhood over the next 30 years, as the city extends the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to 34th Street and 11th Avenue, rezones the area for 16 new office towers, erects a football stadium for the New York Jets and builds new parks and streets. In the language of municipal finance, it is known as tax increment financing, or TIF.
Mr. Doctoroff did not give specifics for the financing plan.
But some urban planners, economists and C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, wondered whether the plan could work. Given the layoffs on Wall Street, a recession and more than 40 million square feet of vacant office space in Manhattan, Ms. Fields said it was hard to imagine who would build the office buildings that are supposed to generate the tax revenues.
"I have questions about how this will be financed," Ms. Fields said at the conference. "Any bonds backed by funds from planned development, whether it's TIF or the sale of zoning bonuses, will be problematic, since the development will come years after the public investment."
According to an outline of the administration's financial plan, which was provided to The New York Times, the $1.2 billion extension of the No. 7 subway line, for instance, would be completed by 2007, along with the construction of platforms over the railyards where the stadium and other development would take place, at an estimated cost of $482 million.
But the sale of development rights over the railyards would not take place until 2009 and the first office tower would not go up until 2010.
A total of 28 million square feet of commercial space would be constructed on the West Side between 2010 and 2035.
Critics contend that the New York real estate market never proceeds smoothly. During what was arguably the biggest real estate boom in the city's history, between 1996 and 2002, only seven towers were built in Manhattan, for a total of 6.5 million square feet, according to the Real Estate Board of New York.
Now there are acres of empty space and Wall Street is continuing to lay off bankers.
"The commercial real estate market is not going to come roaring back in large part because financial services are not going to come roaring back," said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Economy.com, a consulting firm. "The demand for commercial real estate will be significantly constrained by the ongoing restructuring of the industry over the next couple of years and the weak job growth that the industry will experience in the decade afterward. Some of the difference will be made up by health care and educational services, but I don't think there's any industry that uses office space as intensely as financial services."
The Bloomberg administration's plans for the West Side dovetail with the effort to bring the Olympic Games to New York in 2012, and with plans to build a stadium with a retractable roof for the Jets on a platform over the railyards, between 30th and 34th Streets and 10th and 12th Avenues. Representatives of NYC2012, the group leading the city's Olympic bid, also made presentations yesterday.
The Jets have said that the team is willing to pay for a major share of the $1.2 billion stadium, but the city would have to pay for the retractable roof and the platform over the rail yards.
Ms. Fields presented her own plan, emphasizing a residential neighborhood with some commercial space, as opposed to the city's emphasis on creating a new business district.
Where the Jets want to build a striking steel football stadium, Ms. Fields shows apartment buildings. The local community board and many neighborhood groups oppose the stadium.
Mr. Doctoroff said the city must be able to grow to prosper. "If we are going to accommodate growth in this city, we are going to have to find a place to put people," he said.
The administration calls for building roughly five million square feet of office space and roughly 6,000 apartments by 2014, and an additional seven million square feet of office space by 2019.
Under its financial plan, the city would enter into voluntary agreements with commercial developers, in which the city would own the land under their projects. The developers, in turn, would make payments to the city in lieu of property, sales and mortgage recording taxes. The city would use the money to pay the tax-exempt bonds issued by a local development corporation for transportation and other projects.
Residential developers would be offered tax breaks. The city would also sell the development rights to build on platforms over the railyards for about $300 million and the rights to build taller buildings than zoning rules would ordinarily allow.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Shares of Gap Inc. fell more than 12 percent today after the retailer said its spring season was off to an unexpectedly slow start, leading some analysts to trim expectations for earnings and stock performance. 
 Gap, which is based in San Francisco, said after the market close on Thursday that February same-store sales fell short of its projections, partly because of winter storms on the East Coast and low consumer confidence, as shoppers bought less merchandise at full prices. 
 For the month to date, same-store sales rose nearly 10 percent. 
The company had a fourth-quarter net profit, after a loss in the period a year ago.

HEADLINE: W.H.O. Adopts Tobacco Pact But Many Countries Object 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LANGLEY

DATELINE: GENEVA, Saturday, March 1 

 BODY:
The World Health Organization adopted a final text of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control early today, but many major nations, including the United States and Germany, said they would not adopt the treaty in its current form.
 The draft treaty, approved after four years of negotiations, will be presented at the W.H.O.'s annual conference here in May. 
 David Hohman, the American health attache in Geneva, said the wording in some sections was either unacceptable or violated the Constitution. "While the U.S. does not object to forwarding the draft convention to the World Health Assembly," he said, "these and other issues will have to be addressed." 
If adopted in its current form, the treaty would place ban advertising and promotion of tobacco products, in countries where that would be constitutional. It would also impose high taxes on tobacco products. 
Further, the tobacco industry would be required to divulge all the ingredients in cigarettes and print warning labels that cover at least 30 percent of the package. The treaty would also ban companies from using terms like "ultra light" or "light."
It would encourage nations to fight against cigarette smuggling and enact strict indoor air laws. 
Developing countries, projected to be the biggest growth area for tobacco-related illnesses in the next 20 years, fought for the toughest possible laws.
"Our commitment was to public health and nothing else," one African delegate said. "Statistics show that Africa and the developing world will be the countries hit the worst." 
But the strong wording of the text also seemed to work against the treaty's prospects. "It's become an African treaty now," one negotiator said. "It's a regional treaty and not an international one." 
Moreover, because nations have to accept the treaty or reject it without amendment, many countries including the United States and China have expressed uncertainty over whether they can get it ratified. "This complicates the situation," Mr. Hohman said. "We have to see what the treaty looks like at the World Health Assembly in May before we make a decision."
Germany, which objected to language banning advertisements, had threatened to derail the convention, as the European Union requires a unanimous vote of its members before it will adopt a treaty.
A spokesperson for the German delegation said that his country would not object to sending the treaty to the May meeting, but that it still "won't accept it in its current form."
If the treaty is passed in May, it then goes to the W.H.O.'s 192 member nations for ratification. Once 40 have passed it, the it officially goes into effect in the countries where it has been approved.

HEADLINE: Jeweler Abandons Plan to Open a Store in SoHo 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
H. Stern, the Fifth Avenue jeweler that had once hoped to make a pioneering foray into SoHo, has abandoned its plans to open a store in a new building in the heart of the neighborhood, a store official said yesterday.
 In 1998, when SoHo had only a handful of luxury retailers, H. Stern signed a lease to be the sole tenant of a new building at the corner of Prince and Mercer Streets that would take the place of a parking lot. 
 After many delays, the one-story gray steel building, with 3,450 square feet of selling space, was completed in the fall of 2001, but work on the interior never started. In mid-February, the jeweler decided to find a subtenant. 
Andrea Hansen, the company's marketing director for North America, said that H. Stern no longer believed that SoHo was a good market for high-pricedjewelry. "The retail climate has changed," she said. "The foot traffic may be there, but it's definitely not for fine jewelry." 
The company had expected to spend about $2 million creating an interior with terra cotta walls and pearwood fixtures imported from Italy, she said.
H. Stern's withdrawal is a further sign of the decline of the luxury market in SoHo. 
Ermenegildo Zegna, Cartier and Yves St. Laurent are among the other luxury retailers that leased space in SoHo and either occupied it only briefly or never moved in.
On Thursday, Vivienne Westwood, a London clothing designer, closed her only American store, on Greene Street in SoHo, after four years. 
"We're concentrating on markets that are really strong for us," said Mark Palmen, a company spokesman. "America doesn't look too promising right now."
Brokers say that rents in SoHo have climbed to unrealistic levels in recent years, despite the economic downturn and the slump in foreign tourism after Sept. 11. 
H. Stern had been paying rent of more than $400 a square foot, according to Faith Hope Consolo, a vice chairwoman of Garrick-Aug Worldwide, a retail brokerage company. "You might as well go to Madison Avenue, where there's traffic all day long," she said.
H. Stern, which is based in Rio de Janeiro and has 160 stores around the world, is indeed searching for space on Madison Avenue in the '60's, Ms. Hansen said. 
John Usdan, the president of Midwood Management Company, which built the H. Stern building, said that SoHo was going through a shakeout. 
"The traffic is there," he said, "for tenants coming in with the right merchandise."

HEADLINE: 5,000 Workers at Yale Are Set to Strike Over Pensions and Wages 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Nearly 5,000 workers at Yale University, including janitors, cafeteria workers, secretaries and graduate teaching assistants, plan to go on strike on Monday. It would be the seventh walkout at Yale in 35 years, leading labor experts to say that Yale has the worst record of labor strife of any school in the nation.
 Union officials say the strike will involve more groups of workers than any previous walkout at a university. It will include a union representing 2,900 clerical workers and one with 1,200 technical and service workers, both of which have been without a contract for 13 months. 
 The strike will also involve the Graduate Employee Student Organization, a group of more than 1,000 graduate teaching and research assistants who are seeking union recognition. In addition, 150 food workers at Yale-New Haven Hospital, which Yale officials say is independent of the university, will walk out. They have been without a contract for two years.
Both sides agreed that there was little chance of averting the strike, which is scheduled to last five days. "I'd say there's a 99 percent chance that we're going to pull everybody out," said Robert Proto, president of the union representing the clerical and service workers, which staged a one-month strike in 1996, during the last round of negotiations.
Helaine Klasky, a Yale spokeswoman, predicted that the strike's impact would be minimal. The strike will close student dining halls and leave dormitory bathrooms uncleaned. Students will receive rebates on room and board to pay for meals at local restaurants. Some professors, wanting to honor the picket line, have decided to move their classes off campus.
Anita Seth, chairwoman of the graduate employees' group, said the strike would force cancellation of many classes taught by graduate students. Her group wants Yale to agree to a polling procedure that could result in union recognition for graduate students like their counterparts at New York University.
But Yale's president, Richard C. Levin, has resisted granting them union recognition. In the past, Yale officials argued that graduate teaching assistants were students, who were not entitled to unionize under federal law, rather than employees, who had the right to unionize.
"President Levin is not recognizing the democratic rights that graduate students have to bargain collectively," Ms. Seth said.
Yale and other private universities are waiting to see whether the new National Labor Relations Board appointed by President Bush, in a case involving Brown and Columbia, reverses a 28-month-old ruling and declares that graduate teaching assistants are students, not employees.
It is unclear what percentage of employees will strike, but union leaders expressed confidence that a high percentage would.
The university has offered its clerical union raises of more than 4 percent a year over six years and its technical union more than 3 percent a year -- amounts that school officials say are generous considering the weak economy. University officials accuse the clerical and technical unions of rejecting these proposals to pressure Yale to agree to procedures that would make it easier for the graduate students and 1,800 workers at Yale-New Haven Hospital to unionize.
"We have reached this point because the union leadership has made a strategic decision that the unionizing efforts were more important than settling a contract," Ms. Klasky said. "These workers could have already received raises and increased pensions, but now they're still without a contract. It's quite unfortunate for the rank and file."
Union officials denied the university's assertion. They insisted that management's offer was inadequate because Yale's workers were paid so little. Yale said its clerical workers earned $33,717 a year on average and its technical and service workers $30,342. 
Union officials said the main issue was pensions, with many workers retiring after 30 years with pensions of less than $800 a month. "A pension of that level leaves people a choice of not retiring or of retiring in poverty," Mr. Proto said.
University officials said that Yale had offered to raise pensions at least 11 percent a year, and that when Social Security was added in, workers who retired after 30 years received retirement income exceeding 80 percent of their after-tax work income. "Yale has made generous offers on wages and pensions," Ms. Klasky said, "on top of their already generous benefit package."
The labor movement hopes to bring widespread attention to the Yale dispute. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, John J. Sweeney and several prominent politicians have been invited to demonstrate with the Yale workers.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Canada: Economic Growth Slows 

BYLINE:  By Bernard Simon (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Canada's gross domestic product grew at an annualized inflation-adjusted rate of 1.6 percent in the final three months of 2002, the third consecutive quarter of slowing growth, Statistics Canada said. In the third quarter, gross domestic product expanded by 3.6 percent. 
The slowdown was mostly a result of a sharp decline in shipments of automotive products to the United States, which account for 85 percent of Canada's total exports. In spite of buoyant consumer spending, the latest gross domestic product number was weaker than analysts had expected. Some said it could persuade the Bank of Canada, which is also concerned about rising inflation, to leave interest rates unchanged when it reviews monetary policy on March 4. Bernard Simon (NYT)

CORRECTION-DATE: March 4, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a report in the World Business Briefing column on Saturday about economic growth in Canada misstated the nature of 85 percent of the country's exports. It is sales of all goods and services to the United States, not of auto parts alone.

HEADLINE: Former Prime Minister Elected President in Czech Republic 

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Vaclav Klaus, the brainy, abrasive and ever-persistent former Czech prime minister, eked out a win today to replace his old rival, Vaclav Havel, as the president of the Czech Republic. 
 The post of president here is less immediately powerful than symbolic, a role Mr. Havel, the former dissident turned statesman, took on not only for the Czech Republic but in some measure for all former Communist nations after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. He retired early this month. 
 But the timing and circumstances of Mr. Klaus's victory may well endow him with the more direct influence he has sought since being forced to resign as prime minister in 1998 amid a scandal over party financing. His election exposed deep divisions and weakness among the ruling Social Democrats, who failed in three attempts, including today, to elect their own candidate to the presidency. 
The president is also commander of the armed forces, at a time of a possible American attack on Iraq and when Czech chemical units are stationed in Kuwait. In recent weeks, Mr. Klaus has broken somewhat with the official position of his party, the Civic Democrats, to express skepticism about any military action against Iraq. 
On the issue of Iraq, the Czech Republic, long one of America's closest friends in the region, "may not be the same ally as before he was elected," said Tomos Packer, regional analyst for World Markets Research Center, which advises international businesses. 
Like many other experts, Mr. Packer also speculated that Mr. Klaus, a right-wing free marketeer with views that are well defined and often acidly expressed, could be more involved in the day-to-day political fray than Mr. Havel was in his nearly dozen years in office.
Mr. Klaus, said Mr. Packer, is "a political animal."
"That's his raison d'etre," he said.
Mr. Klaus rose to prominence during the anti-Communist revolution of 1989 when he lent economic expertise to the group of well-known dissident intellectuals led by Mr. Havel who had strong credentials in opposing Communist rule, but little proof of pragmatic ability to govern.
But the two Vaclavs had deeply different personal styles and political inclinations, and they became bitter rivals.
Aware that his past was hurting his ambition to become president, Mr. Klaus, 61, has sought in recent weeks to soften his image. He has said that the president should remain above politics and that he would be president for all Czechs, and he has even offered some kind words for Mr. Havel.
The two men's distaste for each other is legendary here, with 14 years of sniping on both sides in public and private. 
Bohumil Dolezal, an aide to Mr. Klaus in the early 1990's, said that Mr. Klaus's personality and strong party roots suggested that he would be a far different president than Mr. Havel, but that it was too early to predict exactly how.
"I'm not such an optimist to believe that he will behave in a more cultivated and civilized manner than Mr. Havel," said Mr. Dolezal, now a political scientist at Charles University in Prague. "I don't think at this point, though, that the election of Mr. Klaus is some kind of catastrophe."
Mr. Klaus won 142 of a possible 281 votes in the third round of voting in the combined session of Parliament today, just one more vote than he needed. He defeated Jan Sokol, 66, a philosopher, former dissident and dean of humanities at Charles University, and the third candidate offered by the Social Democrats.
Mr. Klaus's election ended a crisis in which the Parliament failed twice in January to choose Mr. Havel's successor. If today's voting had failed, the choice would have gone directly to the Czech voters. 
That process, experts said, could have taken six months, at a time when the Czech Republic faces crucial questions on any involvement in military operations in Iraq as well as a referendum in June on whether to join the European Union.

HEADLINE: The New AIDS Fight; 
Waging a Global Battle More Efficiently

BYLINE:  By Paul S. Zeitz; Paul S. Zeitz is executive director of the Global AIDS Alliance.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush's pledge to increase spending on the fight against AIDS by $10 billion over the next five years is encouraging, even historic. The president's budget, however, falls far short of what is needed to save millions of lives in the coming year, and it fails to make use of the most efficient way to distribute the money.
 Only about 5 percent of the new spending is requested in the president's budget. Even more troubling, the president's budget cuts nearly in half the level of financing Congress authorized for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, a public-private partnership intended to expand effective programs. To finance the proposal, his budget also proposes cuts in children's health programs. 
 The AIDS pandemic will not wait for us to act. Some 13,000 new infections occur daily, 2,000 of them in children under 15 years old, while 8,500 people die of AIDS each day. In Africa, AIDS has devastated the work force, contributing to famine and reversing economic progress. By 2010, there will be 20 million AIDS orphans in Africa alone.
The longer the United States delays in providing the money it has promised, the more difficult and costly it will be to achieve results. Yet from my experience working for United States government agencies in Zambia, I know how long it can take for funds to move through the bureaucracy. Even with swift Congressional approval, the president's initiative won't be felt in Africa for almost two years.
In contrast, the global fund can deliver assistance in a matter of months. It has strong safeguards to ensure the proper use of funds and spends only 3 percent on administrativeoverhead. The fund also receives contributions from Europe and other wealthy nations to fight AIDS.
A recent trip to Mozambique showed me how much momentum a grant from the fund can provide. For the first time, the government, nongovernmental organizations, international agencies and the private sector are collaborating on a comprehensive AIDS plan there.
To reach the president's targets of preventing seven million H.I.V. infections and putting two million people on treatment, Congress should give at least half of any new AIDS money to the Global Fund. Instead, the fund is set to receive only $200 million annually of the $10 billion in new money over the next five years.
Last year the Senate unanimously approved legislation providing for $2.5 billion in spending to combat AIDS in the coming year, $1.2 billion of which was to be directed to the fund. Unfortunately, the House failed to pass the bill. Senator Bill Frist, a co-sponsor of the Senate bill, should stand his ground in supporting the fund. Given the worsening AIDS crisis, Congress should provide $3.5 billion in total spending for 2004. And with a shortfall in the fund, Congress should approve an emergency contribution of at least $500 million this year.
An effective strategy to combat AIDS must also go beyond purely medical approaches. It should include better access to clean water and good nutrition and a range of community-based support services intended to meet the needs of affected families and the millions of children left behind by the AIDS epidemic. We must also address the broader, macroeconomic context by mandating debt cancellation so countries can have more money to combat poverty and disease.
The president has shown he is eager to confront the AIDS crisis. Now we must all work to ensure America lives up to the president's promise. Millions of lives depend on it.

HEADLINE: Agencies to Continue to Rate Pools of NewYork Mortgages 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Credit rating agencies have indicated they will continue to rate pools of mortgages that include those from New York City because its new predatory lending law does not threaten investors' returns.
 At the same time, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has challenged the law, so it will not be put into effect until at least April 8. 
 Fitch Ratings said in a statement yesterday that it would continue to rate pools of mortgages sold in the secondary market because the new law does not impose a direct financial liability on the investors. Standard & Poor's issued a similar statement Monday. Moody's Investors Service has yet to make a formal statement but has indicated it is likely to make the same decision. 
Ratings for these mortgage pools are necessary to make them salable to investors in the secondary market.
The three agencies have stopped providing ratings on pools of mortgages in Georgia, where a law allows borrowers who contend they have been victims of predatory lending to sue not only the original lender but also anyone who later buys the mortgage. The refusal to rate these mortgage pools effectively closed the market for home mortgages in the state, which is rushing to rewrite the law.
Unlike the Georgia law, the New York City measure does not allow suits against the issuers of the mortgages or the subsequent owners of mortgages that turn out to be predatory. Instead, it bans the lender or owner from doing business with the city for three years, including the underwriting of municipal bonds and the holding of city deposits. It would also halt any city subsidies to a company that was found to be involved in predatory lending.
Without the threat of a penalty that would reduce the value of the mortgage pool, the credit agencies can provide a rating that reflects the likelihood of investors' receiving their promised return.
Mayor Bloomberg received a preliminary injunction against the law after he contended it conflicted with and was pre-empted by a state predatory lending law. In addition, he contended the law curtailed his executive powers by giving the city comptroller responsibility for enforcing it. The law also requires companies to have certificates of compliance before doing business with the city. The comptroller and the City Council disagree with the mayor.
The state predatory lending law is to go into effect in April. At that time, the three main credit agencies will again have to consider whether mortgage pools with mortgages from New York State can be rated. The state law does allow suits for damages against the originator and the subsequent buyer of the mortgages in the secondary market. That means there could be damages or penalties assessed that would reduce the value of a mortgage pool and, therefore, the return to investors.
Unlike the Georgia law, however, the New York State law does not specifically allow for punitive damages. For rating agencies, the potential for punitive, or essentially unlimited, damages was a central reason for the decision not to rate any more mortgage pools in Georgia.
With a limit on damages, the agencies may still be able to rate pools with New York mortgages. Those ratings may be lower than they would have been in the past, however, because of the potential for some reduction in the value of the mortgage pool if some mortgages are found to be predatory.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: MOSCOW; 
Putin Again Rejects U.S. Calls for Support of a War, Fearing Effect on the Mideast

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Once again and with fervor, President Vladimir V. Putin today rebuffed American calls to support a possible military campaign in Iraq, arguing in an interview that war could throw the Islamic world into turmoil and that "a crisis of this kind should be solved by exclusively peaceful means."
 But with equal fervor, the United States now appears to be pulling out all its diplomatic stops in a drive to win a crucial swing vote in the Iraq standoff in the United Nations. 
 American officials have begun what one called the endgame in the Iraq debate this week with a blitz of meetings and conversations with their Russian counterparts. Their message has been that Russian support for the United States could reap tangible benefits in the two nations' new relationship -- and that opposition could leave the Kremlin on the sidelines when reconstruction of Iraq begins after the ouster of Saddam Hussein. 
This intensive courtship reflects the White House's judgment that winning Russian support or neutrality would leave France and China, two other opponents of a military campaign, in the minority among the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. 
Equally important, officials said, Russian support could persuade smaller nations on the 15-member Council to back the resolution now supported only by the Americans, British, Spanish and Bulgarians.
Since Sunday, Under Secretary of State John R. Bolton has pleaded the White House's Iraq case in Moscow before Russia's Foreign Ministry, and President Bush has lobbied Mr. Putin by telephone. Mr. Putin's chief of staff, Aleksandr Voloshin, held an extraordinary round of meetings this week with every major White House figure, from Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.
Bush administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, may fly later to Moscow to present Washington's arguments again to Mr. Putin and Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov, who today in Beijing seemed eager to remind the United States that Russia has veto power in the Security Council, and may use it. 
The Americans face a Kremlin seemingly insistent that the interests of peace -- and of Russia -- can be met only through global consensus in bodies like the United Nations.
"They do understand that how they decide on Iraq is going to have some consequences for U.S.-Russian relations," an administration official said this week of the Russians.
The United States is wooing Mr. Putin with some long-sought inducements. 
A second administration official said Mr. Bush had elevated Congressional repeal of the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which ties Russian trade preferences to its citizens' freedom to emigrate, to one of his top two legislative priorities. 
The amendment is largely symbolic in post-Soviet Russia. But it has been a constant irritant in diplomatic relations and a symbol, to some Russians, of continuing American disdain. Mr. Bush now pledges a repeal by June. 
The State Department answered another major Russian concern today when it designated three Chechen militant groups as terrorist organizations subject to American sanctions. The announcement was the clearest evidence to date of the United States' growing agreement with Russia that the Chechen conflict -- Russia's biggest international black eye -- is not a purely internal rebellion, but is stoked by foreign-financed terrorists.
Beyond those symbolic gains, American officials are arguing, Russia risks real losses should it take the wrong side in what seems likely to be a one-sided war in Iraq.
Other American officials have stated -- while insisting that there is no quid pro quo -- that Iraq's $8 billion foreign debt to Russia and Russia's multibillion-dollar contracts in Iraqi oil fields are at risk should Russia block a Security Council resolution. 
"What we've said is that if you are legitimately concerned with recouping your $8 billion of debt, and if you are interested in economic opportunities in a liberated Iraq, then it would be helpful if you are part of the prevailing coalition," an American official said this week. 
So far, Russia appears unmoved by American blandishments. In addition to Mr. Ivanov's blunt threat of a Russian veto, Mr. Putin said in an interview published tonight in the Bulgarian newspaper Trud that the Islamic world from Pakistan to North Africa "may be swept by instability" should America launch a war without global approval.
Mr. Putin, who has backed the French and Germans in arguing for more time for disarmament inspections and was visited this week by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, argued that Russia's stance against a quick conflict was backed overwhelmingly by the rest of the world.
"I would like to hope that the basic principles of international law will be observed by all members of the international community," he said, "and that on this basis, we can find solutions admissible for everyone without bringing it to a split not only of the international community, but of the antiterror coalition." 
The Kremlin went a step further tonight, posting a statement on its Internet site denouncing as "completely unjustified" United States and British attacks on targets in Iraq's no-flight zones. The statement urged "maximum restraint" on all parties.
The Kremlin has also been working on its own with Iraq, sending a longtime friend of Mr. Hussein, former Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, to Baghdad last Sunday on a one-day mission whose nature is still not publicly known. 
One American official, noting that Mr. Primakov helped secure a monthlong delay in the beginning of the first Persian Gulf war in 1991, called him "a pain in the neck." 
Despite all that, American officials have been consistently optimistic that Russia will eventually drop its opposition to a resolution authorizing war. 
Indeed, in Kiev three weeks ago, Mr. Putin delivered what many saw as a thinly veiled warning to Iraq that Russian opposition to war had its limits. 
Should Iraq not comply fully with United Nations demands to disarm, he said then, "We intend to work with other Security Council members, including the United States, to work out other solutions -- I won't say what kind, but tougher than the existing solutions."

HEADLINE: Rebuked on Global Warming 

 BODY:
Nothing so far has shamed President Bush into adopting a more aggressive policy toward the threat of global warming. He has been denounced by mainstream scientists, deserted by his progressive friends in industry and sued by seven states. Still he clings stubbornly to a voluntary policy aimed at merely slowing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, despite an overwhelming body of evidence that only binding targets and a firm timetable will do the job. 
 Now there is fresh criticism from sources Mr. Bush may find harder to ignore. Last week Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Mr. Bush's most loyal ally in the debate over Iraq, gently but firmly rebuked the president for abandoning the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on global climate change and for succumbing to the insupportable notion that fighting global warming will impede economic growth. 
 That was followed by another salvo, from an expert panel assembled by the National Academy of Sciences to assess Mr. Bush's proposals for further research into climate change. Though polite, the panel could hardly have been more contemptuous. It described Mr. Bush's plan as a redundant examination of issues that had largely been settled, bereft of vision, executable goals and timetables -- in short, little more than a cover-up for inaction.
Of the two rebukes, Mr. Blair's may have been the more painful. The prime minister said he regarded environmental degradation in general and climate change in particular as "just as devastating in their potential impact" as weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. "There will be no genuine security," he said, "if the planet is ravaged." He also pledged to cut Britain's greenhouse gas emissions by 60 percent by midcentury, a longer-range but still a far more ambitious timetable than Kyoto's target of an average 5 percent reduction by industrialized nations by 2012.
Mr. Blair's speech obviously served the political purpose of distancing himself from the White House, at least on this issue, at a time when many of his countrymen have criticized him for his support of Mr. Bush on Iraq. It should also be noted that, in strictly economic terms, it is easier for Mr. Blair to hold the high ground on this issue than it is for Mr. Bush. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's wrenching decision some years ago to convert Britain's energy base from coal to natural gas, a much cleaner fuel, has already moved Britain closer to Mr. Blair's lofty targets than it otherwise would have been.
Nevertheless, the prime minister's approach is everything Mr. Bush's is not. It conveys a sense of urgency, calls for common sacrifice and offers a coherent vision of how to get from here to there. It is, in short, a recipe for the leadership that until not too long ago the world had been looking to America to provide.

HEADLINE: For Lott, Uneasy Role as One of 100 in Senate 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
When he was one of the most powerful men in a city that cherishes power, Trent Lott ruled the Senate chamber from a front-row center seat. Today, as the junior senator from Mississippi, he sits out on the floor next to his fellow Mississippian, Thad Cochran, with whom he has had famously icy relations.
 In the Capitol, Mr. Lott still strolls the Senate floor, bantering with colleagues, some of whom confess privately they feel uncomfortable around him. Back home two weeks ago for an event billed as a roast-toast, he mordantly joked about his fallen political status, asking, "How can they roast toast?" 
 Two months after he was deposed as majority leader in a humiliating fight over racially charged remarks, Mr. Lott cuts an awkward, isolated figure. As he makes the transition from leader to being "one of 100," in Senate parlance, Mr. Lott is the man nobody wants to mention, but who everybody knows is there. 
In Washington, he is keeping his head held high, but his profile low. No longer President Bush's point man for enacting a sweeping Republican agenda, he is instead immersed in the minutiae of the airline industry, reflecting his new position as chairman of the subcommittee overseeing aviation -- a job he got by pushing aside a colleague with less seniority.
He faithfully attends the Senate's weekly Republican policy luncheons, but does not often speak, colleagues say. There, he mingles with the very same men and women who in December turned so publicly against him, an act those close to Mr. Lott say forced him to confront a painful truth of life in Washington: your friends are not always who you think they are.
"We were hurt, yes," Mr. Lott's wife, Tricia, said. "But you go on. We've made new friends, and we were disappointed by some friends."
Mr. Lott, who at 61 has spent nearly half his life, 30 years, in Congress, put it this way: "You're dealing with human beings and politicians. You don't expect perfection and you don't get it. But we're doing fine."
In Mississippi, Mr. Lott is trying to mend fences, both with blacks -- many of whom remain outraged over his remarks at the 100th birthday party of retiring Senator Strom Thurmond -- and whites, particularly conservatives who view his repeated apologies and subsequent embrace of affirmative action as groveling.
When the Senate passed its 2003 appropriations bill, Mr. Lott pushed for $10 million for a controversial flood-control project, the Yazoo pump, which local farmers say is essential to the economy of the Mississippi Delta. He also led an effort to insert $10 million into the bill for historically black colleges, including eight in Mississippi -- a deed that was not lost on the hometown press.
Organizers of the roast, meanwhile, say Mr. Lott refused their offer to back out of the event, a black-tie fund-raiser held by the Mississippi Press Association to raise money for journalism scholarships. It was planned long before "the recent unpleasantness," as Mr. Lott calls the furor over his comments that the nation would have been better off had Mr. Thurmond, who ran for president in 1948 as a segregationist, been elected.
The evening consisted mostly of gentle ribbing from a friendly hometown crowd, with plenty of jokes about birthday parties and Mr. Lott's perfectly coifed hair.
The lieutenant governor, Amy Tuck, presented Mr. Lott with a can of Aqua Net hairspray. And Mr. Lott himself shocked the crowd by running his fingers through his thick locks to prove they were not a toupee.
But there was tension beneath the humor. Before the dinner, well-wishers patted Mr. Lott on the arm and asked how he was doing, as if he were a patient in a hospital bed. Sid Salter, the master of ceremonies and a columnist for The Jackson Clarion-Ledger, said he had been the host of such events for 20 years, and never before felt nervous.
"I've got flop sweat tonight," Mr. Salter confessed. "It's a no-win situation for us and for Trent. If we ignore the elephant in the room, and there is no mention made of the Thurmond incident, then the press association appears to be cowing to a powerful senator. If we say too much, we really rub a guy's nose in his worst political failure."
Many of his friends and colleagues give Mr. Lott credit for staying on in Washington. The easier course, they say, would have been simply to leave. 
Recent history is replete with members of Congress who have quit after their leadership positions were threatened, among them Newt Gingrich and Jim Wright, former speakers of the House, and Robert Livingston, a good friend of Mr. Lott's who left the House just as he was about to ascend to the speaker's job.
"I know that I would have just wanted to leave," said Mr. Livingston, now a lobbyist. "That's not Trent's nature. I give him credit. He had the strength to say, O.K., I've been the leader. Now I go back to being the senator from Mississippi."
Then again, Mr. Lott had little choice but to stay. Had he left, Mr. Lott would have appeared beaten and defeated -- and put Republican control of the Senate in jeopardy. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove of Mississippi, a Democrat, would have inevitably appointed a Democrat to replace Mr. Lott, reducing the number of Republicans to 50 from 51. Now that Haley Barbour, a Republican, is running for governor in Mississippi, some speculate Mr. Lott might quit if Mr. Barbour wins.
Others say he would never leave, and might even fancy himself leader once again.
"He has done so much to build the Republican Party in the state of Mississippi and the nation as a whole that he would be unable to walk off and leave it," said Marty Wiseman, director of the Stennis Institute, a public policy center at Mississippi State University. "And he knows as well as anybody that politically, the worm can turn."
Close friends of Mr. Lott's say he is reconciled with the loss of the leader's seat, and is willing and eager to move on. "I think he's very much at peace with himself," said Connie Mack, the former Republican senator from Florida. "He believes he was elected by the people of Mississippi to represent the state, and he's determined to do that."
At an all-day Republican gathering on Jan. 6, the day before the Senate convened for its first day of business, Mr. Lott stood up and declared he would advise his successor, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, in any way he could. Mr. Lott said in a brief interview that he had made good on that promise, counseling Dr. Frist on matters like parliamentary procedure and how to manage the outsize egos and delicate personalities that make up the Senate.
"I have made it a practice of studying people very carefully," Mr. Lott said, "and sometimes I can warn him when he's fixing to get in trouble."
Yet at the same time, Mr. Lott has not shied away from putting himself at odds with Dr. Frist. Recently, he introduced legislation that would block the Tennessee Valley Authority from borrowing money unless it comes up with a 10-year business plan -- a bill strongly opposed by Dr. Frist. One prominent Republican in Mississippi said people there viewed it as an attempt by Mr. Lott to extract some revenge.
"He's thinking, 'I'm going to gig Frist a little bit,' " this person said. "It's payback time."
In his new life as Mississippi's junior senator, Mr. Lott has lost the trappings of being leader except for his Senate car and driver, which the Capitol's sergeant-at-arms deemed necessary because there had been threats against him.
He now works out of a mundane office in the Senate Russell building, a far cry from the ornate Capitol suite he once held. Once, he was surrounded by a protective entourage of fellow senators and aides. Reporters trailed him in the painted hallways of the Capitol, arms extended, tape recorders rolling to capture his every word. Now Mr. Lott walks those hallways alone. 
"It's actually very poignant," said one Republican Senate aide.
Once, lobbyists vied for a few minutes of Mr. Lott's precious time, only to find themselves meeting his aides instead. Now, they say they have little trouble getting in to see him.
"Let's put it this way," said Mr. Livingston, who recently paid Mr. Lott a visit. "He gave my client more than enough time."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: STANDOFF; 
U.S. Sees Quick Start of North Korea Nuclear Site

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's experts on North Korea and intelligence officials have told President Bush that they expect that in the next few weeks the North will turn on the reprocessing plant that can produce weapons-grade plutonium.
 The officials say they believe that North Korea might time the move to coincide with the start of any military action against Iraq, a moment when the North may think that the United States is distracted. 
 Spy satellites show a steady stream of activity around the reprocessing plant, and detected a test last month of the power system that would have to be activated before the country's stockpile of 8,000 spent fuel rods could be turned into plutonium, according to several officials with access to the intelligence. A senior official described the activity as "checking off the list, one by one."
"Once they start reprocessing, it's a bomb a month from now until summer," he concluded. After impoverished North Korea has enough plutonium to create what it considers a credible nuclear threat, deputy secretary of state Richard L. Armitage warned Congress earlier this month, it could sell plutonium to "a nonstate actor or a rogue state." 
So, as American troops prepare for possible war with Iraq, Mr. Bush's top intelligence officials have begun to depart from the White House effort to play down the North Korea problem in public, describing the situation as a "crisis." The director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Adm. Lowell E. Jacoby, said this could be "the most serious challenge to U.S. interests in the Northeast Asia area in a generation."
Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has said that while he was concerned about North Korea's action this week to restart the nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, which could produce the raw material for a bomb, restarting the reprocessing facility would be "a disaster." 
It would, he said, permit the country to "produce several atomic bombs in half a year." 
The urgency of the threat has sharpened a behind-the-scenes struggle within the administration over how to deal with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il. A parade of current and former officials -- including Gen. Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser in the first Bush administration, and former Defense Secretary William J. Perry, who was special envoy for the Clinton administration on North Korea -- have warned in recent weeks that the current White House approach is failing, and that time is not on Mr. Bush's side.
Several of these officials have approached top Bush administration aides, including Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, to warn that the administration will ultimately have to negotiate directly with the North -- a step Mr. Bush has refused to take, unless North Korea begins first to disarm.
Mr. Armitage, who has long experience with North Korea, used his testimony in Congress to try to expand that strategy, and his efforts left Mr. Bush "off-the-wall angry," said a senior administration official, whose account was corroborated by several White House officials.
Mr. Armitage praised President Bill Clinton's 1994 deal with North Korea for preventing earlier bomb-making by the North, and he endorsed "a bilateral discussion" with the country under "a multilateral umbrella, of any sort."
Mr. Armitage's testimony led to a meeting at the White House at which Mr. Bush directed Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other officials to ban all public discussion of one-on-one talks with the North. North Korea has so far refused to sit down with any broad group of nations. 
The result is that while North Korea is accelerating its nuclear programs, there is virtually no conversation under way. "We're at the point," said one official involved in the internal debate, "where nothing is happening -- and no one knows how we will respond when the bomb-making starts."
The encounter with Mr. Armitage was the only public glimpse of what many officials describe as a deep divide over Mr. Bush's strategy to force North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions.
Although they will not talk for quotation about the subject in detail, Mr. Bush's top national security aides reject the criticism that they have let Mr. Kim take control of events.
They argue that each new provocation by the North, and certainly the start of weapons production, will convince China, Russia and South Korea that they must take collective action -- and that collective sanctions are the only leverage the West has. The Chinese, one senior White House official argues, "are already moving that way, quietly."
But the evidence to support that argument is scant, and in its first week in office, South Korea's new government has said it will embrace deeper engagement with the North.
Mr. Bush is taking the exact opposite course. In a safe in an office down the hall from the Oval Office, one senior official keeps a list of options for squeezing the North -- everything from cutting off cash from Japan and trade with China, to ordering what officials call "maritime interdiction" of the North's lucrative missile exports.
But each turn of the screws requires the help of reluctant allies who believe sanctions will only inflame Mr. Kim. "Without the agreement of the South Koreans, it is simply not going to happen," a senior Japanese official said. "I can't imagine we could engage in such an activity, which would be so close to military action."
Even as the Yongbyon nuclear site comes alive, officials at the White House and Pentagon insist a diplomatic solution is still within reach.
But Mr. Bush is clearly trying to sow some concern among North Korea's leaders that the United States could be provoked into a precision strike on the single, above-ground reprocessor building. He has, in recent weeks, begun twinning his reassurances that the United States has "no intention of invading" North Korea with a warning that he would keep "all military options open."
Several Korea experts note that in the parlance of the Bush administration, a guarantee against "invasion" is different from a guarantee against a precision attack. But the administration considers an attack on Yongbyon a risk that would require huge reinforcements to the 37,000 American troops already on the Korean peninsula in case North Korea responded by launching a general war. In internal meetings at the White House and the State Department, several officials have cautioned that any unilateral strike over South Korea's objections could terminate the 50-year alliance between Washington and Seoul.
The administration's options, a senior official acknowledged, "range from the deeply unsatisfying to the incredibly risky."
Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld has put American bombers on a special "alert" status, for possible deployment to Guam, if tensions with North Korea rise during the Iraq confrontation.
Advance logistical units for those planes have already been put in place on the island, military officials say, though the aircraft remain in the United States. Other American military assets in the Pacific have been redeployed, so that North Korea is in easy range.
The White House has stopped short of taking steps that Mr. Armitage described in a bipartisan report, published in 1999, and that Gen. Scowcroft, Mr. Perry and a range of other experts have advocated. Mr. Armitage's approach, quicklydubbed "more for more," called for the United States to define a "red line"-- reprocessing nuclear material, for instance -- that North Korea cannot cross without provoking a potential military response while at the same time describing in detail diplomatic and economic benefits that could come from complete dismantlement of the nuclear program.
Mr. Armitage declined to talk about his 1999 proposals or the current debate. General Scowcroft wrote recently, "We cannot afford to defer this issue," and called for one-on-one talks to get a freeze on nuclear activities during negotiations to restore the nuclear inspectors expelled on New Year's Eve, remove the 8,000 spent fuel rods and curb missile exports.
"If you won't talk to them you won't get a freeze," General Scowcroft said recently. Like Mr. Armitage, he said he had no doubt the North Koreans would sell their plutonium. 
To Mr. Bush, engaging in such talks is giving in to nuclear blackmail. 
"The problem with a red line," one senior administration official said, "is that North Korea will walk right up to it." 
Another official said the White House is worried that its major Asian allies would not join in such a warning. South Korea fears North Korean retaliation; Chinese officials tell American visitors that they fear prompting a collapse of North Korea, and a greater flood of poor and hungry refugees. 
All this helps explain, officials say, why Mr. Bush still refuses to call the situation a crisis. He has noted at National Security Council meetings, officials present at the sessions say, that a one-on-one confrontation with the United States is exactly what Mr. Kim is seeking. "Why tell the other guy he's gotten your attention so much?" Mr. Armitage said in his Congressional testimony.
Mr. Kim, however, seems intent on getting that attention -- by beginning to expand his nuclear arsenal from two weapons that the C.I.A. believes North Korea produced in the early 1990's, to eight or more now. "At the end of this," one American official predicts, "he may get one of two things he doesn't have now: a good-sized nuclear arsenal, like Pakistan's, or direct talks with the United States."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DIPLOMACY; 
U.S. SAYS HUSSEIN MUST CEDE POWER TO HEAD OFF WAR

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER with DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
The White House said today that the only way to prevent war in Iraq would be to disarm the country and depose Saddam Hussein.
 At the same time, Russia's foreign minister threatened to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution that says Iraq has missed its last chance of avoiding war. 
 The hardening of positions on both sides increases the pressure on the six uncommitted members of the Security Council, who have looked to the work of Hans Blix, one of the chief United Nations weapons inspectors, for guidance on Iraqi compliance. Mr. Blix's latest report, formally delivered to Council members today, gives ammunition to both sides and does not offer the kind of unambiguous judgment that could help resolve the doubts of those who are wavering. Excerpts, Page A8. 
France and Russia seized on Iraq's decision "in principle" to begin destroying its 120 or so short-range Al Samoud 2 missiles as further evidence that the inspections process was working. Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said today that President Bush was hopeful that war could be averted, but that to escape military action, Iraq must disarm and Mr. Hussein must be deposed.
That combination of events, he said, looked highly unlikely.
Pressed on the point, Mr. Fleischer said both would be necessary conditions because disarmament was the United Nations' goal and changing Iraq's government was the president's.
The statement puts the United States on a different track from the United Nations, whose resolutions have been concerned with the immediate and unconditional disarmament, not with a change of government in Baghdad.
Mr. Fleischer told reporters today that Iraq must "completely and totally" disarm or its leaders must "go into exile."
Later, asked whether Mr. Bush's standard for war goes beyond that of the United Nations, Mr. Fleischer said, "It's disarmament and regime change." 
He noted that Mr. Bush had predicted a token move by Mr. Hussein to alleviate pressure and to try to divide the Security Council. He said, "the Iraqi actions are propaganda, wrapped in a lie, inside a falsehood," a play on Churchill's famous 1939 remark about Russia. The Canadian prime minister, Jean Chretien, in Mexico City where he is consulting on the Iraq issue, said today with visible agitation: "If you start changing regimes, where do you stop, this is the problem? Who is next? Give me the list, the priorities."
Hours before Mr. Fleischer spoke, the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, derided the variety of America's stated goals for Iraq. "The talk now is not about disarmament but about a change of regime," Mr. Ivanov said to reporters in Beijing. "In recent days, the military option against Iraq is posed like a step aimed at democratic transformations in the Arab world." 
Mr. Ivanov added that "Russia has the right to veto" and "will use it if it is necessary in the interests of international stability." 
"Russia will not support a resolution or resolutions which directly or indirectly open a way towards a power solution of the Iraqi problem," Mr. Ivanov said. 
The United States, Britain and Spain introduced a resolution Monday in the Security Council. It needs nine votes to pass. A veto would kill it.
In Madrid, the British prime minister, Tony Blair, derided Iraq's pledge of cooperation, saying, "This is not a time for games." At the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el Sheik, Arab League leaders met to try to formulate a unified response to the prospect of war.
Egypt's foreign minister, Ahmed Maher, speaking to reporters, welcomed Iraq's announcement about the missiles, but called on Mr. Hussein's government to cooperate fully with United Nations resolutions. He and other diplomats, however, dismissed a suggestion made Thursday by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell that the league should prod Mr. Hussein to step down.
Some Arab states, led by Syria, continued to press for a resolution that would oppose the use of force to resolve the crisis, and would call on Iraq's neighbors to deny the use of their military bases, according to participants in the talks. Countries where those forces have already massed, including Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar, however, support a strong resolution calling on Iraq to comply.
Mr. Blix's latest report, which outlines the inspectors' work and Iraqi reactions during the last three months, outlined a litany of spotty Iraqi cooperation on the destruction of weapons. The Iraqis, the report said, are destroying "small known quantities" of mustard gas under inspectors' supervision, and have identified two R-400 aerial bombs that were left intact when 118 others were destroyed at a site called Al Aziziyah.
It added: "It is hard to understand why a number of the measures, which are now being taken could not have been initiated earlier. If they had been taken earlier, they might have borne fruit by now."
The report also said, "The results in terms of disarmament have been very limited so far."
Mr. Blix, in a brief conversation with reporters this morning, called the Iraqis' decision to destroy the Samoud missiles "a very significant piece of real disarmament."
His deputy, Demetrius Perricos, was in Baghdad today to oversee the initial phases of the missiles' destruction.
Mr. Blix's report was delivered to the various United Nations missions this afternoon, and few of the envoys contacted had read it.
Among those who had seen it was Sergey Lavrov, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations. Asked today if Iraq had complied with disarmament demands, he said: "I believe they have been complying. They have not fully satisfied the remaining issues, but the steps which they have taken so far, especially in the last weeks, are steps in the right direction."
Mr. Fleischer insisted that Russia's statements were "not an indication that there will be a veto," and another senior White House official said there were indications that Russia might, eventually, come over to the side of the United States.
But clearly the Bush administration is scurrying for votes. Today it indicated that it was preparing to recognize Bulgaria, another member of the Council, as a "market economy," a move that would bring it a number of trading benefits with the United States. Bulgaria is one of the countries that have been showered with Washington's attentions in recent days, as the jockeying for votes increases.
The Bulgarian envoy to the United Nations, Stefan Tafrov, said this evening. "We are trying to achieve the unity of the Council to the extent possible. We believe that Iraq is in material breach and the Council should put on more pressure." Bulgaria has been considered a sure vote for the pending resolution, but its diplomats have been careful not to commit themselves publicly.
France, Russia and Germany have offered the Council an alternate suggestion -- though not in the form of a resolution -- which envisages another four months of inspections. 
France or Russia could block the British-American-Spanish resolution with vetos, or simply by obtaining 7 of the 15 Council votes.

HEADLINE: Celebration Berlin 

BYLINE:  By William Murray; William Murray is the author of "City of the Soul: A Walk in Rome" (Crown).

 BODY:
Berlin, in the warmer months, is an open-air festival, its youthful population swarming through the streets on bicycles or sitting at its many outdoor cafes. Who would have believed it? The city has risen from the ruins of World War II, reconstituting itself practically minute by minute as a hub of art and culture. Reunited as the nation's capital, Berlin has become an international center to rival Paris, London and New York.

The Mood
 Apart from the sheer energy that seems to emanate from the very stones here, my first reaction as I drove into Berlin a few months ago was amazement at its size. The city is as large as New York, spread out in a seemingly haphazard fashion in every direction, crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the elevated rail lines of its superb transportation system. Three and a half million people of 184 nationalities live and work here, making their way to and from their homes and jobs through great agglomerations of new housing projects, government buildings and corporate towers. 
 This daily scene reflects the elan of a population relentlessly on the move toward the future. And yet Berlin cannot refute its tragic past -- nor does it try to. All over the city are reminders, like the bomb-ruined tower of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Memorial Church, the plaque near the Zoo Station listing the names of all the concentration camps and, on the Operaplatz, the simple, moving memorial to the Nazi book burnings: a pane of glass through which the viewer looks down at rows of symbolically empty bookshelves. Then there is the elegant villa, set in a park in suburban Wannsee, where a well-documented exhibit recalls the conference of Nazi leaders there on Jan. 20, 1942, when the extermination of Europe's Jews was decided.
The Jewish Museum on Lindenstrasse, in what used to be called the eastern sector, holds a scrupulously assembled collection that recalls the history of the Jewish community in Germany. It is mostly on display in a reconstructed 18th-century courthouse. More exhibition areas are in an adjacent new building linked to the old one by a tunnel, a stunning zigzag-shaped design by the architect Daniel Libeskind that ultimately leads to the Holocaust Tower. I entered not knowing what to expect and found myself standing suddenly in total silence and darkness, transfixed. That silence, that darkness convey the full horror of the victims' fate more eloquently than any photograph.
Berlin is now a new city, full of young people who quite rightly feel no direct responsibility for the atrocities committed by others in a now distant past. They are more prone to remember with pride their 30-year resistance to the East German Communist regime sheltering itself behind the hideous wall it built in 1961. The structure cut off about a third of the city and led to the slaughter of more than 200 would-be fugitives. A few segments remain as a reminder, as does Checkpoint Charlie, an adjacent museum and, most eloquently, a row of white crosses where some of the victims were gunned down.
An irony of history is that Berlin has almost always been considered a tolerant and liberal town, from its earliest days as a village on the banks of the River Spree. When it became a city in 1709, it readily accepted foreigners, including many Jews and thousands of French Huguenots fleeing persecution in their own country. Today the city's traditional tolerance is reflected in its politics, extremely liberal by American standards. There are daily peaceful demonstrations of one sort or another -- on the day I visited the newly reopened Brandenburg Gate, a gaggle of distressed dentists, dressed in their white smocks, had gathered under waving banners to denounce a new tax law. 
Berliners, who often speak to one another in dialect, have a rough, aggressive sense of humor, but everywhere I went with my pidgin German I found them to be unfailingly courteous and helpful. They can be funny and sarcastic about their 
own excesses, by referring, for instance, to the two enormous new office towers built by their big auto companies as "Notre Daimler" and "Big Benz." Still, to me the humor seems essentially benign.
Perhaps this is because Berlin is not unlike a huge village. A third of the city is green. The public park of the Tiergarten is a large forest in the middle of town and to the west is the Grunewald, more than 12 square miles of woods traversed by hiking trails and bicycle paths and dotted by unpolluted lakes and streams. 
"Berlin is very vital but still has the feeling of an island," a German novelist explained to me. "We don't even have a major airport yet. And we don't have honking traffic jams or motor scooters running up our backs."

The Food
German cuisine is not noted for its delicacy, and Berlin's is no exception. The local dishes are robust and challenging, featuring mainly pork. Sausages, chops and various kinds of meat dumplings are accompanied by side orders of red cabbage and sauerkraut. Also on the menus are potato dishes heavy enough to anchor a ship. My first meal on this trip to Berlin, served in a small local brewery a few blocks from my hotel, found me confronting an enormous ham hock that could have easily fed a family of four. 
The beer, of course, was excellent.
Berliners don't sit down to eat these huge meals every day. During working hours they tend to favor lighter fare and, like city dwellers everywhere, eat on the run, often standing up at fast-food places such as the imbiss (snack) stalls that serve German sausages as well as Greek gyros and Turkish kebabs. A favorite of Berliners is currywurst, a sausage liberally sprinkled with curry powder and accompanied by French fries. In Berlin this is considered a snack.
Some of the best places to eat in Berlin are at the food stalls in the covered markets at Wilmersdorferstrasse in the fashionable residential area of Charlottenburg and on Marheinkeplatz in Kreuzberg, a lively working-class district in East Berlin. Both markets offer up mouthwatering displays of fresh produce, meats, poultry, fish, cheeses and every kind of delicacy. The specialties are international, reflecting the influx into the city in recent years of workers and immigrants from all over the world.
This diversity is what makes Berlin a great dining town. There are, as in any world capital, the usual expensive restaurants for corporate types and well-heeled tourists, but the real pleasures are to be experienced in the scores of smaller, more intimate places now scattered about in every quarter. The Charlottenburg district alone is peppered with Italian, French, Greek, Cambodian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Malaysian, Japanese, Vietnamese and Mexican bistros, mostly very reasonably priced. My first night in the city, my wife, Alice, and I wandered into the XII Apostoli, where we shared a salad and a pizza as crisp and delicious as any I've ever eaten in Naples. The room was packed with young people cheerfully munching away on pizzas and calzones, simple or topped and stuffed with all sorts of ingredients.
Restaurants, cafes and bars are popping up all over town with such bewildering speed that it's almost impossible to keep up with which ones are in and with which clientele, trendy or otherwise. In East Berlin, now experiencing a culinary boom, we ate one night at Monsieur Vuong, a noisy, cheerful spot crammed with a mostly younger crowd wolfing down the best Vietnamese food I'd ever tasted. And the best local cooking we came across was at the Risacher in Savignyplatz, where we sat on benches at a plain wooden table to eat roast goose accompanied by a fine French claret.
A great place to eat at midday was the top floor of the KaDeWe department store in midtown near the enormous Europa Center. KaDeWe is a contraction of Kaufhaus des Westens (Department Store of the West) and bills itself as the largest such emporium on the Continent. The sixth floor consists entirely of a food hall larger than the one at Harrods in London, and its choice displays of staples and delicacies are awe-inspiring. Scattered about among the counters are stands and small enclaves that serve all sorts of dishes, like caviars and elaborate omelets. Watching the chefs wielding their pots, pans and spatulas with the skill of trained jugglers is alone worth the modest price of the meals.
And if you're a chocolate freak, the place for you is Fassbender und Rausch on Mohrenstrasse, the largest chocolate shop in Europe. Not only is every kind of chocolate available, but citizens can indulge their patriotic frenzies by buying scale models of the Reichstag or the Brandenburg Gate to nibble off a cornice or a column or two on their way home.

The Style
For well over a century, style in Berlin reflected the architectural conceits of Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1781-1841), who, between 1815 and 1830, designed most of the city's famous public buildings and churches. He favored a strictly neo-Classical approach that featured large porticos resting on Doric or Ionic colonnades. His buildings, newly restored, accurately reflect the political and imperial ambitions of Prussia.
Berliners today, however, are more drawn to an environment of space and light. They like to stroll down their great boulevards such as the Kurfurstendamm, with its elegant shops and cafes. The familiar old Ku'damm, though, is now just one of many such focal points, as the major thrust of redevelopment and construction has shifted east, where some of the world's most celebrated architects are designing a new city.
An open, airy flow of government buildings known as the Band des Bundes is rising along the banks of the Spree. At Potsdamer Platz, one of Europe's busiest squares, the work of redevelopment has been going on since 1990, practically from the day the wall came down. The German-American architect Helmut Jahn has created the Sony Center, with a 26-story skyscraper and a spectacular oval roof floating over a central plaza. The Daimler-Benz area was entrusted to the Italian Renzo Piano, who created the 18-story triangular building thrust like the prow of an ocean liner toward the viewer approaching Potsdamer Platz from the west.
Everywhere I went I came upon something new and remarkable -- Frank Gehry's asymmetrical glass atrium for the DG Bank, for example, or Jean Nouvel's gleaming curved facade for the Galeries Lafayette. Even the failures are interesting, like the stolid sandstone block of the Adlon Hotel on Unter den Linden, the unimaginative recreation of a hostelry so luxurious that, according to Berliners, "the waiters tip each other."
Only two or three other cities in the world can offer up such a rich variety of artistic and cultural enterprises as Berlin, with three symphony orchestras, several chamber music ensembles, three opera houses, a ballet company, traditional theater companies (including the Berliner Ensemble), a host of experimental theater groups and an active cabaret scene. 
During my stay I attended a lustily booed performance of Verdi's "Nabucco" at the Deutsche Oper, in which, among other calamities, the Priests of Babylon appeared on stage costumed as bumblebees, but it was compensated for two nights later by an electrifying evening of Beethoven trios at the Philharmonie in the Tiergarten.
Berlin's museums are among the most extraordinary anywhere. The Agyptisches Museum contains the treasures dug up by German archaeologists in Egypt, including its most prized piece, the bust of Nefertiti. Museum Island in the east is home to four institutions, the most famous of which houses the ancient Greek Pergamon Altar, dug up in western Turkey, and the Ishtar Gate from Babylon. Days could be spent wandering around the Kulturforum museum complex, just west of Potsdamer Platz, where the Neue Nationalgalerie, designed by Mies van der Rohe in 1965, is itself a work of art, a simple shimmering glass box that seems to float lightly above the ground.
Although the German economy has been in disarray and the unemployment rate is high, Berlin is still a city on the move, its eyes fixed on the future. To me the most potent symbol of this attitude is the remodeled Reichstag. Originally built in 1884, the ponderous structure was crowned by a glass dome topped by the imperial crest and functioned off and on through its turbulent history as the seat of Parliament. When Berlin again became the country's capital, Sir Norman Foster, the British architect, was called on to design a new roof. After much wrangling with the politicians, he eventually came up with a masterpiece, a dome of steel, glass and mirrors with gently sloping ramps along which visitors can stroll either to gaze out over the whole city or down at the lawmakers in session directly below. Thus Berlin is asked to look out 
at the world and also into its very soul.

HEADLINE: PHILADELPHIA STREETS, REFINED AND LESS SO 

BYLINE:  By Ken Kalfus; Ken Kalfus is the author of "The Commissariat of Enlightenment" (Ecco/HarperCollins).

 BODY:
For a walk through one of America's last great walking cities, you should begin at the goat -- a small, eminently climbable bronze figure on the west side of Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square. I've been coming to the goat for years, ever since my daughter, Sky, was a newborn, and it was at the goat, as a parent, that I was reintroduced to the city's distinct charms. 
 Then, as now, parents sat on the half-circle bench surrounding the statue, compared notes and made friends, while their children sunned themselves in their strollers. The goat attracted the children as soon as they learned to stand, and this attraction soon translated into the desire to shinny onto its rough, prickly back, safe only to someone in diapers. It eventually became a starting point for Halloween trick or treating and snowman building, as well as for excursions with friends to the neighborhood's stylish restaurants and one-of-a-kind shops and museums, and for purposeless strolls through its leafy, elegant streets. A crop of new kids worships at the statue every spring. 
 Rittenhouse Square holds the center of a thriving neighborhood that is simultaneously homey and cosmopolitan, reserved and lively, in a city of distinct, character-rich neighborhoods, many of which are easily accessible on foot. 
The city's scale is human, its sights engage the eye at street level, the downtown's compact, and there's always something noshable on the next block. You can spend days, or weeks, exploring Philadelphia without boarding a single wheeled conveyance.
Named after the 18th-century Philadelphia astronomer David Rittenhouse, Rittenhouse Square took its present form in 1913 under the guidance of Paul Philippe Cret, a French-born architect who drew his inspiration from the Parc Monceau in Paris. The square's promenades are wide and tree-shaded, welcoming at different times of the day diverse visitors, including lunchtime office workers, the elderly and, particularly at dusk, congregations of young people. 
The goat, cast in 1914 and christened "Billy" by the sculptor Albert Laessle, is kept company by other sculptures scattered throughout the park, many of which are perfect for climbing. My daughter, now 10, has graduated to "Lion Crushing a Serpent," by the French sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye, who in 1832 cast the statue in a pro-monarchist frame of mind: the serpent is meant to represent the democratic rabble. Sky loves the statue, imposing her own allegory and calling it Aslan, after the lion in C. S. Lewis's Narnia books.
The streets to the east, west and south of Rittenhouse Square are primarily residential, some of them little more than short, straight lanes lined by doll-size row houses. Of the larger streets, the finest is probably Delancey Street with its unbroken blocks of Victorian brownstone town houses. Philadelphia's best 19th-century architects -- Frank Furness, John Notman, George Watson Hewitt and William D. Hewitt -- designed these homes, often topping them with castlelike turrets and gables that have been caringly restored and preserved. The characteristic Furness home, like the Thomas Hockley house, a private residence at 235 South 21st Street, startles you with its riot of multihued bricks and sandstone.
These precincts harbor one of the city's most distinguished museums, devoted to rare books and exceptional authors. The Rosenbach Museum and Library, two Victorian brownstones on the 2000 block of Delancey, contains within its antique-furnished interior a wide collection of manuscripts and first editions, as well as temporary exhibits celebrating famous literary lives. It's been closed for renovation, but will reopen April 6 with a show of Maurice Sendak's work, including the original art for "Where the Wild Things Are."
The Rosenbach's main prize is James Joyce's handwritten manuscript of "Ulysses," frequently consulted by scholars attempting to determine whether the brilliant multilingual puns in the published versions of his novel are, in fact, typos. If the date happens to be June 16, Bloomsday, the anniversary of Leopold Bloom's epic walk through Dublin in 1904, an amphitheaterof folding chairs is laid out on Delancey in front of the museum. Throughout the day a rotating cast of Philadelphians read bits from the novel, accompanied by music of the period. (You may be reminded that Philadelphia, with its modest size, its row houses with their handsome doors, its traditional lunch-pail economy and its second-fiddle relations with its empire's cultural capital, is a city very much like Joyce's.) 
When visiting friends and I circle back through these decorous streets, I sometimes like to confront them with the indecorous, stopping at the neighborhood's other trove of exotica, the Mutter Museum of medical curiosities on 22nd Street. Established in the 19th century within the College of Physicians of Philadelphia to provide future doctors with samples of medical pathologies, the museum is home to several thousand bones and human anatomical specimens preserved in fluid, as well as wax models and medical memorabilia. Among the jars of abnormal fetuses, a wall of skulls and casts of organs marred by syphilitic sores, several displays are dedicated to conjoined twins and include a plaster model of Chang and Eng Bunker, the 19th-century Siamese who made the medical phenomenon famous.
At this point you probably want a cup of coffee, if only to settle your stomach. You can obtain one in La Colombe, a smart cafe on 19th Street, just north of Rittenhouse Square, founded by two friends, one from Nice, France, and the other from Seattle, who apparently chose the equidistant point most in need of a decent espresso. Philadelphia's public spaces and architecture have been largely inspired by Paris, but in this city there's nothing more French than La Colombe. Its Left Bankedness may be defined by the beguiling accents heard above the clamor, the dark wood bar, the rough terra-cotta-colored walls, the monthly rotating artwork, the two four-spout espresso machines, the chic women and the roguish, world-weary, stubble-encrusted men. The thick cigarette smoke seems predominantly Gauloise.
Now, heading east toward Broad Street, you enter a district of serious drinking, dining and shopping. On the east side of Rittenhouse Square bustle two affiliated restaurants, Rouge and Bleu, along with a busy third, Devon, which is tucked between them and has rebuffed all temptations to change its name to Blanc. Past them, you must run a Walnut Street gantlet of clothing and accessory stores. Some of the big chains, like the Gap and Banana Republic, maintain outposts in the neighborhood, along with smaller retailers like Anthropologie, Joan Shepp, Plage Tahiti and Knit Wit.
At Broad Street, regardless of whether you're carrying tickets to a cultural event, you find yourself drawn inside the new Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, the 150-foot-high block-size glass music shed that was opened in 2001. Built to the edge of the street line on all sides, the Kimmel is meant to be approached on foot. It's a glorious project, a transparent jewel box that encases two state-of-the-art performance halls, including the new home of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and a large indoor plaza that churns with concertgoers and other visitors. The curved roof's lattice of structural supports and the lines of the interior halls create startling vistas of glass, wood, chrome and sky wherever you stand. Philadelphians have yet to embrace the Kimmel fully, and this may be attributed to provincial churlishness -- if it's here, it can't be good -- but in the plaza visitors gaze skyward and pronounce words like "spectacular," "amazing" and "wow." 
Now that we've stretched our legs around Rittenhouse Square, we can try another, more direct excursion, up through the South Philadelphia Italian Market to the carnival midway of South Street. This itinerary is designed to stimulate your gastric juices and make small, gentle tugs on your wallet. My daughter joins me, first stipulating that we acquire some Italian Market prosciutto on the way. 
The market extends down Ninth Street deep into South Philadelphia, a section of the city increasingly claimed by diverse ethnicities. At Washington Avenue, however, we look up Ninth into a tunnel of noise and color that is overwhelmingly Italian. The names of the family-owned businesses stenciled on the shop windows all end in vowels, and the market's sidewalk stalls are roofed by corrugated metal sheeting in the red and green of the Italian flag. Mounds of fruit and vegetables, their prices handwritten on cardboard, are piled high. Flames in open barrels warm the vendors, who shout at us, "Whaddaya need? Whaddaya need?"
It's difficult to maintain our pace up the sidewalks -- other shoppers stop to chat or to inspect the merchandise or, with violent suddenness, to change direction in search of a slightly more perfect eggplant. The meat shops, offering diverse fresh meats, are mostly in two- and three-story row houses of distinguished vintage. The out-of-town visitor may suspect that the alligator filets from D'Angelo Brothers won't travel well, but he shouldn't be dissuaded from stocking up at the Italian Market's cheese stores, Talluto's, Di Bruno's or Claudio's. Maelstroms of commercial ferment, where the staffers and patrons shout the names of delicacies at each other like epithets -- Soppressatta!" "Fontinella!" -- the stores offer cheese and cured meats from all over the world, as well as olive oils representing just about every possible degree of virginity. 
Di Bruno's always lays out little trays of samples. Sky tries some venison pate impaled on a toothpick and comes back for seconds and thirds. Avoid freelance sampling. At Claudio's, a cardboard sign warns, "Shoplifting can get you killed."
As we move up the street, taking a small taste of our obligatory prosciutto di Parma and contemplating how it's basically ambrosia with nitrates, we're confronted by a curious image from the recent past. It's Frank Rizzo, the city's 1970's law-and-order mayor, portrayed in a mural that stands at least 30 feet high and takes up a full side of a building that was formerly a meat market. Rizzo often shocked the rest of the city with his strong-arm tactics and inflammatory language, but South Philly was his home and political base. In this towering painting, commissioned by the city's antigraffiti agency, a mediocre likeness of Rizzo glowers, a strangely depopulated Italian Market fading into the distance behind him.
The prosciutto serves only as an appetizer, and now we're both hungry. Among the many eating places in the neighborhood, my favorite is Shank's & Evelyn's Luncheonette, a narrow, warm family-run sandwich shop on 10th Street. The sisters, daughters and nieces who run the shop construct elaborate hoagies and gorgeous, steaming cheese steaks, but today I order stuffed peppers smothered in "gravy" -- the South Philadelphia word for red sauce. Sky predictably asks for a prosciutto sandwich. The wall opposite the counter displays pictures of visiting celebrities, including Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton; dissonantly, there's a small bust of Mussolini hanging from the ceiling at the entrance to the kitchen.
From the Italian Market it's a brief, pleasant stroll to the environs of South Street, celebrated in a 1963 hit record as "the hippest street in town." Tawdry, vulgar and entirely commercial, it offers a picture of youth culture at this precise moment. On weekend nights the young crowds shuffle from comic book store to pretzel store to Goth-themed clothing store. Walking east from Seventh Street, you can make a stop on each block and get a different part of your body pierced. (I tell Sky, however, that she can't, ever.)
Shops with names like Erogenous Zone, the Mood, Condom Kingdom and the Candy Store sell lingerie and provocative toys. Atomic City Comics has two rooms of comic books, as well as Japanese anime and graphic novels; there's a great variety in the titles, except that in all of them everyone's clothes are several sizes too small. On weekends, Atomic City welcomes game enthusiasts to four long tables that dominate the store's second room. Today the players, somewhat stiltedly declaiming at each other, are role-playing their way through Dungeons and Dragons. Sky asks for the latest issue of "Betty and Veronica." The two women, we quickly discern, are still fighting over Archie.
The greatest asset to the South Street area is its independent music stores and their recordings produced by independent labels for independent audiences. The Theater of the Living Arts, between Third and Fourth Streets, offers a program of live music nearly every night. Headlined by performers and groups thriving within eddies and currents apart from the mainstream, the shows frequently sell out. Some shops, like Spaceboy Music, from time to time also invite musicians to play. Beyond the gimcrack glitter of South Street, beyond the posturing alienated and the grunge-fashionable, you may hear, if you listen hard enough, something completely original.
It's a 10-minute stroll from South Street to the historic attractions in the Independence Hall vicinity, an area undergoing large-scale renovation. A new Independence Visitors' Center has recently opened, to be followed on July 4 by the National Constitution Center, a museum celebrating and explaining that document. The African-American Museum, the United States Mint, the Liberty Museum and other destinations are close by, and only a few blocks away lies Old City, a neighborhood of restaurants and art galleries that are open late on the first Friday of every month, when the entire quarter seems like a single slightly pretentious cocktail party.
Farther north is the Northern Liberties, the glacially gentrifying fringe of Philadelphia artistic settlement. We could walk for days: for example, down West Philadelphia streets lined with 19th-century mansions, or in the unspoiled woods above Wissahickon Creek.
But Sky and I head no farther than Pine Street, to a pedestrian lane we know between Third and Fourth Streets called St. Peter's Way, across from the 18th-century St. Peter's Church. The passage leads into Three Bears Park, named after another climbable sculpture, which welcomes us to a modest playground and some comfortable benches. The concrete bears hardly challenge Sky's alpine skills and she may be too old for the swings, but she obliges me by going off to them anyway. She knows I have to rest my legs.

 ALL ELSE EQUAL
Are Public and Private
Schools Different?
By Luis Benveniste, Martin Carnoy and Richard Rothstein.
206 pp. New York:
RoutledgeFalmer.
Paper, $19.95.
 EDUCATION reform is a swamp of contentious issues and simplistic answers waiting to suck in the unwary. And among the issues few are as heated as the idea of providing parents with choices between public and private schools by giving them vouchers. 
Proponents of vouchers have fielded any number of arguments for them. The notion was first advanced in the 1950's by the economist Milton Friedman, who argued that private schools could deliver the same quality education as public schools at far less cost. Today's advocates see competition with private schools as the best way to force public schools to improve; those against vouchers contend that choice all but abandons the public school system and breaks down the wall between church and state.
Luis Benveniste, Martin Carnoy and Richard Rothstein (an education expert for the World Bank, a professor of education and economics at Stanford University and a former education columnist for The New York Times, respectively) wade into the voucher debate in "All Else Equal" in a way that sets them apart. They are reasonable. They lay out the arguments fairly. And then they actually test voucher advocates' theories and describe the results of their research without making grandiose claims. (While Benveniste et al. are too polite to say so, some of the theories show little evidence that their originators have actually visited schools since finishing their formal educations.)
The authors' case studies, of eight public and eight private schools in California over two years, form the heart of the book. A pillar of the privatization argument is the assertion that private and public schools are organized differently. Private schools are flexible, this argument goes, because they compete with one another and flexibility leads to higher student achievement. (The magic of the marketplace!) Public schools, the theory continues, are trapped in a bureaucratic hell that determines what and how they teach, usually in a way that makes high student achievement practically impossible. (The shame of government incompetence!)
But when Benveniste, Carnoy and Rothstein went into schools to test the choice advocates' predictions, they found something very different. It turns out that what shapes a school's culture most powerfully is the community around it. Public and private schools in low-income communities looked very much alike in most ways, including the lack of meaningful parental involvement. Schools in middle- and upper-middle-class communities also looked very much like one another in many ways, including extensive parental involvement. And whether private or public, schools in upper-middle-class communities looked nothing like schools in low-income communities. (This should not be surprising, though to some voucher advocates it will be.) 
The expectations of voucher proponents are confounded in a number of other ways. For instance, private and public schools in affluent communities respond to parents' attempts to interfere with curriculum and other internal issues quite differently. Private schools, which voucher advocates claim will be flexible and responsive, compete for students, the authors note, and so "are not likely to offer anything but tried-and-true approaches." Public schools, which voucher advocates claim are inflexible, regularly respond to public pressure; for one thing, "they must live with dissent." This is democracy at its best. 
This is not an especially enjoyable book to read. While the writing is clear and the authors do not (quite) overdose on educational jargon, it is also dry and repetitive. Benveniste, Carnoy and Rothstein make the same points so often that one feels a bit bruised around the head and shoulders. But the points matter. Anyone who cares about public education should read "All Else Equal." Some bruises are worth it.

 BODY:
 THE UNKNOWN NIGHT
The Madness and Genius of
R. A. Blakelock, an American Painter.
By Glyn Vincent.
Illustrated. 362 pp. New York:
Grove Press. $27.50.
 AMONG 19th-century American artists, names like Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, Thomas Cole or Frederic Church may be familiar, but not Ralph Albert Blakelock, although contemporary painters often appreciate his work. Some unabashed enthusiasts even proclaim his genius, admiring his abstract treatment of nature and his mysticism. He has inspired relatively little scholarship, but his life merited a cameo portrait in Paul Auster's novel "Moon Palace" (1989), in which a character describes Blakelock as "one of the greatest men we've ever had, and there he was all broken apart, on the verge of losing his mind. He used to tell me about his travels out West, wandering through the wilderness for weeks on end, never seeing a soul. Three years he was out there."
Blakelock's life rose to tragic proportions. It encompassed the youthful adventurer heading west to camp with American Indians when his contemporaries sought the salons of Europe; the prolific father; the marginalized and exploited painter; the delusionary confined to a state-run mental hospital; the victim exploited by a con artist as the focus of a charity claiming to support his impoverished family while actually benefiting only herself; unethical behavior by New York's medical, legal and art establishments, with doctors and lawyers failing at the very least to protect the vulnerable artist from fraud, while art dealers and collectors take advantage of the helpless, mentally ill father of eight surviving children. The biggest surprise may be that such a subject has had to wait so long for the biography that Glyn Vincent provides in his first book, "The Unknown Night."
Born in 1847, the grandson of poor immigrants from England and son of a policeman who became a homeopathic physician, Blakelock grew up in New York. He passed the competitive entrance exam to the Free Academy (later known as City College), but soon left school to devote himself to art. An uncle who was a music teacher, choirmaster and amateur landscape painter encouraged the boy's interest in art and provided opportunity for painting at his summer home in Arlington, Vt.
By the fall of 1867, though not yet 20 years old, Blakelock managed to get a painting accepted by the jury of the National Academy of Design, which then was the most prestigious place to exhibit. Although not singled out by the press, he was invited to submit work for exhibition again the next year. After four showings at the academy that did not attract enough attention to begin an economically viable career, Blakelock decided in 1869 to expand his horizons. While most of his contemporaries chose to study in Europe, he elected to go west, where some artists, like Thomas Moran and Albert Bierstadt, had joined Army expeditions and government survey teams. Blakelock, however, traveled alone, on horseback, sleeping under the stars, encountering the Sioux, the Assiniboins and other tribes. He made a second trip west in 1870, stopping in Wyoming among the Uinta tribe in the scenic Snake River valley. His last journey, to Northern California, took place in 1871. He would never forget these experiences, which fed his imagination. American Indian subjects would inspire him for the next quarter of a century.
In February 1877, not quite 30, Blakelock married Cora Bailey. Their first child was born in July. Cora proved to be a devoted mother and an accommodating wife. As eight more children followed in rapid succession, she seems to have inadequately understood that so many progeny taxed the limits of her husband's ability to support their family. Later she would lament that to raise cash to support his growing family, Blakelock was often forced to turn out potboilers. By 1882, Blakelock and his family had moved in with his uncle, then living in East Orange, N.J. So acute was their poverty that he went to work in a factory, painting trinkets and mass-produced landscapes. Unconventional though he was as an artist, this was humiliating. 
Luck soon seemed to change. In 1883, Blakelock received a commission for a major painting from a silk-mill magnate. He began to get positive notices from critics and fellow painters. He continued to maintain a studio in New York, often renting space in buildings populated by some of the most prestigious artists of the day. But art dealers proved reluctant to intercede for the eccentric Blakelock, leaving him to scramble to sell his pictures. Nor was the National Academy quick to elect him to membership. As a result, he often sold paintings for much less than fair value for comparable work.
The humiliation of having to haggle for even paltry remuneration may have precipitated a mental decline. Cora reluctantly agreed to have Blakelock hospitalized in 1899, after enduring several violent episodes at home and his claims that he was the Duke of York. Ironically, Blakelock's reputation seemed to take off shortly afterward. One of his landscapes won an honorable mention while on exhibit in 1900 at the American pavilion in the Grand Palais in Paris. Several private collectors organized shows followed by significant sales. Such attention, in turn, prompted the first major article to be written about his work.
After 1902, dealers clamored to sell works by Blakelock. By 1913, Senator W. A. Clark purchased his "Moonlight" at auction for the record price of $13,900. But the artist and his family received none of the money that his paintings, previously sacrificed for almost nothing, now commanded in the secondary market. His wife and children continued to suffer dire poverty.
In 1916, one of Blakelock's landscapes sold at auction for $20,000, setting a record for a painting by a living American artist. It was this impressive price that captured the imagination of Sadie Filbert, who had reinvented herself as the socially prominent Beatrice Van Rensselaer Adams so that she could swindle the wealthy by persuading them to donate to charitable causes that would, in fact, serve to enrich herself. She founded and milked the Blakelock Fund, which was supposed to support the impecunious artist and his needy brood.
For this culminating episode of the drama, Vincent depends on research by the art historian Dorinda Evans. Her brilliant detective work, reported without fanfare in a scholarly journal in 1987, unmasked for the first time the true story of Adams-Filbert and her con game. Vincent sometimes relies on art historians when he feels a need to characterize works of art. He makes particular use of research by Norman Geske, who compiled an unpublished inventory of Blakelock's work that is essential, since forgeries have often confused the field. For an accomplished storyteller to rely on scholars for descriptions of art may not be a flaw, but Vincent occasionally fails to discriminate between scholarly sources and publicity puffs produced for auction-house catalogs and calculated merely to sell art. For himself, he professes, "These paintings resist physical description; it's all about the surface and emotion, an unsettled mix of tranquil beauty and frightening isolation." Readers unfamiliar with Blakelock's work may feel frustrated that the book contains so few pages of illustrations.
To his credit, Vincent does an excellent job of providing context for the events of Blakelock's life, making this dire chronicle of originality, treachery and suffering come alive. Scholars will find little that is new, yet Vincent does take credit for rediscovering Blakelock's first favorable review, which had been forgotten since it was published in 1879 in The New York Times by the critic Charles de Kay. Vincent has succeeded in putting together a stunning picture of the art market's cruel failure to care for the welfare of artists. He also does not repeat careless errors from the most recent scholarly monograph on the artist.
Vincent calls Blakelock "the most expressive and idiosyncratic 19th-century American painter," although many would assign this role to his contemporary Albert Pinkham Ryder, with whom Blakelock has so often been compared. But "The Unknown Night" is not only the first biography but the best book yet written about this neglected and fascinating American painter.

 A CONSUMERS' REPUBLIC
The Politics of Mass Consumption
in Postwar America.
By Lizabeth Cohen.
Illustrated. 567 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $35.
 Well before World War II had ended, American planners, confident of victory, could sense the trouble that lay ahead. They saw big problems looming in foreign affairs, from the threat of Soviet expansion to the reconstruction of Germany and Japan. They feared America might be overwhelmed by the return of 15 million veterans to civilian life. But they worried most about the impact of peace on the nation's wartime boom. What would happen, they wondered, when defense spending slowed and factory jobs disappeared? Would consumer demand be strong enough to offset the drop in military production? Was it possible, even likely, that America would slip back into the nightmare of the 1930's, when millions were hungry? 
These domestic worries proved groundless. The years from 1945 to 1975 were the most prosperous in American history. The war created a full-employment economy, though workers found precious little to buy. With consumer goods carefully rationed, they saved their money. By the war's end the public had a great pile of disposable income -- and a powerful urge to spend it. The economy rolled on. 
Big business played its part. Blamed by many in the 1930's for causing the Great Depression, it won plaudits a decade later for efficiently producing the weapons of war. With peace at hand, and its reputation restored, American business fueled a new era of mass consumption through relentless advertising, sophisticated market research and novel forms of credit, like the charge card. Meanwhile, big government spent billions on highway construction and low-cost mortgages for veterans, spurring a rush to the suburbs. By the 50's, America's unparalleled prosperity was marked by the abundant possessions of its thriving middle class. The pain and sacrifice of the past seemed like ancient history. 
The story is familiar. Historians and social critics have told it for years, from multiple angles. Yet few accounts are as provocative or original as "A Consumers' Republic," by Lizabeth Cohen, a professor of American studies at Harvard University. Coming from the political left, with an almost utopian faith in the benefits of federal planning and supervision, she sees the postwar age of mass consumption as both a triumph for capitalist production and a failure for civil society.
At more than 500 pages, including copious footnotes, "A Consumers' Republic" flows remarkably well. Throughout the early 20th century, it argues, Americans had often united as consumers to protect their interests and those of society as well. They had organized boycotts and publicity campaigns to oppose child labor, demand pure food and drug laws and support the rights of workers to join unions. Following World War II, however, this model of the citizen consumer largely disappeared. According to Cohen, a powerful new consensus emerged, backed by government, business and labor, in which Americans could best serve the national interest by buying everything in sight. Mass consumption was in; social action was out. A new patriot was created: the citizen purchaser.
It was hard to argue with prosperity. By all appearances, mass consumption had not only triggered an economic miracle, it had also increased fairness and opportunity by spreading more wealth among more people. In this self-congratulatory atmosphere, Cohen says, there was little pressure on public officials to redistribute income, regulate business and monitor development. Indeed, the primary role of government in the new consumers' republic was to maintain the country's purchasing power -- a role endorsed by Republicans and Democrats alike.
Cohen belongs to the postwar baby boom generation. Raised in Paramus, N.J., an epicenter of tract housing and highway shopping malls, she has used the experience of the Garden State to probe the larger issues of postwar economic change. What she found was an uneven prosperity that's done too little to erase inequalities in American life.
Some will disagree with her premise. Others will debunk the notion that government can fix what's broken. I spent 30 years in New Jersey myself, and Cohen's assessment rings true. She shows how women, blacks and working-class whites were far less able to benefit from the federal outlays -- including the fabled G.I. Bill -- that provided college tuition, mortgage money and other means for moving up the economic ladder. She demonstrates the enormous impact of local zoning laws, variant tax bases and simple prejudice in creating a suburban metropolis still rigidly segregated by class and race. And she skillfully depicts the power of private developers to redefine public space, from shopping centers to ocean beaches, in an effort to keep profits up -- and "undesirables" out. "Letting private markets reign," she writes, has "diminished the Consumers' Republic's otherwise substantial achievements."
The record is not altogether bleak. Cohen rightly credits an activist state Supreme Court for tackling the politically charged issues of open housing, public school funding and access to public space. New Jersey, she writes, "has led the pack both as blatant offender and heroic champion of equity."
It is unfair, perhaps, to ask more of a book this rich in detail and perception. Yet a number of questions come to mind. Is it possible that the absence of an organized consumers' movement in the postwar years had something to do with the rise of McCarthyism and the stifling of dissent? Is there a connection between the birth of the consumers' republic and the dawn of a consumer technology linking Americans together as never before? Is our national culture uniquely suited to the ethos of a privatized mass consumption economy, or has globalization planted this seed in dozens of other receptive places? Can't mass consumption also be seen as a liberating force, enhancing autonomy and self-expression?
For Cohen, the key question is simple: Will Americans remain divided in the face of economic injustice or will civic responsibility prevail? It should be clear, she says, that the seductive postwar notion of generating equality through abundance didn't work. Too many people were left behind. The time has come, she adds, for the revival of the citizen consumer ideal, and the fairness it entailed. Who knows? After Enron, WorldCom and Trent Lott, it just might catch on.

HEADLINE: Too Old to Work? 

BYLINE:  By Adam Cohen; Adam Cohen is a lawyer and a member of the editorial board of The Times.

 BODY:
Allstate recruited new insurance agents in the 1980's with a brochure aimed at the dreams of time-clock punchers everywhere. The cover, which featured tidy-looking offices sporting the company's iconic blue-and-white logo, promised that signing on was "better than being in business for yourself." Inside, it offered prospective agents nothing less than a piece of the American dream. "Have you ever wanted a proprietary interest in a business?" the brochure beckoned. How about "unlimited income potential"? And "job security"?
 Ron Harper, the son of a tractor salesman from Gainesville, Ga., wanted all of those things. A 38-year-old father of two, he had worked his way up in the supermarket business, starting as a bagger at 16 and rising to district sales manager in charge of 17 stores. But the supermarket industry was hurting, and after trying out a couple of other managerial jobs, he was looking for something more stable. 
 That was when he heard that Allstate was hiring. Its Neighborhood Office Agent program offered just the mix of opportunity and security he wanted. Allstate would give him policies to sell, money to run his own agency and a brand whose slogan -- "You're in Good Hands" -- was a marketing legend. He understood that the money would not be great at first. He would have to hustle to build a "book of business," and Allstate's commissions were less than he could earn as an independent broker. As an Allstate employee, though, he would receive generous benefits, including a pension. If he honed his skills and worked hard, he figured, there was no limit to what he could earn. And once he got past the preliminaries, he was told, he could be terminated only for dishonesty. 
In August 1989, Harper was assigned to the small town of Thomson, Ga., and he uprooted his family and began hunting for customers in difficult terrain. Most of Thomson's older residents already had car and home insurance, and the younger ones were clearing out for better jobs in Augusta and Atlanta. But Harper "bled blue," as the company's saying goes. He lived off savings at first, pouring his commissions back into the agency, and used his own money for rent, an assistant's salary and ads in the Yellow Pages. After a few years, he had his book of business and was making a modest living. Then, in 1998, Allstate reduced the commissions it paid its neighborhood agents. To make up the lost revenue, Harper's wife quit her job and worked for him at below-market wages.
In November 1999, just past Harper's 10-year anniversary with Allstate, his supervisor called him in to his office in Augusta. Harper and about 17 of his fellow agents were handed a box of documents -- the "job in a box," they would come to call it -- radically redefining their relationship with Allstate. Harper and the others would now be independent contractors. Their benefits, pensions included, would end.
The box also contained what Harper now calls the "damnable release," which guaranteed that the agents would not sue. They didn't have to sign, but if they refused, their days selling for Allstate were over. "I read that thing, and honest to God, I felt nauseous," Harper says. The agents were filled with questions. Prime among them, What happened to the job security they were promised? But the managers were "on transmit, no receive," Harper recalls. "All they wanted to do was read to us from the script."
The same meeting was being played out in Allstate offices nationwide. The company, which had more than 15,000 agents of various kinds, was offering all of its 6,400 employee agents -- the longest-serving agents, and those with the best benefits -- the same unrelenting terms. They could keep their jobs by forfeiting benefits that were, in some cases, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Or they could give up their benefits and their jobs.
Allstate's reneging on its promise was, Harper insists, "totally wrong." But he also knew that he couldn't afford to walk away. In the end, he did what all but a handful of the employee agents did -- he signed the release. Then he sued for age discrimination.
According to the federal government, age-discrimination complaints filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission are up more than 24 percent over the past two years. Pick up the paper, and the cases are everywhere. Ford Motor Company is paying more than $10.5 million to settle suits by older managers who claim that its evaluation system discriminates against them. A Pennsylvania judge has cleared the way for 5,665 employees over 40 in the state Department of Transportation to bring a discrimination class action. McDonnell-Douglas is paying $36 million in partial settlement of a suit by about 1,100 older workers who say that the company laid them off to save on pension costs and medical benefits.
It's an odd time for age bias to be on the upswing. With the vast improvements in medicine, nutrition and lifestyle in recent years, old simply isn't what it used to be. The problem is that workplace culture has, for the most part, stuck to old ways of thinking about older workers. In many elite job markets -- investment banking, computer programming, publishing -- youth is celebrated, and regardless of how young older workers may feel, they only have to look around to realize that they represent the old school, not the new wave. 
Hollywood has been rocked by a recent round of lawsuits charging television networks, production companies, studios and agencies with "gray listing" -- refusing to hire older talent. (In the case of some television writing jobs, "old" actually refers to the early 30's.) Last September, Doris Roberts, the septuagenarian actress who plays Ray Romano's mother on "Everybody Loves Raymond," told the Senate Special Committee on Aging that society views people her age as discardable. "My contemporaries and I are denigrated as old," she said. "Old coots, old fogies, old codgers, geezers . . . hags and old-timers."
Roberts was testifying about the entertainment industry, but she could have been describing almost any workplace in America. Look through the reams of age-discrimination documents, and you'll see that the biggest cases come not from Hollywood and Madison Avenue but from Old Economy sectors like auto manufacturing and retailing. (And some of the cruelest comments about old workers appear in litigation involving plumbing supplies and fiberglass sales.)
The disconnect between workers who look at themselves in the mirror and feel young and companies that look at them and think "old-timer" has fueled much of the explosion in age-discrimination claims. But there are also some more basic social factors at work. With the graying of America, there are simply many more people eligible to be discriminated against -- and to sue. The more than 70 million baby boomers now make up about half of the work force, and by next year even the youngest boomers will be 40 -- and therefore covered by federal age-discrimination laws. The oldest workers, who are most likely to face bias, are among the fastest-growing part of the work force. Workers over 65 increased by 20 percent in the 1990's; workers over 75 were up more than 80 percent from 1980 to 2000.
Couple these demographics with a faltering economy, and the conditions are perfect for a surge in discrimination suits. It's a typical pattern: when hard times hit, the ax falls disproportionately on older workers, who may be the most highly paid and who are often stereotyped as being less efficient. In a bad economy, with few other jobs available and retirement holdings taking a hit, fired workers are also more willing to sue.
The old face of age discrimination was the solitary worker quietly tapped on the shoulder and put out to pasture (Willy Loman, fired when the boss's son took over, left to complain, "You can't eat the orange and throw the peel away -- a man is not a piece of fruit!"). These days, however, age discrimination is more often the product of broad-based company policies, like decisions to phase out entire job categories disproportionately held by older workers. 
That is precisely what Harper and his fellow agents have charged Allstate with doing. At the heart of their lawsuit is the claim that Allstate executives singled out one category of workers -- employee agents -- because more than 90 percent of them were over 40. If Harper and his 28 fellow plaintiffs win an early procedural battle and are allowed to represent a class of 6,400 onetime employee agents, this could be the biggest case ever charging a company with age discrimination.
The suit is still in its early stages, but the agents have retained two top Washington firms, and AARP has assigned two lawyers to the case. In late 2001, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission jumped in on the agents' side, filing its own suit charging that Allstate violated federal pension and age-discrimination laws when it forced the agents to sign away their benefits and promise not to sue in order to keep working.
The stakes are high. If the plaintiffs win, Allstate could be forced to pay hundreds of millions of dollars. But more important is what the suit could mean for older workers nationwide. Thousands -- maybe millions -- of older workers are discriminated against on the job every year, but many have no idea what their rights are. Age discrimination is ready for a high-profile case that serves -- like Brown v. Board of Education did for race discrimination, or the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill Senate hearings did for sexual harassment -- as a lightning rod.
"I've been looking for a case like this for years," says Raymond Gregory, an employment lawyer and the author of a book on age-discrimination law. A victory in the case, he says, could generate the kind of enormous damage awards and nationwide publicity that would force corporate America to rethink its approach to age in the workplace.
Allstate (the nation's second-largest auto and home insurer and No. 57 on the Fortune 500 list) got its start in 1931 as a mail-order insurance division of Sears, Roebuck & Co. After the 1933 Chicago World's Fair, where an Allstate agent sitting at a card table in the Sears exhibit was mobbed by customers, Sears began putting agents in booths in its stores -- usually under the escalator, the least valuable space on the sales floor.
In 1984, Allstate initiated the Neighborhood Office Agent program to get agents out of stores and onto Main Street. The N.O.A. program recruited agents as exclusive salesmen for Allstate's insurance products. Allstate offered lower commissions, in many cases, than the competition, and the office-expense allotments it paid -- as Ron Harper learned -- often did not cover an agency's costs. But what Allstate was really offering was a relationship that turned the job of insurance agent -- often a lonely seat-of-the-pants existence -- into the equivalent of an executive post with a major corporation. In addition to a great benefits package, Allstate's neighborhood agents would receive the best training in the industry and would be eligible for an array of old-style sales incentives -- Honor Rings, Chairman Conference Awards and trips to sunny islands and European capitals.
The Neighborhood Office Agent program was initially a great success, but things began changing at Allstate in the 1990's. In an I.P.O. in '93, Sears spun off 20 percent of its Allstate stake, and two years later it sold off the rest. As Allstate began to fend for itself, its managers began rethinking the role of agents. It stopped hiring employee agents and, the plaintiffs say, began a campaign to switch the existing ones over to independent-contractor status.
Allstate dangled carrots, like bonuses for managers whose agents switched. And it wielded sticks, including tougher rules for neighborhood offices. But even as Allstate was apparently trying to prod its employee agents, it reassured them that the choice was theirs to make. "Rest easy, there is no plan to convert N.O.A. employee agents to . . . independent contractors effective 4/1/98!!!!" a December 1997 sales update promised.
The late 90's was a time of intense competition in the insurance business, and agent-oriented companies were worried. Insurgents like Geico were eliminating agents and selling directly to customers. And with the dot-com frenzy at a fever pitch, the conventional wisdom was that commerce of all kinds was moving online. The Internet's rise looked like bad news for Allstate, whose costly infrastructure of agents and offices would be a drag on earnings. Wall Street, certainly, was worried. In a booming stock market, Allstate shares plunged more than 50 percent, even as the company was furiously rebuying stock to prop it up.
In January 1999, Allstate's C.E.O., Jerry Choate, stepped down. Choate, the creator of the N.O.A. program, had worked his way up on the sales side and was well regarded by the agents. His replacement, Ed Liddy, a onetime Sears executive, lacked Choate's ties to the agents and came with a take-no-prisoners reputation. At Sears, he had helped to shutter the company's famed catalog, marveling to C.F.O. Magazine, "It's amazing how quickly you can dismantle a business that took a hundred years to build."
It was 10 months after Liddy took charge that Harper and the other employee agents were given Allstate's take-it-or-leave-it offer. Inside the "job in a box" packages handed out that day was a booklet titled "Preparing for the Future," which redefined the employment rules for employee agents. The tough new rules coincided with, and seemed designed to bolster, Allstate's widely heralded new plans to "aggressively expand the company's sales . . . and streamline the way the company operates."
The future that employee agents were supposed to prepare for was a grim one. As the plaintiffs see it, Allstate's motives were clear. The company was trying to cut costs by taking away their health insurance and freezing their pensions. At the same time, they say, Allstate was focused on "re-energizing" to compete against the Geicos and the dot-coms, and younger workers were the key. "We used to hear it in meetings all the time: 'We have these young people and they really go out and work,"' says Sylvia Crews-Kelly, a Tampa agent who was cut off after working 19 years, 8 months and 27 days -- three months before she would have been eligible to start drawing her pension. "They said older workers just want to sit on their policies and collect commissions."
Allstate sees things differently. "There was no discrimination," insists Sue Rosborough, a lawyer for the company. "We reorganized our agency force for a lot of very good business reasons." Allstate says that its new business model cut costs by $600 million but that almost all the savings came through closing regional offices and eliminating 4,000 nonagent positions.
The "Preparing for the Future" program was never intended to cut back on the cost of agent benefits, says Barry Hutton, the executive who oversaw it. Employee agents were asked to become independent contractors, he says, to "streamline" operations. Allstate's 6,400 employee agents were part of a force of more than 15,000 agents hired under different rules at different times. There were 11 categories of agents, Hutton says, each with its own commission rates. Simplifying the categories made Allstate more efficient. "We just flat-out had to make a business decision so we could be nimble, as nimble as a large company can be," Hutton says.
What about Allstate's supposed promises that employee agents would not be terminated except for dishonesty? If these promises were made, Rosborough says, they are not legally binding on the company. 
It is unlikely that any prominent social theorist has ever put forth a vision of reform with insurance agents in the vanguard. The Allstate plaintiffs -- who were highly compensated and are overwhelmingly white and male -- do not look like typical victims of an unjust order. And the facts and legal issues in their suit are muddy. The animosity against older workers, if it was there, may be hard to find under all the layers of corporate cost-cutting and business strategizing.
Still, because of the number of workers affected, the prominence of the defendant, the size of the potential awards and the brazenness of Allstate's actions, this could represent the next wave in protecting the rights of older workers.
American workers are invariably surprised when they first learn, often when they have just been fired, about the concept of "employment at will." The general rule in American law is that employees hold their jobs at the whim of their bosses. Employers are free to fire workers, as the Tennessee Supreme Court explained in 1884, for "good cause, for no cause or even for cause morally wrong, without being thereby guilty of legal wrong."
Modern employment law has largely been a prolonged battle to whittle away at this doctrine. There are now a number of exceptions: workers generally can't be fired for union activity, say, or for whistle-blowing. But the largest carve-out is discrimination law. Employers may, as the Tennessee court said, fire workers for good cause or for no cause, but they cannot fire them on the basis of race, religion, sex or other prohibited factors.
Just where age fits in this list has long been unclear. It has been a kind of forgotten stepchild of the civil rights revolution. When the granddaddy of all employment-discrimination laws, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, was adopted, there was general agreement on most of the categories. But Congress was uncertain what to do about age. The secretary of labor was asked to study age discrimination in employment and advise whether it should be covered. The secretary found that age discrimination was a real problem. At the time, about 50 percent of job listings were not open to applicants over 55, and 25 percent were closed off to those over 45. Relying on the report, Congress passed the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (A.D.E.A.).
Based on its language, which almost exactly tracks Title VII, older workers should be well protected. But it hasn't worked out that way. "The passage of the A.D.E.A. was the biggest victory," says Michael Lieder, a lawyer for the Allstate plaintiffs. "It's been downhill ever since."
It is almost always harder for older workers to win a bias claim than it is for the groups covered by Title VII. One of the biggest differences is the availability of an evidentiary theory known as "disparate impact." The Supreme Court has held since 1971 that plaintiffs suing under Title VII do not need to show that they were intentionally discriminated against (what the law calls "disparate treatment"); it is enough to show that a supposedly neutral policy disproportionately hurt a protected group. Once that is shown, the employer has the burden of showing that the challenged policy (a new kind of aptitude test, say, or a height requirement) is necessary for the job. Disparate impact is a powerful tool, since it is often hard for workers to prove intentional discrimination. Many of the biggest race- and sex-discrimination lawsuits could not have been won without it.
There is no reason that disparate impact shouldn't be available under the A.D.E.A., but many federal courts won't allow it. Even with intentional discrimination claims, older workers are worse off. Many judges just don't like age-discrimination lawsuits. One federal judge complained in a decision that older workers feel they can file age suits with no more evidence "than a birth certificate and a pink slip."
As a result, courts go to great lengths not to see age bias when it is obviously there. In case after case, judges excuse blatantly discriminatory comments as mere "stray remarks" and strain to find alternative reasons that older workers were fired. In one egregious case, a 56-year-old worker at a North Carolina company was fired. Two weeks before the firing, a supervisor said to him, "O'Connor, you are too damn old for this kind of work." This, a federal appeals court held, did not constitute sufficient evidence for discrimination.
Even when older workers make their case, courts are more willing to accept employers' defenses. Early in the civil rights era, it was established that a company cannot defend a race-discrimination claim by saying it acted for economic reasons. In the classic case, a restaurant that pleads "customer preference" -- that it would happily hire black waitresses, but its racist customers would stop coming -- still loses.
But in age cases, courts are all too willing to accept economic defenses. A company that says it laid off older workers because they were highly paid will often prevail. This can be a potent weapon for a company like Allstate, which can argue that when it pushed out all of those agents who were 40 or older, it was looking to get rid of expensive employees, not old ones.
There are many reasons that courts have been grudging about age claims. In part, judges do not see old people as a "discrete and insular minority," the classic legal formulation for a protected class. Blacks are separate and apart from the majority culture, the theory goes, but every family has old people in it, and anyone notcurrently in the class eventually will be. That logic ignores the fact that Congress established to its satisfaction 36 years ago that bias against older workers is real and pervasive -- and passed the A.D.E.A. to do something about it.
Judges are also inclined to see pushing older workers out as part of the natural order, because they are less able, or to make room for the next generation. But stereotypes like these, about who is capable, or deserving, of employment are just what Congress was taking aim at with the A.D.E.A. There is no small contradiction in the fact that some of the worst age-discrimination law has come from Supreme Court justices, who serve for life. Lawyers for older workers have been reluctant to use the word "hypocrisy," but they have noted in their arguments that Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes stayed on the court into his 90's.
Advocates for older workers say, perhaps too hopefully, that the Supreme Court may be softening on age discrimination. They point, in particular, to a case from 2000 reinstating a jury verdict in favor of a Mississippi plumbing-products factory employee who was fired after his supervisor told him that he "must have come over on the Mayflower" and that he was "too damn old" for the job. Reversing a lower court, the Supreme Court unanimously held that the fired worker had put forth enough evidence to prove that his firing violated the A.D.E.A.
But also important, the E.E.O.C. recently signaled a willingness to challenge the court's stingy view of age discrimination. After the Supreme Court ruled in 2000 that individuals cannot sue state entities for damages under federal age-bias laws, the E.E.O.C. stepped in to represent 1,700 retired police officers, firefighters and other safety officers who charged the California Public Employees Retirement System with discriminating in benefits. In January, the retirement system agreed to pay $250 million -- the largest settlement, for any kind of discrimination, in E.E.O.C. history.
Ron Harper and his fellow plaintiffs know they have their work cut out for them. If disparate impact were available to them, they would be off to a fast start. The ratio of terminated agents who were in the protected class -- more than 90 percent -- is enormous by the standards of discrimination law. Under disparate impact, the burden would shift to Allstate to explain what it was up to. 
As things now stand, the plaintiffs will need to come up with more proof of intentional discrimination to show that Allstate was biased against its older workers. If they can make the legal claims work, the plaintiffs say, they believe they have the sort of human stories that will put Allstate on the defensive. There are certainly plenty of plaintiffs like Harper who have stayed with the company and are struggling to stay afloat. More than 2,500 have left, and many of them describe it as if they have been fired. Gene Romero, 54, a 13-year Allstate agent in Overland Park, Kan., sold his book of business and has been unemployed ever since. He has looked for work, but the job market is weak, he says, and he hasn't found anyone who "wants to hire an old man." Michael Wilson, a lawyer for the Allstate plaintiffs, says that his clients are suffering the usual fallout of involuntary job loss -- depression, divorce, alcoholism and worse. "I've had people call me and say, 'I was sitting out in my backyard with a gun in my mouth,"' he says.
Even if they don't prevail on the age-discrimination claims, they may win -- as often happens in these cases -- on a related claim. With sentiment running strongly against large companies that leave their retired workers in the lurch, they may do well with their challenge to the take-it-or-leave-it release.
However things work out for the Allstate plaintiffs, the case could reshape the legal landscape for older workers. Given the nation's demographic trends -- and the persistence in stereotyped thinking about older people -- there is every reason to believe that the age-bias complaints from television writers and teachers, bus mechanics and bankers will continue their explosive growth.
Now the law may have a chance to catch up. If the Allstate plaintiffs prevail, the case could give older workers their first true landmark case, with damage awards large enough to make corporate America recalculate the costs of discriminating.
Win or lose, advocates for older workers say, this case could be indispensable to the process of improving age-discrimination law -- making it the equal of race, sex and religion. They have not given up, they say, on getting the courts to rethink the economic-defense excuse and their antipathy toward disparate impact. "We are not going to cower in front of these precedents," vows Laurie McCann, a senior AARP lawyer. "We're going to chip away to show that they're wrong."
They also want Congress to get involved. It could amend the A.D.E.A. to bring age-discrimination rules in line with the more generous ones available under Title VII. This may seem like a uniquely inauspicious time to ask Congress to expand a civil rights law, particularly with the Republicans in control of both houses. But advocates for older workers point out that their constituents are one of the most potent voting blocs around. Politicians ignore older workers at their peril.
Harper is hoping that his dispute with Allstate rewrites the legal rules. Except for marrying his wife and rearing "two fine boys," he says, taking on Allstate is the most important thing he has ever done. "I'd be lying if I said we're not fighting for ourselves and our families," he says. "But every one of us knows that we're also carrying the ball for other people -- people who will be hit by something like this in the future."

HEADLINE: The Sound of Fury 

BYLINE:  By Bruce Weber; Bruce Weber is a theater critic for The Times.

 BODY:
Something about Stephen Adly Guirgis reminds you of a baby. A lumbering, hairy baby for sure, and a little unkempt, too, the kind of baby who generally looks as if he could use a shave and a good night's sleep. But with his soft, handsome features, dark, puppy eyes looking out from under a mop of salted-by-gray black hair and a manner that seems naturally chastened, he gives off the sense of being unformed, all potential, as if he's waiting for experience and maturity to dawn on him. He's 38.
 Guirgis (pronounced GEAR-giss) is the kind of guy who survives on intermittent trips to the deli for coffee and cigarettes. He lives in a three-room apartment on the far West Side of Manhattan, and at the moment, he's sitting on the floor (because I'm in the only chair), wearing a football jersey and soiled jeans, with a plastic foam cup, an ashtray and a sandwich wrapped in wax paper. There's a desk with a Mac on it, and a wide-screen television across the small room. In the bedroom next door is a mattress on the floor. The kitchen is an unholy mess, and he has no satisfying explanation for why he seems to be using the counter for a laundry basket. 
 "I'm not organized," he says. 
This is the overgrown kid who may be the best playwright in America under 40. 
"There's a line in 'Our Lady,' a character who quotes St. Paul," he says, referring to "Our Lady of 121st Street," his latest play, about a neighborhood reunion in Harlem. "He says, 'When I became a man, I put away childish things.' And all my characters are loaded with their childish things. And that's because I'm loaded with my childish things."
You may not have heard of him till now, but Guirgis already belongs on the list of accomplished young American playwrights that includes Suzan-Lori Parks and David Auburn, the last two winners of the Pulitzer Prize. And his improvement curve is steeper. He has been a playwright for less than a decade; seven years ago, the director of his first play (a one-act that was handwritten on a yellow pad) had to explain what a rewrite was.
Unschooled as a writer, he has never been associated with any of the prominent theaters that yearn to take young playwrights under their wings (though he has now been commissioned by the Manhattan Theater Club and the South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, Calif.). Instead, he has become the voice of the scruffy, scrappy LAByrinth Theater Company, an ensemble that includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Patrick Shanley, Daphne Rubin-Vega and John Ortiz, who goaded him into writing and then coalesced around the work he produced. As a playwright, he seems to have come out of nowhere, a baby born full grown. 
In fact, he came from New York, the son of an Irish Catholic mother and an Egyptian father, and in his work, he is making a bid to become a kind of city laureate. His plays teem with ethnic variety, but the demographic they most consistently represent, and to which he evidently belongs, is of a different sort: that of the perpetually overwhelmed, those who feel they are helpless against the forces of their lives, drowning in their own inconsequentiality.
Tormented as they are, his characters don't know what to do about it but yell. They don't have the discretionary income or the navel-gazing impulse to take their troubles into therapy. They are alert for a scam and a quick buck, the kind of New Yorkers who don't take nothin' off nobody, who scrap for the tiniest victory, who glare withmenace when jostled on the subway. You don't find them in the theater audience much. 
But one of the most affecting qualities of Guirgis's writing is the bond he creates between his characters and the people who do go to the theater, who do go to therapy to assuage their anxieties. This is, after all, the kind of person Guirgis has become. When he was growing up in Manhattan, he says, he and his friends never liked the rich kids, the preppies; nonetheless, Kenneth Lonergan's play about them, "This Is Our Youth," "really affected me because 15 years later I could have empathy for the kids in my neighborhood that I hated." This is the compassion that surfaces in his work, and at a time when all New Yorkers are united by taut nerves and a sense of vulnerability, his plays seem especially pertinent. 
"I've lived my entire life in New York, and it informs everything," Guirgis says. "Sept. 11 reinforced for me that whatever I'm writing about, it better be something that really matters to me because we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. And for me it's stories about people in pain in New York."
To this point Guirgis's work includes only three full-length plays, but each has been a leap from the last. "Our Lady of 121st Street," the newest and fullest, is a knockout, a bruising comic group portrait of the graduates of a Catholic school who, 15 years later, gather for the funeral of a favorite teacher only to find that her body has been stolen. After a brief run in the tiny LAByrinth space in Chelsea last fall, commercial producers raised $750,000; this Thursday, in the middle of rather grim economic times Off Broadway, it opens at the Union Square Theater.
"I read the first act and thought it was the most extraordinary piece of writing I'd seen in years," says Robyn Goodman, a veteran producer who committed to the project before Guirgis even finished the play, which, in typical fashion, he did at the very last moment. "I didn't even ask where the play was going. I didn't care."
Guirgis's previous play was "Jesus Hopped the A Train," a philosophical jailhouse drama set at Rikers Island, where the legal system mishandles two prisoners -- a serial killer who has found God and an angry street kid with a cause. It was well received in New York, but even more so in London, where it was nominated for an Olivier Award, the London equivalent of the Tony. And his first play, "In Arabia We'd All Be Kings," a grim slice of life in and around a divey Times Square bar, opens in London next month. 
This sudden success has allowed a perennially penniless Guirgis to earn some money writing for television and to get an assignment to write a film about death-row inmates wrongfully convicted. In January, "Jesus" was performed in Chile, and he was received there as a celebrity. None of this seems to have altered his self-flagellating frame of mind. 
"I was a guest of honor in Chile, giving press conferences, being feted, looking forward to the opening of my play at the Union Square, followed by the movie and all this stuff," he says with emphatic disbelief. "You know -- top of the world. And I was miserable."
Guirgis is at his best when his characters get their dander up, which they often do. They are not retiring folks. They are angry people who are conflicted about the righteousness of their anger, which makes many of their rants not only moving but hilarious. Like the legless white priest in "Our Lady" who admits to a black penitent that he doesn't much like black people, they have a measure of self-knowledge, but not always self-control.
In"Jesus Hopped the A Train," for example, a street kid named Angel has been arrested for shooting a cult leader -- in the behind. As Angel tells his lawyer that he did it to avenge a friend who was brainwashed, his magnificent high-decibel screed could easily be a manifesto for the frustrated, the powerless, the disenfranchised of New York. To hear the full melody, you have to imagine the following sprinkled with obscenities:
"My friend Joey should be doing what you're doing! He should be a public defender, or a drug counselor, helpin' the people, whatever. But where is he? He's out! Gone! And why? Why is he not here? Why? Do you believe that Reverend Kim is the actual Son of God? That a man deported from his OWN country and convicted of tax evasion in THIS one could even SPEAK for God, let alone BE God? That a man who STEALS people, has them selling flowers on the street, gettin' rich off them -- look me in my eye and tell me that a man like that should be allowed to do what he's doing! With a government approved tax-exempt status and a full police escort? Where's my mother's full police escort when she gets off the subway from work after midnight and has to walk home alone? Where's Mother Teresa's Lexus? And how 'bout you? You a public defender, and if you're any good at lawyering at all, you could prolly make a lot more money working someplace else, right, right? But you don't do that, do you? So where's your mansion? Where's YOUR Frappuccino, swimming pool, mistress, Son a God wonderland? He stole my friend. I shot him in the. . . . Now I'm in jail, and he's eating banana cream pie in some plush hospital bed reading his Wall Street Journal."
Indeed, in Guirgis's plays, character after character has a moment of detonation in which the fury at being dealt a bad hand erupts. The stories involve physical violence, but onstage the only violence is verbal, in the volume of the dialogue, the intensity of the frustration.
To hear just about anyone tell it, Guirgis has this frustration in himself, and though he admits to having "an explosive temper," it is mostly inner-directed. As a writer, he is a world-class procrastinator, with an acute fear of being held accountable for how he fills the blank page.
"He's always second-guessed himself as a writer," says Hoffman, who has become Guirgis's chief interpreter. "He's a real writer, one of our great writers, and what I want him to believe is that he has a responsibility to the theater community and the company to keep writing. I want him to believe he's responsible for that talent." 
The playwright John Patrick Shanley, also a member of LAByrinth, says that Guirgis's plays are about "the reunion of various issues he's keeping aloft" and that when he's writing "he lives in a dynamic where he keeps the pieces in his head as long as he can without reunifying them." This is what makes him crazy. "I lived with him for two weeks when he was allegedly working on 'Our Lady,' and all he did was clean," Shanley says. "He'd go into tirades about his own character, about what a loathsome, worthless person he was, and this went along with his constantly eating cookies. So he'd begin to look worse as his environment became more pristine." 
Guirgis cops to all this, though on first encounter none of it is apparent -- not the rages, not the sulks, not the obsessive binges on food, alcohol or other, not so legal, vices. Instead he is almost supplicating and compliant, calling up an hour before an appointment to say he's running late, but that he'd be able to get there sooner if he could use your apartment to shave in. 
"I think I know what it is," he says of his procrastination. "It's fear. The many flavors of fear." And his mounting success, of course, means mounting expectations. "I remember after 'Arabia', I was afraid to write 'Jesus,' and after 'Jesus' I was afraid to write 'Our Lady,' but the real fear, whatever the circumstances, when you're in a good place or not, is of just showing up for the day. It's a mysterious thing. I don't understand why it's not a given that when I get out of bed I'm going to jump up and brush my teeth and get in the shower, because it seems to me that a lot of people, that's what they do in the morning."
Guirgis, who calls himself a "lost" Catholic, talks about himself as being in a spiritual crisis, revealing precisely the sort of personal angst that his characters carry around. "When I was a kid and I'd be in trouble," he says, "I'd ask God to help me, and then once the fire was out, I wouldn't talk to Him anymore. When I got older, I began to find I needed some help spiritually, just to function. Why? The honest answer is, like, 12-step stuff. And 'Jesus' had to do with my struggle with the third step, which is turning your will and your life over to the care of God as you understand it. But the thing is, when you get the help, you start to believe in the way of living that embraces that, and then here comes, you know, the responsibilities that go with it: To be a good person, to not steal, to be honorable in your relationships with women, with friends, to treat yourself lovingly. That's a lot of responsibility. 
"So your options are to forget the whole thing and go back to the existence without any spiritual connection. Or embrace the spiritual connection, but then you've got to deal with the burden of living up to the admission policy. "
Guirgis is one of those people to whom good stories seem to happen. Good storytellers usually are, but even so, his background is unusual. His mother grew up in Newark, the daughter of a deaf alcoholic printer. She stood up to his rages, often to shield her mother and sister. It was a loving but difficult upbringing, Guirgis says, and "she grew up in a household terrified of intimacy and marriage." Nearly 40 and still single, she was volunteering as an adviser to foreign exchange students when a grateful Egyptian told her to call his family if she were ever inclined to go to Cairo. She was, and she did, and there she met the student's brother, who was in his 40's and assumed to be a confirmed bachelor. Three days later they were engaged. 
In 1963, they moved to New York, where they lived on the Upper West Side and sent Stephen and his younger sister to Catholic school -- the Corpus Christi School on, yes, West 121st Street. It was later, at the Rhodes School, a private academy where he was on scholarship, that the profligacy began. "I remember the first day of school, I was smoking a cigarette somewhere outside, and someone opened a vial of blow and dipped both ends of the cigarette in it and said, 'Here, man, it's better this way.' That was the first day of school. It was the beginning of a lot of lost years."
Guirgis attended the State University of New York at Albany and became a famous campus character. Over the seven and a half years it took him to graduate, he got to pursue his interest in acting and to meet John Ortiz, a fellow student six years his junior. It was Ortiz who in 1993 invited him to audition for a new acting company.
The LAByrinth company was begun as Latino Actors Base, LAB. Though it has since grown into a multiethnic group that produces original material, it continues its original function: that of a theater "gym," a place where actors work out, offering one another classes in technique, workshopping plays written by members.
Guirgis was one of the first non-Latinos admitted, and he immediately knew he had found a home. But it wasn't until 1995 that, at Ortiz's urging, he began to write. His first effort was "Francisco and Benny," a one-act about two neighborhood guys sitting on a stoop and debating the relative virtues of partying and planning for the future, a characteristic Guirgis dichotomy. Its four performances were a turning point, both for LAByrinth and for Guirgis himself. 
"Everybody laughed at the stuff that was intended to be funny, and then when the play got serious, it got quiet," Guirgis says, still with a note of amazement. "People seemed to be having a theater experience that was good." 
These days, everyone who knows Guirgis seems to be simultaneously exasperated by and in love with him. This is especially true of the members of the LAByrinth, who are also his closest friends. He drives them all nuts with his self-immolating predilections, as well as with his habitual procrastination. It took a grievous confrontation with Hoffman to squeeze the second act of "Our Lady" out of him at a time when the actors were already in tech rehearsals for act one.
"I'd see him at his desk at 3, 4 in the morning," says John Gould Rubin, the lead producer on both "Jesus" and "Our Lady." "And he'd be sitting there, staring at the screen endlessly, and he wouldn't have written anything. The tension would get higher and higher, and I'd want to hit him, and he'd be like, all sad, like 'How can I control the muse?' I went through every resource I had to conjure stuff out of him, and I always failed. It's a Zen thing, like it's only when he gives up and acquiesces to the futility of inspiration that it happens. He writes everything at the final moment out of a complete despair."
Until that moment comes, says Liza Colon-Zayas, a LAByrinth member, "he has these outrageous excuses." One day not long ago, Colon-Zayas says, he showed up at a LAByrinth class for which he was supposed to have written scenes, "and he told us all, with tears in his eyes, that he had to take his mother to the emergency room."
He was lying.
This kind of foolish desperation is, in many ways, at the heart of Guirgis's work. Last fall, as opening night for "Our Lady" approached and the play wasn't done, he was bicycling home from a meeting with Hoffman, who had unmanned him with a tearful and pleading sermon about the strain he was putting on their artistic partnership, not to mention their friendship. Somewhere on 10th Avenue, a truck gave an unnecessary honk, startling him and almost throwing him off. It sent him into a murderous rage.
"And I started screaming," he says. "And I chased the truck for five blocks, ready to fight, until I caught up with it at a red light." 
At that point, he says, he caught himself. "At the light, I just sat down on the side of the road and sobbed for like half an hour."
The people in "Our Lady" have that in them: the woman who has never got over a heartbreak; the detective whose son was raped and murdered on a playground; the man trapped by the guilt of having, years ago, accidentally beaned his little brother with a brick. Indeed, Guirgis's plays are compendiums of the things that can go wrong -- in a moment or a month, accidentally or by our own hands -- in lives that might not be so great to begin with.
"The thing is, that kind of anger is always misdirected; it's always chasing the ghost of something," he says. "But there's so much in the world to get angry about; it's easy to hook into it."

HEADLINE: LIVES; 
Cold Comfort

BYLINE:  By Jason T. Shaplen; Jason T. Shaplen was the policy adviser for KEDO, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, from 1995 to 1999.

 BODY:
It's April 1997, a few days before the birthday of the late Great Leader Kim Il Sung. Majon is cold, so cold that going outdoors would be ludicrous were it not for the fact that it's actually warmer outside than in the building where our hosts have decided we should talk. Instead of negotiating at our usual site near Pyongyang, we accepted the North's invitation to meet at a beach resort in Majon to discuss the details of building two safe nuclear reactors to replace the plutonium-producing ones they mothballed. Heading to the coast sounded like a great idea. But now that our delegation from the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization has arrived, I realize that we should have asked about our accommodations. Unlike the hotel near Pyongyang, which has a revolving restaurant on top, this place has no heating -- none whatsoever. When cold seeps this deep into your bones, it doesn't wash away with a long, hot shower -- especially when there isn't one in your run-down bathroom. 
 The bathtub is also a nonstarter: cold rust-colored water -- with solid bits of rust in it -- drips into a tub that leaks onto a cracked tile floor. The instructions pasted to the bathtub say that cold water from the tap can be heated in the tub by inserting a metal heating coil directly into the water; it's similar to those innocuous coils that warm soup in electric cooking crocks. Only a first-time visitor to the North would fall for this trick. But this is my third trip in 15 months, and I know better. On the few occasions when there is electricity in North Korea, it surges. I wouldn't want to be in the bathtub with a 20-year-old heating coil when that happens. 
 The North Koreans don't seem as cold as I am. While I shiver in meetings, they sit stoically, curious as to why I have trouble forming words. One issue on the agenda is emergency medical care. Until we establish our own medical facility at our construction site, our workers will need access to a North Korean hospital in the event of an emergency. We have been assured that the nearest hospital is "world-class with world-class equipment."
We don't tell the North Koreans that we don't believe them, but . . . we don't. (As the United States discovered recently, we should have applied this dose of skepticism to the entire 1994 accord.) This is a country where hundreds of thousands of people die for lack of medicine. For weeks we have asked to see the hospital, but once again we have been told rather tensely that it isn't possible. North Koreans are fiercely proud; many would rather face death than be humiliated or concede that their economic system has collapsed. They probably don't want the South Korean members of our delegation to see a hospital they know is inferior to those in Seoul. The North Koreans want this matter dropped. But to assuage our concerns about the medical center's condition -- and, more absurdly, as an explanation for why we cannot visit -- the head of the North Korean delegation informs me that the hospital has just been "repainted."
This man -- at least twice my 30 years and wearing a fake Rolex five sizes too large for his wrist -- is clearly exasperated. He goes on to tell me that if I don't believe that the medical center is world-class, I can ask the other foreign experts who saw it recently. It is one of the few times in our negotiations that he slips up. I ask why the North is willing to let other foreigners visit the hospital but not us. Now he's having trouble forming words. For the first time since I arrived in Majon, I'm warm. If my body temperature isn't exactly rising, at least my spirits are. 
He backtracks and, in a rare moment of honesty, concedes that the situation is a bit like an arranged marriage. Eventually the bride and groom will meet, but in this case, he says, the "bride" isn't so beautiful, and we'd like to hide that until the last possible moment. (The analogy is apt. On a subsequent trip to the hospital weeks later, it turns out unsurprisingly that the North Koreans have a different definition of "world class" than we do.)
By lunch I am shivering again. Thankfully, the North Koreans don't see me because we eat in separate dining rooms to minimize any socializing. The two Koreas are technically still at war. The North Koreans want to avoid looking as if they are speaking directly to South Koreans across the negotiating table, let alone the dining table. 
I rush back to my room in the 20 minutes between our meal and the start of afternoon talks. I've discovered that there's one source of precious heat; it comes up through the straw mats on the floor of my room. I lie flat on the floor in my double-breasted Italian-tailored suit, first on my back with arms by my side and then on my stomach. I pray that no one comes in and sees me. I remember when I used to think diplomacy was gallant. But there's nothing stately about a 6-foot-4 man lying face down on a dirty floor. 
Perhaps it was a sign of things to come. Six years later, North Korea has started a new nuclear program and reactivated the mothballed one; the project is in shambles. At least I saw Majon.

HEADLINE: Bring Back the Sabbath 

BYLINE:  By Judith Shulevitz; Judith Shulevitz writes the Close Reader column for The New York Times Book Review.

 BODY:
Sandor Ferenczi, a disciple of Freud's, once identified a disorder he called Sunday neurosis. Every Sunday (or, in the case of a Jewish patient, every Saturday), the Sunday neurotic developed a headache or a stomachache or an attack of depression. After ruling out purely physiological causes, including the rich food served at Sunday dinners, Ferenczi figured out what was bothering his patients. They were suffering from the Sabbath.
 On that weekly holiday observed by all "present-day civilized humanity" (Ferenczi was writing in 1919, when Sunday was still sacred, even in Budapest, his very cosmopolitan hometown), not only did drudgery give way to festivity, family gatherings and occasionally worship, but the machinery of self-censorship shut down, too, stilling the eternal inner murmur of self-reproach. The Sunday neurotic, rather than enjoying his respite, became distraught; he feared that impulses repressed only with great effort might be unleashed. He induced pain or mental anguish to pre-empt the feeling of being out of control. 
 About a decade ago I developed a full-blown weekend disorder of my own. Perhaps because I am Jewish, it came on Friday nights. My mood would darken until, by Saturday afternoon, I'd be unresponsive and morose. My normal routine, which involved brunch with friends and swapping tales of misadventure in the relentless quest for romance and professional success, made me feel impossibly restless. I started spending Saturdays by myself. After a while I got lonely and did something that, as a teenager profoundly put off by her religious education, I could never have imagined wanting to do. I began dropping in on a nearby synagogue. 
It was a small building in Brooklyn, self-consciously built nearly a century ago to look European; it had once served as a set in an inadvertently hilarious movie in which Melanie Griffith plays a police officer who goes undercover in a Hasidic community. I sat in the back of this Disneyfied sanctuary and discovered that I had no interest in praying, which I hardly remembered how to do. What I wanted to do was listen to the hymns, which offered the uncanny comfort of songs heard in childhood.
It was only much later, after I joined the synagogue and changed my life in a million other unforeseen ways, that I developed a theory about my condition. If Ferenczi's patients had suffered from the Sabbath, I was suffering from the lack thereof. In the Darwinian world of the New York 20-something, everything -- even socializing, reading or exercising -- felt like work or the pursuit of work by other means. Had I been able to consult Ferenczi, I believe he would have told me that I was experiencing the painful inklings of sanity. For in the 84 years since Ferenczi identified his syndrome, which bears a striking resemblance to what is now called workaholism, it has become the norm, and the Sabbath, the one day in seven dedicated to rest by divine command, has become the holiday Americans are most likely never to take.
It can be startling to realize just how integral the Sabbath once was to American time. When we tell our children stories about the first pilgrims landing on our shores, we talk rather vaguely about their quest for religious freedom. We leave out that this freedom was needed in large part so that the Puritans could obey the Fourth Commandment -- "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy" -- with a zealotry that had deeply alienated their countrymen back home. We all have heard of the Puritan "blue laws," named, supposedly, for the color of paper they were printed on. They required attendance at church but punished anyone who got there with unseemly haste or on too showy a horse. They forbade unnecessary visiting, except in emergencies, and smoking and sports. Unlike Orthodox Jews, who though strict about the Sabbath are nonetheless encouraged to drink and have marital sex on Friday night, the ascetic Puritans frowned on any kind of drinking or sex on Sunday. In at least one documented instance, the "lewd and unseemly behavior" of kissing your wife on your doorstep upon returning home from a journey of three years was punished by a spell in the stocks. From sunset Saturday to sunset Sunday, the most pious Sabbatarians (usually clergymen) wouldn't shave, have their rooms swept or beds made or allow food to be prepared or dishes washed. They ate only what had been cooked in advance and devoted all time not spent in church to reading Scripture. 
Even after Puritanism lost its hold on American culture, the American Sunday was observed with unusual strictness. In 1831, Alexis de Tocqueville observed with some surprise that few Americans were "permitted to go on a hunt, to dance or even to play an instrument on Sunday." As recently as 125 years ago, you would have been hard pressed to find a museum or library open on Sunday. Eighty years ago, football was considered too vulgar to be played on Sunday. Oldsters remember standing in line at the bank on Fridays to get cash for the weekend; youngsters assume they can withdraw at will. Anyone older than 30 can remember living with the expectation that most stores would be closed on Sunday; the expectation now is that they will be open, and we're miffed when they aren't. 
"The Lonely Days Were Sundays" is the title of a book about growing up Jewish in the churchgoing South. The lonely Sunday has been replaced by the overscheduled Sunday -- soccer Sunday, Little League Sunday, yoga-class Sunday, catch-up-around-the-house Sunday. Americans still go to church, of course, but only in between chores, sporting events and shopping expeditions. (You can now find A.T.M. machines inside megachurches; congregants don't have to waste a minute between services and the mall.) 
The eclipse of the Sabbath is just one small part of the larger erosion of social time, with its former generally agreed-upon rhythms of labor and repose. "After hours" has become a strictly personal concept, since the 24-hour convenience store, gas station, pharmacy, supermarket, movie theater, diner, factory and bar all allow us to work, shop, dine and be entertained at any time of day or night. We greet each shift of an activity from weekday to evening or weekend as proof of American cultural superiority; we knock over the barriers between us and the perpetual motion machine that is the marketplace with the glee you might expect of insomniacs who had been chained for too long to their beds. 
The lingering traces of Sabbatarianism seem comically vestigial, like the fetal tail: the New York blue law that won't let you buy beer till after noon on Sunday; Broadway stages that go dark on Sunday nights; work rules requiring us to show up at our offices Monday through Friday, even though many of us do our best work at night or on weekends (and, as you know if you've seen the movie "Office Space," putting in face time at the office is often a cover for doing less).
Customs exist because they answer a need; when they disappear, that need must be met in some other way. There is ample evidence that our relationship to work is out of whack. Economists, psychologists and sociologists have charted our ballooning work hours; the increase in time devoted to competitive shopping; the commercialization of leisure that turns fun into work and requires military-scale budgeting and logistics and emotionally draining interactions with service personnel. Personally, I think the alarm about these matters is often overblown. Most people, with the possible exception of parents of 13-year-olds, have the wherewithal to avoid the mall if they want to, and anyone who seeks to relax in a theme park or on a packaged tour deserves what he gets. So I won't weary you with cautionary tales about what our work-addicted culture can do to you, psychologically and physiologically, because, for one thing, it's completely within your power to hold it at bay, and for another, you don't want to anyway. Ours is a society that pegs status to overachievement; we can't help admiring workaholics. Let me argue, instead, on behalf of an institution that has kept workaholism in reasonable check for thousands of years. 
Most people mistakenly believe that all you have to do to stop working is not work. The inventors of the Sabbath understood that it was a much more complicated undertaking. You cannot downshift casually and easily, the way you might slip into bed at the end of a long day. As the Cat in the Hat says, "It is fun to have fun but you have to know how." This is why the Puritan and Jewish Sabbaths were so exactingly intentional, requiring extensive advance preparation -- at the very least a scrubbed house, a full larder and a bath. The rules did not exist to torture the faithful. They were meant to communicate the insight that interrupting the ceaseless round of striving requires a surprisingly strenuous act of will, one that has to be bolstered by habit as well as by social sanction.
Take the Puritan Sunday. It would be excruciating to us, and yet the restrictions were not pointless. They made of the day something rare and otherworldly, a realization of the Puritan vision of a city on the hill. "Sweet to the Pilgrims and to their descendants was the hush of their calm Saturday night and their still, tranquil Sabbath," wrote the 19th-century historian Alice Morse Earle, who shared with more famous authors, like Harriet Beecher Stowe and Nathaniel Hawthorne, a qualified nostalgia for the preindustrial Sabbath. "No work, no play, no idle strolling was known; no sign of human life or motion was seen except the necessary care of the patient cattle and other dumb beasts, the orderly and quiet going to and from the meeting, and at the nooning, a visit to the churchyard to stand by the side of the silent dead." Anyone who has experienced the eerie serenity of the ultra-Orthodox sections of Jerusalem or Brooklyn on Saturdays would be in a position to conjure a Puritan Sunday. 
Americans, of course, no longer cherish obedience as a virtue. We have become individualists, even libertarians. We will no longer put up with being told how to dispose of our free time. But our unwillingness to suffer constraint shouldn't blind us to the possibility that Sabbath discipline may have real benefits. For one thing, it reflects a paradoxical insight: only a Sabbath that you have to work for will appear worth keeping, just as, in psychoanalysis, a patient will value only those sessions for which he pays. Anything gotten for nothing will be treated as such. After all, as in therapy, the good that comes from the Sabbath is mostly intangible. We don't produce anything when we don't work. 
So counterintuitive is the idea of organized nonproductivity, given the force and universality of the human urge to make things, that you can't believe anyone ever managed to lift his head from his workbench or plow long enough to think of it. To the first-century Stoic philosopher Seneca, the Sabbath was absurd, a way for Rome's backward Jewish subjects to waste "almost a seventh of their life in inactivity." But when (or if), perhaps a millennium earlier, the Jews took over an old Mesopotamian day of taboo and transformed it into one of holy rest, they brought into the world not just the Sabbath but something just as precious, and surprisingly closely linked. They invented the idea of social equality. 
The Israelite Sabbath institutionalized an astonishing, hitherto undreamed-of notion: that every single creature has the right to rest, not just the rich and the privileged. Covered under the Fourth Commandment are women, slaves, strangers and, improbably, animals. The verse in Deuteronomy that elaborates on this aspect of the Sabbath repeats, twice, that slaves were not to work, as if to drive home what must have been very hard to understand in the ancient world. The Jews were meant to perceive the Sabbath not only as a way to honor God but also as the central vehicle of their liberation theology, a weekly reminder of their escape from their servitude in Egypt. 
In other words, we have the Sabbath to thank for labor legislation and for our belief that it is wrong for employers to drive their employees until they drop from exhaustion. So what do we do, today, with this remarkable heritage, which in the last century expanded to a generous two days, rather than just one? Much more than our ancestors could ever have imagined, and much, much less. We relax on the run and, in rare bursts of free time, we recreate. We choose from a dizzying array of leisure options and pursue them with an exemplary degree of professionalism and perfectionism. We rush our children from activity to activity, their days a blur of tight connections. 
And yet there are important ways in which even our impressive recreational creativity fails to reproduce the benefits of the Sabbath. Few elective activities will ever rise to a status higher than work in our minds, and therefore cannot be relied upon to counterbalance our neurotic drive to achieve. Most of us will jettison plans to go skiing if a deadline looms near. We will assign a high priority to a non-work-related hobby only if we have committed to it in some public manner, as we do when we join a volleyball team or a choir. (Oddly, one of the few times a parent can truly relax is when lingering on the sidelines of a child's baseball or soccer game; there is nothing like being forced to be somewhere and do very little for an hour and a half to declench the muscles of the mind.)
And not even our group leisure activities can do for us what Sabbath rituals could once be counted on to do. Religious rituals do not exist simply to promote togetherness. They're theater. They are designed to convey to us a certain story about who we are without our even quite noticing that they are doing so. (One defining feature of religious rituals, in fact, is that we often perform them for years before we come to understand what they mean; this is why ministers and rabbis are famously unsympathetic when congregants complain that worship services or holiday rites feel meaningless.) The story told by the Sabbath is that of creation: we rest because God rested on the seventh day. What leads from God to humankind is the notion of imitatio Dei: the imitation of God. In other words, we rest in order to honor the divine in us, to remind ourselves that there is more to us than just what we do during the week. 
Talk of God may disturb the secular, so they might prefer to frame the Sabbath in the more neutral context of aesthetics. The Sabbath provides two things essential to anyone who wishes to lift himself out of the banality of mercantile culture: time to contemplate and distance from everyday demands. The Sabbath is to the week what the line break is to poetic language. It is the silence that forces you to return to what came before to find its meaning. 
After joining that synagogue in Brooklyn, 
I began to incorporate into my life the most elemental rudiments of a traditional Jewish Sabbath: lighting the candles and eating at home on Friday night; going to religious services on Saturday morning; sleeping or reading or going to a museum in the afternoon. Orthodox Jews will scoff when they read of my subminimal level of observance; my secular friends think I've become a fanatic. Sticking to these few rituals, however, is the hardest and least unconscious thing I've ever done. I fail to keep the Sabbath more than I succeed, probably because I started trying to do it not as a result of some redemptive revelation, such as might occur to a character in a Russian novel, but experimentally, out of curiosity, and in a social vacuum -- by myself, rather than in a group or family setting. I didn't know how else to attain the self-possession that eluded me, the sense of owing nothing to anybody except perhaps God. The conventional weekend felt claustrophobic. Silent, solitary contemplation was not sustainable. The ceremonies performed by my ancestors for the past two millenniums had at least the virtue of having been previously tested and found to be effective.
Do I think everyone else should observe a Sabbath? I believe it would be good for them, and even better for me, since the more widespread the ritual, the more likely I am to observe it. It is much easier to keep the Sabbath, for instance, when your family does, too, though getting children to agree to do anything their friends don't do may prove insurmountable. (The greatest benefit of this may be that it makes a habit of unstructured family intimacy, without which parents must resort to so-called quality time, which tends to leave everyone feeling self-conscious.) 
For hundreds of years it was firmly believed that only a Sabbath enforced through social legislation would keep society from sliding into a kind of unwitting slavery, protecting the vulnerable from the powerful and quashing the punitive obsessive-compulsive who lurks within us all. One of the bitterest public policy debates in 19th-century America, in fact, was over whether offering postal service and opening public institutions on Sundays would harm our national character and lead directly to barbarism. 
If the Sabbath you choose to observe isn't a religious one, you should nonetheless be religiously disciplined in your approach to it, observing it every week, not just when it's convenient. I confess, though, that I have a hard time imagining a Sabbath divorced from religion: who would make the effort to honor the godly part of himself if he didn't believe in a deity, no matter how ecumenical? It's just as difficult to envision the Sabbath surviving the current speeding-up of everything without some generally enforced slowdown. The great religions lasted as long as they did because they were able to make their rituals part of everyone's life. 
But social legislation mandating Sunday (or Saturday) closings is no longer viable. Besides, it seems arrogant to tell someone what keeping the Sabbath would do for him, because it's impossible to know how a ritual will affect a person until he has performed it. "Holy days, rituals, liturgies -- all are like musical notations which, in themselves, cannot convey the nuances and textures of live performance," the historian Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi has written. 
Whenever I dream of living in a society with a greater respect for its Sabbatarian past -- a fantasy I entertain only with anxiety, since Sabbatarians have a long history of going too far -- I think of something two rabbis said. Rabbi Judah Loew of Prague, best known for his tales of the golem, pointed out that the story of Creation was written in such a way that each day, each new creation, is seen as a step toward a completion that occurred on the Sabbath. What was Creation's climactic culmination? The act of stopping. Why should God have considered it so important to stop? Rabbi Elijah of Vilna put it this way: God stopped to show us that what we create becomes meaningful to us only once we stop creating it and start to think about why we did so. The implication is clear. We could let the world wind us up and set us to marching, like mechanical dolls that go and go until they fall over, because they don't have a mechanism that allows them to pause. But that would make us less than human. We have to remember to stop because we have to stop to remember.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Playing Tag With Time And Art's Transience

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL RUSH; Michael Rush, director of the Palm Beach Institute of Contemporary Art, created several multimedia theater projects in New York in the 1980's and 90's.

 BODY:
IN one of the many film fragments Robert Whitman shot in the 1960's and 70's, the camera moves slowly toward an anonymous man standing on an unmarked street in Lower Manhattan. In the background cars are moving backward. Time is displaced; normal perceptions are challenged. What is going on? 
 Mr. Whitman's New York art career seems to share a bizarre affinity with this scenario. In the 1960's he was on a fast track into the history books, along with Allan Kaprow, Jim Dine, Claes Oldenberg, Yves Klein, Jean Tinguely and others who were making up as they went along what we now know as performance art and mixed-media art. 
 But unlike the others, with the possible exception of Mr. Kaprow, Mr. Whitman wasn't ultimately interested in making marketable artworks. He wasn't a painter looking to extend the emotive gestures of Abstract Expressionism beyond the canvas into happenings. Nor was he a sculptor, like Robert Morris, seeking to insert the body into three-dimensional objects. If an essential component of performance is its ephemerality, Mr. Whitman was the quintessential performance artist. Instead of paint, he worked with time; instead of steel or clay, he worked with actors and fabric -- and with film, much of which has fortunately remained in good condition, for by the mid-80's Mr. Whitman had virtually disappeared from view. His camera seemed stuck on permanent rewind until he reappeared quietly with a solo show at PaceWildenstein in 1995. 
This Wednesday, like any good phoenix, Mr. Whitman will rise again in a major retrospective of his multimedia installations at the Dia Center for the Arts. Also shown for the first time will be his "Dante Drawings" (1974-77). Based on "The Divine Comedy" and made with graphite, pastels, wax crayon and aluminum foil, this suite of 27 double-sided works will be suspended from the ceiling. 
Reared on Long Island in Cold Spring Harbor and in Englewood, N.J., Mr. Whitman, now 67, went to Rutgers University to study literature and playwrighting. Soon he started taking art courses because that's "where the excitement was," he said during a telephone interview from his home in Warwick, N.Y. "There was a gigantic outburst of energy in the art department at that time." Indeed there was. In 1999, the Newark Museum celebrated the Rutgers phenomenon with the exhibition "Off Limits: Rutgers University and the Avant-Garde 1957-1963." While there, Mr. Whitman rubbed elbows with Mr. Kaprow, Robert Watts, George Segal, Geoffrey Hendricks, Lucas Samaras, George Brecht and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mr. Whitman distinguished himself early on with sophisticated (for the period) theatrical works involving interaction between live performers and filmed images. Unlike Mr. Dine and Mr. Kaprow, whose performances were highly expressionistic, Mr. Whitman sought an imagistic theater through works described by Lynne Cooke, Dia's exhibition curator, as "magical, poetic, luscious and mysterious." 
"Prune Flat," his best-known piece, was first presented on the small stage of the Film-Makers' Cinematheque, now defunct, in midtown Manhattan in 1965. In it, two women dressed in white performed a sequence of movements that were repeated in filmed images of the same women on a screen behind them. Another woman wore a long white gown, which became a sort of scrim for a film of her undressing. At the end, Mr. Whitman projected a nude image of the young woman onto her clothed body. His intention was not to confuse but to challenge. We expect film to be used in the service of a narrative, not as an instrument of time. 
"Film acts as a clock," Mr. Whitman wrote in a series of program notes in 1976. "I use film for scale, time and color changes." (At roughly the same time, 1964-65, Robert Wilson, the artist who defines the "imagistic theater" of today, was making his first performance-film pieces at the Peerless Movie House near Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.) For the Whitman exhibition, Dia will offer for sale a DVD they have produced containing "Prune Flat" and documentary fragments of other early performances. 
In 1966 Mr. Whitman worked with Robert Rauschenberg and the engineer Billy Kluver on "Nine Evenings: Theater and Engineering" at the 69th Regiment Armory in Manhattan. This enormous undertaking, involving dozens of artists, filmmakers, sound engineers and hundreds of volunteers, has assumed mythic status among devotees of art and technology. 
"It was a nightmare," Mr. Whitman said, wryly recalling the electrical difficulties they encountered. His piece involved six or eight cars, as he remembers it, with men holding projectors in the back seats. As the cars circled the space, images bounced around the Armory.
Dia's retrospective will include several rarely seen installations, among them "Window" (1963) and "Solid Red Line" (1967), a laser project. In "Window," viewers look out a window onto a wooded area where a woman in a black dress is seen on a screen. She removes her clothes very naturally and walks in a repetitive movement. Mr. Whitman emphasizes the role of the camera as an instrument of voyeurism even as he disrupts the voyeur's gaze by repeating the woman's movements in highly choreographed editing.
"Solid Red Line" was developed with Mr. Kluver, an engineer at Bell Labs in New Jersey at the time. Mr. Whitman said he wanted to show a line "drawing itself around a room and then undrawing itself." 
"Spyglass," a new installation made with images from the 60's and 70's, is a 27-foot-wide octagon fitted with mirrors and screens. The film, all from early performances, will combine with visitors' reflections in the mirrors to create a monument to time, past and present. 
It is perhaps fitting that an artist preoccupied with time should be the beneficiary of the healing of time. In 1984, during an economically difficult period for many civic and art institutions, Mr. Whitman was rather hastily removed from the studio space on West 19th Street that Dia had purchased for him in 1979. A fair amount of his work was destroyed. As fate would have it, that space was soon occupied by performers, choreographers, dancers, videographers and musicians like Linda Mussman, John Jesurun, Ping Chong and John Kelly. As the Kitchen, it has become home to new generations of multimedia performance artists for whom Robert Whitman was the model.

HEADLINE: Rebuilding the Paths to Work When a Nest Egg Is Lost 

BYLINE:  By JULIA LAWLOR

 BODY:
EARLY retirement did not work out as planned for Janine Baron.
 For seven years, Ms. Baron, now 51, and her husband owned a boutique money management firm, starting out in Los Angeles and later moving to Manhattan. With the stock market booming, it prospered. Three years ago, her husband died, and she closed up shop, believing that she would never have to work again. 
 Most of her nest egg was in stocks, so she decided to play it safe and moved her high-technology investments into an Irish pharmaceutical company whose shares had risen steadily for 10 years. Unfortunately, they subsequently sank from $65 to $1, pulling down her portfolio by 75 percent. 
And so, last October, Ms. Baron joined the army of retired people in the New York metropolitan area who, having had their incomes hammered by the stock market bust, are looking for work.
It is going to be a tough slog for many of them. New York's economy has sunk deeper into recession even as business in the country as a whole shows signs of perking up. Unemployment in New York has climbed to 8.4 percent from 5.3 percent in less than two years, while the national jobless rate fell to 5.7 percent in January, from 6 percent the previous month. And of course, Wall Street is reeling and the city is planning extensive budget cuts.
Ms. Baron quickly discovered that all her old contacts on Wall Street had been laid off. She sent resumes to online job postings without success. To hedge her bets while she pursued a full-time job, she is also working toward a real estate license, and says she is thinking about starting a home-based business selling health and wellness products. She has given herself a year to start generating an income, though she says she dreads the thought "of having a 9-to-5 job that I hate."
For all the gloom in the air, though, workplace experts urge older people not to lose heart. Even today, some industries are experiencing labor shortages, they say. Deborah Russell, manager of economic security and work for AARP in Washington, says opportunities exist for retired people in health care, including nurses, home health care workers and medical assistants. The service industry needs retail and customer service workers, and there is a great demand for retired teachers.
The five occupations with the largest projected job growth between 2000 and 2010, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, are computer software engineers, computer support specialists, security guards, customer service representatives and food preparers and servers.
In the New York area, the job openings seem to be in the same sectors as in the rest of the country. At Adecco Employment Services, a placement agency in Melville, N.Y., there are openings for health care workers, call-center support workers and mortgage processors, according to Tom Lucas, senior vice president for human resources. Although many high-technology jobs have disappeared, there is still a demand for certain skilled positions like Oracle programmers, he said.
In most cases, older workers will have more luck finding jobs in small and midsize companies than in large corporations, said Richard Bayer, chief operating officer of the Five O'Clock Club, an outplacement and career coaching firm in New York. "They need people who don't require an investment in training, who can hit the ground running," he said.
What if you have just retired with a comfortable income? Plan for hard times anyway, the experts suggest. "People sever too many of their connections right at the beginning," said Jeri Sedlar, a New York executive recruiter who wrote "Don't Retire, Rewire!" (Alpha Books, 2002) with a co-author, Rick Miners. She urges retired people to keep attending industry association meetings, reading industry newsletters and maintaining contacts -- just in case.
If you do decide to rejoin the work force, she suggests, interview people working in the field that interests you. If possible, give the occupation a test drive. If you want to open a hot-dog stand, for example, go and work at one first.
Arnold Fleisher, a 67-year-old retired veterinarian from Long Beach, N.Y., found another way to get his foot in the door. Eight years ago, he sold his practice and began working about 10 hours a week for another veterinarian. He also did volunteer work at the Museum of Natural History in New York.
After taking a beating in the stock market and watching his income from certificates of deposit shrink, Mr. Fleisher jumped last June when the opportunity arose to turn a research project he was working on as a volunteer at the museum into a full-time paid position.
"It took being aggressive, pushing a little bit," he said. With his new museum job plus his part-time stint as a veterinarian, he puts in almost 50 hours a week.
Identifying the job you want is more than half the battle. But for the job interview itself, you should be careful to show enthusiasm, energy and the willingness to be a team player, no matter how lofty a position you held before retirement, specialists say.
"Leave your ego at home," said Robert K. Critchley, executive vice president of DBM, the New York human-resources consulting firm formerly called Drake Beam Morin, and author of "Rewired, Rehired or Retired" (Jossey-Bass, 2002). "Be positive, and don't live off past glories," he said. "No one wants to hear your war stories."
Mr. Bayer of the Five O'Clock Club advises clients to "overcome any prejudice you might encounter" by wearing stylish clothes, showing technical expertise and coming across as full of energy. "Mention any outdoor or indoor sports activities you enjoy," he said. "One of our clients, in his late 50's, would carry his briefcase and a small gym bag to the interview, and would mention it in passing. He was fit. It wasn't a bad tactic."
Most important, workplace specialists say, is to spend most of your job search time networking, rather than sending out hundreds of resumes or answering help-wanted ads. Mona Kreaden, a Manhattan resident who left her last job in June 2001 at the age of 60, says networking has always worked for her in the past. This time around, she is joining women's groups and associations, and contacting people in fields that interest her so that she can gather information.
After working as director of a program at New York University to help professors improve their teaching skills, Ms. Kreaden was ready to take it easy. In a long and varied career, she had been a teacher and an advertising executive, had run her family's trucking business and had run an international nonprofit organization. She imagined the next chapter of her life would involve a cause she truly believed in, perhaps working for a nonprofit agency or even as a volunteer.
But she lost half her savings in the bear market, and now, at 62, is compelled to find full-time work. She is considering becoming certified as an executive coach, but is keeping her options open. Not yet at the interview stage, she already has a plan for what she will say to counter any hesitation the interviewer might have about her age.
"I will say, 'If you hire a younger person, you will spend a lot of time and money getting that person up to the level you want,' " Ms. Kreaden said. "Whereas I have the experience."

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN; 
Houston

BYLINE:  By KATHRYN JONES; KATHRYN JONES is a regular contributor to The Times.

 BODY:
From its soaring "Blade Runner" skyline to the scandals of its rich and famous and the stature of its hottest pro basketball star, Houston is a city that feels supersized. This is, after all, the center of the Texas oil business, where enormous fortunes have been made and lost in booms and busts, and egos tend to run -- well, extra large.
 It's no surprise, then, that when Houstonians celebrate they like to do it up big. This spring is no exception. Texas's largest city is host to a rodeo of epic proportions and is opening a busy season of art exhibitions, musical performances and theater productions. Downtown is bustling with renovations of historic buildings, with new hotels and loft apartments and a new aquarium. 
 Spring is also the time when Houston's mild climate and location near the balmy Gulf of Mexico are shown to best advantage before the weather turns hot and sticky. Azaleas and camellias are showy, and the city on Buffalo Bayou feels as if part of the Old South has been dropped into a shiny metropolis.

Events
Even urban cowboys pull on a pair of boots when the annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo gallops into town. The event, which runs through March 16, drew 1.5 million people last year and promises to be even bigger this year in the new, sprawling Reliant Park at Kirby Drive and South Loop 610. Cattle, horses, goats, llamas and alpacas will fill acres of pens at the livestock show, while the rodeo will feature championship bull riding, barrel racing, steer wrestling and other events. Among the scheduled musical acts at the rodeo are Bon Jovi (March 12 at 7 p.m.), Ray Charles and Ronnie Milsap (March 14 at 7 p.m.) and Alabama (March 16 at 4 p.m.). Tickets are $6 for the livestock show and $14 to $75 for the rodeo and concerts. Call (713) 629-3700 for tickets; for more information, (832) 667-1000 or www .hlsr.com. 
Anchoring Houston's museum district, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, 1001 Bissonnet Street, (713) 639-7300, www.mfah.org, presents several exhibitions this spring in its two buildings. Among them is "American Modern: 1920's and 30's Design," March 15 to July 20, which examines how the clean lines, graphics and industrial materials of furniture and decorative objects in those decades created a distinctive aesthetic. "Paris in the Age of Impressionism: Masterworks From the Musee d'Orsay," April 6 to June 29, includes more than 100 works from the Paris museum, including paintings by Cezanne, Degas and Manet. The enormous permanent collection features Renaissance, 18th-century, Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. Open Tuesday and Wednesday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursday to 9 p.m., Friday and Saturday to 7 p.m., and Sunday from 12:15 to 7 p.m. General admission is $7, free on Thursday, or $10 to $22 including the ticketed exhibitions.
On a quiet street in the Montrose neighborhood, the Menil Collection, 1515 Sul Ross Street, (713) 525-9400, www.menil.org, explores the early work of the Minimalist sculptor Donald Judd in an exhibition running through April 27. "Jasper Johns: Drawings," through May 4, travels through Johns's career. In the permanent collection, ranging over antiquity, tribal cultures and the 20th century, are paintings, sculptures, prints, drawings, photographs and rare books. Open Wednesday to Sunday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. No charge for admission.
Lush Hermann Park with its gardens and fountains is the backdrop for the Houston Museum of Natural Science, 1 Hermann Circle Drive, (713) 639-4629, www.hmns.mus.tx.us. "St. Peter and the Vatican: The Legacy of the Popes," through July 27, displays more than 350 artworks, artifacts, relics, historical documents and treasures, many never shown outside the Vatican, including a fourth-century fresco of San Siricio and a 13th-century mosaic bust of an angel. There is also a live butterfly exhibit, a gem and mineral collection, a planetarium, dinosaur skeletons and an IMAX theater. Open daily. General admission is $6, $17.50 for the Vatican exhibition. 
Houston has the Southwest's largest theater district. This spring's productions include the Tony-winning Broadway revival of Cole Porter's "Kiss Me, Kate," starring Glory Crampton and Paul Schoeffler, at Theater Under the Stars in the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts, 800 Bagby Street. Performances are March 20 to April 6, mostly at 8 p.m., but times vary. Tickets are $25 to $68; (888) 558-3882; www.tuts.com.

The new Downtown Aquarium, Memorial at Bagby, created by Landry's Restaurants, opened last month in a six-acre entertainment and restaurant complex with dancing fountains, a carousel and a shark tank reached by a train through an acrylic tunnel. The enormous underwater tanks hold more than 200 species of marine life, among them seahorses, piranhas, octopuses, jellyfish, electric eels, live coral and stingrays. Theme areas include a Louisiana swamp, a South Seas shipwreck, an Amazon rain forest, a Caribbean reef, a sunken temple and an offshore oil derrick. The Aquarium Restaurant gives the illusion of dining at the bottom of the sea among fish and coral. Exhibits are open Sunday to Thursday 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday till 11.

Renewal Plans in Norwalk Look Away From River

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: NORWALK 

 BODY:
IN the mid-1980's, the City of Norwalk and its Redevelopment Agency devised a plan to rescue South Norwalk from drug dealers, petty crime and burned-out buildings by restoring the 19th-century ship chandleries, stores and flats on and around Washington Street as condominiums, offices, boutiques and restaurants that would attract young professionals and tourists. The agency's concept is now expanding into the 70-acre Reed-Putnam redevelopment area and into traditional downtown Norwalk, areas that were not blighted but were largely ignored during the South Norwalk renaissance. 
 Developers have embarked on new housing, shops and offices, and the state has set aside $20 million for a major infrastructure overhaul that will join South Norwalk to the downtown, giving vehicles and pedestrians a more direct passage between the two districts. 
 These efforts are taking place in spite of a laggard economy and the possibility of war. Mayor Alexander Knopp, who took office in November after serving as a Democratic state representative and Norwalk City Council president, said, "These projects take advantage of the low-interest municipal bond market and private construction firms that are seeking municipal business because there isn't enough private construction to keep their crews together." 
Mountains of newly upturned earth along West Avenue are the first step in fulfilling the Fred F. French Company's commitment to finance and build a $250 million complex of four buildings with a total of 1.15 million square feet of offices, some ground-floor retail space and structured parking for 4,500 cars.
"We are working with the architects, Fox & Fowle," said Timon Malloy, president of Fred F. French Investing L.L.C. of Stamford, "and we are prepared to hold on until the market changes." Meanwhile, when a tenant needing 100,000 square feet or more comes along, he said, "we will start the first building, and if a tenant wanted to build and-or operate a building, we would be interested."
In view of Norwalk's office vacancy rate of 24.6 percent, higher than the rest of Fairfield County, prospects do not appear rosy, but James Fagan, a senior managing director of suburban real estate at CB Richard Ellis in Stamford, said, "That is one of the best located projectsin Fairfield County, at the confluence of I-95 and Route 7, to be built on a beautiful campuslike setting with water views, a few blocks from the South Norwalk train station. Companies that have to make relocation decisions are being cautious, but we've been through this before. Even though there is more space coming on the market, I believe most of the bad news is out there." 
The French company has been acquiring land parcel by parcel for almost a decade. Negotiations are under way for three more parcels that would bring the total to 13 acres, reaching from West Avenue to Interstate 95, at a cost so far of $12 million. The price of three parcels taken by eminent domain has not been determined. The acquisitions include the former Connecticut Limousine depot, which will become a marketing office for Fred F. French. The depot, providing transportation to airports around New York City, has moved to the South Norwalk train station. 
Widening Reed Street and creating an underpass beneath the Danbury branch of the Metro-North Railroad will create a path from West Avenue to Putnam Avenue at the Fred F. French site. An extension of Pine Street will connect West Avenue to River Street near a new housing complex planned by AvalonBay Communities, and widening West Avenue and creating turns will facilitate access to Exits 14 and 15 on I-95. 
In spite of a depressed apartment rental market, AvalonBay expects to build a $50 million complex of 312 units in two four-story buildings on Belden Avenue. The rental complex will replace a mall surrounded by paving and anchored by a Pathmark supermarket, which will be razed. AvalonBay is going through public hearings and reviews by various boards and commissions.
The developer is known for including affordable units in its projects but will not have such units here because, as Mayor Knopp noted, "Norwalk has 12 percent affordable housing -- more than the 10 percent the state wants."
He added, "Avalon residents will jump-start the Wall Street area, bringing people downtown for restaurants and shopping." Wall Street is one of the main business streets in the downtown area.
Units are to have one, two or three bedrooms. Rents are estimated at $1,500 to $2,600 a month and are to include use of an outdoor pool and indoor gym. There are center courtyards in each building, nine-foot ceilings, balconies or decks and lofts in the fourth-floor units. The buildings are to be separated by a mews through which people may stroll down to the river. The entire property will be landscaped, and a riverside walk with benches will be installed. City approval is expected within a year, and occupancy would follow 30 months later.
A third venture, financed by private and public money, is a garage under construction on North Water Street opposite Norwalk's premier tourist attraction, the Maritime Aquarium. Scheduled to open in November, the five-story structure accommodating 780 cars will have a skylight at the top, beaming daylight down through a central atrium and stairway. The first two or three stories of cars will be behind a new complex of shops, 10 condominiums and 3,000 square feet of office space on the North Water Street and Marshall Street sides. A street-level restaurant will face the aquarium. Cars on the upper floors will be behind an exterior wall. 
Beinfeld Wagner & Associates, Norwalk architects, designed the project in partnership with Desmond Associates of New York City and Hartford, specialists in parking structures. The residential units will have one or two bedrooms with sliding translucent fiberglass walls that would allow light through. Oversized windows, exposed steel structural members, stainless steel kitchen counters, stainless steel appliances and 10-foot-high ceilings of matte-finished steel are featured, along with high-tech lighting tracks mounted on steel beams. 
W E wanted to pick up the feeling of the industrial lofts in Lower Manhattan," said Bruce Beinfeld, a partner in the firm, "although these are flats." His company has worked on some 30 design and redesign projects in the city, including the restoration of the Lock Building, the South Norwalk station and the New England Brewing Company and Pub.
Norwalk floated $11 million in bonds for the parking portion of the garage, which it will own and operate. The Spinnaker Companies of Stamford, headed by Clay Fowler, will pay $3 million to build the project and will own the shops, condominiums, restaurant and office space. Spinnaker has an agreement to pay fair market value to purchase a city-owned three-acre parcel north of the aquarium in the future, and Mr. Fowler would build a hotel and several apartment buildings on the site. The city is expecting revenue of about $900,000 in its first year from visitor parking and from leasing garage space to the aquarium and the Lock Building across the street.
A study is under way at the Pinnacle Group in Boston on the feasibility of a 250-room full-service hotel with 20,000 square feet of conference space on the three-acre site. If not, Mr. Malloy said, interest has been shown by hoteliers in the Fred F. French development and in a property occupied by Maritime Motors on West Avenue. 
Beinfeld Wagner and Spinnaker are partners in another condominium project on on Ann Street, around the corner from the garage, offering 34 similarly designed units of 1,000 to 1,200 square feet with some retail space on the ground floor, including an expansion of the Barcelona Restaurant. Apartments in both locations are expected to sell for around $300,000.
State grants of $1.5 million have been used by Stanley M. Seligson Properties to plan for a hotel, offices, 500 rental units and shops on the east side of West Avenue from Orchard Street to Chapel Street. The company already owns some 650,000 square feet of retail, office and distribution space in the city, including Costco, Sports Authority and Toys "R" Us on Route 1, plus several storefronts and Loehmann's Plaza on West Avenue, where a Gap and Huffman Koos furniture store are located. 
Now Mr. Seligson awaits the state's approval of a municipal development plan in which the company asked for substantial city and state subsidies for construction. Timothy Sheehan, executive director of the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency, said, "In this economy subsidies not for public purposes may be hard to come by."
To date, improvements along the west side of the river have turned a neglected wasteland into a charming recreation area. Construction of a quarter-mile elevated pedestrian boardwalk along the river and a large deck jutting out over the water is more than half finished, extending from Heritage Park just north of the aquarium to the I-95 overpass spanning the river. Eventually, it will end at a West Avenue complex that includes the landmarked Lockwood-Mathews Mansion Museum and the Norwalk Children's Museum. Strollers along the way are already treated to congregations of swans, ducks, kayaks and sailboats.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Connecticut and Westchester copies last Sunday about renewal plans for downtown Norwalk misstated the name of a children's museum in an area that will be reached by a riverside boardwalk now being built. It is the Stepping Stones Museum for Children, not the Norwalk Children's Museum.

Which European Stocks Would Hold Up in a War?

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
AS the possibility of war in Iraq unnerves the markets, Ben Funnell, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, has devised a "war basket" of European stocks that he contends will hold up well if shooting starts.
 Mr. Funnell's first advice to investors is to "expect the expected." He referred not just to a war but also to the stock market's path if one breaks out. He noted that the year began with a strong consensus that share prices would fall until war began, then leap as it progressed toward defeat for Iraq, just as in the 1991 Persian Gulf war. But amid the waiting, he said, investors have begun psyching themselves out, reasoning that if everyone is sure that a war will send stocks higher, then maybe it will not. 
 That "makes it all the more likely that expecting the expected might just turn out to be the most profitable, or least unprofitable, way to be invested over the next couple months," he said in a note to clients.
"Keeping it simple, we might well surmise that the most obvious move is the one to trade," he added.
In 1991, markets rallied around the world, with European ones outpacing those in the United States. Some industries in Europe rose much more than others after the land assault began, and Mr. Funnell highlighted four -- transportation, insurance, banking and basic materials -- that he sees as fair bets to beat the market if war occurs again.
To select companies in each sector, he used various growth and valuation criteria, like earnings growth for banks and dividend yield for materials producers, that have correlated most highly with returns over the last decade. That resulted in a list of 16 stocks, including three airlines, Air France and the budget operations Ryanair of Ireland and easyJet of Britain, and two other transportation companies, Copenhagen Airports and Autoroutes du Sud de France, which operates toll roads.
There are four banks -- the Anglo Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland and two from Italy, Banca Popolare di Verona and UniCredito -- as well as the Swiss reinsurance company Converium and TPG, a Dutch provider of postal services. The remainder are in basic materials: the British paper producer Rexam; two German chemical companies, the Linde Group and BASF; and two suppliers of building materials, CRH of Ireland and Lafarge of France.
Dominic Wallington, a manager of European funds at Invesco, rejected the premise that a new war would amount to a rerun of the previous plot. "I'm slightly skeptical that those who feel the Western economies will be up and running after a short war are right." he said.
Still, he said Mr. Funnell's portfolio, intended for a sharp rally, is not that aggressive. "Funnily enough, quite a few of the stocks in there are quite defensive," Mr. Wallington said. "I'm happy with a relatively defensive stance. The vast majority are stocks we would be quite happy with."
He especially likes the four banks but would drop the airlines. Better choices if a war, even a quick one, doesn't prove to be an economic panacea, he said, include the British water utility Severn Trent and the Spanish tobacco producer Altadis.
GARY DUGAN, global strategist at the J. P. Morgan Private Bank, gave Mr. Funnell's portfolio mixed reviews. His chief objection is that many of the stocks are small and somewhat obscure. In a war rally, he argued, investors are likely to rush into marquee names first. While he agrees that bank stocks would attract buyers, he would favor blue chips like UBS and the Credit Suisse Group in Switzerland, ING in the Netherlands and Deutsche Bank. 
A rally's second wave might include "companies where you believe there will be upgrades to profit forecasts or where there is a restructuring story," Mr. Dugan said.
"You also could see money for names that have held up well in the last 12 months and still are on low valuations," he added. He mentioned Credit Suisse and UBS in this context, too -- Credit Suisse as a restructuring play and UBS as a model of resilience.
A rally's third phase would encompass midsize companies of the sort prominent on Mr. Funnell's list. Mr. Dugan likes the basic-materials sector, including three that Mr. Funnell named: BASF, Linde and Lafarge.
He then added two more materials stocks: Corus, formerly British Steel, and UPM-Kymmene, a Finnish paper company. "These are bigger-cap stocks which would lead their sectors in any rally," he said. He agreed with Mr. Wallington that it would be best to avoid transportation companies and that expecting the expected had limitations. While the situation is similar to the one in 1991, he said, there are important differences. "Then there weren't any other battles to be won," Mr. Dugan said. "There is still a big issue with North Korea and concern about the Middle East and what the U.S. will do next, so I would be hesitant to run in and buy an airline stock. The geopolitical situation won't clear up overnight."

HEADLINE: Financial Backup Sites: How Dispersed? 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
UNDER the cobalt-blue glow of ceiling-mounted computer screens, 10 tiered trading pits -- for crude oil, heating oil, unleaded gasoline, natural gas, gold, silver, copper and other commodities -- stretch more than three-quarters of an acre across a windowless room. Snaking among the pits are clusters of traders' booths, nearly 700 of them, linked to the outside by 2,000 telephones.
 This is the New York Mercantile Exchange. But it is not in Battery Park City. It is not even in New York City. The $12 million trading floor sits anonymously on Long Island, ready for an event its builders hope will never come; a disaster great enough to close Lower Manhattan again. 
 "It's a pretty big insurance policy, but we felt we needed it," said Gary Rizzi, a member of the executive committee at the exchange, which was forced to suspend trading for four days after Sept. 11. 
Ever since the attack, financial institutions downtown have struggled with the question of how big a logistical insurance policy they need to guarantee continuity in case of another catastrophe. Naturally, that means diversifying locations where they do business. But then comes the hard part: how close to headquarters should backup and recovery centers be?
"There's a reason financial services tend to be congregated," said Neal L. Wolkoff, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the mercantile exchange. "There's a concentration of expertise, information and paper. Don't discount how much of that there still is."
Each mile of separation buys greater assurance of surviving even the most devastating event. But as distance grows, so do costs. Among the questions: Does the institution intend to recover operations within hours or within a day? Is thebackup site meant to be staffed by employees who normally work at headquarters, or by an entirely different crew? Is a synchronous database needed; that is, duplicate, up-to-the-minute computer records?
And against what calamity is one planning? A nuclear warhead? A radioactive bomb? Poison gas? Poisoned water? Has this hypothetical attack hit headquarters? Or two blocks away? Or across the river? Or at the backup centers, too? Have other institutions been affected? Are telecommunications links still open? And bridges? Tunnels? Subways? Highways?
As if the equation were not complex enough, federal regulators roiled the calculations last August with a draft white paper that asked, "Should some minimum distance from primary sites be specified for core clearing and settlement organizations and firms that play significant roles in critical markets (e.g., 200-300 miles between primary and backup sites)?"
The regulators are widely expected to answer their own question "no," and avoid specifying distances when they issue the final report in a month or so.
But this still leaves financial institutions with the daunting task of trying to plot a tangible response to an unknowable risk. Whether an institution is seeking to place its backup operation a "nuclear distance" from its primary site -- to use the words of Richard A. Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange -- or is comfortable thinking in less apocalyptic dimensions, the notion of dispersion is on the table.
While such dispersion is widely seen as hurting the Manhattan real estate market, it may be a boon for the New York region. For example, when Morgan Stanley decided last year not to complete the three-building campus it was developing near Times Square, the alternate location it chose was the former Texaco headquarters in Harrison, N.Y.
"In many ways, we're uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend," said Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association in New York. "Alone among large metropolitan regions, we have this network of satellite employment centers that are all linked together -- and to the core -- by a modern transit system and highway system."
With the prospect of war in Iraq, the notion of keeping operations geographically contained may gain appeal. "During the Gulf War, we saw a near shutdown of international business travel," Mr. Yaro said. "At those times, Metro-North and the L.I.R.R. start looking pretty good."
Just how much dispersion is taking place is hard to chart. In the best of times, institutions are reluctant to discuss disaster-recovery plans too specifically in public. And these are not the best of times; especially after the Bush administration declared a "high" terror alert on Feb. 7.
Even general surveys are veiled behind security concerns. Without identifying the companies by location, the Securities Industry Association found last September that 27 of 59 large brokerages, investment banks, commercial banks and mutual funds already had backup data centers more than 30 miles from their primary sites and that 20 of 57 companies had relocation offices more than 30 miles from headquarters.
Taking a different tack, the General Accounting Office said in a report to Congress last month that 10 out of 15 organizations it had surveyed -- exchanges, clearing houses, electronic communication networks and payment system processors -- were at risk of disruption because their backup centers were less than 10 miles from primary sites, or they had no backup centers at all.
The issuance last August of the draft white paper by the Federal Reserve System, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Comptroller of the Currency and the New York State Banking Department created enormous concern that the government would mandate significant geographic dispersion to guarantee the continuity of "core clearing and settlement organizations" and "firms that play significant roles in critical financial markets" in case of a "wide-scale, regional disruption."
Kathryn S. Wylde, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, said: "This raised a huge issue across the financial-services industry. It started worrying the insurers."
To calm things down, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman; Harvey L. Pitt, who was then the S.E.C. chairman; and Comptroller John D. Hawke Jr. sent a letter in December to Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who had called the draft white paper a "dagger pointed at the heart of New York."
The regulators denied the charge. "The draft white paper does not recommend as a sound practice that firms move out of center-city locations," they wrote. "Nor does it set specific minimum distance requirements for backup operations or mandate the size of the staff at such operations."
But it did suggest that "out-of-region backup locations should not be dependent on the same labor pool or infrastructure components used by the primary site, and their respective labor pools should not both be vulnerable to simultaneous evacuation or inaccessibility." In the final version of the report, the regulators are expected to ask institutions how they would deploy a single staff in case of a disruption.
After Sept. 11, the stock exchange built a second trading floor, at a cost of $25 million, outside Manhattan but within city limits. (Exchange officials will say no more about its location.) It is to serve only if the Big Board at 11 Wall Street is disabled.
Then the exchange began talking about a third trading floor that would serve as a backup but also function day to day. Mr. Grasso said last September that "to do it right, you have to do it at a nuclear distance" but added a few weeks later that the exchange would build outside New York City only as "a last of last resorts."
Although the exchange has said nothing publicly since then, the third trading floor is still under consideration, according to the General Accounting Office. The exchange has also built an independent telecommunications network with fiber-optic hubs around Boston, Chicago and New York, where the lines are separate from Verizon's widely used underground conduits.
One of the most important institutions downtown, despite its low public profile, is the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation. Through its subsidiary, the National Securities Clearing Corporation, it processes nearly 14 million transactions a day, including most of the trading volume of the Big Board, Nasdaq, American Stock Exchange, regional stock exchanges and electronic trading networks.
Although it had backup centers before Sept. 11, it is planning to "further decentralizing both facilities and people," said a spokesman, Stuart Z. Goldstein. Without elaborating, he said the corporation would have no problem meeting a requirement for backup sites in other regions.
DEPOSITORY TRUST kept operating immediately after the attack but the Bank of New York, which is also an important clearing organization, was badly disrupted. On Sept. 11, 2001, it had more than 8,300 employees within 400 yards of the World Trade Center in headquarters at 1 Wall Street, a computer center at 101 Barclay Street, and space at 100 Church Street and 75 Park Place. The 25-story computer center was so heavily damaged that it did not reopen until July.
Yet in testifying to federal regulators against a 200-to-300-mile separation rule, Donald R. Monks, senior executive vice president of the bank, said, "The events of 9/11 taught us that in a regional disaster, especially one caused by a terrorist act, air transport may be unavailable for days, and geographic obstacles such as rivers may become impassable if the authorities order the closing of bridges and tunnels.
"Further, there is a human element to this equation," he said. "Employees will have natural concerns about the safety of their families and their homes, and may not be willing to relocate hundreds of miles away to staff a distant processing site when they are needed most at home.
"None of this is to suggest that distance is not desirable," Mr. Monks said. "Contingency sites should be miles, not city blocks or hundreds of yards, from the primary operations sites that they support. However, this means that the contingency site will have to be within something approximating 'normal commuting distance' of the primary site."
The bank has taken that step with its plan to move 1,500 employees from 100 Church Street to a new 14-story, 400,000-square-foot office building at Atlantic Terminal, a mixed-use complex at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues in Brooklyn that is being developed by Forest City Ratner Companies. The $240 million project is to be finished next year. The architects are Swanke Hayden Connell.
"The bulk of the labor force they focused on lived in Brooklyn," said Robert Stillman, senior managing director of Insignia/ESG, which represented the bank. He said the bank had to balance accommodating those workers with the need for greater distance between operations.
The project will adjoin the station at which the Long Island Rail Road intersects with the 2, 3, 4, 5 and Q subway lines -- a decided advantage, even at a time of general worry about the vulnerability of such transit hubs.
"The main concern of the Bank of New York was that they not be physically over the railroad," said Bruce C. Ratner, the president and chief executive of Forest City Ratner. He said the bank was assuaged because its building would stand on a portion of the site above solid ground.
Unlike a pure disaster-recovery center, the Brooklyn building is to operate as a back office in the normal course of business. But every other work station is wired for a second telephone and computer, Mr. Monks said, meaning that 750 employees could be added. The bank also has several hundred employees in upstate New York and Florida who could immediately assume critical responsibilities, in what Mr. Monks described as a pilot and co-pilot arrangement.
The Brooklyn deal underscored a point that city officials have been trying to make since the white paper was issued, said Andrew M. Alper, president of the Economic Development Corporation: that New York has a "geographic scale that allows you to separate operations but keep them close enough that you can get back and forth."
The New York Board of Trade, which lost its headquarters at 4 World Trade Center, has been operating for the last year and a half from a backup center in Long Island City, Queens. On Wednesday, it announced it would lease 45,000 square feet at the mercantile exchange in Battery Park City.
The mercantile exchange itself suffered no appreciable damage in the attack. But it learned that a backup site only a few blocks away -- 22 Cortlandt Street -- was useless under warlike conditions.
"Nobody -- obviously including ourselves -- thought of buildings being attacked like that," Mr. Wolkoff said. Though the exchange had generators, it lost its water supply. Without water, air-conditioning cannot be run and neither can computers.
After the attack, exchange officials regrouped at a Midtown hotel and then made a foray by boat to headquarters, where they retrieved computer tapes.
"We realized that while we could recover electronically," Mr. Wolkoff said, "we didn't want to be in a position where we couldn't recover open-outcry trading."
The exchange estimated that members and employees were fairly evenly distributed around Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester. It looked in all three areas before settling on Long Island. (As a condition for allowing a reporter and photographer to visit, the exchange asked that its specific location not be divulged.)
Construction began in April and the floor was ready in October. It is expected to cost nearly $1 million a year to rent, operate and keep at the ready. For example, the exchange is paying to keep a constant dial tone on 2,000 phones, with 1,000 more phone lines reserved for its use if needed.
"We could come in the next day and start trading," said Mitchell Steinhause, vice chairman. The exchange would expect 3,500 to 4,000 people at the alternate site.
At Battery Park City are two 25,000-square-foot trading floors, one for the Nymex division, which deals largely in petroleum products, and the other for Comex, which deals largely in precious metals, and the board of trade. There is only one floor in Long Island, but Nymex pits are on one side and Comex pits on another, arranged so that traders can keep watch on related activity. "It's a different address," Mr. Steinhause said, "but when you walk on the floor, it's the same."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Ad Business Outlook May Be Brightening

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
IN 1917, Norman Douglas, a British author and diplomat, wrote, "You can tell the ideals of a nation by its advertisements." 
 The contemporary world might have altered his view. Last year, global advertising revenue was nearly $450 billion, according to Universal McCann, a division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Nearly half of that figure was spent in the United States. That's a lot of ideals. 
 Lauren Rich Fine, an advertising and marketing services analyst at Merrill Lynch, talked last week about the business of advertising. Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. Last year, conditions seemed to stabilize for advertising companies. Is the business turning up?

A. If it weren't for the prospect of war, I think that within the next three months to six months we would have a full-blown recovery. In the last six months of 2002, clients did increase media expenditures. Television stations reported double-digit numbers. Radio started to move higher, as did newspapers. The agencies had started to see a pickup. Now, people aren't cutting back, but they are postponing decisions until there is more clarity.

Q. How fast does advertising revenue tend to grow?

A. Over long periods of time, advertising revenue has grown in line with nominal increases in gross domestic product. But it clearly underperformed gross domestic product growth in 2001 and 2002, and we don't know what will happen this year. We think it will come close to nominal G.D.P. growth this year, and in 2004 will slightly outpace G.D.P. growth.

Q. Are the companies in this highly creative, competitive business just plodding along?

A. If an ad agency is gaining market share, it will outpace the cycle. Investors are trying to pick the sweet spot, those that will outpace the market.

Q. The business has consolidated. At the end of 2001, the top 10 ad organizations controlled nearly 70 percent of the global market, compared with almost 30 percent in 1989. Does that limit their ability to grow?

A. Because the companies have gotten so large, it will be harder and harder for them to sustain above-average growth.

Q. So what is the investor profile for these stocks?

A. The investor profile has changed quite a bit. For years, a company like Interpublic was considered a widows-and-orphans stock. Since last summer, it has become more controversial because of the suggestion of accounting irregularities. And Omnicom has a similar cloud over it. As a result of that, the whole group has been painted as more speculative than it was in the past.

Q. The stocks were highfliers back in the late 1990's, when they were riding the technology/dot-com wave. Have the advertising downturn and the worries about accounting turned them into value stocks?

A. Omnicom is currently trading at about an 11 to 12 percent discount to the Standard & Poor's 500 index. For a time in the late 1990's, it was trading at a premium of anywhere from 30 percent to 50 percent, partly due to the dot-com mania.

Q. Are the accounting issues a significant concern?

A. Investors are concerned about what might happen at Interpublic, which is the subject of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In my mind there isn't anything to resolve at Omnicom.

Q. Do you recommend any of the stocks?

A. Our analyst in Europe has a buy rating on WPP, which trades American depository receipts in this country.
Otherwise, we like Omnicom and Alliance Data, a marketing services company. 
We like Omnicom because they have the best advertising agencies in the world, BBDO, DDB and TBWA. As a result of that, they get to pitch the most new business, they win the most new business and they grow at the fastest rate. So, we like the quality of their assets, their strategic vision and the valuation of the stock, especially given their growth rate. 
Alliance Data does private-label transaction processing for companies like Limited and Ann Taylor. I like the fact they have posted really good growth numbers. Their long-term targets are 12 percent revenue growth, 15 percent earnings growth before interest, depreciation and amortization and 18 percent cash earnings per share growth. They have been hitting those numbers.

Q. The Interpublic board of directors demoted the company's chairman and chief executive last week. Would you stay away from the stock?

A. I can't advise anyone to buy Interpublic shares yet. This has been a company under pressure for a couple of years. It is in disarray, and has seen some large clients leave over the last couple of months.

HEADLINE: Personal Business; 
A NewHealth Plan Works, at Least for the Healthy

BYLINE:  By BETH KOBLINER 

 BODY:
AT this time last year, if Shalonda Welborn or a member of her family had to see a doctor, she would have had to chip in a $15 co-payment. But this year, she expects to pay no money out of pocket.
 Last fall, Mrs. Welborn, 32, a senior training specialist in corporate development, signed up for a new kind of health coverage, called a health reimbursement arrangement, or H.R.A. As part of the plan, her employer, CompuCom Systems, an information technology service provider in Dallas, has given her a $2,000 health care savings account that she can use to pay for medical care. 
 But Mrs. Welborn's new plan also comes with a hefty deductible of $3,400. That means that if she spends more than her allotted $2,000 in the account this year, she will be liable for the next $1,400 of expenses. After she reaches the deductible, the insurance plan kicks in; it will cover 80 percent of costs, if network doctors are used, and 60 percent if not. 
But if any of the $2,000 remains in her account at year-end, she can add it to the next $2,000 CompuCom will set aside for her in 2004.
Mrs. Welborn expects to do just that. She says she and the other members of her family -- her husband, Gary, and her daughter, Madisyn -- have no long-term health problems. "I like the idea that I may not have to pay any money this year except for my premiums, and I like having control over what I spend," she said. She said that the premiums for her plan were $136 a month, or about 40 percent lower than they would have been under her old coverage. 
Right now, only about 300,000 to 400,000 people -- less than half of 1 percent of all insured employees -- participate in H.R.A.'s. But this small group is being studied closely by benefits consultants, policy experts and insurance companies. Employers are awaiting evidence that H.R.A.'s, commonly marketed as consumer-driven plans, will help contain the cost of health care. The cost of employer-paid premiums rose 12.7 percent last year, the second consecutive year of double-digit increases, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research group in Menlo Park, Calif.
Consumer-driven plans have gained momentum since the Internal Revenue Service issued regulations in June encouraging their use. A recent poll by Mercer Human Resource Consulting found that 7 percent of employers with 20,000 or more employees offer consumer-driven plans, and an additional 14 percent say that they are likely to have them in the next two years. Most offer these plans as an option among other types of coverage. 
Employer-sponsored health care is currently dominated by health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations. More than one in four employees are enrolled in H.M.O.'s, which limit workers to a network of doctors and tend to require preapproval for specialists. Employees pay a small co-payment, generally $10 to $20, for each doctor visit and prescription. An additional 52 percent of employees are enrolled in P.P.O.'s, which give them access to a wider choice of doctors but also impose a deductible for out-of-network care, currently averaging $275.
Consumer-driven plans are variations on P.P.O.'S and H.M.O.'s, but with two important differences: they carry considerably higher deductibles, often around $1,500 for individuals and $3,000 for families; and employers cushion these higher deductibles at the front end, by financing individual cash accounts ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
Employees can use these accounts to cover their medical spending, and in some cases treatments not usually covered by health insurance. Those who do not deplete their accounts may roll over the remaining money from year to year, generally up to limits that vary by company. Mrs. Welborn, for example, can have a maximum of $6,000 in her account.
Unlike participants in H.M.O.'s and P.P.O.'s, those with consumer-driven plans must pay the full fare for everything from doctor's visits to prescription drugs, until they meet their deductibles and the insurance coverage takes over.
The major purveyors of these plans are a handful of small companies that are not insurers but administrators, including Definity Health in St. Louis Park, Minn.; Lumenos in Alexandria, Va.; and Destiny Health in Bethesda, Md. Insurance companies like Aetna and Humana have recently begun offering consumer-driven plans alongside their other offerings.
Proponents of consumer-driven plans contend that they will cut costs for employers by giving employees a sense of ownership over the money they spend, and with it, an incentive to spend more wisely. The current system of small co-payments, they say, isolates consumers from the true costs of health care. To encourage employees to avoid unnecessarily expensive treatments and visits to emergency rooms, marketers of these plans offer features like Web sites, nurse help lines and detailed information on generic drugs. 
Many health care analysts say the newness of consumer-driven plans makes it hard to predict their effect on health care costs. "The hope is that people will view that $1,000 account as their own money and be more cost-conscious, but there's no hard data yet to tell you whether that is true or not," said Jon Gabel, vice president for health system studies at the Health Research and Educational Trust in Chicago and one of the leading experts on these plans. Mr. Gabel also wonders "whether employers will save by giving $1,000 to a healthy 25-year-old who up until now never spent anything on health care." 
Other analysts question whether consumer self-interest can significantly curb health care inflation. "In the long run, it's not at all clear that making people sensitive about taking their children to the doctor when they are only a little sick will affect the things that are really driving health care costs, like technology and new treatments," said Gary Claxton, a vice president at Kaiser.
Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a health care advocacy group in Washington, says employees may be hurt. "The concern is that these plans are part of the process of passing on more costs to the shoulder of workers," he said. 
Many agree, though, that cash accounts are an attractive option for people who spend little on health care in a given year. A 1998 study by the Employee Benefits Research Institute found that 50 percent of employees spent less than $600 a year on health care. 
Todd Barre, 35, director of budget and planning and information technology at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, chose a consumer-driven plan last July for himself; his wife, Donna, a 35-year-old preschool teacher; and their three children. The plan's cash account gives them $2,000, but he also has to pay monthly premiums of $293, slightly less than they would be under his old plan. Mr. Barre said he has spent about $1,000 so far and expects to roll over money to the next plan year. 
For employees whose expenditures exceed the cash account, consumer-driven plans may end up being more expensive than other options. For example, at Pharmacia, the pharmaceutical company based in Peapack, N.J., the out-of-pocket cost of having a baby can vary significantly, depending on the plan chosen. The same medical care would cost an employee $160 in the company's H.M.O., $835 in the P.P.O. and $1,300 in the consumer-driven plan, according to Pattie Duca, Pharmacia's executive director of global benefits. 
SOME people in consumer-driven plans may be startled by how much health care can actually cost. Out of 906 employees who enrolled last year in the consumer-driven health plan offered by Charter Communications, a cable television company based in St. Louis, 115 have moved back to the Blue Cross P.P.O. "I don't think some of the people in it were prepared for the research and understood that the full amount of a prescription would be deducted from their account," said Karen Bellm, manager of health and welfare benefits.
The risk of running through an account is one that many enrollees have said they are willing to bear. "Employees like the greater flexibility of these plans," Ms. Duca said. According to Definity Health, Lumenos and Destiny Health, the re-enrollment rate for their plans was at least 95 percent last year.
But Mr. Pollack of Families USA is still wary that the plans could skim off the healthiest employees, leaving the sicker ones in H.M.O.'s and P.P.O.'s, resulting in higher premiums.

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY; 
Belt-Loosening in the Work Force

BYLINE:  By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
DOES work make you fat?
 Some economists are suggesting that the answer is yes. The huge increase in the number of working women, they say, and a concomitant decrease in home-cooked meals, may be leading Americans to eat more fast food, with predictable consequences for waistlines. 
 The economists -- Shin-Yi Chou, Henry Saffer and Michael Grossman -- presented their findings in a working paper called "An Economic Analysis of Obesity" for the National Bureau of Economic Research. In the paper, the economists note that the number of fast-food restaurants per capita doubled in the United States from 1972 to 1997, a period in which obesity, well, ballooned. 
In analyzing the relationship of weight to incomes, food prices, restaurants, workforce participation and other variables, the economists concluded that the growth of fast food accounted for 68 percent of the rise in American obesity. Why all this fast food? 
As women devoted more time to paid work, the theory goes, they had less time for cooking, a burden that the men in their lives (who typically spend more time at their jobs) presumably had little time or interest in assuming. Fast-food restaurants -- offering cheap, convenient meals dense with fat and calories -- rushed in to fill the vacuum. 
If the economists are right, their findings have surprising implications about work and its rewards in the modern economy. Consider first that obesity is expensive; according to a study published in 1998 in Obesity Research, the medical costs alone were $99 billion in 1995. Obesity may well be the nation's biggest public health problem; a study by the RAND Corporation last year said it was more serious than smoking or heavy drinking. "Obesity appears to have a stronger association with the occurrence of chronic medical conditions, reduced physical health-related quality of life and increased health care and medication expenditures than smoking or problem drinking," said Roland Sturm, a RAND economist and author of the study.
Obesity might well be a hidden tax on work -- a regressive one, since it falls disproportionately on lower-income workers, who are more likely to be overweight yet less able to bear its costs. But as Dr. Chou, Dr. Grossman and Dr. Saffer point out, about half of all health care is paid for by federal, state and local governments. Obesity, it would seem, is a problem like air pollution; both are serious side effects of economic development. 
All these medical costs imply that the American workplace is less safe than it seems. Yes, unintentional workplace fatalities have fallen to 4 per 100,000 workers from 37 per 100,000 in 1933, according to the National Safety Council. But if working raises body weight, these numbers do not tell the whole story. Obesity kills just as surely as industrial accidents once did; an analysis published in 1999 in The Journal of the American Medical Association put the number of adult obesity deaths at 280,000 to 325,000 annually.
It's possible that by reducing traditional workplace hazards and making all work less strenuous, Americans have increased the risk from obesity, which is related to a sedentary life. About a year ago, the economists Darius Lakdawalla and Tomas Philipson, in a different paper for the economic research bureau, asserted that less strenuous work and cheaper food -- both products of technology -- are to blame for the rise of obesity in America. 
BOTH papers imply that the epidemic of fat -- three in five Americans are overweight -- is what Edward Tenner, author of "Why Things Bite Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences" (Vintage Books, 1997) might have called a "revenge effect." It is the kind of unintended consequence that often flows from new technologies and social change.
Obesity arising from more (and safer) work is a dispiriting manifestation of this syndrome, but Dr. Chou, Dr. Grossman and Dr. Saffer have come up with an even nastier one: the war on cigarettes, they observe, is making people fatter, too, simply because smoking, however harmful, causes people to eat less.
Harried workers may eventually become wise to hazards of fast food, just as many people have done with tobacco. Perhaps the idea that work contributes to obesity will help defeat stereotypes about overweight people. "An Economic Analysis of Obesity" can be read as strong evidence that they're not lazy. Just busy (at their desks).

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Joseph C. Williams III; 
Commerce Growth Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
INVESTORS' tendency to overreact to news has worsened in the last six months or so, says Joseph C. Williams III, who runs the $180 million Commerce Growth fund.
 "Before, prices of individual stocks might drop 10 to 15 percent on bad news," he said from his office in Kansas City, Mo. "Now they can drop more than 30 percent within minutes, where it used to be days." 
 The extreme volatility gives money managers tremendous opportunity, he added, and throws into sharp focus one aspect of their jobs: to decipher whether a price decline is justified. 
His analysis has put him ahead of most of his peers lately, though the fund has still lost money. It declined 16.5 percent a year, on average, in the three years through Thursday, placing among the top 15 percent of funds that buy large growth stocks. That group lost 22.8 percent a year, on average, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 13.2 percent, annualized, according to Morningstar Inc. The fund has lost 23.1 percent in the last 12 months, versus losses of 25.8 percent for its group and 23.3 percent for the index.
Mr. Williams, 49, is a senior vice president for Commerce Investment Advisors, the fund's adviser and a subsidiary of Commerce Bancshares. The fund's "service shares," or retail shares, carry a 3.5 percent front-end load, or sales charge, but institutional shares are available without a load through mutual fund supermarkets.
To choose the 45 to 55 stocks in the fund, Mr. Williams ranks roughly 550 growth stocks with market capitalizations of at least $500 million, looking for potential price appreciation, earnings growth and attractive valuations.
In gauging a company, his computer model uses about 15 variables, including the quarterly and 12-month projected earnings growth rates, changes in earnings estimates from Wall Street analysts, and a rising stock price compared with others in its industry and the Russell 1000 Growth index.
From the resulting list of companies, he reviews the strongest 20 percent for how they might fit in the portfolio. He compares, for example, the sector weightings of the fund to those of the Russell index.
Mr. Williams sometimes gives individual industries up to six percentage points of extra weight, compared with the index. But these days, the portfolio's sector allocations essentially mirror those of the index. 
"It's very difficult to make big bets until the Iraq situation becomes clearer, which will drive what the economy does," he said.
He also reviews a company's historical price-to-earnings multiple, then checks the PEG ratio -- comparing a company's current P/E multiple to its estimated three-year earnings growth rate. While industries vary, he said, he is finding good companies that sell for one to one and a half times their projected earnings growth rate.
He never meets with companies' management. "When you deal with big companies," he said, "it's hard to find out something from management that's not already known on Wall Street."
Walgreens, the drugstore chain based in Deerfield, Ill., has been a steady long-term grower, Mr. Williams said, though its shares have been expensive, generally trading for 30 to 50 times earnings in the last five years or so. When that multiple dropped to about 27 in January, he began buying. The stock's PEG ratio is about 1.45, based on a three-year earnings growth rate of 16 percent.
He paid $30.91, on average, for the entire position. The shares are now at $28.14. 
Walgreens has had lackluster growth in same-store sales -- those for stores open at least a year -- but still looks good in comparison to its competitors, he said.
MR. WILLIAMS began buying shares of the Symantec Corporation, based in Cupertino, Calif., last May. Symantec, the Internet security technology company that produces Norton antivirus software, should continue growing steadily, he said, adding, "Sept. 11 spurred everyone's interest in security, even among personal computer owners."
He said that he expects the company's earnings growth to average about 19 percent a year over the next three years, versus 13.5 percent for Microsoft. But he said Symantec's shares are much cheaper, trading at a PEG ratio of 1.4 based on three-year earnings, versus 1.7 for Microsoft.
He paid $33.24 for his Symantec shares; they are now at $40.47.
More sophisticated genetic testing techniques should drive the growth of Quest Diagnostics, a provider of lab testing services that is based in Teterboro, N.J., Mr. Williams said. "Its costs are fixed," he said, "so it's a good long-term growth story." 
He said that he expects earnings growth of 26 percent a year in the next three to five years, but that the stock was inexpensive, with a PEG ratio of 0.48, because of investors' concerns that hospitals and doctor's offices will do more in-house testing. But he predicts that Quest will benefit from the aging of the population and from industry consolidation. He paid $61.06 for shares in August 2001; they now trade at $52.76.

Brokers to Bankers: 'No Trespassing'

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT was just a few lines of dense legalese in a 3,000-page-plus spending bill, but the provision was a turning point in a bitter struggle between two of the most powerful business lobbies in the capital -- real estate and banking.
 The relevant words in Section 646 of the Treasury portion of the spending bill said: "None of the funds made available in this act may be used to finalize, implement, administer or enforce (1) the proposed rule relating to the determination that real estate brokerage is an activity that is financial in nature." 
 It meant this: Banks cannot get into the real-estate brokerage business.
In allowing that 11th-hour add-on to a $397 billion spending bill, Republican Congressional leaders handed the nation's real estate brokers an important symbolic victory -- if perhaps a temporary one -- in their concerted push to keep banks at bay.
The story of how this extraneous bit of policy wound up in a long-overdue appropriations measure is a classic example of how Washington works and how well-connected players can have their problems addressed even when the most logical legislative route is cut off. 
The maneuver was the latest episode in a two-year feud that has made rivals out of bankers and brokers who often work together to close property deals. It has also frayed relationships on Capitol Hill and forced lawmakers to choose between dependable deep-pocketed political allies.
"I'm very glad it is over," said Representative Anne M. Northup, Republican of Kentucky, who engineered the provision and earned the deep enmity of the banking industry in the process. "They are very angry."
Angry in part because real estate sales generated $54 billion in commissions last year, according to an estimate by Steve Murray, an editor of Real Trends, an industry newsletter in Littleton, Colo. A move into the real estate brokerage business also would be an efficient way for banks to increase their mortgage lending, as several joint ventures between banks and brokerages have demonstrated.
Because so much is at stake -- and despite Ms. Northup's exclamation -- this battle is almost certainly not over, according to many involved.
Under the spending bill, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve are prohibited through Sept. 30 from moving ahead with a new regulation that would enable nationally chartered banks to offer real estate sales services. The banking lobby says it still intends to seek that power in the future and will fight a pending measure that would permanently bar national banks from the real estate business.
"We feel pretty good about our chances," said Edward L. Yingling, the chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association.
The battle between banks and brokers dates back to the adoption of major changes in financial services law in 1999. At the time, Congress freed banks to engage in new kinds of services like selling insurance and financial securities and opened the door to further expansion into areas judged by Treasury and the Fed to be "financial in nature" or "incidental to a financial activity."
Seizing the moment, the nation's bankers in mid-2000 petitioned under the new law to make the leap into real estate. Later that year, the Clinton administration proposed a rule to allow it.
The National Association of Realtors, sensing a major competitive threat, quickly fought back. It marshaled hundreds of thousands of its 800,000 members across the country to register their objections and reached out to allies on Capitol Hill.
"This issue is all about who is going to control the real estate transaction," said Stephen Cook, a spokesman for the association, explaining why thwarting the banks quickly became the No. 1 legislative priority of the Realtors. 
The brokers argue that the change could lead to a nationwide consolidation in the industry, one that could ultimately cut competition, hurt service and drive up fees to consumers. The bankers say that large realty companies are already deep into mortgage financing and that banks need to be able to compete nationwide when half of the states already allow state-chartered banks to sell property.
A measure barring the banks was introduced and attracted significant support, but it stalled in the House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over banking. Those panels traditionally have strong political ties to the industry. Phil Gramm, then chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and an author of the measure that cleared the way for such expansions, was dead set against the restriction, one banking lobbyist said.
But there was still the Appropriations Committee, where Ms. Northup served on the subcommittee that allocates money for the Treasury Department. The holder of a bachelor's degree in economics, she was not happy about the bankers' push for new real estate business. At the time the financial services overhaul was passed in 1999, she said, no one was talking about such a big change.
But as one of the few incumbent House members in a highly competitive district, she was not eager to alienate a dependable ally and potential source of campaign financing. "When you win every election with 50 percent of the vote, you are not dying to pick a fight with anybody," she said.
Yet she said she was convinced that allowing banks to get into real estate was a bad idea. "Financial services and commercial services should stay separate," she said, contending that there are inherent conflicts in both selling property and financing the sale.
With backing from the Realtors as well as a coalition that included consumer advocates and small businesses, Ms. Northup persuaded the Appropriations Committee last July to adopt her moratorium as part of the Treasury spending bill.
The political repercussions for Ms. Northup were almost immediate. A state bankers group sponsored a fund-raiser for her Democratic opponent and blistered her in newsletters. But real estate interests donated almost $100,000 to her re-election campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and she won.
THE moratorium proposal, along with almost all spending legislation other than for the military, stalled amid partisan battles in Congress. But after the Congressional elections last year -- a last chance for Realtors and bankers to donate money to sympathetic candidates -- Republicans widened their lead in the House and regained control of the Senate.
Congress was still unable to pass a spending bill last year, but in January Republican leaders met behind closed doors to put together a final spending package.
Michael G. Oxley, Republican of Ohio and chairman of the Financial Services Committee, was adamantly opposed to the Realtors' provision, and Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas and the majority leader, was inclined to resist it, a House aide said.
But in the Senate, Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, had just succeeded Mr. Gramm as chairman of the Banking Committee, and he wanted the provision in. He was an ally of the real estate groups in this fight and spoke at the association's meeting in New Orleans last November. More important, he was also a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, giving him a prime seat at the conference table in deciding what appeared in the final bill.
"If banks get into real estate, they might as well sell jewelry next and cars and batteries and clothes," said Mr. Shelby, who said he was also worried that banks might have to be bailed out if their real estate operations faltered. "Some of this could visit the taxpayer again."
As the final spending measure came together in mid-February, the fight between the bankers and Realtors was among the last to be decided. The leadership finally chose to include the provision as a concession to Realtors, calculating that the bankers would not be too irked because the moratorium would last only seven months. "It kind of puts it off for a while, but I don't think it has any practical effect," said one Republican aide in the House.
The Realtors celebrated nonetheless, saying Congressional approval of the temporary ban should be interpreted as a sign that lawmakers don't want banks in the real estate business.
"There is now a clear Congressional vote on this issue," said Mr. Cook, the spokesman for the brokers. "We are very encouraged." A new measure establishing a permanent ban on the banks is already drawing support, including Mr. Shelby's.
The bankers found reason for optimism as well. They believe that House Banking Committee members are now so angry over the back-door effort by the Realtors to use the appropriations process that they will be sympathetic.
"It is going to be a very, very hard fight," said Mr. Yingling, the bankers' lobbyist. "But assuming the moratorium at some point comes off, the reality is that the Realtors still have to get a bill through Congress. Passing a bill is much, much harder than defending a bill."

HEADLINE: China: Partner, Rival or Both? 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
TO hear the alarmists tell it, the emergence of China as an economic superstar is bad news that is only growing worse. Their familiar cries -- China has an unlimited supply of cheap labor that threatens American workers, China stacks the deck against foreign companies that invest there, China will destroy American manufacturing -- were recently reinforced with a new one: last year, for the first time, China probably bested the United States as the world's top choice for foreign investment.
 China's economic firepower is real, and growing fast. It will inevitably affect the American economy. There is some truth in the alarmists' warnings, but they hardly tell the whole story. 
 China's influence takes many forms that are subtler than the loss of low-wage manufacturing jobs in theUnited States or the opening of a huge new consumer market in China. The costs and benefits of the trans-Pacific relationship are much more complex than simple gains and losses from trade. They extend to the bedrock of the American economy, including the productivity of the labor force and the stability of financial markets. 
"Our fates are becoming inextricably linked," said Paul A. Laudicina, vice president and managing director of the global business policy council at A. T. Kearney, a consulting firm. "China is as important to the U.S. as the U.S. is to China."
Recent figures on trade and investment can overshadow other important trends. Since 1997, the United States trade deficit in goods with China has doubled to more than $95 billion. The trade surplus with China in services, which make up more than half of the American economy, increased by more than 50 percent, but just to $2.2 billion in 2001.
The estimated totals for direct foreign investment are a trifle misleading. The American figure declined mainly because of a drop in mergers and acquisitions involving foreign companies, which have accounted for 90 percent of investment flows in recent years.
Even when these figures are interpreted correctly, however, they are only excerpts from a story with much wider consequences. China's growth has been reinforcing one of the most prominent trends in America's recent economic history: its transition from a manufacturing to a service economy. In the last two years alone, the economy has shed two million manufacturing jobs. Now, only about 16 million Americans work in manufacturing, the same as in the early 1950's. Since then, though, the number of Americans in service professions has risen to 107 million from about 30 million.
China is "accelerating the structural change" taking place in the United States, said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist of the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI. "We're moving the high-labor-cost jobs, the low-technology jobs and the low-capital-intensive jobs abroad."
The manufacturing sector was doomed to shrink, he said, because its productivity has grown faster than the overall economy. But the acceleration of the process has come at a bad time for many workers.
"What makes it so painful is that it's occurring in a period where the U.S. economy is weak," Mr. Meckstroth said. "This recovery is abysmally slow, particularly in the manufacturing sector." Because China maintains a fixed exchange rate with the dollar, he added, that economic weakness does not help American companies pump up their exports.
SOME types of manufacturing have already deserted the United States entirely. For Mattel, the toy maker, all production is now done overseas, said Thomas A. Debrowski, its executive vice president for operations. His options for production include China and other developing countries, not the United States, he said.
Robert C. Feenstra, an economics professor at the University of California at Davis, defended Mattel's model. "Some people would object to having U.S. firms locate abroad and leave us," he said. "I, on the contrary, would say, 'That's what they've got to do to stay competitive.' " Profits garnered as a result of foreign activities, he noted, still flow back to American investors.
American manufacturing may feel China's influence doubly, Professor Feenstra added, because its labor force could enhance the manufacturing power of more advanced economies on the Pacific Rim. "We're going to be competing with these other countries -- Japan, Taiwan, Korea -- who are using China as a source of cheap labor," he said. He added that any labor-cost advantage that American companies might have reaped through Nafta, by moving operations to Mexico or Canada, might therefore be neutralized.
There is little doubt that Asian nations are taking advantage of China's production base. In Korea, more than half of companies responding to a recent survey by the Federation of Small and Medium Business said they planned to invest in China in the next five years.
Mattel has been producing miniature cars in China for years. But it makes jungle gyms and tricycles in Mexico, because freight makes up a bigger share of the cost for such "large cube" items.
"If you take a look at some of our competition, they're using very much the same model that we are," Mr. Debrowski said. "They have to. If you want to be competitive with large-cube product, and you want to source it in China, you're going to go bankrupt pretty quick." In Mexico, he said, "our competitors are right across the street from us."
The same pattern holds in other industries, like consumer electronics. Sony, Samsung, Philips and Thomson (which makes RCA products) are all based in different countries, and they all assemble televisions in Mexico.
Despite China's influence and the general trend, manufacturing still has a future, if a smaller one, in the United States.
"There are some advantages to being in this country," said Roger W. Chastain, the chief executive of Mount Vernon Mills, a textile maker in Greenville, S.C. Big clients like Wal-Mart, he said, often need to restock their inventories on a few days' notice, with many different products packed in the same container. "There's always going to be some need" for manufacturing in the United States, "so you can have the quick turns; it can't come from China," Mr. Chastain said. 
Though most sewing of garments is done overseas, he explained, the fact that Mount Vernon makes the raw textiles in the United States gives it an edge in filling just-in-time orders. Eventually, he said, "the only difference may become transportation costs, more so than labor."
New labor markets have started to become a consideration for American service businesses, though, even as manufacturers take them for granted. Some white-collar jobs that would traditionally have resided in the United States are moving to China. Five years ago, both Intel and Microsoft announced the opening of major research centers there. In 1999, Motorola decided to make Beijing its global center for research and development, with a target work force of 5,000 within five years. Motorola also has large manufacturing plants in Tianjin and Hangzhou.
Motorola and Mattel, like many other American companies, are looking to China's consumer market, as well as its production base, as potential help for the bottom line. China's entry into the World Trade Organization 14 months ago coincided with the economic downturn in the United States, causing even the biggest companies to look abroad for profits.
"The U.S. auto manufacturers had a fantastic year in China, and a relatively lackluster year elsewhere in terms of profitability," Mr. Laudicina of A. T. Kearney said.
Motorola sees China as a profit leader. "China remains a critical part of our global sales and sourcing operations," said Jennifer Weyrauch, a spokeswoman for Motorola. "As of 2001, China was 13 percent of Motorola's overall sales."
China has not yet provided a vast market for every American product. Last fall, Sigma-Aldrich, a conglomerate based in St. Louis that sells small batches of complex chemicals, opened a four-employee sales office in Shanghai. Nonetheless, said Michael R. Hogan, the company's chief financial officer and chief administrative officer, "it would be quite a while before we'd be setting up a manufacturing facility in China."
"We tend to serve research markets for pharmaceutical and biotech companies," he said. "China does not have that kind of infrastructure, even among their academic institutions." As China becomes wealthier, Mr. Hogan predicted, its demand for research materials will increase.
Profits can also come from China's cheaper raw materials -- something that Sigma-Aldrich might soon consider. "Historically, people did not source from China because the prices were dirt cheap but their quality was not certain," Mr. Hogan said. Now, however, "their quality is getting better, and their pricing is certainly a lot lower than in other places we could source."
At the extreme, in terms of China-based profits, are American companies that would not exist without the Chinese market. Chindex, of Bethesda, Md., has been selling top-of-the-line medical equipment to China since 1981. "Particularly in the urban markets, on the east coast of China, there are many, many well-off Chinese who can afford these types of products," said Lawrence Pemble, Chindex's executive vice president for finance and business development. "The hospital system has been able to afford high-end Western technologies for many years now."
Chindex opened a hospital in Beijing in 1997 and plans to open one in Shanghai this year. The company employs about 50 Americans and 450 Chinese. "What we're proving now is that there's a market for very sophisticated high-end health care services in China as well," Mr. Pemble said.
CHINA has added another source of profitability to American companies by acting as a spur for productivity improvements. Besides proximity to customers and the ability to manufacture advanced technology, productivity has become American manufacturing's main advantage in its fight for survival.
The focus on productivity has led to another benefit, said Mr. Meckstroth, the economist, as cheap imports have forced American companies to pass along some of the savings to consumers. "We're actually seeing deflation in the manufacturing sector," he said, "as opposed to inflation elsewhere."
Not everyone agrees, though, on the benefits to Americans. "I don't think very much of it is passed on to the consumer," Mr. Chastain said. He warned that companies might use low labor costs in China to subsidize higher costs elsewhere, with little change in the price of their products.
If the true impact on prices is hard to quantify, the Chinese economy's most important positive effects on the United States may be even harder to gauge. China's fast growth helped Southeast Asia recover from its financial crises in the late 1990's, muting the ill effects on the United States, Mr. Laudicina said. In addition, China's intensified economic links to the rest of the world reduce strategic worries. "The U.S. is going to have increasing leverage over China because of our economic relationship, and vice versa," he said.
Yet the most impressive benefits and costs, contrary to the cries of China's boosters and alarmists alike, could still be a long way off.
First, China's membership in the World Trade Organization might not make it as friendly a business environment as, say, Canada. "At least as far into the future as I can see, China will not become a routine place for business," Mr. Pemble said.
Second, China is pushing foreigners to invest inland, Mr. Laudicina said, ratherthan on its wealthy eastern coastline. Though investors could continue to find low wages there, the workers might lack the skills needed to expand China's export offerings.
And third, even with fast economic growth (which Professor Feenstra says may be overstated by the government's statistics), broad economic changes take time. 
"There's long-term potential, but China remains a very poor country with relatively low human capital," said Robert E. Lipsey, an emeritus professor at the City University of New York and an expert in foreign investment. "Ten years from now, it will still be a very poor country. It will be better off -- they've been growing rapidly -- but dominate the United States? That's hysteria."

HEADLINE: No Worry, Even Now, At MorganStanley 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN and LANDON THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
STRETCHING back in a swivel chair in a conference room high above Times Square, Philip J. Purcell appears not at all frazzled by all the financial, legal and regulatory troubles that are plaguing Morgan Stanley, the giant securities firm he runs, and the rest of Wall Street.
 Though clearly annoyed by the regulators and plaintiffs' lawyers who are pecking at Morgan Stanley and soiling its once-sterling reputation, Mr. Purcell simply says, "It has been a very, very bad two and a half years." 
 Indeed, in an interview at the firm's Manhattan headquarters on Wednesday, Mr. Purcell spoke optimistically about Morgan Stanley's prospects -- a view not supported by the firm's lagging stock price. Most industry analysts are bleak about the investment banking and brokerage businesses and the legal liabilities of Wall Street's big firms -- especially Morgan Stanley. 
Mr. Purcell, who has been chairman and chief executive of Morgan Stanley since 1997, shrugged off questions about a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the firm's handling of public offerings of sought-after technology stocks during the market boom. He said Morgan Stanley had not yet received official notification from the commission that it intends to bring charges against the firm, although the firm's lawyers expect one.
The investigation centers on whether Morgan Stanley prearranged sales of new stocks at prices higher than the offering price before they started trading. Any such charge would imply that one of the standard-bearers of Wall Street had willfully manipulated the market for stocks. (The S.E.C. has already notified two other big firms, the Goldman Sachs Group and J. P. Morgan Chase, that they might face charges from the same investigation, people inside those firms said.)
Mr. Purcell said that Morgan Stanley had done nothing wrong and that it had used "sound practice" to measure demand for stock in companies it took public, a process known on Wall Street as building a book of orders.
"Everything I know about our practices tells me that they were in the best interests of the issuer and the buyer," he said, dismissing the latest assault on Morgan Stanley's character. 
Still, the investigation has only added to the pressures on Mr. Purcell, for whom almost everything seemed to go right during the first 32 years of his career. Lately, his fortunes have reversed.
For the last nine quarters, Morgan Stanley has reported earnings that were below those of the period a year earlier. Its stock price has dropped 66.5 percent from its peak in September 2000, a steeper decline than those of its competitors. In the most lucrative financing businesses, its standing slipped last year, and competitors say Morgan Stanley is less formidable than it once was.
In fact, the firm's participation in the few corporate financing and merger deals that have taken place has slid so much that some senior investment bankers at Morgan Stanley expect the firm, which eliminated 2,200 jobs in the fourth quarter, to start another round of layoffs soon. 
Meanwhile, the legal proceedings section of the firm's recently published 2002 annual report takes up more than five pages. Much of that discussion involves various investigations and lawsuits involving the firm's sales of dozens of new Internet stocks in the late 1990's.
Many of those companies have struggled despite strong support from Morgan Stanley, which often benefited directly from the issues. The firm's own venture capital funds already owned stakes in some companies it took public, including Homestore.com and Transmeta; they sold their shares for substantial profit.
Mr. Purcell, though, asserted that things were getting better, not worse. He said that the firm had been unfairly lumped in with competitors whose standards fell short of its own. He displays little interest in how things have traditionally been done on Wall Street or how others think he should run his firm.
"There is obviously no nostalgia for the old partnership model," said Roy C. Smith, a professor at New York University's business school who was a partner at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley's No. 1 rival. "I've been impressed that Morgan Stanley has become this cold-eyed publicly owned corporation now."
MR. PURCELL remains something of an enigma on Wall Street. Though his office has been in New York for more than 20 years -- he worked high up in the World Trade Center when he ran Dean Witter from 1982 to 1997 -- his family home has long been in Wilmette, Ill., north of Chicago. Most weeks, he flies home for the weekend, sometimes leaving on Thursday night and working on Fridays from the offices of Morgan Stanley's Discover credit card unit in Riverwoods, Ill.
Unlike most Wall Street bosses, Mr. Purcell never was a trader, broker or investment banker. He had been a partner in the McKinsey & Company consulting firm in Chicago when Sears, Roebuck hired him to run Dean Witter, then a subsidiary of Sears. Some Morgan Stanley traders complain that they can't recall seeing him on any of the firm's trading floors, in contrast to John J. Mack, the former president of Morgan Stanley, who had been a bond salesman at the firm.
"Phil is different," said James F. Higgins, who ran the Dean Witter brokerage operation under Mr. Purcell before retiring last year. "He didn't claw his way up the Wall Street ladder."
Investment bankers at the firm say Mr. Purcell has kept his distance from them as well, contributing to their sense that they no longer command the traditional respect from Morgan Stanley's management. A result, these employees say, has been a drop in morale among the firm's bankers and traders.
Many of these complaints have dogged Mr. Purcell for years, of course, as has speculation that he would engineer a merger as big, or bigger, than the one that forged Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter in 1997. Since 1993, Mr. Purcell has maintained an internal strategic planning staff composed of analysts and former bankers that analyzes possible acquisition targets or merger partners. The team has studied American Express, Bank One and the American International Group, among others.
"He is always trying to figure out the next step," said Thomas C. Schneider, a former senior Morgan Stanley executive. "But he will only make a change if it makes strategic economic sense."
If Mr. Purcell feels pressure from his board to save his job, he does not show it. (Last month, he even spent a few days playing golf in the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am tournament.) But some critics say he seems so secure because Morgan Stanley's board has become too cozy.
A former managing director of the firm said Mr. Purcell once told him, "the most important thing I have to do is to keep my board happy."
The board is chock full of current and former chief executives, some with long ties to Mr. Purcell. C. Robert Kidder, the chairman of Borden Chemical, and Miles L. Marsh, who once ran the Fort James Corporation, were, like Mr. Purcell, consultants at McKinsey in the 1970's.
Then there is the Sears connection: Edward A. Brennan, the former chairman and chief executive of Sears, is Mr. Purcell's former boss and tapped him in the early 1980's to run Dean Witter. Charles F. Knight is the chairman and former chief of Emerson Electric, which has been a supplier for Sears.
One example of Mr. Purcell's courting of his board involved the corporate jet: several former Morgan Stanley executives said that he has allowed directors to use it for personal purposes as long as they pay what the same trip would have cost in first class on a commercial airline. It is unclear whether directors took him up on the offer.
Morgan Stanley denies that there was any such offer and says that since 2001 it has had a policy limiting director use of the plane to travel to board meetings and emergencies. In any case, Mr. Purcell countered that several directors would not hesitate to challenge him in the boardroom.
MORGAN STANLEY is one of 12 securities firms that have agreed to pay a total of $1.4 billion to end investigations by federal and state regulators into conflicts of interest among analysts. It agreed to pay a $50 million fine, as did six other big firms. But in some sense it has been less tainted.
While regulators plan to use the word fraud to describe the investment advice published by some firms, including Citigroup, Credit Suisse First Boston and Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley will face lesser charges, people involved in the settlement talks said.
"There's not a shred of evidence," Mr. Purcell said, that Morgan Stanley analysts privately disparaged companies they were recommending to investors. Some competitors said that is because Morgan Stanley apparently destroyed the evidence. E-mail messages written by analysts and their co-workers have served as the smoking guns used by Eliot Spitzer, the New York State attorney general, and other regulators to incriminate firms. But when investigators tried to gather up Morgan Stanley e-mail messages, they found that it had erased many of the messages it was required to preserve.
Morgan Stanley paid a fine of $1.65 million for failing to keep those records, and Mr. Purcell dismisses that admitted violation as a technicality. He said the suggestion that the firm selectively deleted e-mail messages or impeded the investigation was "totally false."
The investigation went beyond reading e-mail messages. Investigators deposed Mary Meeker, Morgan Stanley's influential technology analyst who shepherded dozens of Internet companies to market, but so far Ms. Meeker remains the one survivor among the superstars of the technology boom on Wall Street.
Henry Blodget, Ms. Meeker's counterpart at Merrill Lynch, resigned in late 2001, a few months before Mr. Spitzer released e-mail messages that Mr. Blodget had written disparaging companies whose stocks he was recommending. Jack B. Grubman, the senior telecommunications analyst at the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup, resigned last summer amid an investigation into whether he raised his rating on AT&T's stock to appease Sanford I. Weill, Citigroup's chairman and chief executive. And Frank P. Quattrone, an investment banker who built Credit Suisse First Boston into a leading underwriter of technology companies, was suspended last month after First Boston discovered an e-mail message in which he encouraged employees to throw out documents while the firm was under investigation. All three firms paid higher fines than Morgan Stanley.
Mr. Purcell's pronouncements about reform contrast with those of some peers. Since last fall, Mr. Weill has fashioned himself as a champion of good corporate governance, resigning as a director of two companies whose chairmen serve on his board and declining a bonus for last year. The chairman and the chief executive of Merrill Lynch have apologized in public for the behavior of some of the firm's analysts.
Mr. Purcell has issued no mea culpas. He has been the most vocal among his peers in opposing some of the reforms proposed or put into effect by regulators and lawmakers.
Morgan Stanley agreed to make the same changes that are being imposed on other firms to insulate analysts from the influence of investment bankers. But Mr. Purcell said no other changes were needed in the firm's investment banking practices. Mr. Purcell does, however, cast himself as a longtime proponent of strong corporate governance, praising some changes that have been mandated. He said it was helpful to have the corporate code of ethics and the charters for his board's committees spelled out for shareholders on the company's Web site. But he said Morgan Stanley already had a tougher code of conduct and a stricter definition of independence for its directors than is now required.
As an example, he cited the rule that independent directors cannot be related to company executives. Morgan Stanley bans directors' family members from working at the firm in any capacity, he said. So, two of his seven sons work at competing firms.
If Morgan Stanley has fared so much better in the investigations and avoided entanglements with troubled companies like Enron and WorldCom, it is curious that its stock has performed as poorly as Merrill's over the last year and so much worse than other competitors.
ANALYSTS said that much of the answer lies in Morgan Stanley's unprofitable brokerage operation. As individual investors have withdrawn from the stock market, analysts said, big investors have abandoned stocks like Morgan Stanley, Merrill and Charles Schwab, which depend on trading activity.
There is also, of course, the persistent fear of big legal judgments against Morgan Stanley from the raft of lawsuits investors have filed over stocks the firm underwrote and recommended during the boom. Ms. Meeker and the firm's investment bankers were among the biggest backers of dot-com stocks, financing them with investors' money and sometimes with their own.
Filings by one of the firm's venture capital funds, Morgan Stanley Venture Partners III, show that in June 2000 it sold shares of Homestore that it had acquired before the company went public less than a year earlier. The fund, about 10 percent of which was owned by Morgan Stanley employees, gained about $7 million, a firm spokesman said. Morgan Stanley had underwritten two stock offerings by Homestore, one for $110 a share. It now trades at 76 cents. 
Another private investment fund, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Equity Funding, made about $5 million in May 2001 from selling shares of Transmeta it had acquired in a private placement. Morgan Stanley had taken the company public in November 2000 at $21 a share. The stock now trades at $1.32. A spokesman for the firm said that no employees invested in that fund. He said that neither Morgan Stanley nor its employees could have benefited immediately from the public offerings of those stocks because they were not allowed to sell their shares for the first six months.
Mr. Purcell remains unfazed, despite the investigations, all the pending lawsuits and the poor prospects for a rebound in Morgan Stanley's main businesses. He flatly rejected the notion that he might make an early exit. Leaning back and grinning, he said investors should expect him to be around until he turns 65, which won't happen until 2008.

 CORRECTION:
A chart on March 2 with an article about the business outlook for Morgan Stanley carried an incorrect scale for revenue in the firm's four divisions. The figures were understated by a factor of 10; for example, revenue from investment banking and trading in 2002 was about $20 billion, not $2 billion.

Earnings News Hurts a Nervous Market

BYLINE:  By JEFF SOMMER 

 BODY:
Unimpressive earnings forecasts and worries about a possible war with Iraq drove down the main market averages last week, despite a strong economic report on Friday.
 Symantec, which makes anti-virus computer software, fell 15 percent for the week, one of the biggest losses on Nasdaq, after the company's earnings forecast disappointed analysts. 
Hewlett-Packard fell 13 percent for the week, the biggest fall in the Dow Jones industrials. It missed its quarterly revenue target and said many companies were reluctant to buy equipment because of the war outlook. 
 A Commerce Department report that gross domestic product grew at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, double the rate reported a month earlier, briefly buoyed the markets.
 For the week, the Dow fell 127.03 points, to close at 7,891.08, a loss of 1.6 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.02 points, to 841.15, a decline of 0.8 percent. The Nasdaq composite index fell 11.50 points to 1,337.52, down 0.9 percent. 
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note ended the week yielding 3.69 percent, down from 3.89 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

You Need Outerwear to Go 'Over There'

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WILSON

 BODY:
CONSIDER the word embedded: It calls to mind a piece of jewelry you can't afford, or an embarrassing, unpleasant medical procedure you're not even sure your health plan covers. 
 It's the verb of the moment in New York news media circles. As the conflict unfolds in the Persian Gulf, the Pentagon, for the first time since World War II, is allowing reporters and photographers to travel with troops. In the event of a war, they will be able to report from closer to the action. The journalists are "embedded" with, say, a Marine Expeditionary Unit, eating their food, sleeping where they sleep, swapping stories around the ol' tent, winning cigarettes at poker games. ("Boys, you call that a battle, you should have seen this legislative budget subcommittee hearing I covered, back in oh, hell, you jarheads were still garroting teddy bears.") 
 The assignments went out a couple weeks ago. And New York reporters, whose idea of roughing it is a bodega beer run in the snow, found themselves downloading, straight-faced, bizarre shopping lists of wildly exotic-sounding gear ("excavation tool," "polypropylene bottoms," "water purification tablets," "laundry detergent"), then hitting the streets with corporate credit cards and setting in motion a minor economic boom. 
The first stop on the road to a free Iraq is Paragon, a sprawling sporting goods and camping store in Union Square. Specifically, the outerwear section, a harrowing chamber for any city slicker. All that Gore-Tex, all those zippers and snaps and (shudder) hoods. 
Where to begin? You need something like desert camouflage, so you don't get picked off by a sniper, but not exactly desert camouflage, because this war, if it starts, will be over someday, and you'll come home, and you don't want to look like you know, that guy.
Dennis sells outerwear. Dennis understands. He suggests gray and tan marmot, whatever that is, waterproof, breathable, pockets all over the thing for secret parchment maps and throwing stars and smokes. On sale, even. Bing.
Next stop: a little turn-your-head-and-cough duty. Step on a rusty nail, and they'll be using that excavation tool for you, bub. Shots for tetanus, yellow fever, typhoid fever, the whole hypodermic platter, seven or eight shots in all.
It's funny. When the nurses wish you luck, you swear you can hear bugles sounding. Then you go to the bar, and your pals are talking about St. Patrick's Day, until they notice you and change the subject. Your studio is a wreck, all that stuff. Here's something that looks like an apron with a built-in cutting board: Turns out the bulletproof vest comes with a groin attachment. You've covered stories in some of the toughest neighborhoods in New York, but now, suddenly, everybody's worried about your groin. 
One more stop: Tent and Trails sort of sneaks up on you in Lower Manhattan, a narrow cavern of bungee cords and insect repellent and weird liquid soap you can use on your dishes, face, hair and teeth. 
Jamie Abish owns the store. She has been outfitting embedded reporters all week. When one asked about the availability of a field mirror, she frowned and said, "Have you told your mother you're doing this?" MICHAEL WILSON

HEADLINE: Riding the Bounding Rails 

BYLINE:  By WENDELL JAMIESON

 BODY:
HERE'S this little railroad on the Brooklyn waterfront with 1.5 miles of track, one locomotive and a three-man crew -- the engineer, the conductor and the brakeman. Trains like speed, but this one never goes faster than five miles an hour, on rails that run through Sunset Park, beneath the arched footbridges of the Brooklyn Army Terminal, and alongside and through old warehouses.
 The engineer is Charlie McClellend, 60, who has been doing this for 31 years. It shows: he can move a mammoth battleship-gray diesel-electric locomotive by the inch, backward and forward, gently easing his brake and throttle levers, as if he were manipulating a child's Lionel. The conductor is Jimmy Lada, 35. The brakeman is Jose Torres, 30, who grew up with Mr. Lada on 12th Street and Seventh Avenue in Park Slope, which is how he got the job. 
 The three represent the Brooklyn crew of the New York Cross Harbor Railroad, which provides direct rail service from the borough to the mainland of the United States, in this case, a particularly hellish stretch of the Jersey City waterfront. After the three men nudge their cars onto a float -- a barge with tracks on it -- it is pulled by tugboat for three miles, to a dusty plot of shoreline next to rusting mountains of scrap metal. There, another locomotive and crew take over, hitching the cars to trains that shoot across North America. 
 The railroad brings train cars carrying rice and lead pipes to customers in Sunset Park, and it floats cars filled with wood and cocoa -- which comes to Brooklyn from the Ivory Coast of Africa -- to Jersey City. The cocoa goes to Hershey, Pa., and comes back to Brooklyn as Hershey's Kisses.
 This is one of only two active shortline railroads in New York City; the other, the New York & Atlantic, has nearly 300 miles of track and mostly serves Long Island. The Cross Harbor is also one of the country's smallest. It is the only railroad that runs on New York's streets, and one of only a handful that still float rail cars.
 And it shouldn't even be alive.
 Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show years of losses. A publicly held company, it has stock that trades for pennies. The city will not give it more than a month-to-month lease at its base in the Bush Terminal, which is a spectacular dump, and is even trying to evict it.
 "We're not the little railroad that could," said Wayne Eastman, the company's president, sitting in his trailer office in Jersey City, the Statue of Liberty toylike in the distance. "We're the little railroad that wants to."
 But this little railroad keeps on rolling. Two years ago, a new management team took over; last year, roughly 3,200 rail cars crossed the harbor. That means roughly 25,000 trucks did not travel through Manhattan or Staten Island -- a little relief in a traffic-choked city.
 The economics do not matter much to Mr. McClellend and the rest of the crew, except when business is so good they make two round trips a day instead of one and get a bigger paycheck. They are more worried about tides, white caps, fog, wind, rain, freezing temperatures, freighters, sailboats, dock masters, broken or missing rails or rail cars, traffic, double-parked cars, faulty switches, bad drivers and stuff getting stolen.

Watching these men work on a frigid morning is like watching a choreographed ballet of wheels, rails and switches. At 8 a.m., it was 23 degrees outside Bush Terminal, but felt 20 degrees colder. The harbor was framed square by the terminal's red brick buildings, and the waves, every fourth or fifth one a whitecap, were blue-green and sharp, as if edged with Spackle.
 In the silent locker room, the three men pulled on their tan work clothes, yellow reflector belts and work boots. There were hints that not long ago this was a much bigger operation: dozens of lockers stood empty; vacant crew rooms were filled with computer parts, broken furniture, depth charts and maps. 
 Downstairs, three light blue locomotives with paintings of puffing tugboats and engines on their cabs sat in a dark machine shop. The engines are from the late 1940's and are no longer used. Two others sit forlornly in the yard outside the terminal, along with an old caboose. The one active locomotive is newer, from 1958, and leased.
 A few years back, the Cross Harbor owned and maintained not only its own locomotives but also its own tugboats. Now the tugboat work is contracted out.
 Mr. McClellend remembers 30 or 40 men working, filling the crew rooms, even making night runs, so many men that there were not always enough lockers to go around. Now it is just the three of them. When they leave to start the day's runs, they lock the door.
 He climbed into the locomotive and got the engine going while Mr. Torres rolled up the metal grating door. The three of them must have been wearing long underwear, and several other layers, because they were puffed up like balloons. "There's just nothing you can do about this, especially out here," Mr. Torres said of the cold, stamping his feet. "No matter how much you put on, it just goes right through you."
 Mr. Torres has been doing this for several years, but this will be his last. He has been studying computers at the Katharine Gibbs School. Computers are appealing: they are indoors. Here at the yard, it is not only brutally cold in winter but so hot in summer you can see the heat rising off the rails.

Rendezvous With the Rice Guy
 Mr. McClellend brought the locomotive about 50 feet, past the first switch. Mr. Torres threw an iron lever, and when the locomotive backed up, it went off on a tangent, on a different set of rails. Mr. Torres and Mr. Lada walked up ahead as they crossed 43rd Street and then 42nd Street. On 42nd Street, a man in an idling Cadillac was reading a newspaper, unaware that he was parked atop active railroad tracks. Then he saw the locomotive, with its four glowering headlights, and he was gone.
 The first stop: Interdynamics Incorporated, where an empty tank car that once held air-conditioning gas awaited. Mr. Lada gave second-by-second guidance from the ground on a radio hooked to his shoulder. The locomotive kissed the tank car with a bump. They were coupled, and Mr. McClellend backed them out.
 It is strange to see train tracks running into buildings, which look more like dead ends than destinations. The Cross Harbor tracks, which are also leased from the city, were cobbled together in 1984 from those belonging to two dying dock railroads. They run along First Avenue, and spread out into several warehouses. They go east on 41st Street to Second Avenue and then turn north again, literally cutting through the corner of one warehouse.
 There are other tracks like that around the city. In Dumbo in Brooklyn, old rusty rails show through the asphalt and cobblestones, and lead improbably into long-closed steel doors of converted warehouses. Same thing with the High Line in Chelsea, the only difference being that the High Line is above ground and people are arguing ferociously about its future. What sets the Sunset Park tracks apart is that they are shiny, which means that sometimes a train runs on them.
 Once every few weeks, the locomotive makes its farthest journey north, to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority yards on 39th Street, where it delivers rails and ties for the subway system. Other days, it pushes a box car of uncooked rice to East Peak Trading, whom Mr. Lada calls "the rice guy." Each carload will become part of untold thousands of Chinese dinners served to untold thousands of New Yorkers.
 After the coupling, Mr. McClellend brought the one-locomotive, one-car train back to the yard and hitched it to one that was filled; you could tell because the springs near the wheels were compressed. He pulled it back to Interdynamics, where it would be put into untold thousands of canisters to cool untold thousands of Brooklynites in their cars next summer.
 Throughout the Interdynamics excursion, the float bobbed at the foot of 51st Street. Then the main event began. Ten cars waited at Bush Terminal, brought there the previous day from the 65th Street yard of the New York & Atlantic, Cross Harbor's biggest customer in Brooklyn. Roughly a quarter of the New York & Atlantic's cars, about 150 a month, come from Jersey City via the harbor. Otherwise, rail cars coming from, say, Pennsylvania, would have to travel several hundred miles out of their way to cross the Hudson near Albany.
 This day there were three empty boxcars and seven low-slung, graffiti-covered gondolas filled with scrap metal. The locomotive got behind all 10 and pushed them onto the float, a few at a time. Mr. Torres ran around, putting blocks under the wheels.
 Then the red tugboat, the 200-ton Brian McAllister, arrived. The captain, Kenneth Hawrey, worked out of the upper pilot house so he could see over the boxcars. He backed out, gunning the engine. Everything vibrated. He started a turn to the right, then pulled off a particularly elegant maneuver: cutting the power, he let the momentum he had already created turn the float, silently, 180 degrees, until he was pointing at Jersey City.
 The view from the pilot house was surreal: a train was crossing the harbor. Captain Hawrey turned the float southwest, to deeper water, then headed northwest. In 45 minutes, he was easing the float into a gantry in Jersey City.
 Unlike the facility in Brooklyn, where the loading platform floated and bobbed up and down with the tide, Jersey City's is an oily, clanging, monstrous thing, with winches and chains that raise or lower the track bed. It was built around 1931 and is actually owned by Cross Harbor. A half-second after the front of the float touched land, the windows in the wheelhouse rattled.

Lousy Day for a Locomotive
 That was a good day; they are not all like that.
 On another cold morning, this one misty and drenched in rain, the locomotive set off from Bush Terminal down First Avenue like a ghostly apparition to collect 14 New York & Atlantic cars. Mr. Lada and Mr. Torres were soaked. After a few blocks, Mr. Lada radioed Mr. McClellend to stop. Down in the street, a switch point -- the moving section of rail in a switch -- had been dislodged, probably by the trucks pounding in and out of the Army Terminal during the night.
 Mr. Lada called the railroad's vice president, Howard Samelson, and Mr. Samelson started driving from the office in Jersey City. A railroad man with 30 years' experience, he joined Cross Harbor eight months ago. His wife calls it that "silly little railroad."
 Mr. Samelson has a beard and wears a hat like Indiana Jones. He may be the only person living in Manhattan who actually needs a Land Rover: It bounced and sloshed across the moonscape of the Bush Terminal yard, which was so flooded that many tracks were underwater. When he pulled up to the idling locomotive, he crouched down before assuring Mr. Lada that the train would not derail; the other track, the one that was still there, would hold it in place.
 As the crew continued on to 65th Street, Mr. Samelson found the missing piece of track by the side of First Avenue and got a forklift operator to drop it into the flooded opening in the roadbed with an iron-on-iron bang. The railroad vice president was showered with dirty street water.
 When the locomotive got to 65th Street, 32 cars were waiting, not 14. One, a tank car, was full, which means it was probably not supposed to go to Jersey City. No one was sure what was in it. The first dozen cars were hooked up and the train started back down First Avenue while Mr. Samelson called the New York & Atlantic, trying to figure out whose cars he had.
 Then, disaster. Sitting on 47th Street, on top of the tracks, was the crew's most persistent annoyance: a double-parked car, in this case a blue Ford Spirit. The train groaned to a stop.
 "Hey, you know you've got a train in the middle of the street?" one driver yelled. "Yeah, man, we know," Mr. Torres replied with a sigh.
 Mr. Eastman, Cross Harbor's president, called on his cellphone from Jersey City.
 "Are we railroading?" he asked hopefully.
 Mr. Samelson paused before replying: "Yes, Wayne, we're railroading."
 A half hour later a tow truck arrived and pulled the Spirit away. It did not matter: the fog had closed in. It would be hours before the float could head out. "Fog? Really?" asked Mr. Samelson, who despite his experience is still getting used to the idea of trains going on water. "I thought they had radar."

End of the Line?
 Perhaps the single biggest factor working against Cross Harbor is its troubled relationship with New York City. As a railroad, the company is regulated by the federal government. But the city wants to evict the company from Bush Terminal; under previous management in the mid-1990's, the city contends in a civil suit, the company illegally buried pesticides, petroleum waste and old railroad ties there. The city spent $750,000 to clean it up, and is suing the company to get the money back.
 At the same time, the city's Economic Development Corporation wants Cross Harbor to succeed, because more freight rail service to Brooklyn would help local businesses, strengthen the port and cut down on truck traffic in Manhattan. As the agency studies the viability of a multibillion-dollar rail tunnel connecting New Jersey and Brooklyn, floating more rail cars appears to be a short-term solution. Cross Harbor is the only company that does it.
 "We recognize that they are trying to improve rail freight; we are not here to second-guess them," said Seth Kaye, the development corporation's executive vice president. "It just makes it difficult for us to have them as a tenant at that site, given, up to this point, the failure of New York Cross Harbor to take responsibility for this situation."
 Just a few blocks away from Bush Terminal, at 65th Street, is a $20 million rail-float loading dock that the city finished three years ago. A rail car has yet to be floated off it. The men who run Cross Harbor look at the unused facility, with its straight-arrow tracks, raked gravel track beds and Erector setlike gantries, and imagine how much easier their lives could be. No more traveling down First Avenue to get New York & Atlantic rolling stock. No more double-parked cars.
 They believe that the city is holding the dock hostage until the lawsuit is settled. They argue that the accusations focus on the tenure of a previous company president, and note that nothing has yet been proved. Mr. Eastman points to his own background -- 32 years in the business, including 11 with Conrail -- as proof that professionals are now in charge.
 The city denies that the lawsuit and the 65th Street situation are linked. "We certainly want to come to an agreement with them whereby they could use the rail-float bridge at 65th Street," Mr. Kaye said.
 It's all very complicated, as are most things in railroads in the 21st century, especially those involving Brooklyn, Jersey City, the ground underneath and the water in between. But as the telephone calls go back and forth, and as the lawyers meet, Mr. McClellend, Mr. Lada and Mr. Torres will be out there, hitching that locomotive, moving rice, putting blocks under steel wheels, and waiting for the day when their little railroad is not quite so silly anymore.

Translating Poverty and Pain

BYLINE:  By SUKI KIM; Suki Kim's first novel, "The Interpreter," was published in January by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.

 BODY:
ABOUT three years ago, I became an interpreter by accident. I was working on a novel in which the heroine floated from job to job. I wanted to give her something she could stick to, work that, at least on the surface, did not suggest a commitment. One day, while flipping through a newspaper, I saw this ad: "Freelance interpreter wanted. Flexible hours." Under the list of the desired languages was Korean, in which I and my heroine, Suzy Park, were fluent.
 After enduring a 40-minute-long mock trial at an employment agency near Wall Street that specializes in interpreters for depositions, I was hired. The woman at the agency told me that an interpreter must be willing to travel anywhere within the five boroughs. A deposition's location often depended on the immigrant group. Brighton Beach for Russians. Sunset Park for Mexicans. But I was lucky, she said. Koreans are everywhere. Queens mostly, but sometimes the Bronx, Brooklyn, even Staten Island. 
 I was immediately sent to serve in depositions, which usually took place in gloomy offices known as reporting services. Sometimes an entire building would be filled with them. They had names like Barrister Reporting or Diamond Reporting, and were often situated beside courts. The F train brought me to Sutphin Boulevard, where the Queens courts are lined up on one side. The No.5 was for River Avenue, right by Yankee Stadium and the Bronx courts. You could get on any of the green or red lines for the jobs on Court Street in Brooklyn.
 I had imagined gruesome murder trials involving love triangles and gangster intrigues. But, in fact, most cases were dull. Car accidents, slips and falls, medical malpractice. The personal injury lawyers always acted frantic, pacing back and forth, cellphones pressed to their ears. The stenographers, mostly women in their mid-20's and 30's with distinct Long Island or Brooklyn accents, often showed up late, pushing their own stenograph machines on wheels. In the corner sat the Korean-speaking witnesses, looking small and scared.
 The job of being an interpreter helped change my novel's character. I never imagined that it would change me.
 My research seemed to go smoothly until one day when I was summoned to the State Attorney General's office in Lower Manhattan for a routine case. When the witness entered, he looked vaguely familiar. Once I began interpreting his answers, I realized that his store was located on my block in the East Village. According to his testimony, he also worked as a truck deliveryman and was often absent from the store, which explained why we didn't recognize each other. 
 A good interpreter would have stopped the questioning right away, because of the conflict of interest. But I was a fiction writer, after all. I was curious. It was clear that he was in trouble for violating labor laws. He claimed to employ fewer workers than he actually did, and denied that the cashier from whom I boughtmy daily morning coffee was actually his wife. 
 I had no moral quandary about interpreting his lies. My job was to repeat verbatim what the witness said, in English. What bothered me was that I happened to know the other side of his story. 
 I had seen how hard his wife worked, 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. He had two jobs, running the store and working as a deliveryman. His employees, mostly from South Korea and Central America, spoke hardly any English and probably had no other way of making a living legally. All those people worked too many hours and never seemed to take any time off. 
 His store was open around the clock, seven days a week. But his was not a unique case. There were many such Korean markets around the city. I'd seen picketers boycotting some of them. Yet the secret to their success seemed entwined with the fact that they kept longer hours than anyone else and employed the cheapest labor around. Such a setup inherently teeters, at the least, on the brink of breaking labor laws.
 But customers, including me, rarely stop to question such situations. That's because we New Yorkers are addicted to Korean markets. We love being able get a pack of cigarettes or condoms or fresh salads at the wee hours of the morning. We trust their clean and shiny displays of fruit. In this city that never sleeps, we take comfort in their perpetual availability. 
 The guilty party was the witness, but somehow I was not persuaded that the problem was entirely his. The D.A.'s effort to shut down his store did not pose a real solution, either. By the end of his testimony, nothing seemed as simple as it had first appeared. I wanted to ask the Korean man what he thought about all of this, but I was not allowed to talk with him. It would seem that an interpreter worked for the witness, but she was, in fact, always retained by the opposing counsel. 
 Not until later, on my way home, did it dawn on me that I could no longer stop at his store. I now knew too much about his life and those of other immigrants. I had lived in Manhattan for over a decade. I had attended college uptown and had stayed downtown after that. Until recently, I'd associated Lefrak City only with hip-hop. 
 IT was a revelation, for example, that a Korean construction worker from Brooklyn, who specialized in removing asbestos, made less money in a day than I did in two hours; for each assignment, I was paid at least $150. It seemed that every other car accident victim billed his or her insurance company through this one chiropractor in Flushing. 
 I learned that at a certain hour of the day, the No.7 train was virtually filled with only Asians. I listened to the tribulations of women who toiled as manicurists at nail salons around the city. I became the voice of greengrocers, cabdrivers and dry cleaners. Upon being asked to state their current addresses, the witnesses listed various neighborhoods, including Jackson Heights, Astoria and Forest Hills, but almost never Manhattan. I took it as a given that almost no witness had health insurance or even proper weekends. 
 English, in some ways, struck me as a weapon, and not speaking it was the greatest economic handicap. And my role, as an interpreter, was not only to translate a witness's testimony but also to relieve this pain somehow. 
 With each case, I kept forgetting my mission as a novelist, my responsibility to my heroine, Suzy. After Sept.11, I ran to the family assistance center at the armory to volunteer as an interpreter. It became increasingly difficult to pass by a Korean market or a nail salon and watch some customers berate the workers, or condescend to them as though their lack of English suggested lower intelligence. I was often tempted to interrupt and act on behalf of the non-English-speaker. I was driven by a professional instinct. But it also signaled my shortcomings as an interpreter. An interpreter, of course, should never take sides.
 I stopped interpreting soon after. And I did finish the novel. But the city has changed for me. I keep noticing lines. Between a customer and a worker. Between a prosecutor and a witness. Between Manhattan and the other boroughs. Between one who speaks English, and one who doesn't.

Americans Have a Cool Debate About a Hot-Button Topic

BYLINE:  By BRENT STAPLES 

 BODY:
The debate about race-sensitive college admissions policies has been raging for more than 25 years, long enough for some of the most visible protagonists to switch sides. What started as a high-volume fistfight has evolved into a sophisticated discussion in which those who oppose affirmative action often do so by degrees -- viewing it as right for, say, the fire department or the state college but wrong for an elite university's law school.
 The added nuance lowers the volume and cools things down. The most striking development is that Americans have learned to talk about race without being racist. 
 Things have changed considerably since the heyday of Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who took race-baiting to a new level when he ran for re-election against a black opponent in 1990. A now-legendary attack ad showed a white man crumpling up a rejection letter as a voice-over said: "You needed that job, and you were the best qualified. But they had to give it to a minority because of a racial quota. Is that really fair?"
Mr. Helms encouraged white constituents who had experienced job loss or professional disappointment to blame affirmative action. The message was that antiwhite discrimination was the only possible explanation when a black applicant was chosen over a white person.
George Bush took a page from the Jesse Helms playbook when the administration filed a Supreme Court brief condemning affirmative action at the University of Michigan and tried to mislead Americans into believing that Michigan has a quota system that systematically discriminates against nonblack applicants. The Michigan program in no way resembles such a system. Indeed, the program differs only cosmetically from the one that transformed the American military from a profoundly segregated force on the verge of self-destruction into a model of interracial cohesiveness.
As recently as 10 years ago, quota-baiting by a president would have triggered echoes around the country. Politicians would have jumped on the bandwagon. But the debate about the Michigan case has been surprisingly calm and reflective, partly because many Americans now understand how affirmative action works. Even hard-core conservatives were shaken to see black and Hispanic students disappear from California's elite campuses after Proposition 209 outlawed race-sensitive admissions policies there in 1996. They do not wish to see the phenomenon repeated across the country. 
The new tone also reflects a growing realization that a majority of special admissions cases involve white students who are athletes or V.I.P.'s, or wealthy applicants who get into elite colleges because their families write big checks. The growing realization that money and privilege play a role in the admissions process has transformed what began as a debate about race into a discussion about the meaning of academic merit and what constitutes fair access for the rich, white and famous.
The strongest challenge to the Bush position has come from the American military, which knows that killing off affirmative action would leave the country with a fighting force that would be weaker and more segregated than it is today. Senior officers still in uniform are unable to challenge the White House directly. But their views are reflected in an amicus brief filed last month and signed by several decorated former officers -- including three former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
The brief discusses the Vietnam War period, when the military's ability to defend the country was compromised because it had gone into battle with a nearly all-white officer corps and a multiracial fighting force. Integrating the officer corps meant increasing the minority representation among those entering the Army, Navy and Air Force academies. This meant understanding that standardized test scores are not the final arbiters of ability and focusing on a broad range of factors -- including race -- in recruitment and admissions.
As the Wall Street Journal columnist Al Hunt noted recently, the military academies have grown in stature since these changes took place. Many cadets, both white and black, have been found to have leadership skills superior to fellow students with higher test scores. A similar pattern has emerged at elite civilian colleges, several of which hold SAT's in such low regard that they no longer require applicants to take them. 
The idea that "merit" can be defined solely in terms of test scores has been rejected by the American military and has lost credibility just about everywhere -- except in the White House. The voices that argued most forcefully for Mr. Bush to attack affirmative action at Michigan did so partly because they believe that the university puts too little weight on SAT scores and too much weight on race. This fixation on the link between SAT scores and race is peculiar, given a White House with so many people who relied on privilege and connections as they rose to high office. 
True, the university's admissions scheme -- which is based on a 150-point system -- awards a maximum of 12 points for the SAT score and 20 for membership in an underrepresented minority group. But to focus on that is misleading, given that 20 points can also be earned by white students who are economically disadvantaged or who attend predominantly nonwhite high schools. In addition, a full 110 of the 150 points are derived from academic factors.
Mr. Bush brandished the "quota" label to feed the far right. But the country is learning that special admissions, when taken as a whole, favor white students more than blacks -- and that class, not race, is the main determinant of who gets a boost into the most coveted colleges.

Where to Find the Cash For Everything Else?

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT is a choice that politicians hate to make: guns or butter.
 President Lyndon B. Johnson insisted, for a long time, that he could deliver both, that "we can continue the Great Society while we fight in Vietnam." President Franklin D. Roosevelt acknowledged the obvious in 1943: "old Dr. New Deal" had given way to "Dr. Win-the-War." 
 Now comes the Bush administration, with its ambitious proposals for new tax cuts, an overhaul of Medicare, the creation of new prescription drug benefits, continued improvements in education and other domestic needs. Administration officials and their allies say they can push ahead with these goals even while prosecuting a war with Iraq, if it comes to that, and a subsequent occupation. They argue, in essence, that they will not have to choose.
"Whether or not the president authorizes the use of force, the American people deserve to have jobs," Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said last week. "And whether or not the president authorizes a use of force, it still is important to get prescription drugs to our nation's seniors and to strengthen the Medicare program. I'm certain you would not suggest that if we go to war, seniors somehow don't deserve prescription drugs. There are still a series of initiatives that are important."
But the strains of trying to be bold on two fronts are already apparent. Administration officials are under increasing pressure to put a more specific price tag on a war, which was not in the budget they submitted this year. With deficits already projected at upward of $300 billion a year, Democrats say the case for the administration's $674 billion tax cut will grow ever weaker.
"Will the Republicans and the president push this tax bill when our deficits are soaring to $400 or $500 billion?" asked Representative Robert T. Matsui, the California Democrat and chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
It is not simply a matter of money. Pushing legislation as complicated as a huge tax bill or a Medicare overhaul through Congress takes presidential focus and political capital. Already, the rollout of the Medicare plan suggested that an administration noted for its message control and internal discipline was stretched thin. An early draft was overwhelmingly criticized -- by members of both parties -- as politically unpalatable, forcing administration officials to scramble to adjust.
Some historians, like Robert Dallek, argue that the Bush administration is attempting the impossible. "If you go to war, there is no room for a significant domestic agenda and you can document that," Mr. Dallek said. "Imagine what it would take to put across a major health reform program, a major drug program. Where is the political energy when you get into a war?"
No one was more bitterly aware of that trade-off than Johnson, who told the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin in 1970: "I knew from the start that I was bound to be crucified either way I moved. If I left the woman I really loved -- the Great Society -- in order to get involved with that . . . of a war on the other side of the world, then I would lose everything at home. All my programs."
Johnson, of course, tried to juggle a long, draining war and profoundly ambitious -- and expensive -- domestic social programs. Grover Norquist, the conservative strategist, asserted, "We can, in the next two months, liberate Iraq and pass the president's tax plan."
Moreover, for Mr. Bush, an exceedingly tight budget fits with his view of a limited federal government. Some liberals argue that Mr. Bush is not at all unhappy with a budget that favors guns over butter. Mr. Bush can also accomplish many of his domestic goals, in areas like environmental regulation, by administrative action alone.
But the Bush administration does have some grand ambitions on the domestic front, albeit very different from Johnson's. It could have chosen, for example, simply to add a modest drug benefit to Medicare and set aside its overhaul for a quieter time. It could have chosen smaller tax cuts.
It is hard not to read, in the scale of this administration's ambitions, an Oedipal subtext: the son, unlike the father, will never be accused of lacking a bold vision for domestic policy. The father ended the Persian Gulf war in 1991 with an approval rating of 88 percent, but did not heed, for many months, the pleas in his own party to spend some of that political capital on an aggressive domestic program.
Politically, this White House may feel it has no real alternative. For all the anxiety over terrorism and war, the nation is increasingly worried about the ailing economy. In a poll released last week by the Pew Research Center, 43 percent of those surveyed approved of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy, while 48 percent disapproved. Andrew Kohut, who heads the Pew poll, said voters' fears about having enough money for retirement, for college, for the care of aged parents, have increased in recent years.
Governors are pleading for some federal assistance with programs like Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance for low-income anddisabled Americans. The number of uninsured Americans already stands at 41 million, and many policy makers worry that it will only grow because of continued unemployment, rising health costs and the prospect of cutbacks in Medicaid. "We are, in my view, closer to a health care implosion than most people realize," said Gov. Edward G. Rendell, the new Democratic governor of Pennsylvania.
The prospect of war is like a toothache for American voters, making it hard to focus on anything else, Mr. Kohut said. But once it is over, they will turn quickly to these underlying domestic concerns, he predicted, noting that they always have, a hard lesson for leaders from Churchill to the first President Bush.
There is a winning chain of events for the administration. As one House Democratic strategist put it, "It's all contingent on his numbers." If the war is quick and considered a victory, the president's popularity will rise, his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill will be eager to move his domestic program "and he'll just roll through a lot of this stuff," the Democratic strategist said. "The idea that a lot of Republicans would break with him in that context, if his numbers are getting back to toward the 80's, is unlikely."
White House officials, presumably, would shift gears quickly. Their domestic agenda would be ready to go. Their moderates in the Senate would hold the line. It would depend, in short, on a lot of variables breaking their way. But nothing seems riskier, perhaps, than letting domestic policy slide.

HEADLINE: The World; 
Can Oil Pay for Iraq's Rebuilding? The U.S. Hopes So.

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
AMONG the arguments the Bush administration has offered to allay concerns about the cost of war in Iraq is that the United States would not have to pay for rebuilding the country after the shooting stops. The Iraqis themselves could manage that, the thinking goes, because they sit atop the world's second-largest oil reserves, after Saudi Arabia's.
 "Detailed planning is underway for resumption of oil production as quickly as possible to meet the Iraqi people's basic needs," said Douglas J. Feith, under secretary of defense for policy, at a recent Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. "The oil sector is Iraq's primary source of funding." 
 But over the last few months, a growing chorus of experts, including oil industry and regional analysts, has questioned whether Iraq could count on that money anytime in the near future.
"It's simply a fantasy that Iraq has lots of oil, so therefore it will have lots of money," said James A. Placke, senior associate with Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm, who spent 27 years as a United States diplomat, mainly in the Middle East. 
Over the next 10 years, Iraqis may need about $250 billion to rebuild everything from power plants to social service programs, said Raad Alkadiri, a director at PFC Energy, a Washington consulting group. That does not include an estimated $50 billion over the same period to restore and expand the oil industry, he said. 
Despite such concerns, the government still thinks oil will be the engine for Iraq's economic revival. "The Iraqi economy is driven by oil," said Gregg W. Sullivan, a spokesman for the Near Eastern bureau of the State Department. "We don't expect it to be an impoverished country for long."
Twenty five years ago, before the Iran-Iraq war, Iraq could produce a maximum of about 3.5 million barrels a day. Today, its maximum capacity is about 2.8 million barrels a day, which still makes it the third largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Iraq's oil industry has atrophied for several reasons. Two wars in two decades badly damaged its fields, and United Nations sanctions have reduced the flow of spare parts and technology. 
"The oil sector in some ways is being held togetherby string and chewing gum," Mr. Alkadiri said. "It's a testament to the skills of the technocrats that they managed to keep the oil pumping, but they have paid a tremendous cost as far the state of the oil fields."
Mr. Placke estimated that revenues to Iraq from oil exports, legal and otherwise, were about $12 billion to $14 billion last year, but a war would likely further depress its production. And the possibility remains, despite Saddam Hussein's recent denials, that he might sabotage the oil facilities rather than allow them to be captured.
Even if the industry survives a war intact, "many oil fields are in areas that are likely to be the biggest flash points, not just during the war, but as the United States tries to win the peace," Mr. Alkadiri said.
Kirkuk, a city in northern Iraq with rich oil fields around it, may turn into one of those flash points, regional experts fear. Long a Kurdish stronghold, Kirkuk has been resettled with growing numbers of Arabs sent from southern Iraq by Mr. Hussein. For 75 years, the Kurds have demanded control over Kirkuk's oil fields to have an independent source of money as the first step toward greater autonomy from Baghdad. In 1991, right after the gulf war, during an uprising, the Kurds wrecked the Kirkuk oil complex. 
How would an impoverished Iraq restore its oil fields without outside aid? Industry analysts have noted that oil field service companies like Halliburton (where Vice President Dick Cheney was the chief executive officer before his nomination as vice president) and Schlumberger would likely be the first companies that could benefit from an effort to rebuild the industry, though certainly all the major oil companies are eager to work in Iraq. 
Yet despite the lure of huge reserves, oil field service companies and others are unlikely to go in just because the United States desires a quick rebuilding of the industry. Oil executives have said that doing business in Iraq depends on whether they can be sure they can make money and whether the country affords them the legal protections to repatriate their profits -- guarantees that would take Iraq, coming out of war and decay, some time to develop.
"The oil companies more or less have the same structure of shareholders, which are 35 to 45 pension funds, and they need to be in line with what their shareholders think of investments around the world," a European oil executive said. "Companies, whoever they are, are not going to pour $5 billion or $10 billion into Iraq without a stable government, a constitution, a central bank. These things need to be clarified before anything goes."

HEADLINE: A Pivot Point for the Middle East 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 1 

 BODY:
Since last June, the Bush administration has premised its policy toward peace in the Middle East on what is apparently a paradox: it has sought an act of selfless statesmanship from a leader, Yasir Arafat, whom it regards as no statesman. 
 In Afghanistan and Iraq, the administration has intently worked toward what it calls regime change, but in the Palestinian Authority it has contented itself with periodic public gestures and demands. It has refused to send high-level envoys to Mr. Arafat, while demanding that he step aside as Palestinian leader in the interests of restarting peace negotiations and ultimately of achieving a state for his people. Mr. Arafat has not done so, contending that it is up to the Palestinians to pick their leaders. 
 While this impasse has endured, so has the essential dynamic of the conflict, despite all the suffering and violence by both Israelis and Palestinians in the last year. As the administration's attention shifted to other crises, Palestinian attacks continued, Israeli soldiers operated more and more freely in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, Israeli blockades of Palestinian cities tightened and Israeli settlements grew. 
The impasse over Mr. Arafat is also likely to muffle the immediate effects of two significant developments here this week, a renewed vow by President Bush to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's formation of a new right-wing Israeli government.
In a speech in Washington, Mr. Bush envisioned peace here as he sought support for a war in Iraq, much as his administration once spoke of achieving Middle East peace as it sought support for the Afghan war. Mr. Bush predicted that new leadership in Iraq would better position Palestinians "to choose new leaders" and halt all violence.
That message has important implications for the second development. Mr. Sharon created his coalition with the participation of two parties that oppose any Palestinian state -- a declared goal of Mr. Bush and a declared concession of Mr. Sharon -- and that passionately support the settler movement, which the United States has traditionally considered an obstacle to peace. 
Mr. Bush appeared to be softening the demands on Israel in a draft for a "road map" to peace by the so-called diplomatic quartet of the United States, United Nations, the European Union and Russia. As drafted, the plan called for immediate concessions by both sides, including insisting that Israel dismantle settlement outposts built since March 2001. 
The Israeli government has proposed numerous modifications to the road map, and the Bush administration has repeatedly postponed its announcement of a final plan. 
As long as the Americans keep the pressure on Mr. Arafat and do not demand action against settlements or progress toward negotiations -- that is, as long as Mr. Sharon can continue functioning as he has been -- the far-right in the government and the hawks in Mr. Sharon's Likud Party are unlikely to become restive. They may not even urge Mr. Sharon to renegotiate his pledge to Mr. Bush two years ago not to harm Mr. Arafat, because as long as Mr. Arafat remains in the West Bank, their potential disagreements with Americans and each other over proceeding toward peace are moot, at least judging by Washington's present approach. Mr. Sharon has said that his pledge not to harm Mr. Arafat was all that kept him from trying to force him into exile last year.
Further, Mr. Sharon has set himself up to function as the chief moderating voice on security matters in his cabinet. If Mr. Arafat is the Bush administration's dispensable man, Mr. Sharon in the short term may seem even more indispensable to the administration than he has been, as it seeks to keep matters relatively calm here during an Iraqi campaign. 
Mr. Sharon has replaced as foreign minister his old rival, Benjamin Netanyahu, with a relative novice, Silvan Shalom, a change that puts Mr. Sharon firmly in control of his foreign policy. To some diplomats here, with the appointment of Mr. Netanyahu as finance minister instead, Mr. Sharon is preparing to face up to Israel's dire economic situation and yawning budget deficit. Israel is seeking a large aid package from the Bush administration, which in turn is seeking economic reforms. 
Further, by including the settlers' parties while excluding parties that represent ultra-Orthodox Jews, Mr. Sharon may be signaling where he plans to let the budget ax fall. Shinui, a secular, centrist party that has also joined the government, is a firm opponent of subsidies for the religious. In this analysis, it is Israel's economy, rather than resolving the conflict, that preoccupies Mr. Sharon. 
But to some political analysts, Mr. Sharon is not planning far ahead but merely maneuvering, clumsily at times, to stay a step or two ahead of his multiplying rivals and policy headaches. Itzhak Galnoor, a Hebrew University political scientist, said Mr. Sharon simply felt comfortable embracing the settlers' parties, the National Religious Party and National Union, which also served at times in his last coalition. 
"For him this is not far right," he said. "Those are people who believe in things that are not far from his heart." He noted that Mr. Sharon had awarded the Ministry of Construction and Housing to Effi Eitam, the leader of the National Religious Party. Mr. Sharon himself held that post, and used it to expand the settlements, in the early 1990's under Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. 
At bottom, leaders on both sides are seeking to keep their options open until the expected war in Iraq is under way, which they think will cause the White House to return its attention here and perhaps adjust its policy. "Once this operation starts, things will start moving again here," said Shmuel Sandler, a political scientist at Bar-Ilan University. 
If concessions are demanded, Mr. Sharon can argue that his right-wing coalition gives him little room to maneuver. Or, if he wishes to act on his stated desire for an agreement that yields a limited Palestinian state in less than half of the West Bank and Gaza, he can sustain a break with the right and seek support from other factions, including the left-of-center Labor Party.
For his part, Mr. Arafat has edged toward meeting the administration's demand, saying he will shortly appoint a prime minister, although he has not yet said who will it will be or what powers he will have. More than a year after being declared "irrelevant" by the Israeli government and shunned by the United States, Mr. Arafat remains at the pivot point of peace in the Middle East.

HEADLINE: Steve Carlin, 84, '$64,000 Question' Producer 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Steve Carlin, an ingenious and irrepressible producer of television game shows, including "The $64,000 Question" and others that proved to be rigged, died on Feb. 4 at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 84.
 The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said his wife, Peggy. 
 Mr. Carlin was executive producer of "The $64,000 Question," "The $64,000 Challenge" and other shows that were dropped in the late 1950's when the networks ended all game shows offering cash prizes. Though rigging game shows -- or "preplanning" outcomes, in the phrase favored by their producers -- was still legal, the public and sponsors would not tolerate them in their new, suddenly tainted context. 
To Mr. Carlin, the shows were simply great entertainment, following in the tradition of radio quiz shows, which, it turned out, had also been fixed. He saw the shows as less about money than about "a celebration of the working class."
The idea was to help contestants the sponsors liked by feeding them answers or big hints. Contestants would then return week after week as the prize escalated to $64,000. Less appealing contestants, of course, got no such help.
Mr. Carlin told a grand jury how and why the shows were rigged, according to Tim Yohn, who wrote a book on the quiz scandals with Joseph Stone, a former Manhattan prosecutor who investigated them. The book was "Prime Time and Misdemeanors: Investigating the 1950's TV Quiz Scandal" (Rutgers, 1992).
The only people charged with wrongdoing in the investigation were contestants who did not tell the truth to the grand jury. Fixing game shows did not become illegal until 1960.
After losing his shows, Mr. Carlin went to Europe, where he produced more than a half-dozen game shows, including the Italian hit "M'ama Non M'ama" ("Love Me, Love Me Not"). In this show, two contestants tried to win the most members of the opposite sex by determining whether the love and romance stories they were telling were true. This show was later produced on American television, for which Mr. Carlin worked regularly after memories of the scandal faded.
Another of his shows was a syndicated version of "The $64,000 Question," which began in the United States in 1976. It was called "The $128,000 Question," to reflect inflation.
Michael Dann, a broadcast consultant and the CBS executive who notified Mr. Carlin that his show was canceled in 1958, called Mr. Carlin a genius at quiz shows.
"He walked around with a game show in his head most of the time," said Mr. Dann, who hired Mr. Carlin to create shows in Britain, Sweden, Italy and other places in Europe after the death of quiz shows in the United States.
"Let's face it," Mr. Dann said, "he was a walking game show."
Steven R. Carlin was born and raised in Brooklyn, and was a graduate of the City College of New York. He started in the radio industry and moved on to TV and developed one of the most popular early children's shows, "Rootie Kazootie," a puppet series on NBC. He also wrote a comic strip, with the artist Myron Waldman, called "Happy the Humbug."
Mr. Carlin went to work for Louis G. Cowan, who owned the production company that developed the concept of "The $64,000 Question" and other game shows. Mr. Cowan's company was a packager that came up with ideas, found sponsors and sold the entire package to the networks. When Mr. Cowan took an executive job with CBS, he sold the company to other producers working there, principally Mr. Carlin.
Mr. Carlin testified before the House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight in 1959 that as executive producer of the production company that he had named Entertainment Productions Inc., he was "willing to please the client" by rigging game shows. But he repeatedly denied that he was specifically told to rig anything by the principal sponsor, Revlon.
In addition to his wife, the former Peggy Sanford, Mr. Carlin is survived by his daughter, Melissa, and his brother, Morty.

HEADLINE: Jump in Price Of Oil Puts New Strains On Economy 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The most common cause of recessions, a surge inoil prices, is again afflicting the global economy.
 Just as they have before every American downturn over the last 40 years, energy costs have risen significantly in the last year, capped by a sharp spike since December. With more money being spent on gasoline and heating fuel, economic growth has slowed in both the United States and Europe, and the uneven recovery that began in late 2001 is facing perhaps its biggest threat yet. 
 Most forecasters expect the United States economy to avoid a new recession this year, saying that only an unexpectedly protracted war in Iraq would keep oil at its current price or higher. But any war is an unknown, and the price increases for both oil and natural gas have already caused consumers to cut back on other spending. The increases have also created a new problem for businesses trying to emerge from the hangover of the late-1990's boom. 
"The economy is extremely fragile," said Mark M. Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com, a research company in West Chester, Pa. "We've got some real problems if this drags on for any length of time."
Energy costs began rising more than a year ago, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut production in response to the weak global economy. The potential war in the Persian Gulf, political chaos in Venezuela and a cold winter in the United States caused the price of a barrel of oil to soar to almost $40 on Thursday, the highest since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, before it retreated to $36.60 on Friday in New York. That is up about 69 percent from a year ago.
Every time that oil prices have risen by at least 60 percent since World War II, a recession has occurred in the United States, with the exception of a one-month blip in oil prices in 1987. The current annual increase is similar to the jumps of late 1990, when a recession was starting, and the summer of 2000, nine months before another began.
Higher energy costs reduce economic growth by effectively forcing families and businesses to send more money to oil-producing countries, leaving less to be spent on goods and services that create jobs at home. 
Energy prices affect Europe and Japan even more severely than the United States, which produces more of its own oil and natural gas. Britain reported last week that its economy had grown at the most sluggish pace in 10 years during the last three months of 2002. The German economy shrank at the end of last year for the first time in a year.
"The single best cyclical indicator for the world economy is the price of oil," said Andrew J. Oswald, an economist at the University of Warwick outside Coventry, England. "Nothing moves in the world economy without oil in there somewhere."
In recent weeks, a number of big American manufacturers have blamed higher energy costs for cuts in their earnings forecasts. A few have cited oil prices while postponing new investments that could add jobs, even as an overall rise in business spending has suggested that the economy might be picking up speed were it not for energy. 
For example, DuPont, the large chemical maker, recently delayed until June an expansion that had been scheduled to start in February, according to , a spokeswoman. 
In Elkhorn, Wis., Hudapack Metal Treating, which employs 125 people, is investing in technology to make its furnaces less dependent on natural gas -- which costs more than twice what it did a year ago -- rather than spending to increase its production of bolts for pickup trucks. 
"You can't take an extra $20,000 a month, throw it at gas prices and expect to be profitable," said Gary Huss, the president of Hudapack, which is merely breaking even. 
The ailing airline industry is also being hit hard. American Airlines will probably spend about $200 million more on fuel this quarter than it did a year ago. Standard & Poor's lowered the company's credit rating on Friday, saying fuel costs were one reason that American might have to file soon for bankruptcy protection. 
Many companies buy advance fuel contracts, a practice known as hedging, to protect them from some of the short-term price increases. United Parcel Service has purchased gasoline hedges, but it will still increase the fuel surcharge on its deliveries to 1.5 percent tomorrow, from 1.25 percent, because of increased costs.
Rising oil prices appear to be helping keep layoffs at a pace that few analysts expected, according to government figures, delaying any major improvement in the nation's moribund job market. The economy employs almost two million fewer people than it did two years ago.
Consumers, paying almost 50 percent more for gasoline than a year ago, in turn are reducing their spending on other goods. Over all, purchases at American retail chain stores fell 1.1 percent in January, according to the Bank of TokyoMitsubishi, which adjusts its numbers for seasonal variations. 
Sales of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks have fallen recently, while car sales are still rising. The largest trucks are selling particularly poorly compared with a year ago, according to Morgan & Company, a research firm. Analysts are divided over whether fuel prices are a reason, noting that some carmakers have recently reduced discounts for many trucks.
Over all, families are spending about 5 percent of their budgets on energy, up from 4.1 percent in early 2002, according to Economy.com. 
About one-third of Americans say the recent spike has caused them "financial hardship," according to a recent Gallup poll. More than one- quarter said they thought that gas prices would be near their current level six months from now, and about one half said they would rise. 
"I think it's going to get much worse," said Teri Chavez, a public relations executive in Denver, as she filled the tank of her blue Volvo station wagon last week. "Does it mean that I'm going to stop driving? No. But I might think twice before I take my car up in the mountains."
In 1991, oil prices fell almost as soon as the United States attacked Iraq, and many economists think the same could happen this year. Even if a war temporarily reduced the supply of energy, President Bush could release oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to bring down prices, analysts note.
But because oil inventories are lower than they were 12 years ago, a price decline could be smaller today than at the outset of the Persian Gulf war. Based on the price of oil futures contracts, investors are expecting oil prices to remain around $38 a barrel through April and then gradually decline, falling below $30 by the end of the year.
At those levels, oil prices would still probably prevent the economy from growing rapidly this year. But they would also make a new recession unlikely, particularly because business executives have recently shown signs of optimism, increasing their investments in new technology and equipment.
"It's definitely a negative," said William C. Dudley, the chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, referring to the cost of energy. "It's just not at the point where we think it's recessionary."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ANKARA; 
TURKISH DEPUTIES REFUSE TO ACCEPT AMERICAN TROOPS

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, March 1 

 BODY:
The Turkish Parliament today dealt a heavy blow to the Bush administration's plans for a northern front against Iraq, narrowly rejecting a measure that would have allowed thousands of American combat troops to use the country as a base for an attack.
 More Turkish lawmakers supported the measure than opposed it, but the resolution failed because the total number of "no" votes and abstentions exceeded the number of favorable votes. Under the Turkish Constitution, a resolution can become law only if it is supported by a majority of the lawmakers present. 
 The final tally was 264 to 251, with 19 abstentions. 
The defeat stunned American officials, who had been confident that Turkey's leaders would be able to persuade the members of their party to support the measure. American ships had already begun unloading heavy equipment at Turkish ports in anticipation of a victory, and two dozen vessels were idling off the coast.
The vote also quashed the possibility, at least for now, that Turkish troops would enter northern Iraq, a prospect that many there, especially the country's Kurds, regarded with dread.
In the turmoil after the parliamentary session, American diplomats said they were requesting a "clarification" of the vote. But American officials said they were not seeking another vote, and there was no indication that Turkish officials were either.
The vote came after weeks of negotiations between the United States and Turkey, largely over the amount of economic assistance Turkey would receive in the event of a war with Iraq.
The defeat posed immediate military problems for American officials, who had been counting on Turkey's support to bring as many as 62,000 American troops into the country to build a northern front. A senior Pentagon official said today that the American military would be able to stage the operation without Turkey's help, but most military analysts agreed that it would be extremely difficult without a northern base.
The defeat of the resolution was a stunning political blow as well. Turkey, one of the America's closest allies and a member of NATO, is a secular Muslim democracy whose support in the region the Bush administration has craved. Indeed, American officials have called Turkey a model for the type of system they are hoping an invasion of Iraq would help bring elsewhere in the Middle East.
The defeat seemed to surprise Turkey's leaders, who only hours earlier had predicted that Parliament would approve the measure. Prime Minister Abdullah Gul, and the chief of the governing Justice and Development Party, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had endorsed the resolution, and both men had urged their party, which controls a large majority of the Parliament, to support it.
But the American request had placed Turkey's lawmakers in a difficult position; polls here indicate that as many as 9 of 10 Turks oppose involvement in a war against Iraq. In the end, the resolution failed because nearly 100 members of the governing party appeared to have voted against the measure or to have abstained.
In an interview afterward, Mr. Gul said Turkey's democratic system had spoken with finality. "Turkey is the only democratic country in the region," Mr. Gul said. "The decision is clear. We have to respect this decision, as this is what democracy requires."
The vote casts a shadow over the American-Turkish relationship, which Turkish officials said had come under great strain during the negotiations. Mr. Gul and Mr. Erdogan made no secret of their distaste for the American plans, but associates said both men had concluded that the relationship with the United States was too valuable to endanger by saying no. But as the discussions wore on and tales of American high-handedness spread, Turkish lawmakers, as well as the Turkish public, appeared to become more and more alienated.
"The relationship is spoiled," said Murat Mercan, a member of Parliament from the majority party. "The Americans dictated to us. It became a business negotiation, not something between friends. It disgusted me."
In Ankara, the United States Embassy said American ties with Turkey would not be threatened by the vote. "We respect this as a democratic result -- we will live with that," said an embassy spokesman. "We worked together as allies and we will continue to work together as allies."
The Turkish vote throws into question the ambitious military strategy that had been devised to overwhelm the forces of President Saddam Hussein. American military commanders wanted to begin an attack from Turkey that would pin down Iraqi forces in the north and keep them away from the main American force driving from the south. 
Pentagon officials said they were still hoping that Turkish officials would hold another vote, and there were no signs that the American ships off the Turkish coast had been moved.
The officials said that they were determined, even without Turkey, to open a northern front. Such an operation could entail airlifting troops and tanks from bases in the Persian Gulf.
Pentagon officials said that Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf, has backup plans for moving American forces into northern Iraq. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard B. Myers, said on Friday, "General Franks, as we speak, is looking at lots of options." 
The vote today probably also eliminates the possibility that Turkey would send troops into northern Iraq on its own. Turkish leaders had been planning to send tens of thousands of their own troops into the region partly to ensure that the area's Kurds would not be able to set up an independent state.
Indeed, Turkey's leaders said repeatedly that one of the main reasons for supporting the American plan was to ensure that Turkey had a role in the future shape of Iraq. That role, for now, seems doomed. Even before the vote today, there were several issues that remained unresolved between the two countries. The main sticking point was the American insistence that the Turks continue to adhere to an agreement the country has signed with the International Monetary Fund, which has imposed strict conditions on Turkish lawmakers to reform their economy. In exchange, Turkey has received billions of dollars in loans. The Turkish government is currently negotiating with the fund to receive about $1.5 billion in new loans.
With the Americans promising $6 billion in direct aid, Turkish officials wanted to be able receive the money before striking any new agreement with the fund, but Washington insisted that Turkey reach a deal with the fund first. American officials were worried that Turkey, armed with the new American cash, would walk away from the fund, defeating the purpose of the American aid, which was to maintain confidence in the Turkish economy during a war.
Even with the outstanding differences, Turkey's leaders had tried to persuade reluctant party members, twice postponing a vote to bring them along. Afterward, some members of the ruling party said that several Turkish lawmakers had not voted as they had indicated they would. The vote and the debate were closed to the public.

HEADLINE: Oil Price Jump Adds To Fears on Economy 

 BODY:
Just as they have before every American economic downtown over the last 40 years, energy costs have risen significantly in the last year, including a sharp spike since December. 
 A possible war in the Persian Gulf, political chaos in Venezuela and a cold winter in the United States have helped push prices about 69 percent higher than a year ago. 
 While most forecasters say they expect the United States to avoid a new recession this year, price increases for both oil and natural gas have caused consumers to cut back on other spending. A result is a new problem for businesses trying to emerge from the hangover of the late 1990's boom. And Europe and Japan, which produce less of their own oil and natural gas, are affected even more severely.

HEADLINE: Got Milk? Yes, but That's Not the Issue 

BYLINE:  By GEORGINA GUSTIN 

 BODY:
LIKE Connecticut's struggling dairy industry, David Jacquier's farm, a bucolic spread dotted with hundreds of cows, is shrinking.
 "I'm starting to sell real estate," said Mr. Jacquier, who has been forced to sell off parcels of his Elm Knoll Farm in East Canaan to keep the cash-strapped operation afloat. "That's the worse thing you can do in this business." 
 Mr. Jacquier said he didn't have a choice, and many of Connecticut's dairy farmers are facing the same predicament. The prices dairy farmers are getting for milk are at their lowest point in 25 years and production costs are skyrocketing,. 
"We started the year with 200 farms, and already we've lost five," said Gabe Moquin, who heads the dairy division at the state's agriculture department. "They just can't make a profit." 
Connecticut's dairy farmers are getting paid about $1 per gallon of milk, a drop from the $1.65 they were getting a year and a half ago. At the same time, consumers are paying the same prices for milk at the grocery store -- about $3 a gallon -- which led to accusations that the retailers are price gouging.
"Something is desperately wrong with the picture now," said Richard Blumenthal, the state attorney general, who has recommended legislation that would limit what milk retailers and processors can charge for fluid milk.
Under the legislation, An Act Concerning the Fair Pricing of Milk, if the wholesale price charged to a retailer by a processor is 40 percent above the price paid to the farmers, the processor will be investigated. If the retail price is 40 percent above the wholesale price paid the processor, then the retailer would be investigated.
"Our aim is to help both the farmer and the consumer by eliminating unconscionable profits resulting from price gouging, and to restore competition to the industry," Mr. Blumenthal said. "Essentially the legislation guarantees the farmer will be paid a fair price, or at least a fairer price, because it reduces the amount it could be marked up and pegs the final price paid by the consumer to the price paid to the farmer. In other words, if the price in the supermarket rises, the price paid to the farmer also rises."
Not everyone, however, thinks the legislation in its current form would solve the problem.
At a public hearing at the Capitol in Hartford on Wednesday, dairy farmers, lawmakers, food industry officials and academics gathered to present their views on how best to save the state's industry, while also giving consumers a break at the grocery store. 
The number of dairy farms in the state dropped from 6,233 in 1940, to 663 in 1980, to 195 today. While some wonder why such a small industry matters to a state where agriculture represents only a fraction of the economy, others stress the peripheral benefits of a dairy industry presence.
"The dairy industry is an integral part of our economy and quality of life," Mr. Blumenthal said. "We spend a lot of money to preserve farmland, and helping farmers stay in business when they provide an essential item that is important."
The state's dairy farms are mostly in New London, Windham and Litchfield counties, in scenic rural areas. In the Quinebaug-Shetucket Heritage Corridor, which encompasses 32 towns and was designated a national heritage site by Congress in 1994, the farms are part of the open landscape.
"We lose farms and they can be developed, and let's face it, with the population push, we would end up looking like Newark," said Andrea Ader, of Quinebaug-Shetucket Heritage Corridor Inc., which oversees the area. "That's fine if you want to look like Newark, but there are fewer and fewer family farms. You impact the character of the valley, and it's not just open space. It takes something to be dedicated to milking cows twice a day."
Bonnie Burr, the director of government relations for the Connecticut Farm Bureau, noted the dairy industry in Connecticut earned $74 million in 2001, while keeping roughly 175,000 acres as open space.
Under the state's Farmland Preservation Program, Ms. Burr said, the state buys the development rights to farmland, which allows the farmer to continue farming the land while guaranteeing that it never gets developed. Many farmers, however, when strapped for cash, end up selling land to developers anyway. It is faster than going through a government sale, and it is more lucrative.
"If the prices don't come back by July, I'll be done; I'm losing roughly $300,000 a year," said Mr. Jacquier, explaining that it costs him $13.75 to produce a hundredweight of milk, or 100 pounds, though he is being paid only $11 for the amount by processors. 
"If I sell my cows and real estate, I'll break even," he said. "I'll go get a job. Once they put blacktops and driveways on it, it's over with. We'll grow houses." 
The reasons for the recent drop in milk prices -- from about $17 dollars per hundredweight two years ago to between $11 and $13 these days -- are varied and complex. The industry says production has increased nationally, with milk flooding the market from huge producers in western states, while consumption of dairy products has dropped. 
In the Northeast, where land and labor costs are considerably higher than elsewhere, the expiration of the Northeast Dairy Compact in 2001 has compounded the problem by removing federal price supports for all farmers. Many in the industry believe another regional compact to reinstitute federal support could be the answer, but in the meantime, northeastern states are trying to address the problem through their own legislatures.
Not everyone agrees on the approach.
"Price gouging is a consumer issue, not so much a farmer issue," said Bob Wellington, an economist with Agri-Mark, a cooperative of New England dairy farmers. "But the problem is the shares the farmers are getting are shrinking, and they're getting crushed by the lower milk prices. Most farmers are saying this is the worse financial situation in decades. There are a lot of auctions lined up."
Mr. Wellington explained that while the farmers are struggling, their troubles are creating a domino effect, and related services, like equipment and grain sales, are also suffering. "It's almost like a spiraling cycle now," he said.
Ms. Burr, of the farm bureau, also questions the legislation. "When you look at the bill, while it certainly addresses the consumer needs it doesn't really have the ability to put money back in the farmers' pockets," she said. "We don't think this will do anything for the farmers."
Another price support program, part of the 2002 Farm Bill, guarantees price supports, but critics say it only helps smaller producers.
Once a farmer has produced 2.4 million gallons in a given year, they are no longer eligible for federal cash.
"It's a safety net lying flaccid on a concrete floor," Mr. Wellington said. "If you hit it you're already dead."
Ronald W. Cotterill, who has published many studies on the dairy industry, said he believed the legislation would indeed raise the prices paid to farmers while keeping retail costs at a fair point.
"I've concluded the proposed legislation addressed the farmer end probably more strongly than the consumer end," said Mr. Cotterill, director of the Food Marketing Policy Center at the University of Connecticut.
Mr. Cotterill also said that he believed lower prices at the retailer would result in higher consumption by consumer.
Mr. Blumenthal agreed.
"Certainly price is a consideration when you're considering whether to buy the extra quart," he said.
For some, though, the legislation is just a start.
"Right now we're addressing the consumer's concerns," said George Wilber, a state representative and former dairy farmer who is co-sponsoring the bill. "The next step is working toward putting money in the farmers pockets."

HEADLINE: Bank Robbers Strike 5 Times 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS STAUDTER 

DATELINE: OSSINING 

 BODY:
WHEN the M&T Bank here in the Arcadian Shopping Center was robbed on Feb. 21, local law enforcement officials agreed it was a brazen act. After all, the lone bandit chose a bank that is situated as far away as possible from the two roadway entrances into the shopping center, which are both often logjammed with traffic, making a quick getaway problematical. The bank robber, however, simply walked out the bank's door , through the length of the parking lot, and flagged down a taxi, according to the Ossining police. 
 The first bank to be robbed in the village of Ossining in more than 20 years, the M&T Bank was also the fifth bank held up in the county within the last two months, according to local police officials. So far there have been no arrests. 
 On the day after the robbery at the M&T Bank it was back to business as usual with a few new wrinkles: a security guard now eyeballed customers and visitors as they entered the bank. The bank's employees, including Doreen Edwards, the branch manager, were not talking to outsiders. Inquiries about the robbery were forwarded to an executive at the bank's headquarters in Buffalo, who said that it was company policy not to comment on robberies. 
Chris Henderson, corporate security manager for M&T Bank, said with 475 branch locations through four states -- New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland andWest Virginia -- "we can't afford to put a guard at every location." In Ossining, he said, "there really wasn't a need for a security guard" until the robbery occurred, "and until the subject who committed the robbery is caught, we'll keep a guard there." 
According to a statement released by the village of Ossining Police Department, an African-American man in his 30's, between 5- foot-6 and 5-foot-10, with black, short-cropped hair and wearing a black jacket, entered the M&T Bank about 1:30 p.m. and demanded money from a teller using an unspecified threat but without displaying any weapon.
The robber took "over a thousand dollars," said Lt. William V. Sullivan, the commander of the police department's detective division. 
The cabdriver that the robber flagged down, Vanessa Fagan, a 19-year-old Peekskill resident, said she was about to stop at the McDonald's in the shopping center for a lunch break when the man politely asked her to take him to the Ossining train station. En route he changed his mind and asked to be left at the Philipse Manor train station in Sleepy Hollow.
Traveling down Route 9, Ms. Fagan noticed her passenger was "counting money with a big smile on his face," but then her radio dispatcher began asking questions over the radio about her fare,and the man, visibly upset, asked to be let out immediately on the side of the road, not far from the intersection with Route 117. "He jumped right into a snow bank," Ms. Fagan said.
On her return to Ossining a few moments later, Ms. Fagan saw in her rearview mirror that the man was walking north on Route 9, and then several police cars sped by her going south.
Somehow the bank robber disappeared. Patrol units from Ossining, Sleepy Hollow and Mount Pleasant checked residences while the police from the Metroplitan Transit Authority, the state Department of Environmental Conservation and the Harrison Police Department's K-9 unit also combed the area around Arch Hill. A police helicopter from the Westchester County Department of Public Safety joined the search. By 5 p.m. the search was called off.
Similarly, an unarmed man who robbed the Chase Manhattan Bank in Bedford on Dec. 26 also escaped on foot and was last seen walking down Route 117 toward Mount Kisco when the police lost sight of him, according to Bedford police.Two days earlier a pair of armed robbers fled from an HSBC bank branch in Yonkers, and that investigation is still open, said Detective William Maher of the Yonkers Police Department.
The police were also still looking for a pair of armed robbers who held up the Fourth Street branch of the Sound Shore Federal Savings Bank in New Rochelle on Jan. 29. Earlier that week a man, unarmed and possibly connected to another robbery in the village, had taken about $1,500 from a teller at a Fleet Bank branch in Pelham Manor.
Detective Christopher Mcalvoy of the Pelham Manor Police Department said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was helping out with the Fleet Bank robbery, but several other officials from other local police departments dealing with recent bank robberies within their jurisdictions, including Lieutenant Sullivan of Ossining, said the F.B.I. had balked at aiding investigations of bank robberies, which are considered federal offenses, if no weapon was used or seen by witnesses during the crime because of continuing anti-terrorism responsibilities.
Joseph Valiquette, an F.B.I. agent and spokesman for the New York office, said the F.B.I. gets involved with armed robberies, which include those committed using any weapon, and robberies that appear to be part of larger sprees and other out-of-state crimes.
"There are concurrent jurisdictions between the F.B.I. and local law enforcement on these crimes, so sometimes it just doesn't make sense to duplicate efforts," Mr. Valiquette said. "The No. 1 priority right now is terrorism, which has strained our resources as it is, so we're asking local law enforcement agencies to pick up more of the slack for now."
Mr. Valiquette said that there were only four armed bank robberies in Westchester and Putnam counties last year.
At the M&T Bank in Ossining, several customers leaving the bank were surprised to find that the bank had just been robbed. "But what can you expect in this economy?" said Joanne Tall, a resident. "Money gets tight and things get weird."
Anyone with information about the bank robberies can call Westchester County Crime Stoppers at (800)898-8477.

HEADLINE: Southampton College Seeks a Makeover 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON 

 BODY:
FACED with growing yearly deficits, Southampton College of Long Island University will be transformed in an effort to attract and retain a larger student body with reinvigorated, faculty-taught undergraduate programs built around a new42-credit core curriculum now being devised, university and college officials said last week.
 At the same time, the number of courses and teachers are likely to be pared down and average class size will grow. 
 "Business as usual is no longer an option," said David J. Steinberg, the president of Long Island University. "We need to make this transition, and we see ourselves as having a unique opportunity to restructure a liberal arts college for the 21st century."
Dr. Steinberg and other officials said university trustees had never seriously considered closing the college, an important cultural and economic asset on the East End. But they acknowledged that the deficits, which the university had absorbed in the past, were casting a shadow over the college, which opened in 1963. 
"I would say that we did have very serious questions about how we could continue without major changes," said Jeffrey Kane, the university vice president for academic affairs.
The point man for implementing the changes will be Daniel J. Rodas, an assistant vice president at Duke University, who was named last week as the Southampton College provost, succeeding Timothy Bishop, who resigned last year to make his successful run for Congress. The university said Dr. Rodas was an expert on finances and academic programs for private liberal arts colleges.
In a telephone interview, Dr. Rodas said he supported the concept of transformation and would seek to assure academic excellence and sound financial management at the college, but declined to discuss details of cost-saving steps he might take. "I will need to actually be there to understand more of the situation," he said.
The changes to the core curriculum and other revisions have influential backing from Robert F.X. Sillerman, an entertainment industry billionaire and the college chancellor, who, with his wife, Laura Baudo Sillerman, has given the college more than $17 million in recent years. 
Mr. Sillerman, who made his fortune buying and selling radio stations and in the music concert business, said he expected to announce within several months major new financial support for the changes. 
The nearly 1,500-student residential college, best known for its top-ranked marine sciences program, currently has 1,269 undergraduates and a deficit that has reached about $5 million a year. Its annual budget is $22 million.
Officials said they sought an additional 400 undergraduates, with an emphasis on students from New York State who are eligible for tuition assistance under a state program. "We are looking for students who can pay more of their own way," said Charles Hitchcock, the interim college dean.
About 1,160 of the current graduate and undergraduate students are New York residents, including many from western Suffolk and Nassau County, and about two-thirds of students are women. Tuition, room and board cost about $27,270. About 82 percent of Southampton students receive financial aid. Because the college has a small endowment, the scholarship money it offers comes from tuition fee reductions.
University officials said the changes would mean more classroom teaching for the college's 65 full-time faculty members, caps and adjustments in credit requirements for majors, and probable reductions in the number of majors and in the approximately 150 adjunct professors now teaching at the college.They would take effect for the freshman class entering in 2004.
The college would also seek to eliminate small upper-level classes in which only three or four students enrolled and would aim for an average class size of about 20 students. The current average is about 15. 
The core program would involve an interdisciplinary approach in which, hypothetically, "Moby-Dick" could be taught both as literature and from a marine biology perspective by different professors.
But administrators and faculty said the exact content of the curriculum and details of how it would be changed were still to be worked out. "We all realize that we are just beginning the process," said Paul Forestell, an associate professor of psychology and the chairman of the faculty council. He said the full-time faculty had voted to support the change. "We need to get into how different approaches to knowledge can inform each other in better educating students," he said.
Patrick Gunn, a representative for the adjuncts, said he saw "a philosophical shift regarding the use of us." But, he said, "If this is simply a situation of using their full-time faculty to its greatest potential, I can't find any fault with it." 
Dr. Hitchcock, the college dean, said the changes "cast our lot into transforming ourselves into a really fine small liberal arts college with particularly good marine science programs." 
In the past, he said, "we were somewhat conflicted between being a liberal arts and sciences college and a marine science college."
Marine science programs, which have produced 35 Fulbright scholars in the past 25 years, attract the largest number of undergraduates. "There is really no one ahead of us as far as small schools go," said Christopher J. Gobler, the marine science program coordinator.
Dr. Steinberg said marine science would continue to be a college cornerstone. "It is going to remain and it is vital," he said. "But it is not the be-all and end-all." 
With major campuses in Brooklyn and Brookville as well as Southampton, 31,000 students and an annual budget of $385 million, Long Island University is the seventh largest private university in the country. Dr. Steinberg said part of the financial pressure on the university was caused by cuts in education proposed by Governor Pataki to close the state budget deficit. Under the governor's proposed budget, L.I.U. would lose just under $7 million and Southampton College would lose about $480,000, the university said. 
Dr. Steinberg and other officials said the financial crunch at the college offered an opportunity for far-reaching changes in academic programs that would be impossible in older, tradition-bound colleges or large universities. 
Dr. Kane, the L.I.U. vice president and the former dean of education at the university's C.W. Post College in Brookville, said officials studied core curricula across the country to arrive at a framework for one at Southampton that would stress interdisciplinary study to produce literate students versed in arts and sciences and ready both for the job market and to act as global citizens.
"What we think we can do is provide students not only with the skills they need to get out in the marketplace, but with a higher sense of direction in their own lives," he said. "And in the end students not only want that, they yearn for it."
Mr. Sillerman, the Southampton chancellor, said he had been the impetus for the changes at the college. "It needed to be transformed and it is going to be transformed," he said. He said within six months he hoped to announce investments in the college for a student center, dorms, classrooms and the hiring of new faculty members. 
College officials acknowledged the central role played by Mr. Sillerman, whose post as chancellor is largely honorary but whose largess lends considerable weight to his opinions.
Dr. Steinberg said he and other college officials were actively seeking to raise financial support for the college and were depending on Mr. Sillerman for help. A professional fundraiser, Barbara Grodd, starts work this month.

Rolling With 'Better for You' Food Bandwagon

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
AMERICANS may be paying more attention to nutrition, but they still reach for plenty of processed foods at the market. One byproduct of this paradox is the popularity of so-called "better for you" foods, which mimic the taste of conventional snacks and other packaged foods but lack the customary preservatives, additives, cholesterol and sugar. 
 Perhaps no one has catered to America's contradictory appetites as successfully as Irwin D. Simon. A former sales and marketing executive at both Haagen-Dazs and SlimFast, Mr. Simon has spent the last decade cobbling together more than two dozen natural and organic food companies into the Hain Celestial Group in Melville. Revenues at Hain, perhaps best known for its Celestial Seasonings herbal teas and its Terra Chips line of vegetable chips, approached $400 million last year. 
 In December, Hain Celestial spent $52 million to buy Imagine Foods, an organic-food company that specializes in soy-milk and rice-milk products. Hain was already the world's largest producer of natural foods, an industry term for those made without additives or artificial ingredients. After the Imagine Foods deal, it also became the world's largest producer of organic foods, the term usually used for foods grown without pesticides. 
Mr. Simon, who is from Nova Scotia, founded Hain Celestial's predecessor, Kineret Foods, 10 years ago. While he does not describe himself as a health-food fan, he recalls having grown disenchanted with the products and values of corporate America. 
He believed there was a growing mass market for healthier foods. "I decided after leaving SlimFast to set up my own food company and build up from there," said Mr. Simon, who is Hain's president as well as its chairman and chief executive.
In 1993, he founded Kineret, a kosher frozen-food company in Jericho. In its first year Kineret offered its stock to the public, raising about $3 million, Mr. Simon said, and that financed a series of acquisitions that brought in Farm Foods, Pizsoy and Hain Pure Foods. 
Mr. Simon acknowledged one inherent contradiction in using a kosher food company to build a "better for you" food empire: kosher food, while it is often perceived as being healthful, is not necessarily low in fat. "A lot of kosher food is fried in the highest fat content going," he said. "But people think of kosher food as safe, and we built on that perception."
Following the Hain acquisition, Mr. Simon changed Kineret's name to Hain Pure Foods, to better reflect its business focus. Using revenues from operations to finance further acquisitions, he picked up small but growing brands like Health Valley, which makes organic soups, snack bars, cereals and cookies; Earth's Best, which makes organic baby foods; and Garden of Eatin', which makes organic snacks.
In 2000, Hain bought Celestial Seasonings, the herbal tea company, for about $390 million and renamed itself again. In 2001, it acquired Yves Veggie Cuisine, a Canadian producer of soy-based burgers and cheese alternatives, and Lima, a Belgian natural and organic food concern, expanding its presence in Europe.
In his acquisitions, Mr. Simon said in an interview at Hain headquarters near the Long Island Expressway, he focused on brands with the potential for faster growth. "I look for four things in a brand," he said, warming to his subject. "First is a great product. Second, it must be great-tasting. Third, it has to have a reason for being. Fourth, it has to have nutritional value." 
People in the food business say that Mr. Simon is a principal player in the industry's fastest-growing category, natural and organic foods. "He is clearly one of the leaders in the industry," said David Seckman, the executive director of the Natural Nutritional Foods Association in Newport Beach, Calif. "In fact, he may be the industry's leader at this point."
That industry has enjoyed rapid growth over the last decade, due to social trends and in no small degree to the business skills of people like Mr. Simon. In 1992, when he started his own company, the natural and organic food market was a $4.2 billion a year. Now, 10 years later, the market has tripled to $13.5 billion, according to Patrick Rae, the publisher of Nutrition Business Journal in San Diego.
Mr. Seckman credited Mr. Simon and Hain Celestial, which is a member of his trade group, with playing a major role in standardizing the definitions of terms like "natural," "organic" and even "dietetic." The definitions, previously a mishmash of rules handled state by state, were streamlined last year by the Department of Agriculture, but they have recently been the target of political efforts to weaken them. 
Mr. Seckman said that Mr. Simon was also leading the industry's effort to strengthen the laws governing packaging claims and nutrition disclosures. 
"Hain voluntarily adopted the toughest standards ahead of the new Federal labeling requirements in 1994," he said. "Irwin has spearheaded our efforts to develop higher standards across the industry."
Natural and organic foods occupy account for less than 3 percent of the $480 billion American food market, but the combined category grew at nearly 5 percent in 2001, the last year for which data is available, Mr. Seckman said. Both categories are expected to accelerate through at least 2005, he added, growing as much as 10 percent annually.
If organic foods are broken out as a separate category, the growth rate approaches 24 percent, according to the Organic Trade Association in Greenfield, Mass. 
While many chain supermarkets now stock organic and natural products, most sales are still made by independently operated health-food stores and by specialty chains like Wild Oats, Fairway and Wild by Nature. About two-thirds of Hain's sales last year came from health-food and specialty stores, and the remaining third from traditional supermarkets.
"Although Hain Celestial Group is not yet well known to the average supermarket shopper, its portfolio of 'better for you' brands is well known to health-food store buyers," John M. McMillin, a financial analyst at Prudential Financial in New York, wrote in a December report. 
Mr. Simon is pushing for more supermarket sales. "One of our goals is to sell more of our brands from the traditional supermarkets and grocery stores," he said.
Howard Glickberg, an owner of Fairway, which has two specialty food stores in Manhattan and one in Plainview, said that Mr. Simon had imposed a corporate approach on what had been a homespun way of operating.
"Most of the companies that Irwin purchased were mom-and-pop companies," Mr. Glickberg said. "Irwin brought them professionalism. He brought these products into mainstream America."

The U.S.O.C. Wanted Class. What It Got Was Crass.

BYLINE:  By SELENA ROBERTS 

 BODY:
THERE were no aerial views of Lloyd Ward's Florida home on the tube, but plenty of politicians looking down at his personal excesses. 
 There were no stockholders to betray, just Olympic sponsors who wondered if Ward was keeping the books or if the books were keeping him. 
 There were no endearing nicknames like Kenny Boy, only staffers who privately called Ward "H.A.M." for the cavity-causing "hearts and minds" speech he delivered at every banquet stop.
Drawn to scale, Ward was not Kenneth L. Lay or L. Dennis Kozlowski during his 16 months as the head of the United States Olympic Committee, but a Mini-Me entrant into America's exclusive club of tainted chief executives. 
Until his resignation yesterday, Ward reflected the C.E.O. culture he came of age in by leaning on his charismatic image as a substitute for substance, by offering up fortune-cookie phrases instead of hard truths about the future.
And that is exactly why he was hired. As easy as it is to dissect Ward's flaws -- like his complete lack of self-awareness while his every folly played out in public -- it is more constructive to understand why the U.S.O.C. board fell for him in the first place. 
Ward was the trophy date of the U.S.O.C., which was desperate for validation and insecure about its identity. He may have been a failure as the grand wizard at Maytag, but he was its vision of corporate success, entering his interviews wearing tailored suits and a gold watch with a diamond at 12 o'clock.
Everything he said was silk. Sitting on a couch in his office just weeks after his hire, Ward was at his polished best when discussing the personal epiphany that led him to Colorado Springs.
"I'm here because I've chosen to be here," Ward said earnestly. "I had other alternatives. If I were not in the stage of my life where I wanted to make a difference more than I wanted to make money, I wouldn't be here. It's about what's significant."
You could eat that up with a spoon, right? But on the night the Olympic committee announced it had selected Ward after an interview process that played out like a beauty pageant, there was a mysterious delay in the celebration. 
What was the holdup? About $50,000. Although the advertised salary for the job was $500,000, Ward squeezed another $50,000 out of the suddenly nervous leaders before he would say yes.
No price was too high to give the joint a little class. And this is what the committee members wanted. To them, it was only a matter of time before Ward would turn the heads of sponsors as he created the brand identity the committee craved. 
And, unfortunately, he succeeded. After months of turmoil on Ward's watch, after extravagant severance packages and allegations of nepotism, after senatorial sleuthing and suspect expense reports, the Olympic committee is recognized in every home in the nation. So is Enron, so is Tyco, so is WorldCom.
And as in each case, the chief offers up a "who me?" response. "Clearly, competing interests within the U.S.O.C. have placed its C.E.O.'s in an untenable, if not impossible, role," Ward said, playing the victim in his farewell statement. "My hope is that the governance structure at the U.S.O.C. be clarified at an early date to eliminate the backbiting we who have been C.E.O. have endured."
Ward does have a point. The U.S.O.C. is full of smiling assassins. But what the Olympic committee must do upon restructuring is to eliminate its starry-eyed approach to filling its top-paying job.
"We cannot foul up again," one Olympic committee executive said. "We have to think in terms of a sports person, not a corporate bigwig with tons of conflicts." 
But in the absence of common sense, names like Donald Fehr and George Steinbrenner have emerged as dream candidates. While Fehr may be deft in economic maneuvers in his role as baseball's union boss, how can a leader who has obstructed drug testing for players have credibility in an Olympic movement that prohibits cough syrup? 
While Steinbrenner understands the machinations of the Olympic committee as a former board member, and is synonymous with winning, imagine how sticky his YES network ties might be when television deals come up for renewal? 
Please, no big names need apply. Even in a trimmed down form, the Olympic committee, by its very volunteerism nature, is too petty to provide room for an ego larger than an eraser.
It needs someone who is down to earth, steady and businesslike. Before Ward and after Norm Blake, another corporate marquee decision gone wrong, the Olympic committee had its answer: Scott Blackmun. 
Over the past four years, the only time there has been peace within the organization was when Blackmun quietly steered the group during his stint as the interim chief. He was pushed aside in the Beatlemania over Ward, pushed all the way to Los Angeles, where he works now. 
Blackmun is happy, probably too happy to think of a return. But he should be the prototype chief for the Olympic committee. He is not sensational, just sensible. Just what the U.S.O.C. needs.

Smaller and Faster Emerges Victorious

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
ROY JONES Jr. answered questions that have formed the basis of competition for centuries, from playgrounds to formal fields of competition.
 Can a great little man defeat a good big man. Can speed defeat power and size? 
 Well, yes -- if the fighter is Roy Jones. 
Jones, the onetime middlweight and current light-heavyweight champion, took away John Ruiz's heavyweight championship last night with a unanimous 12-round decision. The fight proved once again, as these sort of championship matches often do, that some things can't be measured by scales and yardsticks: talent, heart, drive. 
One thing that can be measured, speed, was something Jones had in abundance. He was faster, quicker and, maybe not so surprisingly for those who have followed his career, more powerful than Ruiz, who was about 25 pounds heavier.
But there was a greater significance to this fight. This was a victory for a beleaguered sport. The two fighters are highly respected by their peers for their demeanor inside and outside the ring. Ruiz coaches youth football back home in Chelsea. Mass. Jones is respected as a great fighter, a hard worker and an outstanding businessman.
A similar story played out nearly 106 years ago in the Nevada mining town of Carson City, when the middleweight champion Robert Fitzsimmons moved up in class to defeat Jim Corbett for the heavyweight championship of the world.
The world seemed larger in 1897, more mysterious and scary than now, when we're connected by jets and the Internet. But this much is still true, about boxing and life: You can run, but you can't hide. Boxing can never run too far from its roots and we can never run too far from boxing. Last night's fight was larger than Jones or Ruiz; the sport had come full circle.
When Fitzsimmons took on Corbett, prizefighting was a wandering orphan, banned nearly everywhere. The sport found a home in Carson City. Why is this city so crucial to the history of a sport that occupies a puzzling -- often troubling -- place in our history?
On Friday, I followed the truth where it led, through mountains and valleys, along winding roads to northern Nevada. To Pratt and Musser Streets in Carson City, where Gentleman Jim and Ruby Bob fought a championship bout that lasted 14 rounds. The site is marked by a silver plaque set on a six-foot-high frame in the shape of Nevada and describes how in 1897 prizefighting, disdained in many other states, had recently been made legal in Nevada. 
This was where boxing went from being illegal to being a legitimate sport.
Why Nevada? Why did the State Legislature ignore an outcry from Carson City natives and vote to play host to the fight? Over lunch in Reno on Friday, Phillip Earl, curator emeritus of history at the Nevada Historical Society, gave a one-word answer: corruption.
Since the discovery of the Comstock Lode in 1859, Nevada's mining cycle has been a succession of booms and busts. The Corbett-Fitzsimmons fight was brought to Nevada during one of those downward fluctuations. The state needed something, anything, to pull itself out of a bad economic climate.
In 1897, the Nevada Legislature answered the acting Gov. Reinhold Sadler's request for additional revenue measures by passing a bill to license prizefights. The legislation called for a licensing fee of $1,000, with one-tenth going to the county where the fight was held and nine-tenths to the state's general fund. The fight was Nevada's first attempt to attract the tourist dollar. 
"Fights are illegal, but we could make it legal in Nevada, make some money," said Guy Rocha, archivist of the Nevada State Library and Archives in Carson City. "Nevada began looking at what the rest of the nation didn't do, and we decided we'd do it."
On March 17, 1897, 6,000 fans braved a cold, blustery day to watch the Corbett-Fitzsimmons fight. The attendance was twice the population of Carson City but far below what promoters had hoped.
Those who attended saw a classic match that ended early in the 14th round. Fitzsimmons floored the champion with a devastating combination: he dug a left hand deep in Corbett's stomach -- the infamous solar plexus punch -- and a left hook to Corbett's jaw. The champion tried to pull himself up, but slid back down and was counted out.
Prizefighting had proved its worth as a promotional scheme. Nevada, though not Carson City, was on its way to becoming the boxing capital of the world. Carson City never held another significant fight, but significant fights with national implications were staged in Goldsfield, Tonopah and Reno. The legacy continued here last night, with Jones's victory. 
When Fitzsimmons and Corbett met in 1897, boxing was emerging as a sport. Now, boxing is a $500 million-a-year business, with a mixed history of scandals, misbehavior and great performances.
But from Corbett and Fitzsimmons, Ruiz and Jones, one truth remains standing: you can run, but you can't hide.

HEADLINE: Looking for a Leader, Casting a Wide Net 

BYLINE:  By BRIAN WISE 

 BODY:
IT has been just over two years since Zdenek Macal announced that the 2001-02 season would be his last as music director of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. Officials with the orchestra say they are still not close to naming his successor, and the announcement of the 2003-04 season suggests that they are significantly widening their search.
 Sixteen guest conductors are slated to join the orchestra next season, four in return engagements. Because most orchestras undergo searches for new conductors by trying out candidates, any of these guests could be considered contenders. 
 Lawrence Tamburri, the orchestra's executive director, declined to comment on whether there have been any formal discussions with candidates. But he said this was an "artistic leadership search," which meant, he said, that the orchestra may structure the job differently than it has in the past.
For example, he said, the orchestra might hire one conductor as music director to focus on the artistic aspects of the job, and hire another in an associate role to handle more of the fund-raising and educational programs. This is a rare, but not unheard-of, practice; the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra has this sort of leadership structure.
"We're interested in being somewhat flexible," Mr. Tamburri said.
The returning guest conductors are Miguel Harth-Bedoya, from Peru; Marco Parisotto of Canada; the Austrian Carlos Kalmar, and an American, Lawrence Foster. Mr. Kalmar is not in the running for the job because he was just named music director of the Oregon Symphony in Portland. He joins the New Jersey orchestra this week for three concerts, beginning on Thursday. 
The newcomers include the Hungarian conductor Gilbert Vaga; an American, Jeffrey Kahane; a Russian, Yakov Kreizberg; two English conductors, Nicholas McGegan and Jane Glover; three Germans, Stefan Sanderling, Bernhard Klee and Cornelius Eberhardt; and the Estonian father-and-son pair of Neeme Jarvi and Kristjan Jarvi.
The orchestra, with over 70 players, is New Jersey's largest classical ensemble. It logged a $1.1 million deficit last year and is fighting one this season, the result of decreased ticket sales and fund-raising revenue in a sluggish economy.
But musicians and orchestra administrators generally consider it one of the best-managed and artistically robust orchestras in the United States. It enjoys a gleaming concert hall at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, and it has a distinct advantage over other similar-sized ensembles because of its proximity to New York and the musical talent the city has to offer.
The orchestra's cachet increased last month when it made an $18 million purchase of 30 rare 18th-century string instruments, including ones made by Stradivarius, Guarneri del Gesu and other famous artisans, for its members to play. The unusual acquisition, from the New Jersey philanthropist Herbert Axelrod, came after a year of negotiation. Mr. Tamburri believes it will be a powerful draw for potential candidates.
"The conductors all know about this," he said. "They all talk about it." 
Few of the guest conductors are American. Although many critics argue that American orchestras should make an effort to use native talent, Mr. Tamburri said that he did not agree, and that there was a deeper pool overseas.
"The real issue is in America we don't have a good training system for conductors," Mr. Tamburri said. "All over Europe, there are opportunities for people to really learn the craft of conducting. In the United States, we have the conservatories, workshops, and assistant conductors. That's not best for teaching people to be conductors." Mr. Tamburri added that hands-on training was best.
Mr. Tamburri dismissed the notion that European conductors govern more autocratically, while shirking aspects of the job like educational outreach and fund-raising.
"In America, conductors need to help fund-raising," he said. "European orchestras are funded through the government, which has its own set of issues. We want our conductors to be more public figures."
An authoritarian figure might not be a logical match for an orchestra known for encouraging its musicians to take a role in artistic and managerial matters.
Since Mr. Macal departed in 2001, except for periodic conducting stints as music director emeritus, the musicians have had a greater say in artistic matters. This is evident in the opening subscription concerts for next season, which feature three members of the orchestra as concerto soloists. And instead of hiring an artistic consultant as many orchestras do between music directors, the group has used a committee of three musicians and two staff members to shape its seasons.
Of the new guests scheduled for next season, two in particular might make interesting choices.
Ms. Glover has established her credentials largely in opera and early music and so would be an unconventional choice to lead a large, traditional symphony orchestra. At 29, the younger Mr. Jarvi is the youngest candidate, with the most unlikely background. He is conductor of the Absolute Ensemble in New York City, which is dedicated to contemporary music and to blurring the boundaries between classical, jazz and rock music. Most members of the group are in their 20's and 30's, and favor downtown black or leather trousers over tuxedos when dressing for a performance. 
But most of the focus next season will be on the returning conductors.
At age 34, Mr. Harth-Bedoya has earned degrees in conducting from the Juilliard School and the Curtis Institute of Music. Currently music director of the Fort Worth Symphony and associate conductor at the Los Angeles Philharmonic, he made a debut here in late January with an adventurous program of works by Prokofiev, Christopher Rouse and the New Jersey composer Robert Aldridge, which was well reviewed in local papers. 
He returns in September to conduct the orchestra's opening gala along with the first set of subscription concerts. Of all the candidates, Mr. Harth-Bedoya has been generating the most advance talk among managers of artists in the metropolitan area.
Mr. Parisotto is 39. Currently music director of the Oshawa-Durham Symphony in Canada and the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, he gave intelligent, energetic performances, according to the local press, in his prior engagements here. His musical tastes also mesh nicely with the orchestra's strengths in Russian and German Romantic repertoire. Yet while he has appeared on podiums throughout Canada and Europe, he is still relatively unknown in the United States.
Mr. Foster, 66, is a frequent guest of the orchestra. He appears in March 2004 with a program of Haydn, Mozart and Elgar. His selection would at least nominally address complaints about the dearth of American conductors holding major posts in this country. But his resume includes posts at the Barcelona Symphony and Jerusalem Symphony Orchestras. 
The only other American guest conductor to appear next season is the West Coast-based Mr. Kahane, who is music director of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and is equally known as a concert pianist. He is a long shot at best because he is not that visible on the East Coast.
Mr. Tamburri said a decision should be made by spring of next year. In the meantime, audiences can look forward to performances led by widely different personalities.

HEADLINE: A High-Stakes Gamble In a State Known for Sprawl 

BYLINE:  By JEREMY PEARCE 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY seems to be full of color these days green, red, yellow and blue -- in a drizzle-painting work in progress that is more Jackson Pollock than Picasso. Newark, Trenton and Camden sit in islands of green as a red sea washes over the state.
But the picture is far from abstract. With record speed, and in response to Governor McGreevey's vow to tether sprawl once and for all, state officials are sketching the first comprehensive map to regulate development statewide, with the potential to jostle a construction juggernaut worth $14.2 billion annually.
"This is a chess game by the state," said one leading environmentalist, "and it is an impressively gutsy move." 
Yet the governor's ambitious plan to direct -- or as some contend, micromanage -- future development has jarred the state's long-sacred tradition of home rule and provoked a legion of critics.
"They have caused total confusion in this state," declared Joanne Harkins, director of land use and planning for the New Jersey Builders Association. 
In reality, Mr. McGreevey has chosen the very best and worst of times to rattle the game board. With last year's drought not too distant a memory, some residents may be more inclined to value water supplies and open horizons. At the same time, a move to rein in development in a period of economic recession and a $5-billion state budget deficit holds its own dangers. Many towns have become not-so-silent partners in the growth constituency -- in lean years, especially, they favor development and its tax revenue, which support undernourished schools and services.
Builders and activists, urban planners or small-town mayors -- few parties play down what is at stake in a map that would direct growth in New Jersey -- already the nation's most densely populated state.
"This has the potential for more adverse impact than any issue I've seen in 30 years," said William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, a nonprofit organization for the state's 566 communities.
Under the Governor's plan, to be submitted for public comment this week, the mostly urban green zones would be opened to speedier review and in some cases less stringent standards for environmental permits. In the red zones, which cover two-thirds of the state, permits for water and rules against disturbing fragile species would be more closely enforced in a novel attempt to bring environmental regulations to bear on wider land use.
In anticipation of the map -- on track to befinalized in April -- questioners have begun to gather: landowners, planners, developers, local and county officials, and, of course, lawyers representing all sides.
"The ultimate message that the governor is sending is still not clear to us," said Mr. Dressel. "If it's going to become regulation from the top down, then we're going to have a major problem."
A Matter of Location
Praise -- or problems -- are tied to location, location and location. Colors on the map bled markedly in recent weeks as officials in the state Department of Environmental Protection responded to lobbying from landowners and tips from mayors about apparent inaccuracies. Last week, Bradley M. Campbell, the state environmental commissioner who is largely seen to be the map's architect, acknowledged that it had been undergoing "constant refinements" and that regulatory changes behind the map were still in play.
In Ocean County, for example, Mayor Carl W. Block of Stafford spotted an inconsistency. "I noticed that some of the red area is already under our Wal-Mart," said Mr. Block. "There are a lot of assumptions that have been built into this."
In Union County, Elizabeth -- the state's fourth-largest city with a population of 120,000 -- has been placed in a green zone, a decision welcomed by Mayor J. Christian Bollwage. The city contains more than 50 brownfield sites, but has managed to redevelop only 6 of them in recent years. Mr. Bollwage said he believed the map would help urban renewal in once-industrial cities "as a starting point in the evolution toward smart growth."
And in Plainsboro, a Middlesex County suburb of Princeton, the map met a mixed reception. The town has been placed in red and yellow zones, the latter color designating areas that are not likely to be affected by stricter state regulation, but would continue to be subject to existing local zoning laws. A fourth color on the map, blue, is used across the state to depict surface waters. 
Mayor Peter A. Cantu said there needed to be a broad municipal review -- called cross-acceptance, in planning terms -- before any map is adopted, although he suspected that it did not go far enough.
"Frankly, I view this as a beginning point and not as an ending," Mr. Cantu said.
To that last point, Mr. Campbell, who has earned a reputation as a well-informed maverick in the course of navigating other issues, has been blunt in his agreement.
"It's an interesting and complex set of policy problems," said the commissioner. "If the red-yellow-green light moniker is catchy and useful at one level, it is slightly misleading, in the sense that we're still going to enforce standards and protections in green-light areas."
He continued: "And we don't have authority to absolutely shut down development in red-light areas. It's really a matter of having a more nuanced and tailored approach to regulation in those areas."
The heart of the map -- known officially as the Blueprint for Intelligent Growth -- would be a series of revisions and implementations of state environmental regulations. Mr. Campbell and his staff have looked at amending rules concerning freshwater wetlands, flood hazards, water allocations for towns and developments, building near streams and the discharge of wastewater and storm overflows, among other issues. In addition, the commissioner said he hoped to adopt regulations that would for the first time apply state laws passed to safeguard threatened and endangered species.
Most of the precise regulatory changes have not been spelled out, leaving the impression of a work much in progress and raising the volume of questions from critics.
"We're kicking around ideas," said Jeanne M. Herb, director of the environmental department's office of policy and planning. "There are still so many 'it depends."'. 
Focusing in public on the carrot and not the stick, Mr. Campbell has instead been selling the idea of a fairer and more rational process for developers, particularly in the green zones highlighted for the new approach, about one-fifth of the state.
"What many people miss is that this is an effort to make likely regulatory outcomes transparent and predictable," he said. "For every developer, time is money. If we can assure them a quicker decision time in the right areas, I think we will be effective in attracting greater investment."
But Ms. Harkins said she had yet to be convinced, and cited Mr. McGreevey's State of the State address on Jan. 14--in which the governor delivered a manifesto against sprawl in his most unvarnished language to date -- as a misguided swipe against the industry.
"There is nothing to compel anybody to do anything in the so-called growth areas," she said, "and we've heard about streamlining permits through the past four administrations. It has never reached the table."
Even so, others with vested interests are more receptive, if also guarded. Joseph F. Riggs, Northeast region president for K. Hovnanian Companies, which built 1,600 houses in the state last year, said the map held promise.
"I think you will see more and more focus from companies like our own on urban locations," said Mr. Riggs. But if too much of the map turns out to be red, he added, a decline in construction would "cause stagnation and budget deficits that will make the current deficits look small."
Other critics point out that New Jersey already has a state plan, a 359-page document with its own highly detailed map. The plan sets guidelines for everything from affordable housing to sewer services, and even identifies cities and towns selected as suitable for more intensive growth. After six years of exchanges between local, state and county planners and politicians, it was adopted in 1992 and revised only two years ago.
Although gilded by the stamp of consensus, the State Development and Redevelopment Plan remains largely a statement of philosophy--influential, to be sure, but not binding.
"It was meant as a real planning document, but the impact of the mayors and developers has always watered it down," observed Dr. Norman J. Glickman, an urban economist at Rutgers. "In light of the current economy, the disregard for the plan is certain to continue, and will probably get worse."
Another academic, Dr. Robert W. Burchell, who is co-director of Rutgers' Center for Urban Policy Research, agreed the state plan "has been a very contentious document, from a property rights perspective."
But Dr. Burchell said the creation of the environmental map would probably cause further friction as town officials and planners try to determine which map should take precedence.
"This is a go-for-the-throat move by the McGreevey administration, and those moves have extraordinary risks," he said. "If it works, then we've made a great leap forward in planning. But there is no doubt that lawsuits will be brought over this map."
For his part, Mr. Campbell has been careful to tone down any impression that the new map is destined to supercede the state plan and overturn assumptions on which towns and builders have depended.
The point of politics is not trivial. In truth, the environmental map would be adopted rapidly by an order of the commissionerhimself and after a 60-day comment period -- as opposed to the years of public wrangling and review that forged the state plan.
The commissioner put it this way: "The areas of conflict tend to be at the retail rather than the wholesale level. As we go to the higher levels of refinement of the map, it becomes a closer approximation of the state plan. But there are some areas where we are still analyzing."
Still, it is a sticking point that questioners repeatedly raise.
"Is the map going to be reasonable or arbitrary?" asked Robert S. Greenbaum, a Woodbridge real estate attorney who has represented developers. "Are we ultimately facing a takings issue?"
Mr, Greenbaum added: "We only know what the governor and commissioner are telling us. The words sound wonderful, but the changes are going to be monumental."
All parties note the uncharacteristic speed with which the environmental map is advancing. The first draft was released on Jan. 16, followed by revisions late last month, well on schedule to be proposed for acceptance by Mr. Campbell near a target date of April 22, on Earth Day. In large part, it may be an efficiency forged by by desperation. The McGreevey administration -- faced with a shocking budget shortfall and a handful politically embarrassing appointments and missteps -- is trying to redefine itself with a single bold stroke.
Certainly, the machinery of change is quietly being rolled into place. In January, the State Planning Commission published a notice that it might temporarily suspend its rules and "initiate one or more substantial amendments to the State Plan Policy Map."
Asked if the notice presaged a merger with the proposed environmental map, Timothy J. Touhey, the commission's chairman, said, "It could be, yes."
Mr. Touhey, who was appointed to the planning commission last year, added that a single map was the goal for all of the state agencies involved, and was intended to benefit both the regulators and the regulated.
"We're trying to give this some teeth," he said. "You can't please everybody. But at the end of the day, it's going to give us all some predictability. We have the plan. Now, we need the implementation."
There are other rumblings of change. Mr. McGreevey and his administration are at work on a package of legislative bills, said to be the distillation of the anti-sprawl language used in his State of the State speech earlier this year.
Susan Bass Levin, commissioner of the state Department of Community Affairs, said the bills would augment some separate measures already proposed in the state Legislature, intended to amend municipal land use laws.
"Our goal is really to close loopholes in laws that have been slanted to lean toward the developers," Ms. Levin said.
Among the proposals are ordinances that would enable towns to table decisions on development for up to one year, to assess fees on developers to pay for local services, and to extend requirements for public notice in announcing new building projects. Ms. Levin, a former mayor of Cherry Hill, said other proposals discussed included the opening of forums to mediate in border disputes between towns and to direct town planners to prepare a formal analysis of likely future growth.
The commissioner added that the bills were scheduled for introduction in the state Legislature in April, although she declined to identify their sponsors. "This is a work in quick progress," she said.
Barbara L. Lawrence, executive director of New Jersey Future, a nonprofit planning organization, examined the bill proposals and has pronounced them worthwhile. 
"I expect we'll see support from mayors like we have never seen before," Ms. Lawrence said.
Yet as encouraging as she finds them, Ms. Lawrence said she also believed the McGreevey administration was approaching a potential pitfall."The map has gotten everyone's attention," she said. "That's good. But there's so much more to smart growth than the affairs of any one agency. Whether it's the department for environment, transportation or community affairs, no single agency has this total agenda."
As a result, Ms. Lawrence has been lobbying for a cabinet position -- and possibly a distinct department, to bolster the departmental Office of Smart Growth -- to push sprawl programs and "pull together this comprehensive agenda to stop growth in the wrong places and start it in the right places." 
The Hot New Color: Red
Last week, colors on the environmental map drifted in places, mostly from red to green and yellow. Regardless, the state's Highlands region -- identified as a crucial area for animals and reservoirs -- remained overwhelmingly red and yellow. The Pinelands region, colored gray in the first version and protected under its own management plan, suddenly also became red, as state officials continued to revise. In addition, most agricultural lands were placed in the red. And predictably, the major urban centers of Newark, Camden and Trenton stayed green.
In all, the most recent figures suggest that 65 percent of the state will be in red zones; 22 percent in green zones; and the remaining 13 percent in yellow zones.
"When finished, this will be the first time the state plan has borne out its promise," said Tim Dillingham, a former director of the Sierra Club's state chapter and currently assistant director of the American Littoral Society, a coastal environmental group.
"In the past, we had the plan and state agencies often chose not to use it in their decision-making," said Mr. Dillingham. "We are now talking about a sea change in the way we manage growth."
Matt Sprung, a residential developer and vice chairman of the Morris County Planning Board, acknowledged the moment in history, though he said he sensed that the stride toward centralized planning would in the main eclipse the rights of residents.
"Who are these people? Mr. Sprung asked. "There has been no public input, no municipal input."
Mr. Sprung paused, then continued: "They are going to make river ecology more important than the housing of people. The fact is that there are still people who are going to live outside of highly congested areas. This is an attack on that way of life."
In working out the details, Mr. Campbell said that he did not think the map would require a tide of new personnel or budget appropriations, although he did hedge his statement, saying "It's evolving." 
"There are two weaknesses," he went on. "One is that New Jersey has a very procedurally burdensome regulatory process. A second weakness is that the data is never perfect."
 That said, he added, "We're just trying to implement the authority and mandate that we already have."

HEADLINE: THE WHEEL/2004 Infiniti FX45; 
The Shape of Things to Come

BYLINE:  By DAN NEIL 

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C. 

 BODY:
"PLATFORM engineering" insert yawn here -- is an auto industry term of art for sharing major substructures and systems among different vehicles, and even among different brands. The Lincoln LS, Jaguar S-Type and Ford Thunderbird all have the same basic Ford Motor Company anatomy, for instance.
 As bland as the term sounds, carmakers shy away from it, for it conveys a hint of on-the-cheap expedience and mix-and-match design. Yet Nissan is on the verge of raising platform engineering to an art form. Five vehicles are based on the company's FM architecture, an abbreviation for the engine's front-mid position: the Nissan 350ZX sports car and Murano "crossover" wagon, the G35 sedan and coupe from the Infiniti luxury division, and now the FX45, which you could safely call a crossover something. 
 Each of these is a force to reckon with. (The G35 twins were Motor Trend's Car of the Year, and both the G35 and 350Z were runners-up for North American Car of the Year.) Taken together as a portfolio of Nissan's recent work, the FM cars are a tour de force of artful engineering and distinctive styling that reorganizes the same handful of ingredients in novel, even brilliant ways, without obvious compromise. This isn't cut-and-paste platform sharing; it is more like Bach's "Goldberg" Variations. 
With the FX45, Infiniti has managed to whip up what may well be the Next Big Thing: the high-performance crossover S.U.V. The recipe begins with all-wheel drive, high seating positions, room for five, luxury refinements, a sport-tuned suspension and big engines and wheels. Then the whole thing is stirred with a silver spoon.
Several other GT-flavored wagons are coming in the $40,000 to $55,000 range. The Cadillac SRX, due this summer, uses the
architecture of the next-generation STS, which replaces the Seville. The Audi Pikes Peak, a design study making the rounds of auto shows this year, is based on the Volkswagen Touareg utility. Even Maserati (read that: Ferrari) is contemplating an entry based on its Kubang GT concept wagon.
Lording over the segment is the Porsche Cayenne, another cousin of the Touareg. But Infiniti manages to steal Porsche's thunder. Compared with the Cayenne S, the FX45 is nearly a second faster to 60 miles an hour (6.3 seconds, according to Car and Driver magazine, compared with 7.2 for the Cayenne S) and a quarter-ton lighter. At $44,770, the FX45 is about $12,000 cheaper. Sure, the 450-horsepower Cayenne Turbo is faster (5.6 seconds to 60 m.p.h.) but it costs $90,000 and change.
Aesthetically, I'd say the FX blows the Cayenne's doors off. The Porsche design is squarish and dull; the Infiniti ripples with the muscular tension and latent energy of anarcher's arm holding back an arrow. The grille looks like the business end of a Remington shaver. The roofline is low and the greenhouse is raked, with blacked-out door pillars. The car has a squint so menacing it looks as if it is going to light up a cheroot, a la Clint Eastwood.
Nissan says the FX45 has the ready-to-pounce look of a "bionic cheetah." O.K. Sure. Whatever.
Like the eyes of a cheetah, the shape of the car is limned and accented with exaggerating black trim, particularly wheel wells that seem barely able to contain the colossal 20-inch wheels and tires.
This profligate use of alloy and rubber is what makes the FX45 look as if it just drove off the turnstile at an auto show. Mechanically, the big wheels and tires mean the suspension can be shorter and stiffer while still affording adequate ground clearance of 7.6 inches. And there is plenty of room behind the wheels for the biggest brakes on Nissan's shelf. 
Primarily, the big wheels and tires grip tenaciously. This thing blithely rips around curves that would leave other sport wagons skittering into the ditch. The steering has the pinpoint accuracy of the Hubble telescope. The rigid chassis, buckled to stiff springs and shocks and laced with antiroll bars, remains flat and unfazed in cornering transitions that would baffle a rodeo barrel racer. The brakes are amazing.
In its innate athleticism, the FX reminds me of a BMW. Not the X5 utility so much as the 3 Series sedan.
Appropriate to its high-end airs, the FX45 has electronic enhancements like four-wheel antilock brakes and brake-force distribution (which monitors the car's load and adjusts the brake pressure accordingly), as well as four-wheel traction control and dynamic stability control, which brakes the wheels selectively to help keep the FX pointing where the driver aims it.
Among the gee-whiz options offered are a rear-view camera (the high-zoot styling limits the rear sight lines); a laser-based "intelligent" cruise control that maintains a safe distance behind the car you are trailing; something called Brake Assist With Preview, which uses the cruise control's lasers to detect an impending obstacle, then pre-pressurizes the brakes for an emergency stop; and a remote starting feature on the key fob -- perfect for these recent frosty mornings.
Powering it all is the 4.5-liter V-8 from the Q45, Infiniti's flagship. It has dual overhead cams and variable valve timing, and in the FX45 it produces a throaty 315 horsepower and 329 pounds-feet of torque. A $37,000 model, the FX35, comes with the 3.5-liter, 280-horsepower V-6 that is the backbone of Nissan's engine lineup. Both models send torque to the clutch-based all-wheel-drive system through the same five-speed automatic transmission. The FX35 also comes with rear drive only.
Given the unusually miserable Southern weather of recent weeks, I tested the FX45 on ice and slush. I expected the high-speed tires to whirr fecklessly, but they kept their grip thanks both to their circumference and to the pliant all-wheel-drive system with its electronic aids.
Nissan and Infiniti have created their own interior-design identity with brushed-aluminum central consoles, thick three-spoke steering wheels and three-gauge instrument clusters. The same window and mirror switches, monochrome display screen, stereo and climate system are used in all the FM cars. Yet when you compare the interiors, each has a distinct mood. The cabin of my FX45 test car was trimmed in audacious orange leather embossed to look like elephant hide. The bucket seats were well-bolstered and secure. The driving position was upright, comfortable and sporty.
Surprisingly, the split rear seat -- there is no third row, in contrast to the SRX -- has nearly as much headroom as the front; the only problem is ducking in and out, since the rear seat sits fairly high. I particularly liked the child-size headrest for the center of the back seat.
Are there any drawbacks? The ride quality is a tad harsh. The big tires also put up a fight against the road and the wind; between rolling resistance, aerodynamic drag and eight thirsty cylinders, the FX45 manages an E.P.A. fuel economy rating of only 15 in town, 19 on the highway (The FX35 is rated 16/22.) Both engines require premium fuel.
"Sport utility vehicle" was never a particularly apt term -- in which cubbyhole do they keep the "sport" in a Ford Expedition? Even performance-tuned S.U.V.'s like the Mercedes-Benz ML55 AMG come with an asterisk that denotes diminished expectations -- after all, what can you reasonably expect from an S.U.V.? The FX45 says you can expect quite a lot.

INSIDE TRACK: The crossover utility goes ballistic.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 9, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An automobile review of the Infiniti FX45 last Sunday misstated its relationship with another sport wagon, the Nissan Murano. The Murano shares the structural architecture of the Nissan Altima and two new Nissan models, the 2004 Maxima sedan and 2004 Quest minivan; it does not use the FX45's structure, known as the FM platform.

HEADLINE: Dreaming Of Democracy 

BYLINE:  By George Packer; George Packer is the author, most recently of "Blood of the Liberals"

 BODY:
Last summer, the State Department convened a number of Iraqi exiles to advise the United States government on the problems that Iraq would face after the fall of Saddam Hussein. It was called, rather grandly, the Future of Iraq Project. Among the topics was democracy, and among the Iraqis invited to join was a dissident named Kanan Makiya. He seemed a natural choice. In 1989, under the pseudonym Samir al-Khalil, Makiya published a book called "Republic of Fear," which relentlessly dissected the totalitarian nature of Saddam's regime. The pseudonym wasn't a whim; in those years Iraq's overseas dissidents were frequently bumped off. Ignored upon publication, the book became a best seller the next year with the outbreak of the Persian Gulf war, and Makiya, the son of Iraq's most distinguished architect and a trained architect himself, was thrust into the turbulence of Middle Eastern politics. At the end of the war, during a forum at Harvard, the author revealed his identity for the first time and urged President George H.W. Bush to finish the job the war had left undone by getting rid of Saddam Hussein. Makiya's ideas cut deeply against the grain of Arab intellectual life and won him both powerful admirers and powerful enemies. 
 But when the State Department's invitation came last year, Makiya balked. He assumed that the Future of Iraq Project wasn't serious. "Some people in the government are talking democratic change," he told me recently, referring to the civilian hawks in the Pentagon, "and there are other people who think that's all a pile of garbage. These others are in the State Department and the C.I.A. today. They are very powerful players." 
 The history of the Iraqi opposition's relationship with the United States government is a tangled and unhappy one, leaving deep suspicions between and within them. Iraq is one of the most diverse countries in the Arab world, with a majority population of Shiite Arabs, who predominate in the south, as well as large minorities of Sunni Arabs in the center, Kurds in the north and smaller groups of Assyrians, Turkomans, Armenians and a surviving handful of Jews. This ethnic makeup explains some of the Iraqi opposition's notorious divisions, but the political differences are even more rancorous. And nothing Iraqis say about one another quite equals the vitriol of the feuding over Iraq within the American government. 
The Iraq question seems to exist on the far side of a looking glass where everyone turns into his opposite. The State Department and the C.I.A., considered the moderate wing of the Bush foreign policy apparatus, favor working through Iraq's traditional politics, which would mean removing Saddam but letting power stay with his ruling Baath Party, mainly minority Sunni Arabs. The State Department wants stability above all. Meanwhile, the hard-line hawks at the Pentagon and in the vice president's office, with their professed devotion to sweeping transformation in Iraq, want the transition to democracry to be led by the Western-oriented exiles grouped since 1992 under the loose umbrella of the Iraqi National Congress, whose chairman, Ahmad Chalabi, is close to Makiya. 
The battle is less between left and right than between realists and revolutionaries. It has simmered throughout the buildup to war, and it could haunt and possibly sabotage the postwar reconstruction. It makes an odd kind of sense that Makiya, 53, who was once a Trotskyist and supporter of radical Palestinian politics, has ended up as a liberal in the camp of neoconservative zealots, who see a democratic Iraq as a lever for moving the entire Arab world toward the West.
In the end, Makiya decided to call the State Department's bluff -- to "hoist them on their own petard." He joined the Future of Iraq Project's Democratic Principles Working Group, and along with a few allies from the exile community in Washington and London, he took over the writing of a detailed report on democracy after Saddam. There's something in it to offend everyone. The report proposes, among other radical ideas, a representative "transitional authority" chosen by Iraq's opposition exiles and ready to operate inside the country as the regime crumbles; the postwar demilitarization of Iraq; the dismantling of the Baath Party along the lines of German de-Nazification; war crimes trials and a truth commission; thoroughgoing secularism; a constitution in which individual and minority-group rights would be guaranteed in advance of local and then national elections, so that democracy does not lead to tyranny of the majority; a decentralized federal government in which the regions would be drawn along geographic rather than ethnic lines; and an end to ethnic identity as a basis for the state. As long as Iraq is defined as an Arab state, other ethnic groups, like Kurds and Assyrians, will continue to be second-class citizens. In Kanan Makiya's blueprint, Iraq would officially cease to be an Arab country.
"It's the architect in me," he says, nursing a cold over Japanese tea in Cambridge, Mass., where he lives. Makiya is a balding and somewhat disheveled Brandeis University professor of Middle East studies with a soft, intense manner. His office in a Cambridge apartment is lined with leatherbound books on Islamic history and literature. When his cellphone rings, he apologizes for having temporarily acquired one -- "a disaster for a writer." The immediate world of waitresses and crosswalks constantly surprises Makiya out of his thoughts, which these days are elsewhere. This unlikely revolutionary is taking the huge gamble that by riding on the back of an American war, he can hold the Americans to their own talk and help direct the outcome. 
"We've played a kind of game," he says. "It's not a game, it's serious -- we've emerged with something very hard to disown even though it comes up with conclusions opposite to what the State Department wanted. They never wanted that kind of document in the first place."
In December, Makiya went to London to present the report at a meeting of the hundreds of mullahs, monarchists, ex-officers, party bosses, businessmen, intellectuals and schemers who make up Iraq's fractious exiled opposition. In London I saw that the qualities that make Makiya a powerful thinker also make him a bad politician -- the most eloquent spokesman for Iraqi democracy and at times his own worst advocate. In the weeks since London the pressure on him has only grown, along with the difficulty of the task. The closer we get to war, the harder it is to believe that the liberal democracy Makiya envisions will be the outcome. The problem isn't just the Iraqis. It's also the Americans.
No one knows what will happen when Saddam Hussein's death grip on his country is finally broken. Prediction is a dangerous business in politics generally, but in the case of Iraq, where since 1968 the only political activity that won't get you killed is unambiguous loyalty to the Baath Party, the future is especially opaque. For the past several months the country has been crawling with foreign journalists, yet the security apparatus is so extensive and terror so deeply internalized that most of what we know about Iraqis' unofficial thoughts is confined to facial expressions and buried meanings. When Makiya and two other Iraqis were invited to the Oval Office in January, he told President Bush that invading American troops would be greeted with "sweets and flowers." More fancifully, Prof. Fouad Ajami, a Middle East scholar at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, predicts "kites and boom boxes."
A recent report compiled by the International Crisis Group, a policy organization based in Brussels, from secret interviews held in three Iraqi cities last fall gives perhaps the most thorough account of political thought in Iraq today, and it lends some support to the optimists. With unexpected homogeneity, Iraqis voiced an acceptance of the inevitability of war and a change of government. "We have nothing to lose," one Iraqi said. According to the report, "A significant number of those Iraqis interviewed, with surprising candor, expressed their view that if such a change required an American-led attack, they would support it." Though fear of a destructive war and anarchy afterward runs deep, "the overwhelming sentiment among those interviewed was one of frustration and impatience with the status quo." 
But when it comes to the Iraqi landscape after the dictator's fall, the International Crisis Group report has more sobering news for those who imagine a swift transition to democracy. "Thoughts about a post-Saddam Iraq remain extremely vague and inarticulate," it found. In the words of one Iraqi, "We have become political dwarfs." Questionsabout successor regimes and federal democracy met with indifference. On the other hand, according to the report, the opposition in exile "is viewed with considerable suspicion" -- far more than a foreign occupier would be -- "and the desire for a long-term U.S. involvement is higher than anticipated."
When Saddam suddenly ordered the release of tens of thousands of prisoners from the notorious Abu Ghraib prison last fall, the surge of inmates from within the walls and family members from without overwhelmed prison guards and crushed a number of people to death at the very moment of freedom. Reporters who ventured into the bowels of the prison were struck by the appalling odors of long human confinement. When the seal on Iraq is broken, the surge will be just as intense, and the smell of decades of repression just as rank. "With the removal of the dictator," says Thomas Carothers, a democracy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, "political life will begin immediately," and unless American troops are able to provide civil order while they hunt down weapons depots and resisting units of the Special Republican Guard, it will initially look more like vigilantism than party-building. Peter Galbraith, a professor at the National Defense University in Washington, says: "As the American troops sweep north, they'll pass Basra in the early days. Presumably they won't go into the city. Then who's going to govern the city? Will there be another uprising? I think there's a good chance." 
In 1991, when Kurds in the north and Shiites in the south rose up against Saddam after his defeat in Kuwait, the score-settling and looting were so extreme that Makiya later wrote of a "basic nihilistic impulse." Today, Iraqi Kurdistan, under the protection of an allied no-fly zone, has a flourishing civil society and the beginnings of democratic self-government. Peter Galbraith, who as a Senate aide in the late 1980's saw the effects of genocide in Kurdish villages and unsuccessfully tried to turn Reagan administration policy against Saddam, says: "A unified and democratic Iraq is an oxymoron. The important point about the north is that the Iraqi identity is disappearing there." 
A breakaway Kurdistan is a long-term possibility; civil violence in the south is the more immediate threat. The Shiites there have been especially persecuted by Saddam since their 1991 uprising was put down with tens of thousands of deaths. Joseph Braude, a young Iraqi-American whose book "The New Iraq" will be published this month, says that the impoverished Shiite south is "not an existential threat to the map of Iraq. It's more of a terrible social challenge of Iraqi society." The distribution of wealth, more than the ethnic division of power, he says, will determine whether there will ever be social peace in Iraq. Iraq's Shiites -- the most disenfranchised group, with the freshest grievances and the strongest claim on a share of power -- will challenge the policing and diplomatic skills of an army of occupation after the flowers, sweets, kites and boom boxes disappear. Patrick Clawson, deputy director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and editor of the book "How to Build a New Iraq After Saddam," thinks that Iraq's disintegration into ethnic pieces is less of a threat than a series of "revolving-door coups," and for that reason the United States military should keep intact elements of Iraq's army to maintain order and even join a new government. 
To the crucial questions of who will take power after Saddam and for how long, the administration has been loath to give a public answer. For months, a surprisingly public argument has raged between the State Department and the Pentagon over the shape of Iraq after a war. People close to the administration's decision-making about the postwar period describe a confused, largely day-to-day process, in contrast with the disciplined long-term planning for the war itself. In the Pentagon version, Iraqi exiles would form a provisional government prepared to take power under American protection. The State Department, which intensely dislikes the Iraqi National Congress and its chairman, Ahmad Chalabi, has done everything possible to block this possibility and either encourage a coup or plan for the American military to run Iraq for months or years until it would gradually hand over power to Iraqis.
Chalabi is a banker with an aristocratic manner and a controversial reputation who has devoted a considerable part of his fortune and the past decade of his life to building up the Iraqi National Congress, which is based in London. He elicits strong reactions of admiration or contempt in Washington. David L. Phillips, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who worked closely with the State Department on its Future of Iraq Project, says, "If Ahmad Chalabi walked down a street in Baghdad today, nobody would recognize him." In the view of the State Department's Middle East hands, there's something inauthentic about Iraqi exiles, soaked for years in nostalgia, grand ideas and impotence. Some of them haven't set foot in Baghdad for more than three decades; Makiya left to attend M.I.T. in 1968, the year the Baath Party seized total power, and has lived in Cambridge or London ever since. Condoleezza Rice, to whom both American factions have appealed as an arbiter, told one Iraqi, referring to Poland's World War II-era self-proclaimed government-in-exile, "The trouble with the Iraqi opposition is they're like the London Poles." But the Pentagon hawks and their neoconservative allies argue just as passionately that the exiles are the only Iraqis capable of forming a government, all political life inside Iraq having long since been extinguished. In this view, State's scorn for the Iraqi National Congress amounts to a disbelief in Arab democracy.
It now seems that the State Department has won this fight. As Peter Galbraith suggested, half in jest, the Pentagon will get its war and State will get its postwar. In mid-February, administration officials finally announced plans for an American military government to run the country for at least two years, guaranteeing security and overseeing the reconstruction of Iraq and the election of an Iraqi government. Baath Party officials would be removed from the top levels of the bureaucracy, but those a notch down would be kept on to work with their American superiors. Gen. Tommy Franks of the United States Central Command would take a job that the Pentagon never wanted to exist, acting as a sort of discreet and colorless MacArthur. Iraq's exiles would be the losers, relegated to seats on an advisory council to be shared with American-picked Iraqis from inside the country. This proposed course of action, played down for months by the administration, suggests that in the absence of a strong coalition of countries, a largely American war will be followed by a largely American peace.
There are other projections for what might take place -- ones that follow the law of unintended consequences. The Turkish Army occupies northern Iraq to prevent an independent Kurdistan on its border, prompting Turkish and Iraqi Kurds to join forces against the Turks and Iraqi Turkomans. The Kurds refuse to rejoin the country that once tried to exterminate them unless federalism gives them control over the oil reserves of Kirkuk. The two Kurdish parties resume the fighting that broke out between them in 1996. The Iranian hard-liners, realizing that Iraq's territorial integrity has become a theoretical matter, take the opportunity to finish off the opposition mujahedeen across the border. Shiite mullahs, finding themselves locked out of power again, resist American authority and form antioccupation militias. A Sunni officer in the Iraqi Army pulls off an 11th-hour coup, declares himself friendly to the United States and stops the process cold. Makiya calls this last "my greatest fear." 
In Arabic, "Iraq" means "well-rooted country," which suggests the kind of promotional thinking that makes urban planners christen a concrete housing project "Metropolitan Gardens." The country was assembled at Versailles after World War I out of three former Ottoman provinces and handed over by the League of Nations in 1920 to be a British mandate, breaking the promise of postwar independence that T.E. Lawrence, better known as Lawrence of Arabia, had made to Britain's Arab allies. But the British found this unruly concoction of peoples more trouble to govern than it was worth, even with Lawrence's friend King Faisal I on the throne, and in 1932 Iraq became an independent constitutional monarchy, though the imperial power didn't leave without securing favorable oil concessions. Within four years Iraq gave the Arab world its first modern coup. After that, the violence never really stopped, with coups, ethnic pogroms and massacres among political parties. (The Arab Baath movement emerged in World War II as a pro-Nazi group.) But the most turbulent decade followed the overthrow of the constitutional monarchy in 1958. One military regime was toppled by the next. In 1968 the Arab Baath Socialist Party finally consolidated power, destroying its opponents among the Communists and the other Arab nationalists. Saddam, the head of internal security, quickly acquired de facto power but assumed the presidency only in 1979 amid a bloody purge. Chaos gave way to dictatorship, two ruinous foreign wars and the Kurdish genocide. 
Iraqis today, depending on their age, express deep nostalgia either for the cosmopolitan Baghdad of the years before the Jews were made to flee upon the creation of Israel; or for the constitutional monarchy before the 1958 coup; or for the oil-rich years of the 1970's. But while Iraq might once have been stable or wealthy or tolerant, it was never really democratic. Makiya first got to know Ahmad Chalabi when they sat together on an airplane and Makiya was impressed to find the chairman of the Iraqi National Congress reading a thick tome on the reconstruction of postwar Germany. But anyone seeking historical lessons for a democratic Iraq has to face the fact that Germany before Hitler was liberal compared with Iraq before Saddam.
This bloody history has produced a hopeful new idea. Call it Iraqi exceptionalism. It's the idea that Iraqis have suffered so intensely under a radical nationalist regime that they are by now immune to the anti-Western rhetoric that remains potent in the rest of the Arab world. Iraqis crushed by Saddam's brand of Arab nationalism do not see America and Israel as their eternal enemies. The real enemy is the one within. 
This thinking took hold of Makiya during the Iran-Iraq war. He left his father's London architectural practice whenMohamed Makiya began to receive commissions from Saddam to rebuild Baghdad in monumental fashion; he threw himself into the research for "Republic of Fear." It changed him from a revolutionary Marxist to a liberal democrat. He began to think outside the dominant lines of Middle Eastern ideologies: rather than an anti-imperialist resistance leader, he became a dissident in the Eastern European way, diagnosing the pathology of homegrown tyranny. "It wasn't the United States, it was Iraqis and Iranians who were bleeding themselves to death," he told me. "This sense that the malaise was principally in my world, and not principally in the United States, was the seismic shift in my politics."
The implications of the shift are far-reaching, for the lens through which most of the Arab world views Israel and America might no longer fit Iraq. Without denying the justice of the Palestinian cause, Makiya says, Arabs shouldn't regard it as the key to solving regional problems. The crucial issue is no longer national liberation, but democracy based on human rights. These ideas came to a head during the gulf war, when most of the Arab world supported Saddam. "Republic of Fear," copies of which had been smuggled into Iraq, made Makiya famous among his countrymen, and after the war, when he traveled through the Kurdish region to film a BBC documentary, "Saddam's Killing Fields," Iraqis sought him out to tell their stories of the genocide and the bloody repression of the 1991 uprisings. If Makiya had simply collected them in his next book and called it "Cruelty," he wouldn't have become a lightning rod in the Arab world. But his anger at the Arab intelligentsia's complacency before Saddam's crimes was burning too high, and "Cruelty and Silence," which came out in 1993, was not a cool meditation but a cri de coeur that named names. "There can be no more romance and no more false heroics in the Arab world," Makiya wrote. "There is only the legacy of pain which must be grappled with by a new language and in a new style." 
Not surprisingly, the idea of Iraqi exceptionalism has brought denunciation from many Arab quarters, including the leading Arab intellectual in the West, the literary critic Edward Said. Writing in an Arabic newspaper in December, Said, who teaches at Columbia University, accused Makiya of being an inauthentic Arab and of selling himself to American imperialism and Zionism out of sheer vanity. For Said, a Palestinian who sees the Israeli occupation as the primary problem of the Middle East, Makiya has made himself the tool of Israel's right wing and of America's interest in Arab oil. This fight is far more than personal: it suggests an intellectual turning point in the history of Arab politics.
One striking feature of Iraqi exceptionalism is the attitude toward Jews. Before their exodus in the early 1950's, Jews made up an estimated one-third of Baghdad's highly diverse population. Among certain exiles, Jewish music and culture have become part of the lore of pre-Baathist Iraq. The Iraqi National Congress newspaper Al Mutamar recently published an article by an Israeli writer and articles about Iraqi Jewish poetry. A London coffee-shop owner named Dia Kashi went so far as to travel to Israel, meet with Iraqi Jews and help found the Iraqi-Israeli Friendship Committee. Several Jews were invited as delegates to the London opposition conference.
The champions of Iraqi exceptionalism include the neoconservatives in the administration -- Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith at the Pentagon; John Bolton at the State Department; Lewis Libby in the vice president's office; Richard Perle, who is chairman of the Defense Policy Board, a panel that advises the Pentagon -- and numerous scholars, columnists and activists, most of them identified with the pro-Israel American right. In recent weeks, President Bush himself has appeared to embrace the idea as a geopolitical rationale for war. The story being told goes like this: 
The Arab world is hopelessly sunk in corruption and popular discontent. Misrule and a culture of victimhood have left Arabs economically stagnant and prone to seeing their problems in delusional terms. The United States has contributed to the pathology by cynically shoring up dictatorships; Sept. 11 was one result. Both the Arab world and official American attitudes toward it need to be jolted out of their rut. An invasion of Iraq would provide the necessary shock, and a democratic Iraq would become an example of change for the rest of the region. Political Islam would lose its hold on the imagination of young Arabs as they watched a more successful model rise up in their midst. The Middle East's center of political, economic and cultural gravity would shift from the region's theocracies and autocracies to its new, oil-rich democracy. And finally, the deadlock in which Israel and Palestine are trapped would end as Palestinians, realizing that their Arab backers were now tending their own democratic gardens, would accept compromise. By this way of thinking, the road to Damascus, Tehran, Riyadh and Jerusalem goes through Baghdad.
The idea is sometimes referred to as a new domino theory, with tyrannies collapsing on top of one another. Among the harder heads at the State Department, I was told, it is also mocked as the Everybody Move Over One theory: Israel will take the West Bank, the Palestinians will get Jordan and the members of Jordan's Hashemite ruling family will regain the Iraqi throne once held by their relative King Faisal I.
At times this story is told in the lofty moral language of Woodrow Wilson, the language that President Bush used religiously in his State of the Union address. Others -- both advocates and detractors -- tell the story in more naked terms of power and resources. David Frum, the former Bush speechwriter who wrote the first two words in the phrase "axis of evil," argues in his new book, "The Right Man," "An American-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein -- and a replacement of the radical Baathist dictatorship with a new government more closely aligned with the United States -- would put America more wholly in charge of the region than any power since the Ottomans, or maybe the Romans."
It's an audacious idea, and part of its appeal lies in the audacity. It shoves history out of a deep hole. To the idea's strongest backers, status-quo caution toward the sick, dangerous Middle East is contemptible, almost unbearable. "You have to start somewhere," says Danielle Pletka, a vice president of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group. "There are always a million excuses not to do something like this." Who wouldn't choose amputation over gangrene? If we have the will and imagination, the thinking goes, we can strike one great blow at terrorism, tyranny, underdevelopment and the region's hardest, saddest problem.
"It's called magical realism, Middle East-style," says Thomas Carothers of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Exactly how, he wonders, would this chain reaction occur? Arab countries are stuck between autocratic governments and Islamist opposition, he says, and "our invasion of Iraq isn't going to remove those political forces. They're going to be sitting there the next day." The war, which is vastly unpopular in the Arab world, is far more likely to improve the fortunes of the Islamists, he says, and provoke governments to tighten their grip, than to ventilate the region with an Arab spring. 
The chances of democracy succeeding even in Iraq under American occupation are highly questionable, Carothers argues. War seldom creates democracy; according to a recent article in The Christian Science Monitor, of the 18 regime changes forced by the United States in the 20th century, only 5 resulted in democracy, and in the case of wars fought unilaterally, the number goes down to one -- Panama. Democracy takes root from within, over a long period of time, in conditions that have never prevailed in Iraq. For democracy to have a chance there would require a lengthy and careful American commitment to nation-building -- which could easily look to Iraqis and other Arabs like colonialism. Nor can we be sure that democracy, in Iraq or elsewhere, will lead to pro-American regimes; it might lead to the opposite. "The idea that there's a small democracy inside every society waiting to be released just isn't true," Carothers says. "If we're pinning our hopes on the idea that this will lead to a democratic change throughout the region, then we're invading for the wrong reason." Jessica T. Mathews, president of the Carnegie Endowment, adds, "'We've suffered so much that the only alternative is democracy' -- as soon as you say it, you realize there's a mile between the beginning and end of that sentence." 
One premise of the strategic rationale for war is that Arab public opinion -- the resentment turning to fury that will probably greet an American invasion -- doesn't matter, because it is wrong, even delusional. "America," Fouad Ajami writes, "ought to be able to live with this distrust and discount a good deal of this anti-Americanism as the 'road rage' of a thwarted Arab world -- the congenital condition of a culture yet to take full responsibility for its self-inflicted wounds." 
I ran these notions by Hussein Ibish, the Lebanese-born communications director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. He pointed out that some Arab views, especially about the Palestinians, are based on reality, not manipulated paranoia, and that anyone genuinely interested in Arab democracy had better take the popular will into account, delusional or not. If, on the other hand, Iraq is to be turned back into a colonial mandate as it was 80 years ago, inching toward "Heart of Darkness," as Ibish said, we should openly admit that the anticolonial values of the intervening decade are being cast aside. "How do you think this discussion will sound translated into Arabic and broadcast on Al Jazeera?" he asked. "This war will only reinforce the Arab feeling of humiliation and impotence. It could be a giant television commercial for Al Qaeda." 
As Arab regimes try to weather popular discontent, they will be far happier with the State Department's postwar scheme for regional stability than with the Pentagon hawks' notions about regional transformation -- especially if Iraq's oil is used by the Americans to rebuild Iraq and not to undermine OPEC. Iran, which has taken a surprisingly benign view of the war gathering on its horizon, might change its mind once American troops settle into Iraq for the long haul and events across the border make themselves felt among Iranian reformers. France and Russia, with their extensive interests in Iraqi oil and other contracts, might sit out the war but cut to the front of the line during the reconstruction to claim their share of the spoils. America's closest ally in the neighborhood, Turkey, with its troops in Iraq's north possibly provoking a Kurdish revolt, could turn out to be the most problematic player of all. Except, of course, for the Iraqis and the Americans themselves. 
The London Hilton Metropole is a garish hotel near Paddington Station, and over a December weekend it seemed that most of Iraq's three million to four million exiles were there, in turbans and robes, in kaffiyehs, in English-cut business suits, huddled in conspiratorial-looking groups, clutching cellphones to ears. Among them Makiya was an anomalous sight, looking rumpled in shirtsleeves, baggy corduroys and all-weather shoes, his face clean-shaven. (One Iraqi told me that the country's next president must either be a woman or a man without a mustache.) The politicos from the Kurdish, Shiite and ex-military parties complained that Makiya's casual appearance lacked respect. The rumored contents of his report, copies of which most of them hadn't yet received, troubled them, too. Worst of all was the bluntness with which Makiya and some of his young, Western-educated allies in the Iraqi National Congress were talking about the need to move beyond the "old politics" of the ethnic parties, which had all been born in the image of the Baath.
Before the conference, American officials made it clear that they were opposed to any votes being taken in London; no transitional government would be elected, no report on democracy approved. The State Department had won out. Just before the conference began, Makiya sat down in a cafe across from the British Museum to survey the damage with Salim Chalabi, a London lawyer and nephew of Ahmad Chalabi, who had helped draft the document.
"They want to come out of this as one big happy family," Makiya said of the traditional parties. "They want to show unity and support for the Americans. I want to win something concrete." He wanted the Iraqi opposition to commit itself to a proposal and make itself relevant before the shooting started and the logic of war took its course. "But I'm afraid we're fighting a losing battle."
Chalabi told Makiya that his outspokenness was hurting his own cause. Makiya is an old friend of the Kurds; in addition to having made the documentary "Saddam's Killing Fields," he directs Harvard's Iraq Documentation Project, which is organizing and translating millions of documents left behind by the Baath Party as records of the genocide. But the Kurdish parties at the conference were vehemently opposed to the proposal for a nonethnic federation in Iraq. They had fought hard to gain recognition and equal status with the Arabs, and they were not going to relinquish it easily. The views of the Shiites on the section dealing with secularism had not been solicited. The Sunnis were less represented than anyone. There had been a lack of inclusiveness. Makiya agreed -- but he couldn't help adding: "I've begun to hate the word 'inclusive' here. I know it's going to mean the lowest common denominator. Nothing will be said that means anything." 
Makiya was sweating, the lines deepening in his high forehead. The conference, the months of work, the political storm that always swirled around him, seemed to be placing him under an intolerable strain. Finally he relented. 
"O.K., what should we do?" he asked.
"You have to play it more like a game," Chalabi said. He suggested emphasizing the points on which there was agreement, like human rights, and muting the controversial ones. He urged Makiya to lower his profile.
On the first day of the conference, at a press briefing, Makiya sat alongside Ahmad Chalabi and a few others, content to listen. But when a reporter asked him a question, he leaned forward and said: "The report carries forward a completely new idea that doesn't exist in the Arab-Muslim world. This is something tremendous, something unbelievable. We're talking above all of an idea of democracy that isn't only majority rule -- an idea of democracy that is about minority rights and above all individual rights." He added: "This is a fighting document, by the way. We intend to fight for it on the floor of the conference."
I had seen it before: when Makiya spoke, the energy in the room became focused. Afterward a swarm of reporters gathered around him. Into the room walked a furious Hoshyar Zebari, a leading official of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, whose own press conference had been sparsely attended. Later, I asked Zebari about the document and about Makiya. Zebari smiled through his answer, but he kept thumping me in the chest as he spoke. "We are rooted in the country, we are the ones who have suffered," he said. "What Kanan Makiya has done, I appreciate his intellectual work, but it's just an intellectual exercise."
Makiya, I suggested, was trying to give it teeth.
"He's the only one," said an American who was hovering around the conversation. It was David L. Phillips, who had worked with the State Department on the Future of Iraq Project. "The report is not a political document -- it's not a blueprint. If it becomes one it will be divisive." Phillips later expressed sharp anger at Makiya for hijacking the writing of the report and then lobbying so hard for its provisions. 
Back in Washington, officials thanked the Democratic Principles Working Group for its advice and shelved the report that the State Department had solicited. Makiya had called their bluff, and now they were calling his. The London conference ended with expressions of unity and vague support for that thing called democracy in Iraq; Makiya was named to a 65-member transitional coordinating committee. But the report of the Democratic Principles Working Group, printed and bound with hundreds of pages of appendices and dissents, was never officially discussed. It struck me as inauspicious that of all the committees in the Future of Iraq Project -- on water, electricity, agriculture and a host of other topics -- only the committee on democracy was deemed a failure. 
The longer you try to look at Iraq on the morning after Saddam, the more you see the truth of what many people told me: getting rid of him will be the easy part. After that, the United States will find itself caught in a series of conundrums that will require supreme finesse: to liberate without appearing to dominate, to ensure order without overstaying, to secure its interests without trampling on Iraq's, to oversee democratization without picking winners, to push for reforms in the neighborhood without unleashing demons. It's hard to know whether to be more worried by the State Department's complacency or by the Pentagon civilians' zealotry. 
On the day that Saigon fell in 1975, the British writer James Fenton found a framed quotation on a wall of the looted American embassy: "Better to let them do it imperfectly than to do it perfectly yourself, for it is their country, their way, and your time is short." The words are from T.E. Lawrence. Vietnam remains the shadow over every American war, but never more than the one we're poised to fight, for no war since Vietnam has professed greater ambitions: to change the political culture of a country, maybe a whole region. Ever since Woodrow Wilson worked to put democracy and self-determination on the agenda at Versailles, this strain of high-mindedness in the American character has drawn the world's admiration and its scorn. In Graham Greene's novel "The Quiet American," which was recently released as a film, the title character is a young idealist sent to Vietnam in the early 1950's to find a democratic "Third Force" between the French and the Communists. The book's narrator, a jaded British journalist, remarks, "I never knew a man who had better motives for all the trouble he caused." Americans have never been very good at imperialism, or much interested in it; we're too innocent, too impatient, too intoxicated with our own sense of selfless purpose. Several Iraqis expressed the wish that their occupiers could be the British again, who took the trouble to know them so much better, who wrote whole books on the Marsh Arabs and the flora and fauna of Kuwait. Afghanistan lost America's attention as soon as Kandahar fell, and it remains unfinished business. As for Iraq, Jessica Mathews of the Carnegie Endowment, says, "Our country is not remotely prepared for what this is going to take." 
If so, the fault mainly lies with President Bush. His articulation of political aims and postwar plans has been sketchy to the point of empty cliche. He has never discussed the human costs of war, nor its price. The Yale economist William D. Nordhaus estimates the military expenditure between $50 billion and $140 billion; far more daunting, his study finds, the postwar costs to the United States of occupying and rebuilding Iraq, along with the impact on oil markets and the economy, could run as high as $2 trillion. This is a calculation that no one in the administration has dared to make, at least publicly. Privately, some officials suggest that Iraqi oil will pay for it. 
More than anything, the president hasn't readied Americans psychologically to commit themselves to a project of such magnitude, nor has he made them understand why they should. He has maintained his spirit of hostility to nation-building while reversing his policy against it. Bush is a man who has never shown much curiosity about the world. When he met with Makiya and two other Iraqis in January, I was told by someone not present, the exiles spent a good portion of the time explaining to the president that there are two kinds of Arabs in Iraq, Sunnis and Shiites. The very notion of an Iraqi opposition appeared to be new to him. War has turned Bush into a foreign-policy president, but democratizing an Arab country will require a subtlety and sophistication that have been less in evidence than the resolve to fight. 
I asked John W. Dower, a history professor at M.I.T. and author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning book about the American occupation of Japan, to compare that project with the democratization of Iraq. The difference between Japan and Iraq is great enough, he answered; the difference between America in 1945 and 2003 is even greater. "We do not have the moral legitimacy we had then, nor do we have the other thing that was present when we occupied Japan -- the vision of the American public that we would engage in serious and genuinely democratic nation-building and that we would do this in the context of an international order." Even Fouad Ajami, a strong believer in the war's potential for regional reform, told me: "The country is depressed, psychologically and economically. There is no great calling toward planting our truth in Mesopotamia. The war will have an ideological claim, but tempered by the difficulty of Iraq, by the fact that we don't know this land." 
The unease among Americans, even those who support the president, about the war and its aftermath is certainly due to fear of unknown consequences. It might also come from the sense that we're trying to have it both ways -- guns and butter, war without sacrifice, intervention without commitment. If Iraq succeeds in becoming a democracy under American protection, it will represent the triumph of hope over experience for both countries. It's a notion that I always found easier to imagine when I was within earshot of Kanan Makiya. 
In mid-January, Makiya emerged from his meeting at the Oval Office to declare himself "deeply reassured" by the president's dedication to Iraqi democracy. Within a few days Makiya had flown to Tehran with Ahmad Chalabi and a few other Iraqi National Congress members to hold talks with Iraqi Shiite leaders. At the end of January, under the protection of Iranian security, they crossed the snow-covered mountains into northern Iraq. One recent morning, Makiya called me from Sulaimaniya, in Iraqi Kurdistan. He and the Kurds had patched up their differences, and one of the two Kurdish parties -- the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan -- had embraced the principle of nonethnic federalism. "The opposition is trying to get its act together, basically," he said. 
When the United States revealed a few weeks ago its intent to impose a military government after the war, Makiya took the news as a betrayal. "It is Baathism with an American face," he declared. In his view, the odds for democracy have never looked longer, and he now wonders aloud if his harshest critics, who accused him of naivete and worse, will be proved right after all. The exiles who gathered in late February to hold a second conference in northern Iraq won't declare a provisional government against American wishes, Makiya told me, but they are trying to forge an Iraqi leadership that will be capable of forming one after the war sweeps through. 
What Makiya is trying to do is think his way out of Iraq's blood-stained history. After the gulf war, when he and other dissidents drafted what they called "Charter 91," outlining principles of tolerance for a new Iraq, Makiya received a severe letter from an old friend that he was willing to reprint in "Cruelty and Silence": "I think -- and please allow me to tell you this -- that the ideas of the Charter issue from an ivory tower which has elevated itself so high up into the sky that we who are standing down below can hardly see or hear where they are coming from. You see, our society today has become like '1984.' There is no one who remembers or who even dares to remember the meaning of words like 'freedom,' 'democracy,' 'brotherhood' or 'humanity.' They no longer know what 'human rights' are. I mean, what does this have to do with them! . . . Their only preoccupation is to survive and to live, like sheep." 
It's possible that Makiya's ideas are too lofty to stand a chance of being realized soon. David L. Phillips may be right to say that "Iraqis aren't quite ready for the new politics. The tribal structures, the ethnic groupings -- they matter to Iraqis. They're important. This isn't a university laboratory." It's also possible that Makiya was foolish ever to imagine American cooperation with his exile dreams, and that he is out of his element in the dangerous labyrinth of Iraqi powerpolitics. Meanwhile, ahead of the war, an Arabic translation of the report is being smuggled from Iraqi Kurdistan into Baghdad in miniature editions disguised as cigarette cartons.
"The document is just paper at the end of the day," Makiya told me one snowy evening at his Cambridge apartment. "One of the less grandiose impulses behind it was this: there's a world of people out there deeply, deeply skeptical about whether or not this country can make it to democracy. And I know deep down that they have good reason to be skeptical. I'm not really as rosy, I'm not as naive as sometimes I appear on this question. But it seems to me, for history's sake, important to have a group of Iraqis turn out a decent document that can be taken seriously, that will be picked up and remembered and churned over and used as some kind of a test, some kind of a yardstick against which to measure the progress of things afterward. And it was, after all, produced by Iraqis -- so that Iraqis can lift their heads up a bit and go out there in the world and say: 'We meant it. It wasn't all a word game. Some of us tried to give it a shot."'

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
The Wisdom And Folly Of Tax Cuts And Deficits

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
"FOOLISH consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds," wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson, expressing a wisdom most political leaders can appreciate.
 Those accused of contradicting their previous views, Emerson advised, should simply claim to have been misunderstood. "To be great is to be misunderstood," he wrote. 
 Perhaps with Emerson's spirit in mind, the Bush administration last week brushed aside the ridicule that the newest member of its economic team once heaped on two ideas that are sacrosanct in today's White House: the wisdom of deep tax cuts and the insignificance of budget deficits. 
N. Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard economist nominated last week by President Bush to lead his Council of Economic Advisers, once lampooned the tax cuts and budget-busting policies under President Ronald Reagan as "fad economics" dreamed up by "charlatans and cranks."
Given that Mr. Mankiw will be expected to promote Mr. Bush's plans for tax cuts and budget deficits at least as big as those run up by Mr. Reagan, his writings will almost certainly be used by Democrat opponents to embarrass Mr. Bush.
But the political reality is that Democrats have also proposed tax cuts, though theirs are much smaller, and both parties say they are more worried about stimulating the economy than about balancing the budget.
As a practical matter, few voters change their views about politicians simply because of logical inconsistencies in past and present positions. The first President Bush won the election to succeed Mr. Reagan even though Mr. Bush had earlier ridiculed Mr. Reagan's supply-side policies by using the immortal phrase "voodoo economics."
Academics and pundits can score points with logic, but the current president faces economic problems like sluggish growth. In the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, conducted Feb. 10 to 12, only 38 percent of those questioned approved of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy.
The Bush administration is struggling to reconcile more than rhetorical inconsistencies. With Mr. Bush's proposal for $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years (which include not only his $695 billion "jobs and growth" package, but also his proposals to make other tax cuts permanent), the administration is bumping up against a large number of mainstream economists and the unease of many old-fashioned Republicans who still fret about fiscal discipline.
One of those old-fashioned Republicans is Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Greenspan said at a Congressional hearing two weeks ago that "contrary to the views of some," he believed that budget deficits could indeed lead to higher interest rates and hurt the economy. And while Mr. Greenspan supported Mr. Bush's biggest single tax proposal, to eliminate taxes on most stock dividends, he also contended that the tax cut should be offset by either spending cuts or other tax increases, which Mr. Bush has no intention of proposing.
JOHN W. SNOW, the new Treasury secretary, has been wrestling with similar issues. Mr. Snow, the former chairman of the CSX Corporation, pushed hard for deficit-reduction measures in the mid-1990's when he was head of the Business Roundtable, an association of top corporate executives.
Now he is lobbying Congress and barnstorming around the country, arguing that the budget deficits of more than $300 billion envisioned for this year are small in comparison with the economy and that tax cuts are crucial to increasing economic growth. As Democratic lawmakers have pointed out in hearings, however, the deficit projected for this year could equal 3 percent of the gross domestic product; it was around 2.2 percent when Mr. Snow spoke out in 1995.
Both Republicans and Democrats have lists of economists to bolster their arguments, and Mr. Mankiw publicly backed Mr. Bush's agenda in the presidential election.
But Mr. Mankiw's own analysis of the impact of high government debt is much more nuanced. In a much-cited paper he wrote in 1998 with Douglas W. Elmendorf, an economist at the Fed, Mr. Mankiw supported the wisdom of letting the government run up debt during wartime, as, arguably, it is right now. But he and Mr. Elmendorf also supported economists who argued that budget deficits could lead to lower national savings and a reduced capital stock.
"He put his finger on the key point that deficits reduce national savings," said William G. Gale, an economist at the Brookings Institution, which has attacked the Bush administration's policies as fiscally reckless. "What's surprising is that this is considered controversial at all. It's really just mainstream economics."

HEADLINE: Going for Broke; 
War Means High Risk, Serious Money

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IN the ashen aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, President Bush committed himself and the nation to a global fight against terrorism that he warned would be long, shadowy and unconventional -- and whose outcome might not be known for years. 
 Now, with hundreds of thousands of American troops poised to fight Iraq, Mr. Bush stands on the apparent eve of a far more conventional and concrete conflict, one on which he has wagered not only his historical reputation but his immediate political future, for better or worse. 
 By tying his presidency so closely to the goal of ousting Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush has complicated the United States's relationships with some of its oldest allies, and narrowed the range of options through which presidents can shape their political fate -- first and foremost by subordinating many of his domestic objectives to a probable war. He is acutely aware of the seriousness of the moment. 
"We meet here during a crucial period in the history of our nation, and of the civilized world," Mr. Bush told a sympathetic audience at the American Enterprise Institute last week. "Part of that history was written by others. The rest will be written by us." 
In the modern presidency, "foreign policy is more likely to defeat than re-elect a president," said Allan J. Lichtman, a historian at American University, who cited the examples of Harry S. Truman enmeshed in Korea, Lyndon B. Johnson undone by Vietnam and Jimmy Carter stymied by the Iranian hostage crisis.
"Even some of the greatest foreign policy triumphs are no guarantee, so in strictly political terms, he's taking a great risk going to war in Iraq," Mr. Lichtman said. "His biggest danger is the economy. No incumbent president has ever been re-elected during an election-year recession, and that's one of the most potentially perilous effects of this war."
No one knows this better than President Bush. Will a war plant the seeds of a more peaceful, more democratic Middle East, as Mr. Bush contends, or inflame anti-American feeling and spark terrorist attacks throughout the Muslim world? Or both?
"Success is wonderful for everything, respect, power, influence, everything," said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama. "Failure, or getting bogged down, and you've got a very different problem. All the indications are they feel very, very confident." 
At this point, Mr. Bush has left himself little choice. Public support for his handling of Iraq, and terrorism more broadly, remains high, and pollsters and politicians agree that those ratings will shoot even higher, at least in the short term, the moment bombs start falling on Baghdad. Still, public assessments of his handling of the economy and other domestic issues have dragged down his overall job approval ratings to just above 50 percent.
Whatever the outcome of the next round of debate in the United Nations Security Council, the worldwide skepticism about the wisdom of Mr. Bush's course means that any war with Iraq will be seen, above all, as his war. John Brady Kiesling, a career foreign service officer who last week resigned his post as political counselor at the American embassy in Athens to protest Mr. Bush's policy, made that point.
"We have begun to dismantle the largest and most effective web of international relationships the world has ever known," Mr. Kiesling wrote Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. "Our current course will bring instability and danger, not security."
Mr. Bush's position has been to seek support from the United Nations to enforce its own past resolutions against Iraq, but he has repeatedly said that he would act with whatever partners he can persuade to remove what he considers a grave threat to American security and world peace. Having staked out that ground so unequivocally, Mr. Bush will have to hold it.
"In terms of politics, it's probably highly profitable, with a rally round the flag," said Nelson W. Polsby, a professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley. "If you can keep pumping that up, you get a free pass with respect to almost everything else, and he's milking that for all it's worth."
As Mr. Bush knows all too well, even a swift military victory in the year before an election is no guarantee of success at the polls. On Aug. 12, 1991, still fresh from his triumph in the Persian Gulf and the end of the cold war, the first President Bush confided to his diary: "The stories keep saying I will be very hard to beat. The more we hear of this, the more worried I become. 'The bigger they are, the harder they fall.' That sticks in my mind."
Within months, as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell recalled in his memoirs, President Bush's "Desert Storm adulation had melted like snow in the spring," and Bill Clinton, whom the president described that long ago August as "a very nice man," had the last laugh.
But Walter Dean Burnham, a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin, noted that the big difference between now and the end of the first Persian Gulf war is "that at that time, there was no perceived external threat to the United States," equivalent to the Sept. 11 attacks.
"I've argued since Sept. 11 that it all but assures Bush's re-election, because it implies a long struggle, one that is highly lethal," Professor Burnham said. "Until or unless something comes along that produces a credible story that this administration has simply screwed up, and that people have suffered or are threatened with suffering as a result of its actions, I don't see that changing. It would also have to be effectively exploited by whomever the Democrats nominate."
But Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said: "The important political calculation for the White House is to what extent they are willing to prepare the country for difficult future consequences now, so those consequences don't come as an unpleasant surprise. And by and large, the Bush team has chosen not to do that. I don't think they've done anything to prepare the country for a very expensive reconstruction, a substantial impact on the economy, or even a substantial increased risk of terrorist reprisals."
Indeed, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul L. Wolfowitz drew sharp questioning from Democrats on Capitol Hill last week for declining to provide even a ballpark estimate of the potential cost of war, and the White House has steadfastly declined to ask Americans not in uniform for any sacrifice much greater than waiting in longer airport security lines.
Whatever happens in Iraq, the broader threat that Mr. Bush has outlined will endure, and even be emphasized periodically by Mr. Bush's own administration through the color-coded system of terror alerts that amount to overt and official warnings to be wary, if not actually afraid.
But Mr. Bush seldom shrinks from a fight, and he has an uncanny record of overcoming initial doubts. He is, in E.B. White's phrase about successful New Yorkers, "willing to be lucky."
"If we wait for threats to fully materialize," Mr. Bush said at West Point last year, "we will have waited too long."

HEADLINE: A Call for Softer, Greener Language 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1 

 BODY:
Over the last six months, the Republican Party has subtly refocused its message on the environment, an issue that a party strategist called "the single biggest vulnerability for the Republicans and especially for George Bush" in a memorandum encouraging the new approach. 
 The Republicans, as the memorandum advised them, have softened their language to appeal to suburban voters, speaking out for protecting national parks and forests, advocating investment in environment technologies and shifting emphasis to the future rather than the present. 
 In interviews, Republican politicians and their aides said they agreed with the strategist, Frank Luntz, that it was important to pay attention to what his memorandum, written before the November elections, called "the environmental communications battle."
In his memorandum, Mr. Luntz urges that the term "climate change" be used instead of "global warming," because "while global warming has catastrophic communications attached to it, climate change sounds a more controllable and less emotional challenge." 
Also, he wrote, "conservationist" conveys a "moderate, reasoned, common sense position" while "environmentalist" has the "connotation of extremism."
President Bush's speeches on the environment show that the terms "global warming" and "environmentalist" had largely disappeared by late last summer. The terms appeared in a number of President Bush's speeches in 2001, but now the White House fairly consistently uses "climate change" and "conservationist."
Senator John E. Sununu, Republican of New Hampshire, was elected to his first term in November after running advertisements promoting his efforts for clean water and forest preservation. "It is only a slight exaggeration to say that historically, Republicans went out and talked about the budget or taxes and the economy and waited to get beat up on the environment and education, hoping that they could hold their own," Mr. Sununu said. "Why wait? Why not step forward and talk about work that you have done to improve the waterways or national parks?" 
National environmental groups say the shift has blunted the edge of Republican attacks. "They are not playing defense anymore," said Kim Haddow, a consultant for the Sierra Club who has helped counter some Republican advertisements. "It's like a tennis game. The ball is back in our court, and we need to spend time and energy educating voters."
In the State of the Union address, President Bush singled out a hydrogen fuel initiative that would revolutionize automobiles and help control global warming. And this week, the Department of Energy announced investments in technology to burn coal without carbon dioxide emissions, the main gas that scientists say contributes to global warming.
Republican officials emphasized their view that a successful communication strategy can work if it is built on these kinds of policies. "The message means nothing if the policy isn't sound," said Scott McClellan, a White House spokesman.
Many new Republican communication strategies match the recommendations of the 16-page environmental memorandum put together by the Luntz Research Companies, the consulting firm run by Mr. Luntz, who was also one of the drafters of "Contract with America," the manifesto of House Republicans under Newt Gingrich, the former speaker.
The memorandum was given to The New York Times by the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group critical of Bush administration policies. "They are showing the message discipline they need to get these anti-environmental policies past suburban voters," said Ken Cook, president of the organization.
Six years ago, Mr. Luntz released a 222-page guide called "The Language of the 21st Century," which offered Republicans a holistic communications strategy. 
"It's essential that you communicate your principles if you want your public to understand your policies," Mr. Luntz said in an interview.
The most recent memorandum suggests peppering speeches with phrases like "balance," "safe and healthy" and "common sense," terms that have been adopted frequently in Republican environmental discussion. In a speech last August introducing an initiative on thinning forests to prevent forest fires, for example, President Bush used the term "common sense" at least six times. (It was also a favorite phrase of Carol M. Browner, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator in the Clinton administration.)
One section of the memorandum, "Winning the Global Warming Debate," asserts that many voters believe there is a lack of consensus about global warming among scientists. "Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly," it says. "Therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue."
Among the ways to "challenge the science," the memorandum says, is to "be even more active in recruiting experts who are sympathetic to your view and much more active in making them part of your message" because "people are more willing to trust scientists than politicians."
Mr. Luntz, who uses focus groups to test marketing strategies, has often been harshly critical of the party. For example, the memorandum criticizes how the White House handled what Mr. Luntz called the "arsenic in water imbroglio," which he described as the "biggest public relations misfire of President Bush's first year in office."
Before leaving office, the Clinton administration issued an executive order tightening standards for arsenic in water. When the Bush administration delayed the plan, it was attacked because it failed to get its message across, the memorandum said. "The story was not that Bush was delaying a hastily imposed regulation," Mr. Luntz wrote, "but rather he was actively putting in more arsenic in the water." 
The memorandum says bad public relations over such issues stems from an underlying problem that, "as with education, Social Security, and so many other issues, the Democrats have been expert at constructing a narrative in which Republicans and conservatives are the bad guys."
So the memorandum advises that Republicans stop emphasizing a choice between environmental protection and deregulation and instead become "a champion of national parks," the "best way to show our citizens that Republicans can be for something positive in the environment." The memorandum continues, "Being against existing laws or regulations has been translated as being against the environment."
Each party says Mr. Luntz's advice played a role in elections last fall, including the Senate race in Colorado, where the Republican incumbent, Wayne Allard, ran advertisements promoting his work with the Great Sand Dunes National Park and cleaning up nuclear weapons plants. 
"The thrust of the memorandum is consistent with what we tried to do with our campaign, to take issues which have real impact on people in Colorado and work on those problems," said Dick Wadhams, a spokesman for Senator Allard. "The Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters spent millions of dollars attacking Senator Allard and it didn't work." 
That kind of success will encourage more Republicans to embrace these strategies, party officials say.
"We have not engaged in the discussion as enthusiastically as we should on occasion -- there are so many governors around the country that have sterling environmental records," said Marc Racicot, chairman of the Republican National Committee. "We are going to talk about these issues a lot over the next election cycle." 
National environmental groups say the new strategy has improved the public's view of Republicans. "He's not saying, 'I am going to make environment my top priority,' " Ms. Haddow said of Mr. Allard's campaign. "He's saying: "You don't have to worry about me. I'm in sync with you.' "
"Luntz's advice is right," she said. "It's very smart -- confounding, troubling, but smart."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 13, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on March 2 about advice from a political strategist to the Republican Party on how to broaden its base by softening its language on the environment misstated an action taken by the Clinton administration to tighten standards for arsenic in water, a move the Bush administration delayed. It was a regulation, not an executive order.

Pakistan Says It Arrested Suspected 9/11 Planner
Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, suspected of planning of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington and one of the F.B.I.'s most wanted terrorists, was detained by Pakistani authorities, officials here said. The arrest represented a major victory in the American-led global search for pivotal leaders of Al Qaeda. 1

Iraq Begins Missile Destruction
Iraq began destroying its short-range Al Samoud missiles, crushing four of them under the supervision of U.N. weapons inspectors, the latest in a series of steps that Baghdad has swallowed in hopes of staving off war. There was no comment from the Iraqi government. 1

The Turkish Parliament dealt an unexpected setback to the Bush administration's plans for northern front against Iraq, narrowly failing to accept a measure that would have allowed American combat troops to use the country as a base for an attack. 1

The United Arab Emirates became the first Arab country to call for Saddam Hussein to step down, presenting the idea to a summit meeting of Arab leaders as the only way to avoid an American-led war and the devastation it could cause. 11

Iraq has placed surface-to-surface missiles within range of Kuwait in recent weeks, prompting a series of American air strikes and opening a new phase in the low-grade air war between Saddam Hussein's government and the Bush administration. 11

Hope Shrivels in Argentina
Just a few years ago, Argentina was a largely middle-class nation, with the highest per capita income in Latin America. But the economic crisis that began in December 2001 has turned millions of Argentines into paupers without jobs, hope or enough food for themselves and their children. 8

Scrutiny of Abuse Policy After Charges at Academy
The decision of the Defense Department Advisory Committee on Women in the Services to stop addressing complaints of sexual assault is receiving new scrutiny now that 20 women who are Air Force cadets have come forward saying their complaints were mishandled by the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. 26

U.S. Olympic Chief Resigns
Lloyd Ward resigned as the chief executive officer of the United States Olympic Committee. The resignation ended a two-month siege in which he resisted stepping down, despite having been punished for violating the U.S.O.C.'s ethics code. 1

Signs Urge End to Killings
Chicago's murder rates have been stubbornly persistent while those in many big cities have declined. Chicago's rate -- 22.3 killings per 100,000 -- is the highest among the nation's nine largest cities. All through one homicide-plagued neighborhood, a grassroots campaign of anti-violence signs is calling for peace. 16

Gay Adoption Ban Challenged
A federal appeals court in Atlanta will hear a challenge to the Florida law that forbids any adoption by a homosexual. This is the first time a federal court has considered the ban. Gay people are the only group categorically restricted from adopting children in Florida. 16

Message Shift on Environment
The Republican Party is softening language on the environment to appeal to suburban voters, speaking out for protecting national parks and advocating investment in environment technologies. 24

NASA Shuffles Investigators
NASA will move officials directly involved with the Columbia mission off the investigation into the loss of the shuttle to avoid possible conflicts of interest, according to letters released by the independent board in charge of the inquiry. 20

It was refreshing to read Toni Smith's thoughtful explanation for why she turns her back on the American flag during the pregame playing of the national anthem ("Player's Protest Over the Flag Divides Fans," Sports pages, Feb. 26). 
 The strength of our democracy has always depended on informed citizens who are willing to challenge highly questionable government policies and actions, especially those that could have long-term dangerous consequences for the health and safety of our country. 
 I applaud the president of Manhattanville College for supporting this brave young woman's right to express her opinion in a quiet and dignified protest against the growing economic inequality in the United States and the Bush administration's headlong rush to war with Iraq.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Cisco Seeks Bigger Role in Phone Networks

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
The telecommunications boom of the late 1990's was cruel to Cisco Systems. Now the company is trying to benefit from those harsh lessons.
 Cisco, which built its reputation in data networking equipment, angered many major telephone companies a few years ago by trying to expand its small share of the voice-and-data market by focusing on a group of upstarts that were competing with the telephone companies. Because Cisco acted as lender in a lot of those purchases, the company lost tens of millions of dollars on the deals when many of those start-up companies went bankrupt. 
 But Cisco's chief executive, John Chambers, has engineered a recovery that has left the company in surprisingly strong financial shape despite the continued technology recession, and Cisco Systems may be in a position to dip back into the telecommunications waters, wiser for its troubles.
As the major makers of telephone network equipment paddle furiously to keep afloat, particularly Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks, Cisco sees an opportunity to increase its relativelysmall share of that market -- this time by concentrating on traditional long-distance and local phone providers.
So far, telephone companies are still spending relatively little on new equipment. Some industry analysts say the lull has given them a chance to reassess their investment strategies. Once spending picks up, these analysts say, the phone companies may be more inclined to begin adopting a new generation of technology in which voice calls, video and other data are transported in the same manner as Internet traffic. Although a major changeover to such technology could be two decades away, any steps in that direction could be good news for Cisco, the current leader in Internet traffic-routing gear.
In recent months, in fact, Cisco has inked several deals of that sort with telecommunications companies, including AT&T and Sprint. To promote its push, Cisco operates a showroom at its headquarters in San Jose, Calif., displaying telephones that can be used to send and receive voice, e-mail and other Internet data.
"The longer the downturn lasts, the more opportunity there is for Cisco to build market share," said Tim Luke, a telecommunications analyst with Lehman Brothers.
So far, Cisco controls about 4 percent of the estimated $75 billion global telecommunications equipment market. Securing a firmer foothold in that market is crucial because Cisco's dominant position in the Internet market is showing signs of eroding as other companies enter the field, including Dell Computer and the Chinese company, Huawei Technologies. 
Cisco's financial soundness -- more than $21 billion in cash and equivalents, an annual revenue run rate of about $20 billion and a profit of around $1 billion in its most recent quarter -- could help make Cisco look like a solid vendor to the big phone companies at a time when Lucent and Nortel seem to be living quarter to quarter. 
With only about 20 percent of Cisco's revenues now coming from telecommunications companies, executives say that Mr. Chambers's long-term goal is to build telecommunications sales back up to 40 percent of revenue, but this time with most of it coming from major carriers like AT&T and British Telecom.
But Cisco may still have some trust and credibility issues to overcome. Not only are many telecommunications carriers still most comfortable dealing with longtime vendors like Lucent, Nortel and Alcatel of France, said Stephen Kamman, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, but there are fences to be mended with the conventional phone companies that recall Cisco as the supplier to their upstart competitors in the boom years.
The bigger challenge, though, will be inducing the carriers to begin scrapping hundreds of billions of dollars of network equipment that is based on conventional telephone network architecture and replacing it with newer, Internet-based technology that makes much more efficient use of network lines.
In the five years since the first experimental efforts in sending voice calls over the Internet, 10 percent of international voice traffic now travels by that means, as users seek to avoid the high tariffs that many foreign telephone companies charge to complete the calls. But among telephone companies in the United States, capital investments and institutional inertia are working against adoption of Internet-based technology, generally known as I.P., for Internet protocol.
"It's a bit like bringing an Apple Computer into a PC environment; you can do it, but people have tended to not want to try," said Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Verizon Communications, the nation's largest local telephone provider.
Eventually, the carriers know they will need to replace their aging network. Because Internet technology has proven itself a more efficient and flexible way to move digital information of all sorts, industry executives say the mass migration to Internet-based technology is simply a matter of time.
In the interim, "it's more expensive to operate two networks than one," acknowledged Charles H. Giancarlo, general manager for product development at Cisco. And yet, he said, "there's a general agreement that over the long run, it's cheaper to consolidate."
In the short run, telephone companies have begun integrating Internet-based technology at points along their networks. And even in this nascent piece of the market, Cisco is seeing competition from Lucent and the other big equipment vendors, which recognize the inevitability of Internet-based technology.
Telephone companies are not the only customers for such equipment. Businesses large and small have begun using Internet-based technology to route data and voice within their internal networks. Burger King and Ernst & Young are among Cisco's corporate customers for the systems, and Cisco has struck alliances with the phone companies AT&T, SBC Communications and Sprint to offer packages of equipment and service for the corporate market.
As the business world and carriers embrace Internet-based technology, Mr. Giancarlo predicted, telecommunications companies will develop pricing plans based not on individual telephone minutes but on services -- whether voice, data or video.
"We're moving from a world in which carriers charge for how long someone is on the phone and how far the call travels," he said. "We're moving to a world of bandwidth and services."
Within the telephone industry, even within individual companies, opinions are mixed on how fully and how soon Internet-based technology will arrive. Mr. Rabe, the Verizon spokesman, said the company already conducted a significant amount of business with Cisco and was generally interested in increasing its ties to Silicon Valley companies and their new technologies.
But a Verizon manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Cisco had "angered a lot of people by promoting the advantage of I.P., but not always acknowledging that it is expensive to deploy" and not always as reliable for voice traffic as conventional network technology.
"We get up in the morning knowing we have to move 1.5 billion phone calls on our network everyday," the manager said, "and there's no guarantee we can do it reliably with I.P. technology."
"We just can't roll out the technology because it's neat," he said.

HEADLINE: Panel on Nazi Art Theft Fell Short, Experts Say 

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
A Clinton administration commission on Nazi plunder failed to examine critical records pertaining to traffic in looted art before, during and after World War II, some leading scholars who worked on the inquiry now say. 
 The experts, historians and economists who worked from 1998 to 2000 on the panel, the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States, say that as a result it came up with a report that broke little new ground and failed to come to grips with the question of how much stolen art passed through American controls. 
 Several of the panel's leaders defend the work or say that shortcomings were results of lack of time, but in many quarters the report is perceived as a lost opportunity to provide definitive answers to questions that in many ways are being asked more now than anytime since the days just after World War II.
"The tents were folded much to the chagrin of many of us," said former Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of New York, and one of the commission's 21 members. "I felt we should have been doing much more than we did." 
Objections to the panel's work were so strong that some staff members said they contemplated writing a minority report. Their comments, and similar ones from leading experts in the field, were not publicly expressed when the commission reported its findings and came out in recent interviews about the search for missing Nazi plunder nearly 60 years after World War II.
Stuart E. Eizenstat, the former deputy Treasury secretary who urged the panel's creation and served as a member, acknowledged that the report did not go as far as he had hoped. "Lack of time was a major problem," he said. He added that the panel's mandate had proved too narrow and that its work had fallen short of what similar inquiries had uncovered in Europe. 
The chairman of the commission, Edgar M. Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress and the former chairman of Seagram, praised the overall work of the panel, which wound up two and a half years of work in December 2000 with a 313-page report, "Plunder and Restitution." But he said missing records and a lack of time made the inquiry into looted art difficult. "We didn't do as good a job as we could have," he said, adding that the commission had more success with its inquiries into missing financial assets. 
The report concluded that American authorities in Europe had made "extraordinary efforts" to find, safeguard and return art and other victims' assets but that their work had been compromised by conflicting wartime and occupation priorities and occasional acts of thievery by G.I.'s.
Yet the report did not, in the words of one of the panel's experts, Helen B. Junz, a former Treasury official, examine "the ways art was laundered into the U.S." 
Legislation creating the commission was passed by Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton in June 1998 while world attention focused on efforts to settle victims' long-dormant wartime claims against Swiss banks and insurance companies.
The panel's mission was to "conduct a thorough study and develop a historical record of the collection and disposition" of artworks, gold and other assets of Holocaust victims that came through American jurisdiction and "review comprehensively any research by others." 
The report noted that as early as 1946 the State Department had notified museums and other institutions that looted art was entering the United States. But the panel did not examine how museums responded. It also said that it had only preliminarily investigated "the possibility that looted art from Europe was trafficked through Latin America" and that this was among the issues it left "for others to pursue."
A scattering of artworks stolen from Jews and other victims of the Germans have turned up recently in some American museums. But how many of the estimated 10,000 to 100,000 works of museum quality that are still missing may have found their way into the country through Customs and the mails through Latin America, Canada or other channels has long remained uncharted despite State Department reports in the 1940's and 50's by a zealous art tracker, Ardelia Hall, and voluminous additional documentation. 
The National Archives hold more than 50 million records relating to World War II and the Holocaust, including more than a million pages of American occupation records about recovered cultural property.
In recent interviews scholars who worked on the panel said that rather than exhaust these channels, it focused on a search for possible American misdeeds, and it found few besides an episode of looting by soldiers from a train of Hungarian gold. 
Marc J. Masurovsky, director of research of the commission's section on gold and co-founder of the Washington-based Holocaust Art Restitution Project, which conducts research into wartime losses, said he had expected the panel to investigate "anything that came into the U.S., legally or illegally and all research done by others." But, he said, "90 percent of what we did was reinvent the wheel," restating well-known historical facts.
Aside from short general visits by staff members to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Getty, he said, museum holdings and records were not scrutinized. And while Congress had not given the commission authority to investigate private enterprises, "we could have worked around that" by studying federal import and auction records, Mr. Masurovsky said. Some of the disaffected staff members, he said, considered writing a stronger minority report. The final report, he said, "could be construed as akin to a whitewash." 
Carried out as he and other staff members had urged, he said, the investigation would have examined the Ardelia Hall records, European auction records and other investigative archives. 
But Mr. Eizenstat, who now heads the international trade and finance practice at Covington & Burling, a law firm in Washington, and is the author of a recent book on Nazi looting, said the commission's mandate limiting its inquiries to assets flowing through official United States control had been overly restrictive. He called for another international conference on the issue like one held in 1998 and for creation of a new foundation to continue the commission's work. 
Lynn H. Nicholas, a research adviser to the panel and author of the 1994 book "The Rape of Europa," which became a touchstone of art-looting scholarship, said the commission "started out with an agenda." "They were so anxious to find smoking guns in the misdeeds of the U.S.," she said, particularly G.I.'s stealing booty as commanders turned a blind eye. 
Gerald Feldman, a professor of history at the University of California at Berkeley and an expert on financial and insurance issues, said the panel "had some good scholarship but didn't do anything with it." He deplored the decision not to issue a multivolume comprehensive study of Nazi looting as documented by American authorities, similar to reports by the Swiss and Austrians. Instead, after the scholars weighed in, "the original research was distilled by nice young people who wrote the report," he said. "It was a quickie." In the end, he said, "this was a commission set up because they needed to set up a commission." 
Kenneth L. Klothen, the commission's executive director and the son of Jewish refugees from Nazism, said, "If documents had been available, we definitely would have gone after them." 
Mr. Klothen, former counsel to the Corporation for National Service, the federal agency that runs programs like AmeriCorps, said many could not be found. He said the panel had been handicapped by limited time and had no power to compel information. But he said efforts were under way to continue the commission's work as a citizens' commission constituted as a private nonprofit foundation.
Separately, Lucille A. Roussin, a lawyer, art historian and archaeologist who was deputy research director of the commission's art and cultural property section, said the panel should have searched harder for government records documenting the traffic in looted art. She was dismissed from her $55,000-a-year position after seven months and later sued in federal court in Washington, charging age discrimination. Dr. Poussin, who was 58 at the time, later settled her suit for $32,000. Mr. Bronfman wrote her a letter praising her work. 
In her complaint Dr. Roussin contended that the director of the commission's art unit, Jonathan Petropoulos, had obstructed her inquiries into the Metropolitan Museum and others and had blocked her efforts to inquire into Nazi-era transactions by the Wildenstein family of art dealers.
Dr. Petropoulos, professor of history at Claremont McKenna College in California and author of two books on Nazi art thefts, praised the commission's work and denied any effort to inhibit Dr. Roussin's inquiries. 
He said the commission had collected about 1,000 pages on the Wildensteins. "There was nothing conclusive," he said. 
The Wildensteins have consistently denied any art dealings with Nazi authorities in France.
Mr. Petropoulos said that since leaving the commission he had become a consultant to the Wildensteins in another lawsuit involving Nazi-era claims.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Wall Street has voiced confidence in Interpublic's new chief but questions whether he will succeed.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP of Companies in New York is scrambling to put the best face on the extraordinary executive shake-up orchestrated by its board last week, but doubts are multiplying about whether the restructured management team can pull off a turnaround at the agency company.
 Wall Street, after months of punishing Interpublic's shares for a series of financial and operational problems, had a generally positive view of the changes, though many analysts and investors did not get the outsider they wanted to clean up the mess at Interpublic. 
 But some on Wall Street -- along with Interpublic clients, employees and even competitors -- are wondering if anyone can reverse the flagging fortunes of the company as it endures difficulties that range from a federal investigation of its accounting procedures to mounting losses at a sports-marketing division. And the new top leader of Interpublic, David Bell, is likely to find himself contending with more bad news later this week, in the form of disappointing quarterly and annual earnings results, before he can try to get out any good news. 
The reshuffling in the executive suite sent JohnJ. Dooner Jr., the chairman and chief executive at Interpublic, back to the McCann-Erickson World Group, the division he headed before being promoted to lead Interpublic, the No. 2 agency company behind the WPP Group. Mr. Bell, the vice chairman, was named to succeed Mr. Dooner, whose return to McCann-Erickson was made possible by the dismissal of his successor there, James R. Heekin III.
The challenges facing Interpublic loom large as the agency company, along with its peers, struggle to avoid slipping into recession. Also, there are increasing indications that the latest Interpublic financial results, scheduled to be released on Thursday or Friday, will disappoint Wall Street considerably. That could reverse months of damage-repair efforts by Mr. Dooner and Sean F. Orr, the executive vice president and chief financial officer, whose assiduous courting of investors and analysts was met recently with increasingly diminished returns.
"Very simply, the No. 1 thing the new C.E.O. of Interpublic needs to do right away is cause Wall Street to have confidence in management, as quickly as possible," one senior Interpublic executive said.
"And that's something David has demonstrated before," the executive added, referring to Mr. Bell's tenure as chairman and chief executive at True North Communications before joining Interpublic. Mr. Bell cultivated close ties to the analysts at brokerage firms who follow ad agency stocks and helped sell True North to Mr. Dooner and Interpublic in June 2001 for $2.1 billion, one of the biggest deals ever on Madison Avenue.
One analyst who spoke with Mr. Bell on Friday, Michael Russell at Morgan Stanley in New York, had a mostly upbeat review of the changes.
"Wall Street in general preferred someone from outside" to take the place of the demoted Mr. Dooner, Mr. Russell said, "and Interpublic in general preferred someone from inside."
"David Bell is a little bit of both," he added.
Mr. Bell "is coming into a really, really tough spot," Mr. Russell said, "but at least he knows what he's getting into."
Another industry analyst, Joseph Stauff at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York, described Mr. Bell in a report he released on Friday as "a capable executive with a track record of returning True North to solid performance before it was ultimately acquired" by Interpublic.
That said, Mr. Stauff maintained his rating of "neutral" on Interpublic shares, which closed in New York Stock Exchange trading on Friday at $9.65, down 5 cents. The shares gained had 5 percent on Thursday on news of the executive reshuffling.
"Any material upside in the stock" from the management reorganization, Mr. Stauff wrote, "may be limited given the task at hand to get Interpublic back on track."
The relentless drumbeat of negative news from Interpublic, even after assurances that all the financial bombshells about earnings restatements and division losses had been dropped, has resulted in a nearly empty reservoir of good will among shareholders and analysts. And that may make the demands confronting Mr. Bell overwhelming, no matter how talented or capable he may be.
Mr. Bell "has trained his entire life for this moment," said E. Lund Friedman, a marketing consultant who has worked for automotive companies and their agencies, "but can he do it?"
Mr. Bell, in an interview on Friday, said: "We're going to be very visible, credible and aggressive to drive shareholder value. Reassuring Wall Street is all about financial performance and financial reliability and communication. All those are at the top of our radar screen going forward."
On Thursday and Friday, Mr. Bell said, he "touched base briefly with a number of those in the investment community, particularly analysts and our largest stockholders." Those efforts are to be expanded toward the end of March, he added, with "a large push" that would include steps like meetings, visits and conference calls.
Mr. Bell acknowledged the criticism that he has had little visibility as the Interpublic vice chairman for the last 20 months, during which time he handled duties like the oversight of a division known as the Partnership.
"In terms of communicating about the company the last two years, I've kept my mouth shut, I've been quiet," Mr. Bell said. "A holding company, and public companies, don't need multiple spokespeople, and it was clear it was John's responsibility."
"That changed yesterday," Mr. Bell said, referring to the shake-up on Thursday, "and we will communicate differently now."
Another issue facing Mr. Bell is the perception that he is in his posts on a temporary basis.
"He'll run the company for a year, and then the board will find someone to replace him," one executive said. "Or they'll simply wait and see how he does."
Frank J. Borelli, the member of the board who is the presiding director, sharply questioned any doubts about Mr. Bell's tenure.
"This is absolutely not an interim position," Mr. Borelli said in an interview. "The board from the get-go took this up as a permanent position."
"As long as David is willing to serve, and able to serve, he will do so," Mr. Borelli said.
Whether Mr. Bell finds that to be a vote of confidence, or the start of a clock ticking, will begin to be determined starting later this week.

Lately Readers Want Mixed Fare: Fluff, and Very Serious Reporting

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
SOMEONE looking to put a mood ring on the American psyche could do worse than to examine which magazines are selling on the newsstand. Figures released last month by the Audit Bureau of Circulations suggest that America is of two, seemingly opposite, minds: blatantly escapist, and loaded with gravitas.
 US Weekly, a bubbly mix of celebrity and exclamation points, had the biggest percentage increase in newsstand sales among general interest magazines, selling 55.2 percent more copies in the six months ending in December than it did the year before. US Weekly wins readers' hearts, if not their minds, by promising, "The truth behind the rumored troubles facing Brad and Jennifer." But The Atlantic Monthly, a 145-year-old magazine that promises, among other things, the truth behind the coming conflict with Iraq, has the second-biggest percentage increase, at 52.4 percent. 
 US Weekly, at 505,000 newsstand copies a week, sells almost nine times more newsstand copies each week than The Atlantic sells in a month, but The Atlantic is on a tear like no other in its long history. And The Atlantic is not the only Brad-and-Jennifer-free magazine that is engaging more newsstand consumers. At a time of flat sales in a brutally competitive newsstand environment, Mother Jones is up 48.8 percent according to its publisher, The New Republic is up 42.3 percent, Harper's Magazine is up 28.1 percent and The Nation is up 15.9 percent.
But for many readers, text-intensive magazines are the reading equivalent of Brussels sprouts, featuring sober articles at odds with the bawdy tropes that have dominated the newsstand for the last five years. From a business perspective, ruling the kingdom of class-over-mass magazines is a little like being the mightiest Chihuahua: the magazines rarely make money and most require the steady infusion of financing from their owners/benefactors. Their collective newsstand sales do not equal those of Real Simple, a glossy lifestyle magazine that sold an average of 335,000 copies in the last six months even though it is less than three years old.
The across-the-board ascent of policy-laden magazines still represents a significant shift for publishing. In the last year, The Atlantic has run term-paper length tutorials on Saddam Hussein's idiosyncrasies, a portrait of what postwar Iraq might look like and the domestic state of our union. The December issue of Harper's offered a preview of a war in Iraqby running a frightening article by a marine who served in the last Persian Gulf war. Both magazines have been offering serious articles for a long time, but the attenuating economy at home and pressing issues abroad have caused more people to pay attention.
"We are at a hinge moment in our history," said Cullen Murphy, managing editor of The Atlantic. "The country has to make a lot of decisions about how it behaves in the world, and whatever decisions it makes, they are going to last a long time." The Atlantic's new owner, David G. Bradley, increased financing and promotion for the magazine after he bought it three years ago, and readers apparently like the results.
The New York Times Magazine does not have to battle it out at the newsstand, but it does fight for readers' attention. Adam Moss, the editor of The Times Magazine, suggested that as times get harder, that fight gets easier.
"Times of change and anxiety make for very interesting journalistic opportunities, and for the most part, writers are rising to the occasion," he said. "In the 60's, for instance, it was pretty difficult to publish a bad magazine, and I think the same holds true for this period. Serious magazines are just better than they've been for a while -- a hungry market plus better product equals a serious magazine boom."
Esquire, which is up against racy, male-oriented newsstand behemoths like Maxim and FHM, published not one but two pieces of significant war reporting last August. Esquire's newsstand sales are up 17.9 percent, while FHM's are up 9.6 percent and Maxim's are up only a bit. (Maxim, to be fair, has a circulation of 2.5 million and sells almost 850,000 copies on the newsstand, while Esquire has a circulation of 740,000 and sells an average of 93,000 single copies.)
"People are clearly looking for perspective or reassurance," said David Granger, editor in chief of Esquire.
The last six months have not been kind to Time and Newsweek. Time's newsstand sales are down 32.3 percent and Newsweek's are off 35.8 percent, which might suggest that the trend toward the substantive has its limits but exactly how serious the newsweeklies are depends on the week. Regardless of approach, it would be difficult for the magazines to ascend to the post-9/11 heights that fueled weekly sales, and current newsstand numbers are still far above the numbers the magazines garnered in the 1990's.
The growing appetite for deeply reported narratives over bits and bites extends beyond narrow political magazines. Like many weeklies, The New Yorker is not matching its torrent of newsstand sales after Sept. 11, but overall circulation is up over 15 percent in the last five years, to 938,000.
"Something that began with the incineration of 3,000 people still seems quite close," said David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker. Last week, the New Yorker published a 20,000-word profile on Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United Nations, an assignment Mr. Remnick said would have been unthinkable a few years ago. "People very much want to know who is on the other end of the equation, whether it is Jacques Chirac or Osama bin Laden."
Even so, magazine readers seem to want both escape and reliable information on escape routes.
"It's the venerable bread-and-circus syndrome," said Mr. Murphy of The Atlantic. "The very same conditions that prompt a surge in seriousness also promote an escapist impulse, even in the same people. I spent last Monday editing a serious piece about the Middle East, and then went home and watched 'Joe Millionaire.' "

HEADLINE: Pondering Value of Copyright vs. Innovation 

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif., March 2 

 BODY:
Technology scholars, business leaders and policy makers gathered at California conferences this weekend to argue whether a mismatch between two different technologies and the legal policies that govern them could inhibit free expression and innovation.
 At one conference, held here at the University of California at Berkeley, the technology in question was software known as digital rights management, which allows copyright holders to set rules on how people can use a wide range of products, from DVD's to garage-door openers. 
 The use of such software has grown since the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was passed by Congress in 1998. The law, aimed at restraining Internet piracy, made it illegal to break the digital locks protecting copyrighted material. 
Carey Sherman, a lawyer for the Recording Industry Association of America, defended both the law and the technologies that have sprouted since it was passed. He said they enable copyright holders to offer users a wide range of digital material that would otherwise stay locked up for fear that it might be pirated.
But many speakers at the conference, sponsored by the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology, expressed concern that such technologies interfered with a tradition in which innovators figure out how a competitor's product works by taking it apart.
Joseph Liu, an assistant professor at Boston College Law School, said that the law could have a chilling effect on academic researchers. "When you're regulating activity this far upstream," he said, "you have to be careful of downstream effects."
Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, said digital rights management could be pushed too far. She cited as an example a preliminary injunction issued to Lexmark International by a federal judge in Kentucky on Friday against a company that makes generic replacement cartridges for Lexmark printers.
The court found that an electronic chip in Lexmark cartridges, which marks them as authentic, could be protected under the 1998 statute.
"We have ceded too much power to copyright owners," said Ms. Lofgren, who plans on Tuesday to reintroduce a bill that would amend the 1998 law. "People are afraid to proceed on innovative measures."
At the other conference, held at Stanford University, technologists, economists and lawyers clashed over how the airwaves should be allocated with the advent of technology that may make the traditional notion of "interference" between bands obsolete.
Some economists argue that rather than have the Federal Communications Commission allocate licenses, large chunks of the spectrum should be sold outright, creating a market economy for spectrum that, they argue, would drive down prices and spur innovation.
Others argued that as technology like software-enabled radios make it easier to communicate over the airwaves without interfering, such ownership rights are unnecessary and would only serve to limit the wide-ranging uses of the spectrum by requiring cumbersome transaction costs for whoever wanted to use it.
This conference -- organized by the Stanford Center for Internet and Society and titled "Spectrum Policy: Property or Commons?" -- featured a moot court that pitted Lawrence Lessig, a Stanford law professor, and Yochai Benkler, a New York University law school professor, representing the public-ownership side of the debate against Gerald R. Faulhaber, a business professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Thomas W. Hazlett, a senior fellow of the Manhattan Institute, taking the side of property.
One judge, Harold Demsetz, professor emeritus at U.C.L.A. business school, who acknowledged that his bias leaned heavily toward the property side, said he had been impressed with the debate, but he asked for more clarification.
"Go back to work and clear up this mess for us," Professor Demsetz said. "And don't take too long to do it because we're losing ground fast."

Why Mexico's Small Corn Farmers Go Hungry

BYLINE:  By TINA ROSENBERG 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
Macario Hernandez's grandfather grew corn in the hills of Puebla, Mexico. His father does the same. Mr. Hernandez grows corn, too, but not for much longer. Around his village of Guadalupe Victoria, people farm the way they have for centuries, on tiny plots of land watered only by rain, their plows pulled by burros. Mr. Hernandez, a thoughtful man of 30, is battling to bring his family and neighbors out ofthe Middle Ages. But these days modernity is less his goal than his enemy.
 This is because he, like other small farmers in Mexico, competes with American products raised on megafarms that use satellite imagery to mete out fertilizer. These products are so heavily subsidized by the government that many are exported for less than it costs to grow them. According to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy in Minneapolis, American corn sells in Mexico for 25 percent less than its cost. The prices Mr. Hernandez and others receive are so low that they lose money with each acre they plant. 
 In January, campesinos from all over the country marched into Mexico City's central plaza to protest. Thousands of men in jeans and straw hats jammed the Zocalo, alongside horses and tractors. Farmers have staged smaller protests around Mexico for months. The protests have won campesino organizations a series of talks with the government. But they are unlikely to get what they want: a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, protective temporary tariffs and a new policy that seeks to help small farmers instead of trying to force them off the land.
The problems of rural Mexicans are echoed around the world as countries lower their import barriers, required by free trade treaties and the rules of the World Trade Organization. When markets are open, agricultural products flood in from wealthy nations, which subsidize agriculture and allow agribusiness to export crops cheaply. European farmers get 35 percent of their income in government subsidies, American farmers 20 percent. American subsidies are at record levels, and last year, Washington passed a farm bill that included a $40 billion increase in subsidies to large grain and cotton farmers.
It seems paradoxical to argue that cheap food hurts poor people. But three-quarters of the world's poor are rural. When subsidized imports undercut their products, they starve. Agricultural subsidies, which rob developing countries of the ability to export crops, have become the most important dispute at the W.T.O. Wealthy countries do far more harm to poor nations with these subsidies than they do good with foreign aid.
While such subsidies have been deadly for the 18 million Mexicans who live on small farms -- nearly a fifth of the country -- Mexico's near-complete neglect of the countryside is at fault, too. Mexican officials say openly that they long ago concluded that small agriculture was inefficient, and that the solution for farmers was to find other work. "The government's solution for the problems of the countryside is to get campesinos to stop being campesinos," says Victor Suarez, a leader of a coalition of small farmers.
But the government's determination not to invest in losers is a self-fulfilling prophecy. The small farmers I met in their fields in Puebla want to stop growing corn and move into fruit or organic vegetables. Two years ago Mr. Hernandez, who works with a farming cooperative, brought in thousands of peach plants. But only a few farmers could buy them. Farm credit essentially does not exist in Mexico, as the government closed the rural bank, and other bankers do not want to lend to small farmers. "We are trying to get people to rethink and understand that the traditional doesn't work," says Mr. Hernandez. "But the lack of capital is deadly."
The government does subsidize producers, at absurdly small levels compared with subsidies in the United States. Corn growers get about $30 an acre. Small programs exist to provide technical help and fertilizer to small producers, but most farmers I met hadn't even heard of them.
Mexico should be helping its corn farmers increase their productivity or move into new crops -- especially since few new jobs have been created that could absorb these farmers. Mexicans fleeing the countryside are flocking to Houston and swelling Mexico's cities, already congested with the poor and unemployed. If Washington wants to reduce Mexico's immigration to the United States, ending subsidies for agribusiness would be far more effective than beefing up the border patrol.

HEADLINE: Democrats Pulling Together United Front Against G.O.P. 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Out of power, groping for a voice in an unfamiliar wilderness, Democrats in Congress have begun to put aside their differences and coalesce around a sharpened new criticism of President Bush's domestic policies.
 After a midterm election campaign that many Democrats considered fractious and muddled, party members in the House and the Senate have reached general agreement on how to address economic and social issues. They have instituted regular meetings with governors and like-minded interest groups to map out a strategy for weakening the legislative proposals of the administration, and claim credit for the president's somewhat weakened standing in opinion polls. 
 "We put a lot of thought into this last fall, after the election," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader and a principal architect of the strategy. "We knew we could do a better job of working with governors and outside groups to use our amplification system more effectively. Now we've got our rapid-response team going, our message of the week, and some of these things we've never really done before." 
The message has not won universal acclaim from party leaders around the country, some of whom continue to find it unfocused and repetitive of class-division themes. Democrats remain scattered on Iraq, a subject on which members are free to go their own way.
Even so, the assault on the administration's domestic policies has remained consistent in its unrelenting use of three domestic themes, as laid out by Mr. Daschle and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader.
First, they say, there is a "credibility gap" between Mr. Bush's words and his actions, an idea they apply to dozens of specific issues. The president's budget, they also contend, is too concentrated on tax cuts for the wealthy and does not provide enough for domestic security or medical and social needs. And finally, they say the budget's record-setting deficits threaten the economy and job growth.
The broad outline of these themes was set out in a joint appearance by Mr. Daschle and Ms. Pelosi at the National Press Club in January, the day before Mr. Bush's State of the Union address.
Almost every workday since, Democratic staff members have met to construct a message of the day to rebut whatever administration officials are saying. At a news conference on Thursday, Ms. Pelosi ridiculed Mr. Bush's claim that dropping the tax on dividends would help the elderly, saying most would receive minimal tax relief.
"It's that credibility gap again," she said, "the gap between the president's lofty political rhetoric and the harsh reality of his policy." 
Senate Democrats have also set up five "message teams" to deal with specific issues, putting Senator Jon Corzine of New Jersey, for example, in charge of economic issues, and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York in charge of domestic security matters. The senators brief their colleagues every Wednesday on plans for the week, and outside groups, including labor and civil rights leaders, meet with Congressional leaders on Mondays. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York is the liaison with Democratic grass-roots groups, and Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan regularly meets with hosts of liberal radio talk shows.
These efforts may seem obvious, and some have been employed by Republicans for years. But the extent of their use is a new response by a Democratic Party that often seemed to disagree with itself as much as with Republicans.
Forty Democrats supported President Bush's first tax cut plan in 2001, and last year many Senate Democrats reacted coolly when House Democrats proposed a package of tax cuts. The mixed message on social and economic issues was cited by members including Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the new House Democratic whip, as a principal reason the party lost ground in the November elections. 
Now, having lost the Senate and failing again to win back the House, Democrats are no longer burdened by the need to pass legislation and keep either chamber running smoothly, and many seem comfortable in their new defensive role.
Only one Senate Democrat, Zell Miller of Georgia, has signed on to Mr. Bush's latest tax cut, and many who supported cuts in 2001 say they cannot agree to the new package. With conservatives angry about the deficits and liberals angry about the proposed tax cuts, party members have been drawn together by what they consider to be the audaciousness of Mr. Bush's economic plans.
"All of a sudden, Democrats have a lot to talk about, and we're doing so," said Representative Martin Frost of Texas, a senior House moderate. "I think the Republicans are in serious trouble on the economy, thanks to the points we're making, and there's no doubt we've made it clear to people that their Medicare plan is totally unacceptable."
Democrats said their repeated criticism of an administration idea to restrict Medicare prescription drugs to people who join health maintenance organizations had all but killed the plan, and they claimed credit for dampening the enthusiasm to end the tax on stock dividends.
Republicans on Capitol Hill said they had their own problems with those proposals, but some acknowledged that the Democratic message has made their job harder by saturating talk shows and op-ed pages.
"They've got a pretty good machine going now," one Republican Congressional aide said. "It's not going to stop our momentum, but it could slow us down a little."
Democratic officials around the country say they are generally pleased that the Congressional leadership is taking on the White House aggressively, but some expressed reservations. May Scheve, the Democratic state chairwoman in Missouri, said the message seemed to be directed mostly at elite opinion makers, and was getting lost at the grass-roots level. Richard A. Harpootlian, the party's South Carolina chairman, said the "tax cuts for the rich" message was losing its force through repetition, and needed to be sharpened and made more hard-hitting.
"They're using a mantra when they should be talking about specifics," he said. "Show us a picture of Dick Cheney's former partner, and tell us how many millions he's going to make off this tax cut, and compare that to the few hundred bucks in most people's pocket. Make the argument that George Bush has surrounded himself by these people, the ones who elected him president. And don't get distracted by the war."
Even Senator Corzine said he would prefer that the party talk a bit less about the unfairness of the tax cuts and a bit more about the job losses under Mr. Bush's watch.
"I think we're better served by saying that the Republicans are failing to create jobs and are destroying wealth," said Mr. Corzine, one of the wealthiest members of Congress. "But either way, the subject matter is very clear, and I'm glad we're starting to use all the levers of dialogue that are appropriate."
Mr. Daschle acknowledged that the tax cut argument had its limits and risked alienating voters who aspired to wealth. Still, he said the credibility-gap theme was a "useful mantra" the party would repeat. 
"There's no question we've got to be careful not to alienate the very people we're trying to connect with," he said. "The trick is to find ways to do that effectively. President Clinton did such a good job of talking about these issues in ways that did not alienate those at the top, reminding people that there were more millionaires created under his administration than any other time. We need to find a way to do that, too."

HEADLINE: Algerians Give Chirac a Warm Welcome 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: ALGIERS, March 2 

 BODY:
Showered with confetti and flowers, cheered and applauded like a hero, President Jacques Chirac of France swept into this former colony today in the first state visit by a French president since Algeria won its independence in 1962.
 The adulation, which is expected to last throughout his three-day visit, gave Mr. Chirac a much-desired respite from those in Britain and the United States who have criticized his opposition to a war against Iraq by portraying him as a worm and as Joan of Arc in drag. 
 In a sign of confidence in Algeria's omnipresent security system -- and the quieting of terror incidents in the capital -- Mr. Chirac and President Abdelaziz Bouteflika greeted hundreds of thousands of well-wishers while standing and waving in a black Mercedes convertible limousine. 
Mr. Chirac plunged into the crowd along the corniche, zigzagging back and forth along the main boulevard to grab the hands of Algerians who had been kept away from him by iron railings and blue-uniformed policemen in white gloves and spats.
But the cries from the crowd were not cries of "Vive la France!" or "Vive Chirac!" Rather, the words heard over and over as Mr. Chirac reached out to touch the people that France once called its countrymen were, "Visa! Visa! Visa!"
The purpose of the trip is to redefine a tortured relationship that has grown even more complicated in the past decade as Algeria has been gripped by a civil war in which at least 120,000 people have been killed.
In a gesture -- but certainly not a pact -- of friendship, the two presidents signed a document titled the Algiers Declaration, intended to give "a decisive impetus" to a political dialogue, cultural and technical cooperation and an economic partnership. The goal, said the document, is to engage "in the construction of a shared future" without "forgetting the past." 
The most burning bilateral issue for ordinary Algerians, particularly the 70 percent of the population under age 30, is how to get easier access to France. With an unemployment rate that is officially set at 30 percent but is universally seen as much higher, many Algerian youths see an exit visa as their only way out of hopelessness. France is their first choice; Canada, because of French-speaking Quebec, comes next.
France gives about 180,000 visas to Algerians every year, but there are long delays, largely because of the civil war and terrorist acts against France that led to the closing of France's consulates in the country. With terrorism subsiding, France has reopened its consulates in Algers and Annaba and plans to reopen its consulate in Oran next year. 
About 120,000 people have died in the civil war that broke out in 1992 after the army canceled elections that an Islamic party was poised to win.
Without political stability and economic opportunities in Algeria, France fears an uncontrollable wave of Algerian immigration. 
Algeria is treating Mr. Chirac's visit like a momentous event in its postcolonial history, stage-managing every detail.
Mr. Chirac first came to Algeria as an army lieutenant during the 1954-62 Independence War, which cost 1.5 million lives and ended 132 years of French rule. Today he was greeted by honor guards and military salutes; sword-carrying, turban-wearing guards on horseback; drum-beating troupes, tribal dancers, off-key trumpeters and a girls' choral group.
Algeria bans all demonstrations and conferences except those with official government approval. Hundreds of thousands of people came out to greet Mr. Chirac, though certainly not the 1 million to 1.5 million estimated by security officials. 
The capital underwent rapid-fire, sporadic urban renewal. The buildings along Mr. Chirac's route were repainted bright white, their shutters and iron railings bright blue.Tons of garbage were collected, following a crippling two-day general strike last week, although tons more were left on side streets away from festivities. 
Mr. Chirac has called the trip an occasion to open a "new chapter" in the history of the relationship between the countries, and as a sign of good will, he returned to Algeria the silver seal of the city of Algiers that was given to the leader of the French expeditionary force by the last ruling official of Algiers when the French forces captured the city in 1830 and colonized the country. 
"The return of this symbol of the sovereignty of the Algerian state in my mind seals the meeting of our two countries and our peoples, a new advance in our relations," Mr. Chirac said in a brief statement.
Coincidentally, Mr. Bouteflika celebrates his 65th birthday today. Mr. Chirac gave him an original edition of the three-volume war memoirs of de Gaulle.
In turn, Mr. Chirac received the keys to the city of Algiers. He visited a neighborhood hit by deadly floods in 2001, which killed hundreds of people. He also laid a wreath at a monument for Algerians who fought against France.
But there was no escaping the looming American-led war against Iraq. Mr. Bouteflika praised Mr. Chirac for his antiwar stance, saying, "We appreciate the firm and wise attitude of France."
For his part, Mr. Chirac reiterated his position that Iraq must cooperate fully with United Nations weapons inspectors, adding, "There is an alternative to war."

HEADLINE: The Rush to War 

 BODY:
The Bush administration proved over the weekend that it can plan for war against Iraq and fight international terrorism at the same time. The capture in Pakistan of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a top operative of Al Qaeda who is suspected of planning the Sept. 11 attacks, was the most significant strike against the terror group since the United States dislodged the Osama bin Laden network from Afghanistan. America is safer today because Mr. Mohammed is in custody, and the C.I.A. and F.B.I. should be applauded for their role in his capture.
 But a cautionary note is in order. Pakistan's pivotal role in the seizure of Mr. Mohammed is one more demonstration of the importance of working in concert with other nations in the fight against terrorism. The United States cannot defeat Al Qaeda without the help of dozens of other nations. The same principle applies to Iraq. President Bush may be able to win a military victory against Saddam Hussein without broad international support, but he won't be able to rebuild Iraq, much less change the political and economic dynamics of the Islamic world, without a great deal of foreign assistance. 
 After a weekend of fast-moving events, including the destruction by Iraq of some of its illegal Al Samoud 2 missiles, Mr. Bush needs to take a deep breath. The White House seems increasingly intent on attacking Iraq, whether or not Baghdad disarms and whether or not the Security Council endorses a war. Mr. Bush may soon find himself forced to choose between going ahead with an invasion despite marginal international support, or bowing to demands by many allies to give inspectors more time. We believe more time is warranted to determine whether Iraq's dismantlement of missiles is a signal that Mr. Hussein is reconsidering his stubborn defiance of the United Nations and to see if a solution short of war is still possible.
It was a bad weekend for the war initiative. The Turkish Parliament failed to approve American plans to use Turkish bases as a staging ground for the invasion. Iraq's willingness to begin destroying its missiles is sure to give invasion opponents a stronger hand during U.N. debates this week. A White House spokesman's statement late last week that Mr. Bush would be satisfied only with the departure of Mr. Hussein appeared to shift the rationale for war to fit new circumstances.
The Turkish Parliament's vote, narrow though it was, conveyed an awkward message. Mr. Bush argued last week that invading Iraq would help bring democracy to the Middle East. A few days later, a parliament full of democratically elected Muslims rebuffed Washington's request to use Turkey as a springboard for an invasion of Iraq.
The missile destruction is important, though not proof that Iraq has changed course. Destruction was the only action possible if Iraq wanted to head off a Security Council resolution supporting invasion. Iraq has about 100 of the missiles, and it has so far destroyed only a few. 
We are not under any illusion that Mr. Hussein is disabling his missiles simply because he likes the idea. Iraq would never be making even these grudging concessions if American troops were not massed near Iraq's border. The U.N. must realize that whatever success it has achieved of late in getting Iraq to abide by its directives has come only because of American military might.
The threat of force, however, should not give way to the use of force until peaceful paths to Iraqi disarmament have been exhausted and the Security Council gives its assent to war. Everything that happened over the weekend underlines the fact that the United States should not invade Iraq without broad international support. Even if there is a quick military triumph, many things could go wrong over the long haul. The Turks could intervene militarily in northern Iraq to assert control over the Kurds there, who have established an autonomous -- and democratic -- government. The fragile Pakistani government could be toppled in an anti-American reaction, endangering the war on terror. Iraqi biological and chemical weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists. None of these events will necessarily happen, but the odds that they will are as good as the odds that a war will lead to the establishment of a peaceful, democratic state in Iraq.

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
Two Presidential Pals, Until 9/11 Intervened

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It was only two years ago that Vicente Fox was taking George W. Bush home to meet his mama. The infatuation between the new president of Mexico and the new president of the United States was in early bloom that February 2001 at Mr. Fox's family ranch in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato, where the two men wore his-and-his black cowboy boots and embraced the future on both sides of their 2,000-mile border.
 "Know that we consider you a friend to Mexico, a friend to Mexican people and a friend of mine," Mr. Fox said then in English, looking directly at Mr. Bush, the man who held the keys to an immigration deal that could have given legal status to 3.5 million Mexicans working in the United States. 
 Oh, how things have changed. As anyone who watches Mexican-American relations now knows, the Sept. 11 attacks intervened and the hopes for looser immigration in a nation attacked by outsiders collapsed with the World Trade Center. 
Mr. Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who was once a center of Bush II foreign policy, was sidelined for important allies against terrorism like Tony Blair and Vladimir V. Putin.
But now, like a suitor seeking out a lover he spurned, Mr. Bush is desperately pursuing Mr. Fox for Mexico's crucial vote on the United Nations Security Council in favor of a resolution implicitly authorizing an American-led attack on Iraq. And Mr. Fox, feeling neglected for the last 18 months, is holding out. The American president he once knew, Mexicans say, is gone.
"President Bush is somewhat a different person than he was," said a person who was at the last meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Fox, which came at an economic conference last fall in the Mexican resort of Cabo San Lucas.
"He's less relaxed, he's much more intense. And that intensity sometimes makes relations a little more complicated. There's very little small talk or banter. Bush was remarkable at making people like Fox feel very, very comfortable. Now he is driven by a single issue. But the fact is, Fox doesn't lose sleep every night over what Saddam Hussein is going to do."
At that meeting, Mr. Fox invited Mr. Bush to come to Mexico for a state visit in the middle of this year, perhaps to announce some progress on immigration, but at least to have the visit, with or without progress. Mr. Bush declined. 
"President Bush came back and said, 'Well, maybe we'll be at war then, and you may not want me to come because maybe it won't be a popular war,' " the person at the Cabo San Lucas meeting said. "The fact is, he wasn't addressing the issue that President Fox was bringing up."
Arturo Valenzuela, a former National Security Council officer for Latin American affairs, agreed with that assessment. "They did have a very strong relationship, a good chemistry," he said. "Unlike a lot of Mexican officials who are very intellectual -- very French, actually -- Fox is a business guy, so he comes from a different world. But it has soured. There is a sense that Fox feels that Bush has not understood his priorities."
There is equal exasperation on the part of a White House used to having its way, where there are still memories of Mexico's response to the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 
"There is a sense in the administration that Mexico didn't come through after 9/11," said a Latin American scholar close to both administrations. "They didn't say anything for several days. And even Mexicans were surprised. After a while, you have a distancing. Bush does keep score."
The White House also says that Mexico has been unrealistic in its hopes for an immigration deal after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
"That whole enchilada is not digestible in the U.S. political system," a senior administration official said last week, playing off the comment of Jorge G. Castaneda, Mexico's former foreign minister, who said in the summer of 2001 that the immigration deal had to be "the whole enchilada, or nothing."
Last week, after a call from Mr. Bush, Mr. Fox appeared to wobble from one hazy position to another on the forthcoming vote in the United Nations Security Council, where Mexico is one of six undecided nations the United States needs to assure that the resolution passes. This week, only three months before Mexico's midterm elections, Mr. Fox will remain under enormous pressure, pulled in one direction by the vast majority of his nation's citizens, who are opposed to war, and in the other by an insistent business community warning of what they see as the economic consequences of defying the Americans.
"There are no two nations in the world that are more interconnected than Mexico and the United States," said Juan Jose Bremer Martino, the Mexican ambassador to Washington, in an interview last week. 
For now, the betting in both countries is that economic considerations will ultimately force Mr. Fox to side with the United States, more than any love for the president he took home to Mama.

HEADLINE: A Question of Priorities 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Miracles frequently follow a period of back-breaking labor, so Joel Klein works a 15-hour day.
 A quiet, slightly built, middle-aged man who wears rimless glasses and can still daydream about being a point guard for the Knicks, Mr. Klein was Mayor Michael Bloomberg's pick to turn the New York City public school system around. 
 The mayor pulled off one miracle by somehow seizing almost complete control of the system, which has 1,200 schools and more than a million students. Miracle number two would be to make this behemoth of a system thrive. That's Mr. Klein's job. 
Now try to imagine doing that job while dismantling fundamental classroom programs and escorting thousands of teachers to the unemployment lines. With Gov. George Pataki proposing a nearly half-billion-dollar cut in state education aid to the city, and with the city mired in deep budget troubles of its own, that unhappy (and ultimately destructive) sequence is what's facing Mr. Klein and the children in his charge.
The schools chancellor remained low-keyed about the governor's proposed cuts during an interview last week in his office in the renovated and stunningly beautiful Tweed Courthouse, which is now the headquarters of the Department of Education. The nation may be revving up for war, and financial support for public education may be hemorrhaging, but there is still a generation of kids to be served.
"Whatever money I have, I'm going to work toward raising standards for kids," he said. "I'm not going to get into the excuse game."
But he also noted that he has already cut more than 1,000 bureaucratic positions from the Education Department, and made additional cuts at the local district level. "I honestly believe that we're now at the point where significant new cuts will start to chew into the muscle of the operation," he said.
"After we've whittled away at the bureaucracy, we spend money principally on teachers, on professional development, on support staff and on our after-school and summer school programs. None of those things are things we need fewer of. They are things we need more of."
The New York City school system is at an extraordinary moment in its history. The levers of power have been taken over by a mayor who has staked his prestige on his ability to improve the schools, and his energetic, innovative chancellor, a former federal prosecutor who has already embarked on a top-to-bottom overhaul of the system.
If they get it right, New York will become the education model for big cities across the country, much as it became the model for urban crime-fighting in the 1990's.
But they cannot get it right if the system is starved of funds needed for even the most basic improvements.
Mr. Klein stressed the importance of the classroom experience in the earliest grades for public school youngsters, especially those who are disadvantaged. "We're always playing catch-up," he said. "If a child's in fourth, fifth or sixth grade and is half a grade or a grade behind in reading and math, the challenge is so much greater."
What is potentially tragic about the Pataki budget proposal is that it would wipe out support for pre-kindergarten programs and cripple efforts to reduce class sizes in the earliest grades in school systems throughout the state. Chancellor Klein told state legislators last week that if the governor's proposal stands, New York City will lose 43,000 pre-kindergarten seats.
Despite the funding problems, Mr. Klein is moving ahead with his efforts to remake the New York City system. He has established a strong new management team and is putting together a Leadership Academy that he hopes will result in a new generation of exceptionally well-qualified and creative principals.
And he holds on to the hope that somehow the funds needed for a viable school system will be found.
"It's true that education can be expensive," said Mr. Klein. "But how much more costly is ignorance?"
He added: "There is no more important investment that American society can make than in its schoolchildren. If we're going to end these cycles of poverty and all the other 'catch-up' problems that we're trying to fix at the wrong end, we need to put our highest priority on public education. So in terms of my view of social policy, I think that more resources in this system is where we should go. That's one man's view."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: KARACHI; 
Tens of Thousands Stage Pakistan's Biggest Protest

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, March 2 

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of Pakistanis marched in Karachi today to oppose a military attack on Iraq, shouting "God is Great!" and warning their president to not to buckle under to the United States. 
 The demonstration, organized by a powerful coalition of conservative Islamic parties, was by far the largest yet in the country by opponents of an Iraq war. Independent estimates of the crowd ranged from 70,000 to more than 200,000 -- far below the million-plus figure promised by organizers, but a potent sign of the clashing pressures on President Pervez Musharraf as a crucial vote nears in the United Nations. 
 The same religious groups have called for another "million-man march," as they have been describing it, next Sunday in Rawalpindi, near this capital city and where the president resides. They have vowed to hold similar marches in every major city. 
The demonstrations followed on the heels of the arrest on Saturday of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, one of the most wanted leaders of Al Qaeda. If pressure at home leads the government to decide, despite the American pressures, to abstain on a United Nations resolution that would open the way to war with Iraq, rather than support it, the arrest will serve as a reminder to the Bush administration of Pakistan's central role in the drive to exterminate Al Qaeda. 
The high-profile arrest may also help blunt American concerns that Pakistan is not acting forcefully enough to curb its own Islamic militants.
Pakistan sits on the United Nations Security Council this year and holds one of the swing votes that could mean success or failure for the new proposal by the United States, Britain and Spain to condemn Iraq's record and justify military action. 
General Musharraf survived an excruciating turnabout and protests once before, after the Sept. 11 attacks of 2001, when he ended Pakistan's support for the Taliban and became close partners with Washington in its campaign against terrorism. He called that the only realistic choice for the nation, which could not survive economic isolation by the West. 
Many Islamic leaders and fervent Muslims here were never happy with that decision. Now, with growing public resentment of American power and what many regard as Washington's persecution of Iraq, a fellow Muslim nation, General Musharraf faces another politically dangerous choice. He will soon have to vote yes or no, or to abstain, on this matter seen as vital by the United States, his most important international ally. 
Demonstrations over Iraq will be large and volatile, but are unlikely to bring down the government, said Rasul Baksh Rais, a political scientist at the Lahore Institute of Management Sciences.
"This vote puts Pakistan in a very difficult position," Mr. Rais said. "But I think those who are running the state are very pragmatic and realistic."
"They know that Saddam Hussein is finished," he said. "In public, they can't stand out in support like Tony Blair has, and they need to keep stressing our concern for the people of Iraq, if not Saddam Hussein himself." 
For all the public emotions being vented, experts here note, Pakistan also has important financial ties to Saudi Arabia and other Islamic states in the Persian Gulf that are quietly supporting the American squeeze on Iraq. 
Pakistan officials say they will not decide on their Security Council vote until after March 7, when the United Nations inspectors are to report about Iraq's cooperation.
At today's rally in Karachi, which proceeded peacefully, there were a handful of pictures of Osama bin laden and Mr. Hussein. Some carried signs with slogans like "No blood for oil" and "Global terrorist: America." White banners simply saying "God is great" were most common.
Large numbers of women were among the crowd, which heard emotional speeches from many of the Muslim leaders who formerly praised the Taliban and who now are in the forefront of the rising Islamic political coalition that won 25 percent of the seats in parliamentary elections last fall. 
Their warnings, to the United States and to General Musharraf, were not subtle. "The people will never forgive the government if it supports the United States against Iraq," said Qazi Hussain Ahmed, a top leader of the Islamic coalition. 
Syed Munawar Hasan, secretary general of Jamaat-e-Islami, the largest single religious party, said, "Pakistan must use its U.N. vote to foil the American intentions." 
The crowd included some people with broader antiwar feelings but was dominated by religious students and militant believers, who make up a significant minority in Pakistan. "Unity is the only way to save the Muslim world from the American infidels," said Mohammad Shafique, 40, a shopkeeper from a poor suburb of Karachi. "America is the enemy of all Muslims, not only Iraq." 
Allama Shah Ahmed Noorani, another top leader of the Islamic coalition and a recently elected senator, told the crowd that Pakistan's Parliament should oppose the presence of American forces on the country's land. "The American army should leave, and Pakistan should not allow them to use any air base in our country," he said.
Maulana Fazlur Rehman, a prominent cleric, said millions of Muslims around the world stood with Mr. Hussein. If the Pakistani government does not change its current pro-American foreign policy, he said, the people of Pakistan will force it to do so. "We do not want war -- we want peace," he said.

HEADLINE: From Political Calculation, a Sweeping Vision of Ground Zero Rose 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Just weeks after the World Trade Center attack, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki began to imagine the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan, and they immediately saw two problems. 
 The first was Mark Green, the leading candidate for mayor, a Democrat, and a man neither Republican officeholder could abide. As mayor, he would assert significant influence over the rebuilding effort. 
 The second was Mr. Pataki's own re-election bid the following year. Appearing to exert too much control over the rebuilding effort would leave Mr. Pataki vulnerable to charges of manipulating the city's grief to his political ends. 
That is why on Nov. 2, 2001, four days before New Yorkers went to the polls to choose the mayor who would see the city through the first phase of rebuilding, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki announced that the effort would be directed by a new agency, the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corporation. The agency would help dole out billions of dollars in federal aid to the city and oversee the effort to create a fitting memorial to the victims. 
The creation of that corporation set off what could have been any government operation -- a plodding, obtuse process run by bureaucrats with little public participation. Instead, it evolved into a grand public discussion about architecture, public space and the nature of memory. 
A confluence of factors produced that result, from the political races to New Yorkers' apparent need to work out their grief by reconstructing something that had been lost. But the greatest factor, it seems, was essentially a large misunderstanding -- the public's perception of an initial round of designs for the site that looked like little more than white blobs on a map.
From the beginning, it was clear that the governor would control the endeavor. He appointed 7 of the corporation's 11 board members, including its chairman, and it became a subsidiary of Empire State Development, the state's economic development agency, run by one of the governor's closest allies. Another Pataki confidant, Louis R. Tomson, was appointed president, overseeing the corporation's day-to-day operations.
It was not surprising, then, that last week, nearly 16 months later, Mr. Pataki lobbied for and ultimately secured the selection of his preferred choice, Studio Daniel Libeskind, as the architect for the rebuilding of the trade center.
Yet while Mr. Pataki has exerted major influence over the initial rebuilding effort, the evolution of the agency, known later as the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, is far from a cut-and-dried case of political muscle.
In between its founding and last week's decision, it transformed itself into an agency with its own momentum, engaging the public in an architectural project of immense scope in ways public policy experts never imagined. 
"Our greatest challenge has been to restore a sense of optimism to a city still suffering from a savage attack, and to create a planning process to address the wishes of so many stakeholders," Mr. Tomson said at a news conference to unveil the winning design. "There were many times when reaching consensus seemed nearly impossible, and we certainly made mistakes along the way."
The effect of the process on life in the city, too, was so unusual that it was sometimes disorienting. Bartenders debated the merits of Mr. Libeskind's design with customers. Rafael Vinoly, the second-place architect, was discussed on talk radio. At the World Financial Center, tens of thousands of families, students, young professionals and tourists viewed an exhibition of architectural models, the tiny balsa-wood streetscapes normally seen only in the offices of developers and condominium salespeople.
That outcome did not seem likely on Nov. 29, 2001, when the development corporation's board was introduced. Heavy with business and financial types, it had but one representative of the downtown residents, small businesses and cultural institutions that were hardest hit by the attack's economic fallout. 
"At least we got one," said that representative, Madelyn Wils, the chairwoman of Community Board 1, whose responsibilities include the trade center site. "I intend to be a loud voice."
Others, too, began to raise their voices. Michael R. Bloomberg, who had defeated Mr. Green in the mayoral race, and who had opposed the formation of the development agency during his campaign, established himself as both an ally and a counterweight to Mr. Pataki, and gained a greater role for the city. John C. Whitehead, the developmentagency's chairman, and Roland W. Betts, one of its directors, stepped into a void created by Mr. Pataki's public detachment. Mr. Whitehead began to reassure downtown business leaders that the corporation would be free from political pressures, a statement Mr. Pataki's staff members said they could have lived without. And Mr. Betts, known to many of the city's power brokers as a personal friend of President Bush's, emerged as one of the board's most active members, overseeing its site-planning committee.
Throughout the winter and early spring, the development corporation was in what Mr. Whitehead referred to as "listening mode," meeting with advisory committees and groups of residents, commuters, business people and others. But as the cleanup of the trade center site progressed faster than expected, concerns surfaced that once the recovery was complete, New York would be left with a vast hole and no plan to fill it.
To alter that perception, the corporation published an outline of its rebuilding goals in April that called for critical changes to the downtown area's transportation systems, economy and traffic patterns for pedestrians and automobiles.
New Yorkers responded with an outpouring of opinion, challenged some of the assumptions that rebuilding officials had adopted. In January, for example, Mr. Whitehead said that another 100-story building on the site would not be practical or appropriate. But at a public hearing in May, the overwhelming message was to put up tall towers. 
Several architects in the last round of the design competition proposed just that, and Mr. Libeskind's plan includes a building with a restaurant at the 110th floor, although commercial offices would stop at about the 70th floor.
By late spring, most rebuilding officials had agreed to a general outline that re-established Greenwich and Fulton Streets through the trade center site, cutting its 16 acres into four parts. The southwest quadrant, where the twin towers had stood, was thought by many to be the logical place for a memorial. 
Such a plan would allow significant space for a memorial, therefore thwarting arguments by some victims' relatives that the entire site should be left untouched. The remaining three quadrants could accommodate commercial development, restoring an income stream for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
In July, Mr. Pataki made it so. In the heat of his re-election bid and just before the first site plans were unveiled, he told a forum of family members, "We will never build where the towers stood," all but sealing the decision that the memorial would be in that southwest quadrant.
Days later, a first set of plans, developed by the architectural firm Beyer Blinder Belle, was unveiled at the historic Federal Hall on Wall Street. Even before the plans became public, however, rebuilding officials recognized that they were uninspired. Mr. Whitehead said that if they did not create "the kind of beautiful center that we want this to be, then we will change our plans."
The plans were overwhelmingly rejected, but not necessarily because they were so different from what was ultimately embraced. The criticism voiced most often at a meeting of 4,500 people at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center was not that the land-use plans were faulty, but that the building models were ugly.
The Beyer Blinder Belle plans were presented in a uniform fashion, using what architects call massing models -- nondescript white blocks that represent buildings. Rather than try to portray architecture, they are simply functional, and they madethe plans look uniformly bland.
The development agency's learned a critical lesson from the July experience: the public responds less to concepts than to concrete models. A second round of designs was prepared by seven new teams of architects who were encouraged to include dazzling graphics and models. 
Nearly all their efforts, including that of Mr. Libeskind, took the same four-quadrant approach to the site. But this time the architects challenged the imagination of New Yorkers with odd-shaped buildings, public spaces 70 floors above ground, and conceptual approaches to the memorial that went beyond the design limits that had been set out.
When the plans were unveiled, the first to present his design was Mr. Libeskind. When he finished, a smattering of polite applause began, then crescendoed to a roar, signaling that someone had found a way to capture the essence of the tragedy of ground zero and the hope of a rebuilt, and recovered, Lower Manhattan.

SCENARIOS FOR WAR

BYLINE:  Agence France-Presse

 BODY:
 SCENARIOS FOR WAR -- Overthrowing President Saddam Hussein might give the United States more muscle in the Middle East and beyond, but it will not necessarily guarantee a safer, more stable Iraq over the longer term, the London-based Royal Institute of International Affairs said in a report, "Iraq: The Regional Fallout." The institute, also known as Chatham House, is one of Britain's most respected foreign policy research organizations. Six of its Middle East experts contributed to the report, which explores three scenarios for Iraq if war breaks out: a quick American military victory and occupation, a coup d'tat against Mr. Hussein, and a Vietnam-style protracted military conflict. It rated the chances of a coup against Mr. Hussein as "not great," while a quick victory would tempt Washington to take a "minimalist approach" to deal with Iraq's internal problems -- not least because American voters would want President Bush to focus more on a flagging economy. Protracted conflict, meanwhile, would produce "the worst possible outcome" for Iraqis, the world community and Mr. Bush himself, depending on the success of Mr. Hussein's plans for stalling an American invasion.

SENSITIVITY IN QATAR -- The gulf emirate of Qatar is so sensitive about allowing American warplanes to operate from its territory that it is refusing news media access to Al Udeid, one of the man air bases for American forces. American military sources do not discuss the issue in public for fear of upsetting the country that has provided a mobile headquarters base for the United States Central Command under Gen. Tommy R Franks. But the Pentagon says it hopes Quatar will relent. "It's the first time they've done anything like this and they are understandably being very cautious," one source said. American officials briefing reporters in Washington over the week-end confirmed that news media access to the sprawling base outside Qatar's capital, Doha, was still impossible because of sensitivities of the host nation. Baghdad has warned that it will treat any country that permits American forces to use its territory to launch an attack on Iraq as an enemy. (Reuters)

INTERPOL ON ALERT -- The secretary general of Interpol, Ronald Noble, has urged police forces worldwide to be ready for terrorist attacks in the event of a war on Iraq. Mr. Noble also acknowledged over the weekend that he had ordered Interpol's general secretariat in Lyon, France, and its regional offices in Africa, Asia and the Americas to be placed on a higher state of alert if war broke out "Simple prudence dictates a heightened level of awareness," he said in remarks at Tufts University. "Interpol and the world's police forces must prepare themselves for any potential increase in terrorist attacks if there is a war," Mr. Noble said. Interpol believes targets in countries supporting the war could be under higher risk of terrorist attack. Interpol, set up in 1923, works to encourage cross-border criminal police cooperation. (Angece France-Presse)

KARZAI CONFIDENT OF AID -- President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan said he had been promised continued support form the United States for his country's fledgling institutions, despite concerns that a looming conflict with Iraq could draw away troops and money. In an interview with CNN over the weekend, Mr. Karzai said that he got a "good promise" of help for irrigation projects, which he said would be a priority for the coming year. Mr. Karzai said he hoped that there would not be a war in Iraq, but that Afghanistan would support the United States in its efforts to oust President Saddam Hussein. "We are with the Iraqi people," he said, and added, "We are a friend of the United States. The U.S. has helped us in the time of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the U.S. has helped us now. We're not going to leave our friends unsupported, unhelped."
 (Agence France-Presse)

POPE SENDS PEACE ENVOY -- An envoy for Pope John Paul II will travel to Washington to urge President Bush to pull back from the brink of a war with Iraq. The pope, 82, set the tone for the visit when he told pilgrims in St. Peter's Square over the weekend that "every possible route" should be taken to avoid war. "Without surrendering to difficulty, we must search for a god down every possible route to avoid war, which always brings with it mourning and grave consequences for everyone," he said in his weekly homily. Italian newspapers quoting Vatican sources said the message, to be carried by Cardinal pio Laghi, who is retired, to the White House will urge Mr. Bush to make "every effort" to avoid going to war with Iraq. The pope has chosen his messenger carefully. Cardinal Laghi, 80, is a longtime family friend of former President George Bush, a friendship fostered during the 1980's when he was th eVatican's first ambassador to Washington.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC PULSE: The Northwest; 
Rising Tide of the New Economy Recedes in the Pacific Northwest

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 2 

 BODY:
When President Bill Clinton came to Seattle 10 years ago as the host of a Pacific Rim economic summit, this city was his stage and his symbol. Looking to the next century, he held Seattle up as a New Economy role model for the rest of the country.
 After all, coffee, music, apples, wine, software, airplanes, even potential cancer cures, were sailing out of the Puget Sound area -- the most trade-dependent part of the country, with particularly close ties to Asia. Microsoft, the hometown company, was minting fresh millionaires by the month, and the entire region was pulsing with creative energy from technology spinoffs. 
 At the same time, Seattle was still holding onto some of the highest-paying factory jobs in the world. 
For much of the 1990's, national magazines touted Seattle as the best place for business, and Portland, Ore., as the most livable city in the United States. The Puget Sound area economy was growing at twice the national rate, and per capita income was 20 percent above the national average.
But now the very attributes that made the Pacific Northwest look like the vanguard of the new-century economy have come back to haunt this region. A staggering Asian economy, the worldwide downturn in the airline industry and the dot-com bust dealt a triple blow to the area.
"The upside of getting ever more connected to the global economy is you can really ride that wave when things are going well," said Eric Liu, who was a domestic policy adviser to President Clinton and who now lives in Seattle. "The downside is that the ripple effects tend to get magnified."
Over the last year, no place in the country has had higher unemployment than this region. Washington, Oregon and Alaska have all posted unemployment rates of about 7 percent. While only a few years ago the Northwest was the nation's top new job producer, it now ranks among the leaders in job losses. The Seattle area alone stands to lose about 80,000 jobs before the economy here turns up, projected for late next year.
And in Oregon, which had almost no unemployment at the height of its mid-1990's transition to a "silicon forest" of computer chip factories, state revenues are so anemic that the school year has been cut by three weeks to five weeks in places and prisons are releasing some felons early.
Those who flocked to Seattle in the high-flying 90's cannot believe the turnaround.
"When I moved here four years ago from Los Angeles, I had no trouble getting a job, just like that," said Lashawn Baldwin, 33, a mother of three. She took a maternity leave from her health care clerical job, which paid $13 an hour, and then the job disappeared. She has not been able to find a job nearly as good since trying to return to the work force.
"I've had resumes out for two months, but no one's called," Ms. Baldwin said. "I'm thinking of moving back to L.A."
The entire picture is certainly not grim. Some of the area stalwarts are still going strong and have managed to ride out the storm. Starbucks, started in the early 1970's in Seattle's Pike Place Market, last month reported the most profitable quarter in its history, selling more than a $1 billion of lattes and other coffee confections.
The world's biggest software company, Microsoft, is still hiring new employees while sitting on nearly $40 billion in cash at its global headquarters just across Lake Washington. And the airplane company born in a barn along the Duwamish River, Boeing, is still turning out planes, although its world dominance is gone.

'That Mid-1990's Frenzy'
 Starbucks attributes its good fortune in a time of economic sickliness to being ingrained in the daily routine of millions of people. A $3 latte, Starbucks says, is "an affordable luxury." Microsoft, though still looking for the next golden goose on a par with its money-making operating system, generates enough sales of software for personal computers and games so that it weathered a storm that reduced many other software companies to a fraction of their value.
But most other smaller New Economy companies -- and even some former giants -- are floundering. The dream of a world hooked to a virtual market by a computer click persists, but it no longer generates thousands of new jobs or Wall Street investment capital.
"Seattle did get caught up in that mid-1990's frenzy," said Susannah Malarkey, executive director of the Technology Alliance, a private group that promotes New Economy companies. "The fundamentals are still there. We've got an awful lot of talent and smart people in the area. But perhaps we now need the rest of the world economy to lead us out of the hole we're in."
The economic drop-off has left state governments reeling. Washington has no state income tax, Oregon has no sales tax and Alaska no statewide general tax at all. But these tax structures, which have been so attractive to companies that could locate anywhere in the world, are now a drag on these states, as it does not give them a way to make up their deficits quickly.
Facing a $2.4 billion shortfall, Gov. Gary Locke of Washington, a Democrat, has called for slashing of state services while deferring raises for teachers, which voters approved in the boom years.
Oregon has been the hardest hit because of budget shortfalls, in large because of a series of voter-approved measures that cut taxes and required surpluses to be returned to taxpayers. Now, to make up a $740 million deficit, Oregon plans to cut up to a third of all state police employees. The state already has the shortest school year in the nation because of cuts.
The first warning sign of ripples from Asia hit the shores of Puget Sound in 1998 at a moment when money seemed to come out of thin air. Boeing was so desperate for workers it was flying them in from around the country, and an economist calculated that one in every five workers at Microsoft was a millionaire, on paper.
Even Boise, Idaho, long known as sleepy burg run by potato magnates, became a New Economy darling, attracting thousands of educated workers to its tech companies like Micron. Amazon.com, selling books at first, and then nearly everything else from a virtual market with a real headquarters in Seattle, made old-shoe economists believe that many brick-and-mortar stores would follow Hula Hoops into the retail museum.
"It was hard to imagine a better time for any place," said Dick Conway, an economic consultant in Seattle who puts together a regional forecast for business and political leaders.
But even as starter castles proliferated on Lake Washington, as Amazon clerks counted down the days until they could cash out stock options, the roaring economies of Asia retreated. Japan, South Korea, even parts of China, paused, stumbled and crashed.
For Seattle, it meant that orders for airplanes built in factories around Puget Sound were canceled. For farmers, it meant markets that were supposed to be their salvation turned cold. By 2000, Washington apple growers, once proudly independent, were accepting government handouts and subsidies, like so many other American farmers.
For fishermen in Alaska, who had flourished with global sales while the fishing industry all but disappeared elsewhere in the country, it was the same story. Japan still wanted wild Alaskan king salmon. But once trade barriers fell, the Japanese market was flooded with Alaskan salmon and prices plunged.

Timber Takes a Hit
 Even timber, a Northwest trading staple since 19th century railroad barons laid eyes on the carpet of green west of the Cascade Mountains, slumped because of a worldwide glut in wood. The biggest complaint from Northwest timber owners these days is not about the spotted owl, a tiny bird whose imperiled status forced a major retreat from logging of public lands, but Canada, which is flooding the market with competitively priced wood -- even with a stiff tariff on top of it.
The second major blow was the worldwide bust in high tech and all its peripheral bubbles. With that burst, many companies disappeared, selling back office furniture for 10 cents on the dollar. The companies that survived, like Amazon.com, saw their net worth reduced to a fraction of what it had been. Only Microsoft, whose stock was cut in half from its high, has survived relatively intact, and has continued to hire, with a job base of about 25,000 workers in the Seattle area. Finally, the attacks of Sept. 11, while particularly brutal to the New York economy, also hit this region hard, hammering the airplane industry.
And nobody is predicting a quick recovery. If anything, the Northwest is projected to lag behind the rest of the country, said Chang Mook Sohn, the chief economist for Washington State.
While other states can recover as the normal economic cycle becomes more robust, the trade-dependent Northwest will have to wait for the rest of the international economy -- particularly that in Asia -- to rebound in order to see a big upturn, economists say.
The prolonged downturn may be causing lasting damage, especially at Boeing, which is still the region's largest single employer, with about 60,000 workers. The concern is that so many jobs have been lost that the skills needed to make airplanes are disappearing.
"The average Boeing machinist is 47 years old," said Connie Kelliher, a spokeswoman for the International Association of Machinists, which represents airplane assemblers. "They've literally skipped a generation. And that's a huge concern to us."
The machinists' local here has gone from a high of 39,000 members in 1999 to 17,000 now, said Ms. Kelliher. The average wage is $26.50 an hour. Increasingly, Boeing contracts out large portions of its airplane assembly jobs to cheaper sources overseas.
At the same time, the company that once called itself "plane maker to the world" has suffered a steep loss in market share to its European rival, Airbus, and now books barely 50 percent of new airplane orders. This year, for the first time, Airbus could deliver more planes than Boeing.
Boeing moved its corporate headquarters out of Seattle to Chicago in 2001, but still makes most of its commercial airplanes here. Its officials say they are in the airplane business for the long haul, but that they have been developing a new business model, with airplane assembly scattered around the world. Also, Philip M. Condit, the president of Boeing, says that half the company's revenue now comes from space and defense contracts.
Still, many machinists in Seattle are nervous that the company is phasing out its airplane business altogether.
"Are they going to be making airplanes in 15 years?" Ms. Kelliher asked. "If so, where will that next generation of machinists come from -- here in Seattle, or overseas?"
Others are happy that they never went to work for the company, which once seemed so stable it was part of the landscape.
Dave Mayer works a 40-hour, three-day-a-week job as a forklift operator, but has been seeking work during the other four days. At the height of the Boeing boom, he thought of taking training course that would have allowed him get on at the company.
"Now I'm glad I didn't take the training," said Mr. Mayer, 36. "I have a of friends who did it and got laid off. They made really good money, but now they're going to have to take these $8- and $9-an-hour jobs."
Still, there is little sign that people are fleeing the way they did in the past. In 1971, for example, after Boeing laid off nearly 70,000 workers, a sign went up in this city reading, "Will the last person leaving Seattle turn out the lights?"
This time around, despite having the highest unemployment rates in the country, the Northwest is not losing population. Economists attribute this to a cushion of wealth left over from the recent boom, and to a belief that the fruits of the global economy will come around again soon.
In December, Alaska posted the highest unemployment rate in the nation, 7.6 percent. Yet its economy is still adding jobs and people. The state has the nation's highest minimum wage, $7.15 an hour, and residents, rather than being taxed, are paid to live there -- about $6,000 a year for a family of four. This money comes from North Slope oil royalties, which drive the state.
Tourism has grown considerably in Alaska, with cruise ships plying coastal waters from May through September. But what was once the healthiest segment of Alaska's economy, fishing, has taken a dive because of a global glut of farmed fish from places like Chile, which compete with Alaska's wild product.
"Quite a few people with permits to catch salmon didn't even fish this year because prices were so low," said Dan Robinson, a state economist. But even with the troubles, he said, more people are moving to Alaska than are leaving it. The population is 634,892.
In Oregon, the timber-driven recession of the 1980's sent about 20,000 a year out of the state, a time when unemployment reached 12 percent.
Then Oregon restructured its economy. The timber industry shrank, and $13 billion in high-tech investment in the Willamette Valley, from Portland south, brought record prosperity. The state grew by 580,000 over the last decade, to 3.4 million people. But not all the laid-off timber workers became computer chip factory workers. Of the 18,000 who were forced out of the industry, those who found new jobs also found their wages had declined by 1 percent, said Ted Helvoigt, the co-author of a study on what became of Oregon's former timber workers.

In Idaho, No Turning Back
 Idaho, with 1.3 million people, is a similar story. The state went from a resource-based market to one built around high tech and processed agricultural products, all tied to the new global economy. The population grew by 20 percent in the 1990's, as companies and workers fled Southern California for the cheaper business environment around Boise.
Still, even though Idaho unemployment was the worst in a decade last year, just under 6 percent, and job creation lagged behind the rest of the nation, state officials say there is no turning back to the old economy.
Indeed, Northwesterners have not stopped dreaming, nor is there a sense of panic or retreating from the global economy. About $15 billion in stock options went to Microsoft employees over the last 15 years, and that has provided a cushion for many during the downturn.
"People's stock portfolios are certainly worth a lot less, but there was such a big pile to begin with," said Paul Sommers, a professor at the University of Washington.
Portland is going after a major league baseball team. Seattle is building a new city hall, a new central library and two transit systems. Alaska still plans to construct a natural gas pipeline to send energy south, while a new governor, Frank H. Murkowski, a Republican, talks of a huge new road-building program, stitching distant outposts of Alaska to its handful of cities. And all of them look west, beyond the sunset, even in the worst economic times in a generation. They say there is no other way.
"We have introduced a generation of people to the idea that the global economy is the future," said John Mitchell, a Western economist for US Bancorp in Portland. "For a while it was all up. Now they see what a down cycle is like. The amazing thing is that people are staying put. They like this part of the country and are not going anywhere."

Men and Women Aren't Alike. Really.

 BODY:
MISMATCH
The Growing Gulf Between Women and Men
By Andrew Hacker
228 pages. Scribner. $25.
 Men are selfish pigs. And there aren't enough of them to go around. 
 At least that's what Andrew Hacker suggests in his depressing new book "Mismatch," a glib, didactic book that uses sometimes dubious methodology to ratify women's worst fears about dating and marriage and the opposite sex.
In much the same way that he asserted in his controversial 1992 book "Two Nations" that America continued to suffer from a bitter and deeply entrenched white-black racial divide, so Mr. Hacker argues in these pages that there is a widening chasm between men and women. 
As evidence of this gender gap, Mr. Hacker notes that half of all marriages end in divorce, fewer and fewer adults are becoming parents, and close to 40 percent of children aren't living with their fathers. More and more fathers are rejecting parental obligations, he argues, even as more and more women are opting for motherhood on their own. He writes that polls indicate a growing divergence in the political and social views held by men and women, and he identifies a growing cultural divide between the sexes, galvanized by the fact that fewer men than women are graduating from college.
"There is a greater divide between the sexes than at any time in living memory," he writes. "The result will be a greater separation of women and men, with tensions and recriminations afflicting beings once thought to be naturally companionable." 
Why has this come about? Mainly, Mr. Hacker suggests, it's because women are less willing "to subsume themselves or limit their ambitions to make life more congenial for men," as many did in the past: "Few are willing to sustain the former complementarity that required them to play a subordinate role. More broadly, they expect full equality, not just legally and in the economic arena, but in the holistic sense of being perceived as an integral human being. As hardly needs recounting, women are now entering spheres that were once dominated by men. And as more of them are revealing their talents, they are competing against men, a circumstance that was never contemplated in the past." 
To buttress his conclusions Mr. Hacker -- a professor of political science at Queens College in New York -- flings around a huge number of statistics, many of them taken from government reports like the census. The problem is he tends to mix up solid facts and figures with more qualified findings, focuses almost exclusively on those statistics that back up his thesis, presents the familiar or obvious with an air of revelatory zeal and glosses everything with speculative hyperbole -- a technique he lamely defends by arguing that "hyperbole can serve a purpose: to sharpen our understanding of the murky world in which we live."
Despite such protestations, his methodology has the effect of undermining his more legitimate conclusions. The book mixes findings from broad, well-controlled surveys with findings from small, arbitrary studies; for instance one that is cited as showing that women are more inclined to value emotional communication than their husbands featured voice-activated tape recorders placed in the living rooms of a mere dozen married couples.
To make matters worse, "Mismatch" is liberally seasoned with knee-jerk editorializing on Mr. Hacker's part. He makes gross generalizations about men and women ("in most marriages, he loves her less than she does him"); asks stupid questions ("to what extent," he wonders, is brutality "endemic to men"?); and makes silly assumptions ("let's imagine that all the women who favor greater curbs on guns and less reliance on missiles would prefer to find a man who shares their views").
There are questionable assertions in this book -- "few straight men haven't married at least once by the time they reach their 40's" -- and even more dubious theories: at one point the author suggests that "a growing unwillingness by white men to become or remain resident fathers to the children they have sired" might be connected with the mainstream popularity of rap and hip-hop music and movies like "Shaft" that "glamorized black potency" and a laissez-faire attitude toward family life.
In the course of this book Mr. Hacker makes more unsavory generalizations about men than "The First Wives Club." He accuses the majority of his sex of being selfish, self-absorbed, uncommunicative and unwilling to make marital adjustments and at one point goes so far as to wonder whether evolution has "implanted a propensity for rape that lingers in modern man?"
His conclusion: "It is not an exaggeration to suggest that today's women actually want more from life than men do. Unfortunately, when it comes to what women want from marriage, not enough husbands are willing or able to provide the responses that wives believe are possible." 
Though women initiate 64.9 percent of divorces, he reports, it is men who tend to prosper afterward. He writes that the living standards of divorced fathers typically rise by 10 percent after the split (while those of mothers and their children fall by 27 percent), says the checks divorced women receive average $3,844 a year and points out that "more former husbands than wives remarry." 
Which brings us to the Great Male Shortage -- a scarcity that has already been dissected and debated for years, from the infamous 1986 Newsweek article that asserted that a 40-year-old woman had better odds of being killed by a terrorist than getting married, to Barbara Dafoe Whitehead's recent book "Why There Are No Good Men Left."
Mr. Hacker's approach to this phenomenon is to emphasize the accelerating ambition and success of women, their overtaking of men -- in college, where for every 100 women graduates there are only 75 men; and in college sports, where thanks to Title IX, "there are now actually more women's teams" than men's -- and men's uneasiness at this development. 
Echoing the title of his earlier book on race, Mr. Hacker concludes that men and women can be viewed as "two nations," that there is "an emerging mismatch between the sexes" and "not enough men who satisfy the expectations that modern women have for dates and mates." 
Bridget Jones and Carrie Bradshaw could have told you the same thing without brandishing a single statistic or citing a single survey.

HEADLINE: South Africa Cuts Price Of Offering 

BYLINE:  By NICOLE ITANO

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, March 3 

 BODY:
Citing weak markets and fears about war in Iraq, the South African government sharply reduced the price range for the initial public offering of the national telephone monopoly Telkom but said that the offering would not be delayed any longer.
 The government will sell one-quarter of the company on the New York and Johannesburg stock exchanges on Tuesday for 27 to 30 rand a share ($3.35 to $3.72); it had formerly hoped for 33.5 to 40 rand a share. 
 "This is very consistent with the feedback that we've been getting from both local and international investors," said Franca Di Silvestro, an analyst at HSBC South Africa. "Clients are worried about taking a position this close to war in Iraq, and people are worried about the currency issue, with the rand having improved so dramatically." The rand has risen in value by 6 percent against the dollar so far this year. 
A year ago, Trevor Manuel, the finance minister, was predicting 10 billion rand ($1.24 billion) in proceeds from the sale; at the new range, the figure will at most be half that.
Analysts said the government was going ahead with the sale despite the climate because it wanted to convey that it was serious about its privatization and restructuring programs. The Telkom privatization, now four years in the making, has already been postponed once, and another big sale, of a 30 percent stake in the national energy company, has been put off indefinitely.
"Waiting is not going to solve any problems," said Dobek Pater, a telecommunications analyst at BMI-TechKnowledge, a South African consultancy. "If anything, it's going to jeopardize the government's credibility. South Africa can't be seen to be going back on its promises."
The government is also concerned about bolstering its financial markets, as trading in several major companies has shifted to London and New York in recent years. And it hopes that the sale of Telkom shares will help introduce more South Africans, especially lower-income people, to investing and the financial markets. Reg Rumney, director of Business Map, a South African economic research and consulting firm, said the idea was to help overcome the persistent effects of apartheid by helping to foster a new class of small shareholders.
Retail investors are expected to buy only about one-tenth of the offering, or 2.5 percent of the company. But the government has been aggressive in wooing small investors, with radio and television advertising and workshops in more than 200 cities and towns. It has also offered discounts of 5 percent, and in some cases, 20 percent off the share price. 
As a result, about 1.5 million South Africans have registered to buy shares, most of them members of previously disadvantaged groups, the government said.
Mr. Rumney said the success of the effort would depend as much on teaching these new investors about the market as it would on enticing them to buy. A similar program in 1989 encouraged retail investors to buy shares in Iscor, a privatizing steel and iron company, but many of the new investors mistakenly believed that they had to hold their new shares indefinitely.
"People will make money out of this thing if they know when to sell," Mr. Rumney said. "My hope is that, as happened with the Iscor privatization, people won't believe that you have to hold onto your shares long term."
They may be put off by the experiences of small shareholders in Europe, many of whom made their first investments in newly privatized phone companies like Telecom Italia and Deutsche Telekom in the 1990's. The bursting of the technology bubble and consequent slump in telecommunications stocks have driven those shares far below their offering prices.
Even so, analysts said today that Telkom would probably fare well when trading starts in the new price range on Tuesday. The bulk of shares will probably be bought locally, but investment banks said there was strong international interest.
"The mood seems to be pretty comfortable, because the price range is realistic and more in line with Telkom's global peer group," said Meloy Horn of Merrill Lynch's South African affiliate.

HEADLINE: A New War Opens an Old Wound 

BYLINE:  By Jason Goodwin; Jason Goodwin is author of "Lords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire" and "Greenback: The Almighty Dollar and the Invention of America."

DATELINE: DORSET, England 

 BODY:
As the United States tries yet again to entice Turkey into a prenuptial agreement on invading Iraq, it faces the traditional money concern -- is it enough? -- and the fact that public sentiment is against the match. This has thrown prospects for a second, northern front in the upcoming invasion into doubt. Should America's overtures succeed, however, a long-term problem for Washington might turn out to be lurking in the small print: the part about allowing Turkish troops to follow the American incursion in order to create a buffer zone inside Iraq.
 Participants at last weekend's conference of Iraqi opposition groups gave support for the American cause but also flatly rejected any Turkish military presence in Iraq, even if under American command. That rejection was echoed by some 100,000 Iraqi Kurds who took to the streets yesterday. Unless all sides can come to an agreement, an American invasion could free northern Iraq from Saddam Hussein only to turn it over to chaos. 
 The Turks' stated desire is to prevent a repeat of 1990, when Operation Desert Storm drove half a million Iraqi Kurds across the border. Ankara was worried that the newcomers would further radicalize Turkey's own Kurdish population. Harrowing scenes were transmitted around the world of Turkish soldiers beating the desperate refugees back into no-man's land. 
This time the Turks want to be prepared: to provide humanitarian relief, and at the same time to dampen Kurdish expectations that war might lead to the creation of a Kurdish state. In fact, even if the deal with Washington falls through, Turkey is likely to move soldiers into northern Iraq after the Baghdad regime falls. Their presence of would leave Turkey in a position to help broker a deal over the makeup of a new Iraq. 
That in itself may be no bad thing, for any successor regime in Iraq would need a friendly neighbor in Turkey. It may not enjoy the oil wealth of its Arab neighbors, but Turkey has a long tradition of friendly alliance with the West, is an important trading partner of Europe and America, and has traditions of government that on the whole contrast favorably with the autocratic regimes of the area. There remains, however, the issue of the Kurds.
While the 25 million Kurds who live in the mountainous borderlands that separate Turkey, Iraq and Iran are culturally and linguistically distinct, their claim to nationhood is one of the more forlorn hopes in the palimpsest of claims and traditions that bedevil the Middle East. Under the Ottoman empire they enjoyed the preferential status granted to all Muslim subjects; clannish and nomadic, they roamed the mountains under the guidance of conservative-minded clan chiefs and sent their sons to be soldiers for the multi-ethnic, multifaith empire. 
But the Kurds were badly prepared when the empire began to fracture toward the end of the 19th century. With one ethnic group after another asserting its identity and proclaiming independence, the Turks faced political eclipse. It was only by stressing a new-found ethnicity of their own that the Turks were able to forge a post-Ottoman country founded on the Western model. In 1924 they abolished the caliphate, taking away the sultan's role as religious leader; it is no accident that the Kurdish language was outlawed on the same day. Being Muslim no longer counted, and the Kurds -- frequently dismissed as "mountain Turks" -- found themselves second-class citizens, denied the right to use their languages or express their culture.
Eighty years of Turkish repression has fostered a cycle of violence and a legacy of mistrust. The Kurds even find it hard to unite among themselves over means or aims -- some insist on independence, others would be happy with some sort of official "recognition" and autonomy, while others have gravitated toward guerrilla groups espousing causes from Islamist extremism to revolutionary Marxism. 
The Kurds of Iraq -- invaded, tortured, displaced and bombed with chemical weapons by the Iraqi army in the 1980's -- now enjoy a measure of autonomy under the the allies' no-fly zone. They have organized practical self-government and have achieved some peace and even prosperity -- mainly as middlemen in the large black economy of the Iraq-Turkey-Iran borderlands. 
For all that, the Iraqi Kurds seem to recognize that independence is not an option: neither practical in itself nor likely to get the support of the United States. At this weekend's meeting, the Kurdish leadership agreed to become part of a proposed multi-ethnic post-Saddam Hussein government of all Iraq. They have also agreed not to take control of the cities of Mosul and Kirkuk -- centers of oil production that could provide the seed money for a Kurdish state. 
The apparent Kurdish compliance with America's larger goals shows why coming to a watertight agreement about the Turkish role is vital to any deal the Bush administration makes. Were Turkey to use a heavy hand it would further alienate the Kurdsand even raise the possibility of armed insurrection behind American lines. Iran might even be tempted to intervene if Turkish armies move too close to it spheres of influence on the borders. 
The United States needs to impress on the the Turks the excellent steps that Iraqi Kurds have managed to take since being freed from Saddam Hussein's wrath, and the Turks must accept that all Kurds are not automatically wedded to violence or separatism. Taking a benign role might be in the Turks' interests: Were Turkish Kurds to see their Iraqi counterparts get get a strong role in a postwar Iraqi government, it could lessen separatist pressure, showing the benefits of working within a democratic state. (The liberal Islamist party now in power in Ankara is already viewed less skeptically by the Kurds than its predecessors were.) 
If handled correctly , this war could give Turkey's new government a chance to help reshape the region -- and to make a fresh start in the mountains.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Disney, Bank One and Visa International all agree to live together on one little card.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
REMEMBER the commercials decades ago from Contadina that asked, "Who put eight great tomatoes in that little bitty can?" Now, the Bank One Corporation, the Walt Disney Company and Visa International plan to spend an estimated $125 million to $150 million to determine whether consumers will accept three big-brand logos on one little bitty credit card.
 The card, called the Disney Visa Credit Card from Bank One, enables holders to rack up points redeemable for Disney Dream Reward Dollars. But the three companies, which will formally announce their partnership today, are entering a crowded field of co-branded credit cards that already includes a directly competitive card from J. P. Morgan Chase, MasterCard International and the Vivendi Universal Entertainment division of Vivendi Universal. 
 For Disney, the entertainment giant that has struggled in recent years, the card is another tool to try to forge closer ties with its current customers. And such efforts -- known as customer relationship marketing or loyalty marketing -- are a crucial component of campaigns by advertisers during tough economic times. Marketing research shows it is generally more expensive to attract a new customer than to persuade a reliable customer to buy another stuffed animal, visit another resort or see another movie. 
"We've never had such a credit card before," said Peter E. Murphy, senior executive vice president and chief strategic officer at Disney in Burbank, Calif. "It's part of the increasing levels of sophistication in our customer relationship marketing efforts.
"Disney is the magic, the pixie dust," he added, "that provides the customer relationship and the rewards."
The multimedia advertising, marketing and promotional campaign for the Disney Visa card is being handled by agencies including Leo Burnett Worldwide in Chicago, part of the Publicis Groupe; the Gardner-Nelson Project in New York; and Ketchum, part of the Omnicom Group. The campaign, to run for the next two to three years, will test the power of what Madison Avenue calls co-branding, which unites two or more marketers in peddling one product. Examples include the Eddie Bauer version of the Ford Explorer, Hidden Valley Ranch flavor Wavy Lay's potato chips and Betty Crocker SuperMoist German Chocolate Cake Mix with Hershey's chocolate as an ingredient.
But if one plus one equals three, according to the legions of supporters of synergistic pitching as a marketing tool, what does one plus one plus one equal other than too much information to absorb from a 30-second commercial, a print ad or a brochure?
"Disney, Visa and Bank One all on one card?" Alan M. Siegel, chairman and chief executive at Siegelgale, acorporate identity consultant in New York, asked rhetorically. "That's a bit much.
"It will probably work," he added, "but it's just a little crazy with all those brands on a teeny card."
Needless to say, Tom O'Donnell, senior vice president for relationship marketing at the Bank One Card Services division in Wilmington, Del., which offers more than 1,200 co-branded or other affinity cards, disputes that assessment.
"Co-branding, bringing brands together to work for customers, is our lead strategy for credit cards," Mr. O'Donnell said. "The three brands will fit together perfectly.
"With Disney, we have an opportunity to push into a new dimension, offering travel awards, cash awards to families," he added. Bank One has co-branded cards with marketers like Amazon.com, Marriott International and the United Airlines division of the UAL Corporation. Another triple-branded card, combining Bank One, Visa and Starbucks, is being introduced in the fall.
"The notion of a co-branded credit card is not new," said Steve Gardner, co-founder of the Gardner-Nelson Project, the Bank One agency that created the TV and radio commercials to introduce the card, which will start Monday.
"Consumers are familiar with the concept," he added. "We'll just try to keep each role clear."
The initial television spot shows children uncharacteristically encouraging their parents to buy broccoli and gasoline and even to get them haircuts. The goal, of course, is for the adults to charge those purchases with the Disney Visa card. The commercial ends with a girl who asked for broccoli, confiding to Mickey Mouse at a Disney resort, "You don't want to know what I had to do to get here."
For Disney, the reaction to the card, which replaces previous relationship-marketing programs like the Magic Kingdom Club, is crucial. The company is eager to reinforce ties with its best customers at a time when it faces numerous business challenges. A soft economy, the increase in gasoline prices and the uncertainty about war in the Middle East could lead millions of tourists to postpone or cancel vacation trips to Disneyland or Walt Disney World or aboard Disney cruise ships.
"This allows us to give more to our best guests," Mr. Murphy said, using the Disney jargon for customers. The card, he said, provides them "with special offers, no annual fee and no blackout dates on redeeming rewards."
And it enables Disney to keep up with its rival Vivendi Universal, which is spending an estimated $100 million to $125 million, according to the trade publication Advertising Age, on its multiyear marketing deal with J. P. Morgan Chase and MasterCard. The licensing fee being paid by MasterCard to Vivendi Universal was estimated at $10 million; the fee being paid by Visa to Disney may be twice that.
Mr. Siegel, the identity consultant, said that while the card "is a way for Disney to generate sales volume," it also offers Bank One and Visa "some positive rub-off" from the Disney image. Indeed, Mr. O'Donnell at Bank One Card Services said his company expected the Disney Visa card to be "our fastest-growing program ever," with 100,000 consumers already preregistered for cards.
Disney's skill in generating hoopla should quickly add to that number. Among today's bicoastal series of events to introduce the card is a scheduled appearance at the New York Stock Exchange by Mickey Mouse, joining Michael D. Eisner, chairman and chief executive at Disney, and Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive at Bank One, to ring the bell that opens trading.

HEADLINE: TV Campaign by Labor Coalition Calls for Higher Tax on Wealthy 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 3 

 BODY:
A coalition of labor and civic groups began a television advertising campaign today urging the state to raise taxes on the wealthy rather than cut back money for education and health care.
 The campaign marks a sharp escalation in the attacks on Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, from labor and Democrats angry about his plan to close an $11.5 billion shortfall in the coming fiscal year's budget mostly through borrowing and deep reductions in aid for schools and health care programs. 
 Using pictures of forlorn children in school and elderly people in wheelchairs, the TV commercials criticize Mr. Pataki for his proposed budget cuts. An announcer says, "There's a better choice for New York's economy: limit these cuts by closing corporate tax loopholes and asking the wealthiest to pay a little more."
Through the campaign, the coalition is raising an ideamany Democrats in the Legislature have whispered about but few have been willing to openly support -- a temporary tax increase on the wealthy.
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the most powerful Democrat in Albany, has been careful not to take a firm stand on raising income taxes. He has said the final budget must include some tax increases, some borrowing and some cuts, but he has stopped short of saying he would support an income tax increase on the wealthy.
At a news conference today, after he criticized Mr. Pataki for cutting $220 million for public preschool classes, Mr. Silver said, "I haven't ruled anything in or out."
The governor's chief spokeswoman, Lisa Dewald Stoll, said, "There will always be those who advocate job-killing tax hikes to address the fiscal challenges, but history has made clear that would damage our economy, cost us thousands of jobs and hurt hard-working families across New York."
But a consensus has been building among labor leaders and groups devoted to the problems of the poor that Mr. Pataki's medicine for the state is too bitter.
In particular, the coalition paying for the ads, known as New Yorkers for Fiscal Fairness, has been pushing for changes to the corporate tax laws that would close down some tax shelters to raise about $1.6 billion. The coalition is also calling for a seven-tenths of 1 percent increase in the tax rate for people earning more than $100,000 and a 1.4 percent increase for people making more than $200,000. That would bring in about $3 billion, some budget analysts say.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Coping With the Threat of War

BYLINE:  By DAVID JONES

 BODY:
On the night of the Sept. 11 attacks, Benjamin J. Hood, vice president for product strategy at EXE Technologies in Dallas, found himself stranded in Philadelphia, 1,500 miles from home. With the nation's commercial airspace shut down, Mr. Hood and two co-workers drove a rental car for 26 hours back to Texas, stopping only once for a catnap. 
 Since then, Mr. Hood has stopped flying American flag carriers overseas, and he rides Amtrak for many domestic trips. With an invasion of Iraq looming, he views future business travel with dread. "I'm terrified of flying now, but it's part of the job," he said. 
 His fears will no doubt grow if Iraq is invaded, but he and others like him will have this consolation: The occasions for worrying are likely to shrink. Eighty-two percent of 400 corporate travel managers surveyed by the Association of Corporate Travel Executives said their companies would reduce international travel in the event of a war, and 32 percent said their companies would scale back domestic travel.
That survey, and a separate report by the National Business Travel Association, suggested that hundreds of companies were drawing up contingency plans for an outbreak of hostilities, like instructing employees to register with American embassies overseas and even suggesting they carry a short-wave radio.
In the three weeks since those surveys were released, the prospect of war has come into much clearer focus for many companies.
"We spoke to some customers last week who said the buying decisions they make are being held off," said Robin Schleien, president for North American operations at Carlson Wagonlit Travel. "We're driven by our customers' reaction to the economy and the general reaction to war."
Several American companies have stepped up security procedures in anticipation of a war. Black & Decker, the maker of power tools in Towson, Md., has issued guidelines to about 1,000 employees, asking them to reconsider plans for overseas trips, according to Pete Buchheit, director of travel and meeting services. "Basically, we're just asking people to use their own good judgment, as they usually do," he said. He said, however, that Black & Decker is not planning mass repatriations or evacuations of overseas employees.
Novartis, the drug maker, is also proceeding cautiously. Paul Tomaszeski, the executive director for administration, says restrictions have been placed on about 9,000 North American employees who travel for the company to about 10 countries. Mr. Tomaszeski declined to identify the nations, but he said Novartis had banned travel to some of them; for others, it had limited travel to essential purposes only; and for the rest, it had required notification to the company's corporate security department of any trips. 
But Novartis, like Black & Decker, is striving to avoid going overboard. "I think it's a sensitive time," Mr. Tomaszeski said. "But on the other hand, we're a global company." 
Another step that corporate travel departments are taking is to instruct employees to order tickets only through the company's official travel agency, according to Edward S. Adams, chairman of Navigant International, a corporate travel agency in Denver. They want to avoid the confusion that followed the Sept. 11 attacks, he said, when many companies had trouble finding employees who had booked cheap tickets on the Internet.
All bets are off if an invasion occurs, of course. Carol Salcito, president of Management Alternatives, a corporate-travel consulting concern, says many companies have already put in place an emergency plan for bringing employees home in case any airlines are grounded or stop flying.
Hal Rosenbluth, chairman of Rosenbluth International, a corporate-travel agency in Philadelphia, says he has not seen a big decrease in business but he expects changes and cancellations should a conflict break out.
For the airline industry, of course, a conflict would spell potential disaster. The International Air Transport Association estimates that an invasion of Iraq could lead to an immediate 20 percent drop in worldwide travel, and several airlines are reporting that international bookings are stagnant.
"The general view is that all of the major carriers can withstand the incremental impact of a brief, decisive engagement," said Sam Buttrick, an airline analyst at UBS Warburg. "One could make the case that the airlines would be better off to get it over with sooner." 
Although the airlines may fear the worst, they are busy making contingency plans of their own. An association spokeswoman said the major American carriers had been talking about an initiative to ask Congress for some kind of immunity from antitrust laws that would allow them to coordinate flight schedules, similar to a proposal for easing airport gridlock that was discussed in the summer of 2000. However, one official close to the discussions said the industry was more intent on gaining relief from high fuel and war-risk insurance costs and security taxes and fees. He said airline executives did not see any antitrust effort being "part of the final mix."
Airlines are also making plans to cope with a possible conflict. United Airlines, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, would cut 10 to 12 percent of capacity, according to a spokesman, Jeff Green. He declined to comment on specific routes, but he said it was unlikely the carrier would eliminate any destinations.
Officials at American Airlines and Delta Air Lines also said their companies planned to cut capacity if war broke out.
British Airways, which says April-to-June bookings are up from last year, has suspended all flights to Oman and rerouted nonstop flights to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other countries near Iraq through Cyprus, according to John Lampl, a spokesman. To spur advance business, the airline is offering discounted tickets this week through travel agencies for flights between New York area airports and London.
Virgin Atlantic officials say advanced bookings have been "slightly depressed" recently but add that making projections has become much more difficult with travelers booking flights much closer to departure dates than previously. In late February, Virgin made a temporary policy change to allow passengers to cancel and reschedule any tickets booked through March 17 for trans-Atlantic flights from the United States and for flights between Britain and Hong Kong, Tokyo and Shanghai.
Virgin, meanwhile, is stepping up internal security with a previously announced plan to add closed-circuit cameras in the cockpit and is adding a second layer of preflight interviews for passengers that is modeled on procedures used by El Al, according to a spokeswoman, Wendy Buck.
Michael Boyd, an airline consultant in Evergreen, Colo., says many airlines will rush to file bankruptcy protection if they believe a war will last more than a few weeks.
Hotel chains are also revising policies to take account of war jitters. Shangri-La Hotels, a chain based in Hong Kong, will allow groups to get refunds or postpone meetings if war breaks out, and the London-based Thistle Hotels has suspended cancellation fees for some groups.
Not all business executives are skittish about traveling. Heidi Albrecht, a marketing manager for Agco, a farm equipment maker in Atlanta, finds the concerns annoying. "You have experienced travelers getting worked up over small things," she said.

HEADLINE: Industry's Pace Slows; Consumer Spending Drops 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3 

 BODY:
Manufacturing expanded in February at the slowest pace in three months after consumer spending on cars and other durable goods fell the most since 1990, reports released today showed.
 The Institute for Supply Management, a private industry research group, said its factory index fell to 50.5, from 53.9 in January. A reading above 50 signals expansion. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that durable goods spending in January dropped 5.7 percent, the biggest decline since the period before the 1990-91 recession. 
 Consumer purchases account for two-thirds of the economy and a sustained pullback will keep growth from accelerating at a time when companies are reluctant to spend as a possible war with Iraq looms, economists said.
Factory orders and production slowed, while a measure of employment was the weakest since January 2002, the manufacturing report showed. Corporate executives are less inclined to hire or spend more because capacity in use is close to the lowest in two decades and crude oil prices have surged as much as 21 percent this year. Manufacturing accounts for about one-seventh of the economy.
"Given the stellar productivity gains and lowly capacity rates, there's no impetus for businesses to hire or invest in new equipment," said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research in New York.
The Commerce Department's report showed personal spending fell 0.1 percent in January, the first decrease in four months. Income rose 0.3 percent for a sixth consecutive month. The decrease in spending on durable goods, the largest since February 1990, came after a 6.8 percent surge in December.
The manufacturing group's index of new orders slumped to 52.3 in February from 59.7. It was the biggest decline since July and the weakest since 52.2 in October, suggesting production may start to ease in coming months if demand fails to pick up.
"The threat of war is damping demand," said Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the Institute for Supply Management of Tempe, Ariz., that surveys more than 400 companies in 20 industries. That "ultimately translates to every industry," he said.
The production index declined to 55.4 in February from 56.3 in January. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending rose in January to a record as the lowest mortgage rates in more than four decades fueled home building. Spending rose 1.7 percent, to $877.9 billion at an annual rate.

HEADLINE: Students Get a Seminar With the Iraqi Envoy 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
When students head to college, they expect to learn about the world. But few expect the kind of front-row seat on world affairs that a dozen Lehigh University students had yesterday in a two-hour meeting with the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammed A. Aldouri. 
 The students -- a mix of Americans and foreign students, graduate students and undergraduates, pro-war and antiwar -- listened respectfully as the ambassador described his view that America wants war and Iraq wants peace. 
 When the students had their turn, they asked him about Iraq's human rights record, whether President Bush should be invited to address the Iraqi people directly, and if war was inevitable. 
"You say you hope you can avoid war," said Patrick Schmid, a computer science major from Germany, marching up to the question on everybody's mind. "Will there be war?"
The answer was not as direct as the question. 
"I cannot say that the war is not coming," Mr. Aldouri said in accented English. "I can say only that war is avoidable. There are a lot of nations asking for peaceful solutions. I hope you will pressure your government; there is no reason for war."
The ambassador seemed to relish the give and take at the Iraqi mission in a town house on East 79th Street, just off Fifth Avenue. He said that before becoming a diplomat, he spent 30 years as a professor at Baghdad University, where he specialized in international law and human rights. 
At times, the meeting resembled a college seminar; the participants sat at a large table in an ornate room decorated with a chandelier and a portrait of a smiling Saddam Hussein. The discussion was civil and calm; there were no peace signs or armbands in sight, no raised voices or strident statements.
The visit was arranged by Bill Hunter, director of Lehigh's office of international students and scholars, who oversees the roughly 500 international students at Lehigh, a campus with 6,200 students in Bethlehem, Pa. Mr. Hunter has taken students to the Pentagon, to NATO headquarters in Virginia and to meetings at the United Nations. 
Last week, to give his students a more direct taste of Iraqi views, he called Mr. Aldouri's office and proposed a visit. Less than 24 hours later, the ambassador's office agreed, and later accepted Mr. Hunter's proposal that reporters for The New York Times and ABC News also attend. 
Some of the students agreed with the ambassador that there should be no war, but few seemed to buy many of his other arguments. 
"He was really good at putting an Iraqi spin on things," said Roberto Escalante, a Lehigh junior from Mexico who is majoring in mechanical engineering.
As a Mexican, Mr. Escalante said, he understands what it feels like to be the underdog, "to be manipulated by another country." But he said he believed the ambassador was trying to shift blame away from Iraq onto other people.
"I was a little disappointed," said Nur-E Farzana Rahman, a junior majoring in economics and journalism who is editorial page editor of the Lehigh student newspaper. "I went in hoping there would be a way to bridge the gap between American and Muslim cultures," said Ms. Rahman, an American citizen born in Bangladesh, who said she supported President Bush. "But I didn't see a desire for change on his part," she added, referring to the ambassador.
Perhaps the students' biggest surprise was the ABC reporter's brief interview with the ambassador when their session was over. 
The interview covered some of the same ground, but the questions were louder, the exchange more confrontational.
"I felt bad for the ambassador," Mr. Escalante said afterward. "I always like to keep things cordial."
For Ms. Rahman, it offered a different kind of lesson.
"I was watching and wondering," she said. "I was wondering, 'Will I be able to do this?' "

HEADLINE: Korean Paralysis 

 BODY:
The United States is in a bind with North Korea. Pyongyang comes closer every day to beginning full-scale production of nuclear weapons, while diplomacy remains stalled. That is not entirely Washington's fault, but the need to begin direct negotiations with the North is increasingly urgent. Talking is a wiser course than standing by and watching the North start producing nuclear bombs at the rate of one a month by this summer. 
 There is no way to ignore North Korea's nuclear programs, and almost any military response would endanger hundreds of thousands of lives. As this past weekend's encounter between an American spy plane and North Korean fighter jets shows, the current standoff is already dangerously volatile. That leaves diplomacy, but differences over the best format have kept talks from getting under way. 
 North Korea seeks unconditional negotiations, but the only subject the Bush administration is willing to talk about is ending the North's nuclear programs. And while North Korea wants direct, one-on-one talks, Washington has been holding out for an international forum, including neighboring countries like Japan, China, Russia and South Korea. Meanwhile, the North has restarted its plutonium-producing reactor and moved spent fuel rods to a reprocessing plant, which could begin turning them into bomb material at any moment. Once reprocessing begins, North Korea will be able to produce about one nuclear bomb per month.
It's time to stop quibbling about the format and start talking, with North Korea suspending all nuclear weapons work once discussions begin. Broad regional participation in these talks is desirable, but for the moment it is unrealistic. Given the current policy differences between Washington, Seoul, Beijing and Moscow, that may be just as well. China's attitude has been particularly disappointing. Beijing wants to be taken seriously as a regional and world power. Yet on North Korea, it has been narrowly parochial, appearing more concerned about the economic burden of more North Korean refugees than the destabilizing consequences of more North Korean nuclear bombs. 
On his trip to Asia last week, Secretary of State Colin Powell heard repeated pleas for Washington to begin direct talks with Pyongyang. Those should begin swiftly. China, South Korea and other countries can help by pressing North Korea to freeze its nuclear programs during the talks. The economic aid and security assurances North Korea seeks should be firmly linked to a permanent and verifiable end to all of its nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and exports of dangerous weapons. The place for insisting that bad North Korean behavior will not be rewarded is at the negotiating table.

HEADLINE: Speaker Wields Preschool Education as a Sword 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 3 

 BODY:
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's weapon of choice this year is preschool education, and he is using it to attack his political rival, Gov. George E. Pataki, at every turn.
 In the past week alone, Mr. Silver has called three news conferences here to rail against the governor's proposals to eliminate early education programs that provide prekindergarten classes for 60,000 students and reduce elementary class sizes. 
 Today, standing in front of valentines drawn by children, Mr. Silver once again brandished that weapon: "The governor makes a wrong choice by wiping out universal pre-k, effectively slamming the schoolhouse door shut on 60,000 of our precious 4-year-olds in this state."
During a year of painful financial choices, Mr. Silver, a Democrat, has managed to keep Mr. Pataki on the defensive with a carefully orchestrated campaign that focuses almost exclusively on education. In prekindergarten classes from Chinatown to Buffalo, Mr. Silver has repeatedly attacked the governor's proposals to reduce state education spending by $1.2 billion in the 2003-04 fiscal year. 
In doing so, political strategists say, Mr. Silver has steadily chipped away at Mr. Pataki's hard-won support among educators and parents. Since the governor took office in 1995, his aides point out, total state aid for schools has increased by $4.8 billion, or 51 percent. 
But faced with shrinking revenues this year, Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has focused on jobs and the economy, and left himself open to Mr. Silver's attacks. During a news conference about pension benefits last week, Mr. Pataki felt compelled to remind reporters, "No governor, as I've said, is more committed or has a better record in providing resources for education than I do."
By choosing education as his core issue, Mr. Silver appears to be drawing a line against deep budget cuts, though he has been careful not to say with any detail how he would pay for restoring those programs. From a tactical standpoint, Mr. Silver is busy portraying Mr. Pataki as an enemy to education, indeed as an enemy to 4-year-olds whose parents want them to attend preschool.
Yet, as a practical matter, what remains largely unspoken so far is that Mr. Silver must either support a tax increase or more borrowing to restore the state's education financing. Mr. Silver has said he is not ruling out either possibility.
"Obviously, we understand that both sides of the ledger have to be balanced," Mr. Silver said. "But you have to identify what you want to buy first when you go to the store."
Lisa Stoll, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, said that while he welcomes debate on the state's fiscal crisis, he has, in his words, urged people not to "pit our children and seniors and most needy New Yorkers against the taxpayers and businesses and jobs that will be the source of further revenue used to aid them."
Ms. Stoll added: "It's easy for the speaker to do photo opportunities with 4-year-olds. What's difficult, and what the speaker has failed to do, is say how he's going to pay for these massive spending increases." 
But Mr. Silver's strategy, at least for now, seems to be resonating with his supporters. For instance, the United Federation of Teachers, the union that represents New York City teachers, endorsed Mr. Pataki last year after he campaigned heavily on his education record during the election, and even chose to present him with its highest award.
But this year, the union's award will go to Mr. Silver. The union's president, Randi Weingarten, has pointedly criticized Mr. Pataki for his education cuts while she has commended Mr. Silver for "fighting over the long haul, in good and bad times for kids, educators, and public education."
Mr. Silver has also managed to distance himself from possible tax increases, thereby avoiding a potential trap laid out by the governor's budget.
Brian Nickerson, director of the Michaelian Institute for Public Policy and Management at Pace University, said that even if local school districts end up raising their property taxes to pay for these programs, most people will remember only that Mr. Silver "fought the good fight" to keep the governor from slashing education.
"If it really plays out," Mr. Nickerson said, "the blame is going to fall on local elected officials and school boards, and to some extent, on the governor, but it won't matter because it's not an election year for him."
Besides keeping pressure on Mr. Pataki, Mr. Silver's mantra of education also works for his Assembly members, political strategists say. Though the Assembly is overwhelmingly Democratic, some members are elected from closely contested districts in Westchester, Rockland and Long Island, where education is typically the main concern.
"It's a way to show that the Assembly is taking leadership on this critical issue," said Richard Schrader, a Democratic analyst, who has studied polling data. "He's providing real political capital for his marginal suburban members, particularly in the downstate suburbs."
Mr. Silver himself rejected the suggestion that he had seized upon preschool education as a way to attack the governor. "This is not about games, this is not about politics," he said. "Educating 4-year-olds should not be about politics. I believe in educating these children."
Mr. Silver and his allies say he has a genuine interest in education. After all, they say, he secured financing for the prekindergarten and classroom reduction programs in 1997, after agreeing to the governor's request for a program that reduces local school taxes through infusions of state aid.
Whenever the governor has proposed less money for these programs, Mr. Silver has bargained for more in return for other budget concessions. Some political observers see the governor's proposal to eliminate the programs altogether this year as a continuation of this horse-trading ritual. 
Robert Lowry, associate director of the New York State Council of School Superintendents, said Mr. Silver might be thinking of his legacy in Albany. "I don't think it's all about bargaining positions and responding to polls," he said. "I believe there's some heartfelt commitment to the idea that providing kids with a better beginning is important."
But some critics say that all the finger-pointing now by Mr. Silver does not change the fact that he was as much to blame as anyone for the state's budget crisis. 
Elizabeth Lynam, director of state studies for the Citizens Budget Commission, said political leaders in Albany, Mr. Silver included, approved record increases in education spending even when they saw that the economy was slowing.
"They all went along, like the proverbial ostrich, with their heads in the sand," she said. "The last few years, they've been setting up school districts to fall because they were making commitments of money that wasn't there."

The top commander of NATO laid out his vision today for a radical overhaul of how United States forces are deployed in Europe, which would reduce the American presence in Germany in favor of smaller, less costly bases in Eastern Europe.
 The commander, Gen. James L. Jones, said the plans, which were still at an "embryonic stage," would shift the weight of American forces from Western Europe to eastern countries, like Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania, which are closer to the post-cold-war conflicts of today. 
 "With an alliance that is moving to the east, it stands to me as eminently logical that we will have more contacts with the east," General Jones said in a briefing here, at the European headquarters of the United States forces. "We will be looking for ways to be more flexible, more agile." 
He said he would visit NATO's future members in Eastern Europe this spring to brief them on the proposals, and would be in a position to begin carrying out the first stages in about a year.
General Jones, who became the NATO military chief as well as the commander of American forces in Europe in January, portrayed the process as part of a broader transformation of the alliance's war-fighting abilities.
But it is also occurring against the backdrop of a political rift between Germany and the United States. That rift, he said, could propel the debate over where to send troops in unpredictable directions.
"Timing is everything," said General Jones, who first presented his thinking to members of Congress last month and plans to offer more details in testimony before the House and Senate this month.
Some lawmakers have called for the Pentagon to pull its troops out of Germany as a way of punishing Chancellor Gerhard Schroder for his refusal to support an American-led war on Iraq. General Jones insisted his plans had nothing to do with the current trans-Atlantic tension.
"I cannot dictate what people think," he said. "But I will do everything possible to dissuade them."
General Jones said he had discussed the plans with German military officials, but had not presented them formally. He said he did not detect any "trauma" on the part of the Germans.
Rumors of base closings, however, are already getting headlines here. Today, a German newspaper, Die Welt, reported that the reductions would fall heavily on Heidelberg, a university town that is the European headquarters of the Army and the base for its V Corps.
There are 78,000 American troops in Germany, many with families. In Heidelberg and other towns like Kaiserslautern, which is near the Ramstein Air Base, they are an important part of the local economy.
General Jones singled out Ramstein as a base with "enduring value," which would be likely to remain open, regardless of the movement of troops elsewhere. He declined to comment on Heidelberg, saying, "There's no pocket list of what bases might be closed or reduced, or where we might go." 
Dampening speculation in Eastern Europe about new bases may prove just as futile. Last week, the defense minister of Bulgaria returned from a trip to Washington and told his country that the United States might put four or five bases there as a reward for Bulgaria's support of President Bush.
General Jones said he had not discussed bases with the Bulgarians, or with officials from Poland, Hungary, or Romania. The plan has not even been formally presented to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, though officials said he generally supported its direction.
A former commandant of the Marine Corps, General Jones championed the idea of what he calls "lily pads," compact bases scattered around the world from which soldiers can jump off into hot spots.
He noted two bases that could be used as models for Europe. The Marine base at Okinawa, he said, typified his preferred approach to deployment. The soldiers serve four-month hitches, without their families, and are rotated back to their home base, Camp Pendleton in California.
Camp Bondsteel, which was built to house troops during the Kosovo conflict, typifies his preference for stripped-down facilities, with wooden barracks and makeshift helicopter hangars. Asked how it qualified as a lily pad, General Jones said, "I've got to come up with a better word."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
From Closer to Convert

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

DATELINE: PHOENIX, March 3 

 BODY:
Sixteen months ago, Byung Hyun Kim suffered a double-barreled blow from which some pitchers would never recover. In startling succession, in Games 4 and 5 of the 2001 World Series against the Yankees, Kim, the Arizona Diamondbacks' closer, squandered ninth-inning leads by throwing balls that wound up flying over fences for two-out, game-tying home runs.
 Kim also gave up a second home run, in extra innings, that lost Game 4. The Diamondbacks, of course, survived those stunning losses and won the World Series. Kim survived those pitches and gained 36 saves and 8 victories last season as the Diamondbacks repeated as National League West champions. 
 Having demonstrated that those losses did not devastate him, Kim is now the central character in the Diamondbacks' intriguing spring training experiment. He is competing for a spot in the team's starting rotation, the one that features Randy Johnson, winner of the Cy Young award each of the four seasons he has pitched for Arizona, and Curt Schilling.
Kim, a 24-year-old South Korean with a submarine-style pitching delivery, declined to discuss his attempt to convert from closer to starter.
"I don't want to say a wrong answer," he said shyly, concerned that his limited mastery of English would betray him.
But even his presence at Phoenix Municipal Stadium today was interesting. He had pitched Sunday and was not scheduled to pitch in the exhibition game against the Oakland Athletics, but he opted to take the two-hour bus ride and do his daily work here instead of staying in Tucson and doing it there.
In wanting to return to starting, which he did in South Korea, Kim is trying to make a transition that is unusual in the major leagues. Boston's Derek Lowe went from being a closer with mixed success to a 21-game winner last year as a starter, but no pitcher has ever made 20 or more starts the year after gaining 30 saves as a closer.
Manager Bob Brenly spoke about Kim's attempt to start and was straightforward about it. It developed, he said, from Kim's desire to start and the return to good health of Matt Mantei.
"It was all predicated on the fact that we thought Matt Mantei was back and 100 percent healthy and could resume his role as a closer," Brenly said. "If we didn't have Mantei to close, we wouldn't be proceeding with this experiment.
"But because he's back, we feel if we're ever going to give B. K. a chance to start, this would be the time to do it."
Brenly was aware of Kim's desire to start again. 
"We try to put pitchers in a comfort zone where they can go out and feel like they're doing what they want to do to the best of their ability," Brenly said.
Kim, he added, brought some attributes to his conversion that should benefit him.
"Even as a closer, this is a guy who threw 100 or 200 pitches every day in the bullpen," Brenly said. "He's very resilient, he has a tremendous arm that can bounce back quickly, and he's got a huge arsenal of pitches at his disposal: a couple different fastballs, a couple different sliders and a straight changeup." 
But the right-handed Kim will not make the transition effortlessly. He has to master certain other elements to persuade Brenly to put him in the rotation: his pitching delivery, his pitch count and his ability to get the ball to the plate quickly with runners on base.
"In the past, he's fooled around with a lot of different motions and leg kicks and arm pumps," Brenly said. "Sometimes from hitter to hitter and pitch to pitch. But we asked him to find something that was comfortable for him and stay with it, and he's been able to do that."
Part of the consistency Brenly wanted from Kim was his windup, or no windup, delivery.
"As a reliever," Brenly said, "sometimes he used a windup, sometimes he didn't. He may start a hitter pitching out of a windup, throw ball one, go into the stretch for the next two pitches and then go back to the windup. We never knew what he was going to do. We needed to eliminate that to eliminate all the possible mistakes that come from that. He's been able to make the transformation to a delivery he likes."
Kim demonstrated his new delivery in his two-inning outing Sunday against the Chicago White Sox.
"It's close to normal," Brenly said. "He's got a couple near pauses as he goes into his windup, but it's not a Hideo Nomo-type delivery or anything like that."
Kim encountered his pitch-count problem in the first inning Sunday, throwing 25 pitches. He was more economical in the second inning, using 15.
"Stamina and ability to throw lots of pitches has never been a problem for B. K.," Brenly said. "He can throw all day long if you want him to. But we don't want to have to run him out there for 175 pitches to get a decision. We'd like to keep him in a normal range of pitch counts."
The Diamondbacks also want Kim to quicken his delivery with a runner at first base. And, Brenly said, they expect the Kim experiment to run the course of spring training.
"At this point I think so," he said. "We need to see some extended outings, see him get some innings under his belt and see how it progresses. If Kim shows he can be a No. 5 starter, that means Miguel Batista would go back to the bullpen, a role he filled tremendously for us in 2001." 
Brenly will give Kim every chance to become the fifth starter because he wants to improve the bottom end of the rotation.
"Derek Lowe is one of the best pitchers in the game," Brenly said. "He was able to make that transformation and do it very successfully. We know it's somewhat of a gamble with Kim, but we think the possible rewards are well worth the risk."

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Fell Last Month On War Fearsand Weather 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 3 

 BODY:
Sales of the lucrative, gas-guzzling giants of the auto industry -- the Escalades, Excursions, Suburbans and other big sport utility vehicles -- are sliding, according to figures released today. 
 Analysts said that rising gas prices and a drumbeat of criticism of S.U.V.'s figure in the slowing sales. But the biggest culprit, they said, is a new wave of small and medium-size sport utilities from Asian automakers that are chipping away at a crucial profit center for the domestic auto industry. 
 Over all, auto sales fell to their second-lowest pace in four and a half years last month, as snowstorms and worries about a possible war with Iraq tempered buying. Sales fell 6.7 percent from a year earlier, to a seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 15.4 million vehicles. 
Sales at General Motors fell 19 percent last month from a year earlier, and both Ford and G.M. said they were cutting their production levels for the second quarter, compared with a year ago. 
Auto sales were a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy economy last year, but slowing assembly lines and slumping sales are a troublesome economic sign, and analysts said today that the carmakers' price wars had lost their novelty with wary consumers.
"Unless they're going to offer them two for one, I don't see how they're going to keep up the sales rates they had been so optimistic about," said Diane C. Swonk, an economist at Bank One. "At some point in time, we have market saturation." 
Ford's sales were flat last month, and to maintain that pace, the company relied heavily on less lucrative sales to corporate and government fleets. The Chrysler Group's sales fell 4 percent. 
"Three words: weather, war and worry," Gary E. Dilts, senior vice president for sales at Chrysler, said in a conference call today, summing up the mood over the last month. 
Of particular concern to Wall Street is that Detroit's grip on the S.U.V. market is eroding, despite the Big Three's incentives -- zero percent financing, loans as long as six years and cash-back offers of up to $3,000. 
G.M., which has been the aggressive leader in ratcheting up Detroit's incentive war, said today that it would wait and see what its competitors did next to spur sales. 
"Right now, we're going to have to evaluate where the playing field is," said Paul Ballew, the company's chief sales analyst. 
In general, S.U.V.'s continue to gain in market share, but some shifting has been under way toward smaller and medium-size S.U.V.'s and so-called crossover utilities, which are engineered more like cars than pickups. The market share of the largest S.U.V.'s held steady in 2002, but now sales of some of them are in free fall.
Through February, sales of the Cadillac Escalade are down 28.8 percent compared with a year ago. The Chevrolet Suburban is down 39.7 percent and the Ford Excursion is down 24.3 percent. 
The Ford Explorer, smaller than those behemoths, is down 10 percent, while sales of the company's smallest S.U.V., the Escape, are up 26 percent.
Sales of full-size pickups also showed signs of weakness. The Chevrolet Silverado is down 29.4 percent this year, while smaller pickups, like the Ford Ranger, are up 8.8 percent.
Some large S.U.V.'s from foreign brands are also taking hits, with the Mercedes M-Class down 28.6 percent this year.
While G.M.'s sales of light trucks -- S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans -- have fallen 20 percent in the first two months of the year, Honda's generally smaller light trucks are up 27 percent, with a lift from sales of two new vehicles, the Pilot and the Element. In addition, the Kia division of Hyundai has added the Sorento, a small S.U.V., to the market in recent months. 
George Pipas, the chief sales analyst for Ford, said the shift toward smaller trucks had been developing for some time and was probably affected only at the fringes by rising gas prices. Of large S.U.V.'s, he said, "The segment is large and is going to remain large for several years to come, but as a percentage of the total vehicle population, I see it declining." 
Environmental groups welcome the shift in sales patterns. 
"Maybe people are starting to realize that zero percent financing on a gas guzzler isn't such a deal in the first place," said David Friedman, a senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental group.
But he added that it was premature to proclaim any broad victory of environmental groups in altering consumers' purchasing decisions.
"There are a lot of pieces to the puzzle," he acknowledged.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: TROOP MOVEMENTS; 
The Screaming Eagles Fly to the Gulf

BYLINE:  By JIM DWYER

DATELINE: CAMP NEW JERSEY, Kuwait, March 1 

 BODY:
In their desert camouflage uniforms of light beige and brown, the soldiers on the Fort Campbell airfield were clothed for weather in the Persian Gulf, not the cold, damp night air of a Kentucky winter. A thick coat of fog had dropped onto the Army base. For an instant as they filed in a long, single line onto their jet, the soldiers formed silhouettes against the murky glow of fog-shrouded runway lights.
 It was near midnight on Thursday, and the 101st Airborne Division -- the Screaming Eagles -- was beginning its flight from Kentucky to the deserts of Kuwait, a distance of some 7,000 miles. 
 For even one person such a trip would be a giant leap. For the 19,000 soldiers of the 101st, it is an industrial-strength operation that began on Wednesday and was expected to continue through Tuesday. 
A reporter from The New York Times traveled with one planeload of soldiers from the 101st, providing, in effect, an ant's view of the anthill, a glimpse of the capacity for war and an informal tote of the human costs that go along with threatening to wage it.
As part of the United States buildup for a possible invasion of Iraq, some 200,000 American soldiers are in the Persian Gulf region. In an armed conflict, military planners expect that soldiers from the 101st will be among those leading the ground campaign to seize Baghdad. The 101st can attack from the air and drop troops into position by helicopter. 
Right now, however, the troops appear to be arriving well in advance of any action since most of their equipment, including 250 or so helicopters, is still at sea and not expected to arrive for several days. Then everything must be unpacked from 1,900 cargo containers. The helicopters, for instance, were shrink-wrapped in plastic for the voyage.
The soldiers who might wage war from those helicopters had their own travel needs, including an extra pair of socks at the commissary, a last-minute wedding by an accommodating judge or chaplain and vaccinations administered in a hangar just before boarding the jet. 
On the flight that left late Thursday night, more than a few were watching the clock: one compensation for going to a war zone is that up to $5,339 a month in pay becomes tax-free. If the soldiers arrived before the calendar turned from February to March, all of their February earnings would be tax-exempt.
They know, however, that the Army cannot be rushed, a lesson that was taught again and again over the next 47 hours. "It's not like going to Nashville and getting on the plane," said Lt. Col. James Larsen, the deputy operations officer for the 101st.

Hour 1: 'Chalk 19' Is Formed
At 1 p.m. Thursday the soldiers finish their goodbyes to family and friends. Although they are hours from departure, they will be sequestered until they board the plane. During earlier troop deployments -- including the war in 1991 that drove the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait -- many families stayed with the soldiers until the final minutes, adding a ragged emotional edge to the leave-taking because the departure times dragged on for hours past the schedule. Now once the families are gone, the soldiers draw the weapons -- M-4 carbines for everyone, sidearms and Berber knives for some -- that they will carry until they come home.
Then they pile their duffle bags and rucksacks in a parking lot. Their gear is loaded onto a truck with "Chalk 19" marked on the back in white chalk. For mass deployments, the 101st moves in cohorts of soldiers and gear, each one given a chalk number, which will fill an airplane. Each chalk moves through stages: goodbye to the family, pick-up of weapons, loading of baggage onto the chalked truck, holding-time in a cafeteria, paperwork, inoculations. They are carried through those stages by buses.
Sgt. Henry DeGrace boards a bus and gazes down the line of seats, then yells: "I see some soft hats that have to go." As they deploy for combat, the soldiers are expected to be in their combat uniforms. That means Kevlar helmets must be worn. It also means that weapons are carried onto the buses and planes. After the groups are formed, the bus rolls across a scale, followed by the truck with Chalk 19's baggage; the military calculates that each passenger represents 400 pounds of blood, sweat and gear. "Anybody been lying about their weight, we're going to find out right now," Sergeant DeGrace yells.

Hour 5: Paperwork, Prayers And Other Precautions
In a hangar soldiers swipe their identification cards through a digital reader; that puts them on the passenger manifest. They stand in lines to sign wills and forms granting power of attorney, to get shots they might have missed earlier and to update any paperwork to include new family members. 
Scores of soldiers, perhaps hundreds, were married in the days before their deployment, Colonel Larsen said. 
None of those weddings were performed by Maj. Len Kircher, a United Methodist chaplain flying with Chalk 19. "I don't do spur-of-the-moment jobs," he said.
Major Kircher developed his thinking during an earlier assignment at Fort Benning, Ga. 
"I put up a sign in my office that said, 'I don't marry privates, and I don't marry teenagers,' " he said. "When I was down at Fort Benning, you'd have these 19-year-old privates wanting to marry some disenfranchised 17-year-old they just met at the Columbus Mall." The teenagers are too young, he said, and the privates are too poor.
He was astounded by the flood of babies being born at Fort Campbell's community hospital, observing that it was not a boom inspired by the potential war. But he offered a prediction: "I can guarantee that when we come back, nine months from now there will be a lot more babies."

Hour 9: Food, No Water
The troops move from the hangar to another holding area. Along the way a detail opens crates of "Meals Ready to Eat," packaged food that lasts for years and includes a magnesium chip that will heat up the entree by adding a tablespoon of water. The soldiers are told to take three of these, plus some bottled water. It turns out that the water will come in handy for more than one reason: the plane chartered for Chalk 19 has lost its water supply in the lavatories. 
As soon as that announcement is finished, a lengthy line forms outside the lone bathroom in the hangar.
It is not hard to find anxiety over the trip: the crisis with Iraq could end without a war, an outcome that most of the soldiers would welcome. But few have any desire for a long period of squatting inside tents in the desert, killing time during a prolonged diplomatic standoff. Specialist Charles Robbins, 23, of Knoxville, Tenn., said his wife, Emily, is four and a half months' pregnant with their first child, and he was not happy at the prospect of being away for the birth. But he did not resent being assigned to Iraq, even though he was not long back from Afghanistan.
"I feel this is our job; this is our duty," Specialist Robbins said.
"They can do it without me," interjected Specialist Jeff Wilkinson, 21, of Nacogdoches, Tex. He was on the verge of finishing his four-year enlistment and was ready to go to college when he learned that he was going to Kuwait. "It's called an involuntary extension."
Standing next to him, Sgt. Andrew Batovsky said he too resented having his enlistment extended. Sergeant Batovsky, 24, of Liverpool, N.Y., had entered the service when he was 18 and served in Afghanistan. "I was all set for community college," Sergeant Batovsky said. "Then they came out with this order."
Specialist Eric Budet, 28, from Springfield Gardens in Queens, N.Y., said he had been to Kosovo and the military life agreed with him. "I'm definitely going to re-enlist," he said.

Hour 11: 50 Planes
There are two ways to look at the 101st's deployment to Kuwait from Kentucky. On the one hand, it took 11 hours to go the first mile, basically across Fort Campbell from the baggage collection point to the airfield. On the other hand, inside of 24 hours the 101st division loaded 18 chartered airplanes with soldiers and sent them across the world.
Under an arrangement with the airline industry, the government can requisition commercial passenger jets for military purposes, paying the airlines for the use and a standard crew. Over the five-day deployment of the 101st, 50 separate aircraft will be used to bring the troops to the gulf region, Colonel Larsen said.
Chalk 19 was traveling on a World Airways MD-11 jet that had only economy-class seats, 10 across. Because of the plumbing difficulty, the 101st loaded cases of water into the overhead containers, causing much of the carry-on baggage to end up between the legs of the passengers. For that and other reasons, people on board could not wait for the trip to end. 
At Hour 18 when the plane stops for refueling at an Air Force base in Frankfurt, Capt. Tito Villanueva glances at his watch and sees that they are running short of time to reach Kuwait airspace for the February deadline that would mean the month of tax-free pay.
"We're going to be pushing it," Captain Villanueva said with a smile. "We may have to take over the plane and accelerate it. Maybe we should lighten the load -- leave a few people behind."
"I am all about that," one soldier called out.
Before anyone can leave the plane in Frankfurt, Sergeant DeGrace tells the soldiers to leave their weapons behind. A team will stay to guard them. The soldiers who were recently given the smallpox inoculation are warned that if they are changing bandages, they must throw them only into a black-and-yellow container outside the gate.

Hour 27: Did Anyone Tell You Why You Are Here?
At the airport in Kuwait City, the passengers on the Chalk 19 flight are told to leave the plane, swipe their identification cards at a portable reader held by other soldiers in a sport utility vehicle and then immediately board a bus. They are not to stand outside talking or smoking.
The sense of menace had grown an hour earlier as the plane approached the airport. The cabin crew had turned off all the lights and had told soldiers sitting by the windows to pull down the shades so the jet could land in near darkness. The pilot tried to point out rows of oil wells on one side of the plane with controlled fires coming from their crowns, but it was too late to see them since the shades had already been pulled down.
One of the senior officers called back to Fort Campbell to report that Chalk 19 had arrived in Kuwait airspace on Feb. 28 at 11:30 p.m. No one argued the point.
A military briefer boarded and said the terrorist threat was high. He explained security precautions for traveling off base. 
The buses dropped Chalk 19 at a holding tent the length of a football field, and several other soldiers gave briefings. 
"Did anyone tell you the reason you are here?" one said.
"To kill," someone called out.
"War," another person shouted.
"Force protection," the briefer said, reminding the soldiers that they had to be ready to protect themselves to carry out their mission.

Hour 47: Camp New Jersey
The baggage followed the convoy of buses in two trucks to Camp New Jersey, the primitive camp where most of Chalk 19 will be stationed. They had nothing to see but the endless sand. They had little running water. So far, there was no telling how long they would sit and wait. Another military unit had just cleared out of Camp New Jersey before the 101st arrived; they moved deeper into the desert.
Sergeant DeGrace, the leader of Chalk 19, had brought his troops from Kentucky to the desert. "What a beautiful country," he declared to no one in particular. "I can see why we're here."
Hundreds of duffle bags and rucksacks were stacked on the ground. As the soldiers picked through them, the wind picked up, and dust rose in smoggy brown sheets, which whipped across men and women, bags and buses. The tents shuddered and held. Two soldiers moved across the horizon, silhouetted just as they had been 47 hours earlier, when they climbed into the jet in the damp fog of the Kentucky night.
In two grinding days across 7,000 miles, the foggy dew had been swapped for a hazy dust. The sense of place and perspective vanished. As the soldiers bent into the wind, in a world turned inside out, it was not possible to say if they were coming or going; only that they had arrived as promised.

HEADLINE: Antismoking Measures Gain In Heart of Tobacco Country 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Ky., Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The tobacco patches that cover the hilltops near here are dusted with snow, their sheds locked up till the spring thaw. But what is occupying farmers and politicians across Kentucky, the Carolinas and the rest of tobacco country seems as improbable as a blizzard in August.
 Governors, lawmakers and even chambers of commerce are calling for increases in cigarette taxes -- not only to close gaping state budget deficits, but also to help prevent smoking. In state capitols and county courthouses, bans on smoking that were unthinkable a year or two ago are being enacted every few days. 
 In short, a seismic political shift that was a decade in the making is toppling old alliances and redrawing the landscape of tobacco country. Besieged growers, their yearly quotas cut by half or more, have switched allegiances and are shunning the cigarette manufacturers who now buy as much or more tobacco from foreign farmers. Instead, the growers are turning for aid to the very antismoking advocates they once saw as mortal enemies. 
 Now, public health groups like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids are lobbying Congress for a $16 billion buyout for tobacco farmers in exchange for the farmers' support of the regulation of cigarettes by the Food and Drug Administration. As a result, efforts at local and state levels to curb smoking are encountering less and less resistance.
 "I've been in these wars since 1990," said Anthony J. DeLucia, a professor at East Tennessee State University who is the chairman of the American Lung Association. "It used to be the health groups would parade up somebody with emphysema or cancer, and the tobacco industry would have the farmer. We'd use these human shields in our arguments, as symbols. But the tobacco industry can't jerk the chain on the tobacco farmers like they used to, because the farmers have realized that the industry would love to just move everything overseas, where they can pay a next-to-nothing wage and spray any pesticide they want."
 For their part, farmers say they see little point in putting up much of a fight anymore and are more interested in winning a federal buyout that will let growers leave the business with at least their dignity intact. "Once you stand in front of a tractor-trailer truck and get run over two or three times, it gets more difficult to stand in front of it again," said Jimmy Hill, a grower in Kinston, N.C.
 With farmers largely sitting out the debate, antismoking legislation is sweeping the Southeast.
 Here in Lexington, the Fayette County Board of Health voted unanimously on Feb. 10 to draft a smoking ban for bars and restaurants. It would be the first such prohibition anywhere in Kentucky, where farmers in 119 out of 120 counties make this the most tobacco-dependent state in the nation and where a nation-leading 3 in 10 adults and 4 in 10 high school students are smokers.
 On Feb. 3, just outside Winston-Salem in the heart of North Carolina's tobacco belt, Yadkin County commissioners banned smoking in parts of the courthouse. On Feb. 12, the state's House of Representatives in Raleigh banned smoking in its chamber, a week after the Tennessee State Senate did the same.
 In South Carolina, Clemson University announced a ban on smoking in all dormitories this month. On Feb. 24, organizers of a drive to outlaw smoking in restaurants and bars in Charleston, the state's biggest tourist destination and a onetime cigar-manufacturing center, drew the city's mayor and 200 other people to a kickoff event, including a local trial lawyer who donated $2 million to help.
 A decade ago, farmers and the public health groups were bitter enemies. The Depression-era program of quotas for tobacco production was constantly under attack in Congress, and the antismoking lobby -- led by the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association and the American Cancer Society -- supported its abolition. But beginning in Virginia in 1994 and in Kentucky in 1995, farmers and officials of the health groups met in halting, initially contentious talks that did much to clear up misconceptions on both sides.
 "We became educated," said Amy Barkley, then a local tobacco control advocate in Kentucky and now a coordinator for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in five tobacco-producing states -- "the belly of the beast," as she calls it.
 "We learned that getting rid of the tobacco program didn't stop one cigarette from being smoked, it just opened it up to lower prices, which could mean the opposite," Ms. Barkley said. "We were sold on the health benefit of quotas and price supports. So we dropped our opposition to the program and then began defending it."
 Growers, in turn, let the health groups know that just because they raised tobacco did not mean they opposed any restrictions on its use. "I have five grandchildren from 6 to 16 -- that's five reasons I don't want to see young people smoking," said Mr. Hill, a nonsmoker who is a director of the Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corporation, which represents about 25,000 growers in five states.
 Mr. Hill said members of his co-op at first thought their leaders were crazy for talking to the health groups, but soon "saw that these guys were more sensitive to the issues than our so-called friends," the cigarette manufacturers.
 Since the mid-1990's, he said, flue-cured growers have lost 46 percent of their quotas as cigarette makers are simply buying less domestic tobacco. Will Snell, an agricultural economist at the University of Kentucky, said burley leaf growers -- those who till the soil in the hilly terrain of Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia and Ohio -- had lost as much as 60 percent of their quotas in the same time. Consumption of tobacco has declined slightly, Mr. Snell said, but the main reason for plummeting production quotas is that cigarette makers are buying more and more overseas, in countries like Brazil, Argentina and even Zimbabwe.
 What began in secret in the mid-1990's has now come nearly to fruition as tobacco growers are pushing for a federal buyout worth $15 billion to $20 billion, and their strongest backing is coming from public health groups.
 A number of bills are on the table in Washington, backed not only by influential Republicans from tobacco-producing states like Senators Bill Frist of Tennessee and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, but also by Democrats more concerned with health care, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. In broad strokes, the bills would pay $8 a pound to owners of the quotas, and $4 per pound to actual growers, many of whom rent quotas from owners for around 50 cents a pound. The quota system would be done away with, though farmers are still hoping for a floor on domestic tobacco prices.
 For a grower with 100 acres in flue-cured tobacco country, the buyout could mean a payment of $800,000; the owner of that much quota would get $1.6 million. Mr. Hill said the payments would allow farmers to "get out of tobacco with some dignity."
 Ideally, he said, it would also help those farmers who choose to stick with tobacco compete with imported leaf: "You'd retire half the growers, and by eliminating the quota as a cost of production, you'd lower the price of American tobacco by 40 to 50 cents a pound."
 Mr. Hill said tobacco farmers were merely bowing to the inevitable. "In our Bible class, we've just started studying the Book of Daniel, and the lesson's titled, 'The Handwriting on the Wall,' " he said. "You can't smoke in bars or office buildings, and the pressure is building. Matter of fact, you've got to look to find a place you can smoke."
 Much of the added pressure is coming on the price to consumers, in the form of higher cigarette taxes. With state budget deficits soaring into the billions, 20 states increased their excise taxes on tobacco last year, among them Tennessee, the fifth-largest tobacco producing state, which raised it to 20 cents a pack from 13 cents. This year, Tennessee is considering another increase, and so, too, are lawmakers and governors in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Georgia. Even the chambers of commerce in North Carolina and Kentucky have come out for the first time in favor of higher cigarette taxes .
 Rosalind Kurita, a Tennessee state senator and a registered nurse who recently won a ban on smoking in the Capitol, is also pushing to raise the excise tax on cigarettes to 60 cents, close to the national average of 62 cents. "It's the right mechanism, the right message and the right time," Ms. Kurita said. She said it would produce $187 million in sorely needed revenue, help deter children and youths from taking up smoking and indirectly help the state cut its soaring health care costs, since smoking is the leading preventable cause of death.
 That another tax increase was conceivable, let alone a likelihood, had everything to do with the new way of seeing the tobacco industry in tobacco country, Ms. Kurita said, as divided between farmers who deserve sympathy and manufacturers who do not. "Big Tobacco is growing tobacco in every country in the world," she said. "They will undercut my Tennessee farmer in a heartbeat."
 In Kentucky, the 3-cents-a-pack cigarette tax, the country's second lowest, has not risen since 1970, and leading state lawmakers have killed a tax increase in this year's short session. But lawmakers then stunned antismoking advocates by saying they would support raising the tax to 47 cents in next year's session.
 At a hearing in Frankfort on Feb. 4, even the dean of the University of Kentucky's medical school, Dr. Emery A. Wilson, spoke for a tax increase after 15 years of silence on tobacco control efforts. His voice breaking, Dr. Wilson said he had held his tongue until then out of fear of political retaliation from farmers and their representatives in the Legislature.
 "At some point, we need to do more what is right than what is politically expedient," he said. "None of us will win the Nobel Prize, become president or do anything of real lasting significance in the world. Most likely what we do will be through our children. And one of the best things we could do would be to protect their health."
 Of course, his remarks were not the profile in courage they might have seemed at an earlier time. In an interview a day later, Dr. Wilson acknowledged, "It's certainly safe for us to take that position now."

HEADLINE: Comptrollers Say Albany Budget Will Increase City's 2004 Deficit 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The city and state comptrollers both released reports yesterday warning that New York City's plan to balance its budget next year was full of risks, and that Gov. George E. Pataki's spending plan would substantially increase the city's deficit.
 City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. released a report estimating that the city's deficit for the fiscal year beginning July 1 had grown to $3.9 billion, a half-billion-dollar increase over Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's January estimate. 
 State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi's report said that the city's budget plan included $3.4 billion in risky assumptions, warning that the city was counting on things like a nearly $1 billion commuter tax and savings from unions that might not materialize. The report added that the city might be underestimating what it would spend on police overtime.
Both reports painted grim pictures of a sputtering economy that is driving down tax revenue, while the costs of pensions, Medicaid and debt service rise sharply. Mr. Thompson said that the city's pension funds, which are expected to earn interest of 8 percent a year, instead lost 8.3 percent in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and had lost another 7.3 percent during the first half of this fiscal year.
The report said the city would have to increase its contribution to the pension funds to $2.7 billion next year from $1.8 billion this year, and to $4.6 billion by 2007.
Both reports concluded that Governor Pataki's budget proposal would cost the city money. Mr. Thompson said it would cost $844 million, not including the governor's opposition to the nearly $1 billion commuter tax or the $200 million from new tolls or other initiatives that the mayor wants. Mr. Hevesi put the net cost at $295 million next year.

A Bubblegum Duo Sets Off Squeals and Squirms

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 3 

 BODY:
They pout and strut on stage. They strip and kiss between songs. They are Russia's biggest musical export since Shostakovich, and surely its most controversial. 
 Russia's new pop sensation -- two teenage girls called Tatu -- reached No. 1 on the charts in England in January. In all, they have hit No. 1 in 10 countries, a first for a Russian band. They were closing in on the American Top 20 as they began a tour in the United States last week. 
 But their image is making people squirm. The duo, Yulia Volkova and Elena Katina, were discovered by Ivan Shapovalov, a Russian child psychologist-turned-advertising executive. To the horror of children's advocates, the singers were 14 when Mr. Shapovalov chose them from among several hundred young women he auditioned when creating the band. They dress in schoolgirl uniforms with short skirts.
Mr. Shapovalov, 36, plays coyly on references to youth. He acknowledges that he selected the English school uniforms to emphasize the girls' youth. He also says he has seen child pornography while surfing the Internet, the main objection in England, where the band's video caused an uproar in January. 
But Mr. Shapovalov denies that Tatu's image is based on pornography. The performers, now 18, are not children. Nor are they being forced, he said. In his view, Westerners, put simply, are prudes. 
"All our inspiration is from childhood," Mr. Shapovalov said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles last week. "Why should this be hidden? Social organizations are afraid of violence, but what kind of violence is there with Tatu? They are two teenagers singing about love." 
The scuffle goes to the heart of a major cultural divide between Russia and Western countries like England and the United States. Most Russians see the West as sexually repressed. During President Bill Clinton's impeachment, Russians admired his manliness instead of judging his morals. In Russia, feminism is a dirty word, despite the Soviet era's emphasis on women's rights.
Some Russian intellectuals argue that, though the girls may not be musical powerhouses as far as talent is concerned, they have already helped improve Russia's image abroad. In Eastern Europe, where anti-Russian sentiment is still strong, young people are singing Tatu's Russian songs. They have brought Russia into the American mainstream, as guests on the Jay Leno show this week with a top-playing single on American radio.
"People are saying that it's a pity the country that gave the world Pushkin and Gagarin is now represented by lesbian nymphets," said Artyom Troitsky, a music critic and founder of Russian Playboy. "But that's garbage. Compared to how Russia is usually seen -- the dirty war in Chechnya, Russian mafia, corruption, money laundering -- these two teenage girls are nice and clean."
The group is the product of the sexual free-for-all that ensued after the fall of the Soviet Union. After the strait-laced Soviet state collapsed in 1991, sex exploded onto city streets, television shows and advertisements.
"In the Soviet Union, anything erotic, and particularly nontraditional, was completely banned," said Igor S. Kon, a well-known Russian sex therapist. "That which is forbidden is all the more desirable. In that sense, these girls have a very well- thought-out image."
But the new freedoms that brought openness in sexual relations also carried economic woes. The Soviet economy collapsed and a raw, new capitalism emerged, plunging millions of Russians into poverty. In the scramble to survive, prostitution and human trafficking jumped, as did production of child pornography.
In England last month, child rights activists deplored Mr. Shapovalov's approach. Channel 4 in London called it "sick" and attacked the record label for supporting their "open pedophile message." 
"What we objected to and didn't find funny was Ivan marketing them as an underage sex fantasy," said Michele Elliott, director of Kidscape, a children's protection group. "These girls are talented. It's a shame they were marketed off the backs of hundreds of thousands of sexually abused children."
Mr. Shapovalov, in the interview, condemned the child pornography industry, but said Western countries, in particular England and the United States, are equally responsible for it as some of its biggest consumers. One of the reasons, he said, is sexual repression. 
"I am getting calls from England asking if I really went to children's pornography sites, when half of England is sitting on the Internet looking at them," Mr. Shapovalov said. "It's too bad that Russia is paying with its image for open relations, but that's life. Russia makes it and the whole world watches."
Cultural differences aside, the band was built to shock. Ms. Katina and Ms. Volkova combine a sometimes baffling mixture of kissing and embracing with school girl uniforms that often appears more male fantasy than lesbian love. It was as if Mr. Shapovalov, having studied MTV, drew up a list of exactly what would be most likely to catch the attention of both Western and Russian audiences. 
"They were 14 when I found them," he said, adding that his friends "looked at me as if I was a maniac."
Bob Guccione Jr., founder of Spin, an influential music magazine, and currently publisher of Gear, a men's magazine, said Tatu was "a timeless success gimmick of someone that has found a button to push. 
"This is not a problem that will bring down civilization," he said. "It's like getting worked up over Kabuke."
America, it seems, has not taken offense. The girls were unruly as Jay Leno guests, kissing lustily in defiance of a request that they not and wearing T-shirts that used a potent Russian expletive to denounce the possible war in Iraq. In short, their tour has been a success, said David Junk, the head of Universal Records in Russia, the American record label that represents the group.
"I've been trying to get Russian bands to break out of Russia for years now, and finally we've done it," Mr. Junk said. "Hopefully it's the beginning of the Russian invasion."
Mr. Troitsky disagrees. 
"From the point of view of music, it is nothing," he said. "There are plenty of serious things going on in Russia right now. This is just a pleasant little nonsense."

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Telecommunications:Celestica Will Close Oklahoma City Plant 

BYLINE:  AP

 BODY:
 The sluggish economy and the lengthy downturn in the telecommunications industry are forcing Celestica Inc. to close its Oklahoma City operation, putting 450 people out of work, officials said. Celestica, which is based in Toronto, manufactures electronic products like printed circuit boards for large telecommunications equipment. 
The company plans to transfer the remaining work in Oklahoma City to other Celestica sites, affecting about 450 employees, Stephen W. Delaney, Celestica's president for operations in the Americas, said late last week. The Oklahoma City plant will close by November. The 40-year-old plant employed more than 9,500 people at its peak in the 1970's. Employees will be offered severance packages and Celestica has begun negotiations with local union officials, Mr. Delaney said. In September 2001, Lucent Technologies sold its Oklahoma City operations to Celestica for $570 million. In July, Celestica announced it would cut 500 jobs, or half its work force, at the Oklahoma City plant by the end of 2002. Eliminating the Oklahoma City operation is part of a consolidation effort within the company, Mr. Delaney said. Shares of Celestica rose 20 cents, to $12.26.

McBride, a Mersey Hit, Still Longs for Home

BYLINE:  By JAMIE TRECKER

DATELINE: LIVERPOOL, England 

 BODY:
Brian McBride, the only player to score goals in successive World Cups for the United States, has made a big impact here. On loan to Everton, he has cemented his reputation as an elite player in a league known for chewing up and spitting out lesser talents. 
 McBride is even feted in the local papers as a savior for a club plagued by financial problems. Everton is currently fourth in the 20-team Premier League, 6 points ahead of intracity rival Liverpool, and McBride has tallied four goals and two assists in seven games. 
 He is considered such a sure thing that before Everton's match against Southampton on Feb. 22, the odds were 9 to 2 that McBride would score the first goal, perhaps the ultimate praise in a country known for betting on absolutely everything. In the end, he did not score in Everton's 2-1 victory, although the Canadian striker Tomasz Radzinski did, twice.
"He's been the player who has made the biggest impact in the Premiership in the January signings," Everton's manager, David Moyes, said. "He's just been terrific for us." 
McBride has been widely rumored to be a target for purchase -- if not by Everton, then by a team making a Champions League or UEFA Cup run. Both Everton and Major League Soccer officials confirm he is on the block, despite his signing a new four-year contract with M.L.S. The asking price would be steep, perhaps as much as $5 million at a time when the global transfer market has been stagnant as clubs across Europe fight inflation. 
For most American soccer players, such a prospect would be cause for celebration. But not for McBride. Despite his love for soccer, McBride is first and foremost an American. It is only with reluctance that he talks about a future abroad, preferring to talk about the things he would miss were he to leave the United States. 
"I've spent nine years in Columbus," McBride said of the Ohio city he has called home since M.L.S. was formed in 1996.
"Dina and Ashley and I love it," he said of his wife and daughter. "I miss things there -- like Mitchell's steakhouse. Or Lou Manetti's pizza in Chicago. It's the best pizza in the world. I suppose there are things here that we would like, but we don't know about them." 
Accepted wisdom has it that American players have to go abroad if they are to improve. But McBride, 30, feels that might not be the case for him, and moreover, it might not be best for his family. 
"M.L.S. has been a good deal for a lot of guys," he said.
"Comparing the two is really like comparing apples and oranges," he said of M.L.S. and the Premier League. "The speed is different, but every year M.L.S. gets faster." 
Liverpool, of course, is one of the cities that has been a magnet for Americans over the years, almost entirely because the Beatles were formed here. The same wry humor and plain-spokeness that drove that band's popularity is in evidence around the city. At Goodison Park, Everton's home ground, a small sign at the player's entrance reads "Grass grows by the inch, ruined by the foot."
The downtown -- once a victim of the withering strikes that crippled the shipping industry in the 1970's and 80's -- is now vibrant and alive with music and the arts. And unlike other English cities that are still feeling the effects of centuries-old class divisions, the people here are warm. Everton also has a reputation as one of the friendliest clubs in the league. 
Yet, it is telling that the players McBride says welcomed him at the club -- Thomas Gravesen from Denmark and Niclas Alexandersson of Sweden -- are fellow expatriates. 
"Thomas was great," McBride said. "He called me at the hotel where I spent three weeks and said 'I stay up late, call me any time.' Niclas and I usually watch movies on the bus together. 
"I had no expectation of starting, but when I arrived some guys were hurt and I went right into the team," McBride said of his arrival at Everton.
And he immediately scored goals, so there he has stayed. Moyes has told the club's supporters via the team's Web site that he would like to keep McBride; indeed, McBride might not have come over at all had it not been for Moyes, who coached him at the First Division's Preston North End several years ago. 
"He's the same he was at Preston," McBride said of Moyes. "Meticulous, demanding and honest. He knows when to get into you and he's fun to play for. The two days Dina and I talked about the loan, I knew it would be easier for me to come because I would be working under him again." 
McBride said that Moyes is similar to Bruce Arena, the coach of the United States national team. "Both are very organized, and their team talks can last awhile," he said. "When they're done, you know your game plan and what the opponents will probably do. But they never profess to know everything. That's important, because sometimes a manager gives you that and then the opponents do something different and maybe you can't straighten it out." 
In years past, someone like McBride might have felt compelled to stay in England to play at the top, but that is no longer the case. Although there are a handful of Americans playing abroad today, the United States national team has shown that the top contributors can be home-based -- Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley stand out clearly. 
Many here do not want to see McBride leave. The question on most fans' lips is whether McBride will stay. The answer is cloudy. Moyes, when asked if McBride would be purchased, was noncommittal, putting the ball in M.L.S.'s court. "I think your system is different over there, so I really don't know," he said. 
As for McBride, he is fairly plain: "I expect to be home April 1 in Columbus. Anything else, I'll have to look at as it comes up."

HEADLINE: Westchester Lawmakers Ban Smoking in Workplaces 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, March 3 

 BODY:
The Westchester County Board of Legislators voted 12 to 3 tonight to outlaw smoking in all indoor workplaces.
 The ban, which will go into effect in 90 days, met its stiffest opposition from the restaurant and tavern industry, whose businesses are covered to protect workers there. 
 The county executive, Andrew Spano, is expected to sign the legislation, which will join bans already approved in New York City and in Nassau County. 
The Westchester legislation does not have loopholes for promotional uses or allot extra time to phase out specially ventilated smoking sections, as New York City's ban does.
Dennis Gallagher, the general manager of the Willett House restaurant in Port Chester, N.Y., said the ban would push 20 percent of his business into adjacent Connecticut, where there are no bans on smoking. He said half of the people calling for reservations want to know if they can smoke.
Six years ago, when the Board of Health told restaurants they had to reconfigure to create separate areas and ventilation for nonsmokers, the restaurant spent $500,000 to remodel, he said.
"This law isn't about secondhand smoke," he said, "it's about the American Cancer Society trying to get people to stop smoking."
James O'Toole, a bartender at Dudley's Parkview Restaurant in New Rochelle, testified that if the law was passed, "I'll be on the unemployment line."
But Lillian Jones, an advocacy director for The American Cancer Society, said that studies based on tax revenues of restaurants where bans have been imposed show there are no adverse effects on business. "In fact there have been increases," she said. Ms. Jones said polls found that 90 percent of Westchester residents think secondhand smoke is harmful and that their patronage of local establishments would increase or not change if smoking were banned.
David Martin, executive director of the American Lung Association of Hudson Valley, said that studies in 80 cities have found that smoking bans had no negative effect on businesses, and in many cases help them.

HEADLINE: Justices Seem to Lean to Charity Telemarketer 

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3 

 BODY:
A concerted effort by many of the nation's leading charities to explain to the Supreme Court what they regard as the dangers of limiting protections for charitable solicitation appeared close to bearing fruit today.
 The occasion was an argument on the Illinois attorney general's effort to bring consumer fraud charges against a telemarketer that keeps nearly all the money it raises on behalf of a veterans' charity. 
 The court gave a skeptical hearing to the state's assertion that a fund-raising pitch that was not affirmatively false could nonetheless be so misleading as to strip it of the First Amendment protection that normally surrounds charitable solicitations.
"I don't know how you can possibly prosecute people for fraud where there is no fraud," Justice Stephen G. Breyer told Richard S. Huszagh, an assistant Illinois attorney general. 
Justice Breyer said the briefs filed in the case on behalf of charities were "filled with examples" where telemarketers kept all the money they raised in campaigns that were nonetheless "perfectly legitimate" because they served to educate the public or build awareness of a new charity.
In this case, the Illinois Supreme Court dismissed the state's charges against Telemarketing Associates Inc. on the basis of United States Supreme Court precedents that bar states from limiting the share that fund-raisers can keep or requiring charities to inform prospective donors of their fund-raising arrangements. The justices' decision to hear the state's appeal, an appeal supported by 45 other states, alarmed many charities, which feared that the court might be about to reconsider or limit its protective precedents.
That fear does not appear close to being realized, at least judging by the justices' responses today to Illinois's argument.
The state's position is that Telemarketing Associates committed fraud by allowing donors to infer that most of the money it raised on behalf of a charity called VietNow would go for such stated purposes as delivering food baskets and providing shelter to homeless veterans; in fact, the contract between the fund-raiser and its client called for the telemarketer to keep 85 percent of the money raised.
Even if the telemarketer did not actually lie about the arrangement, Mr. Huszagh said, there was fraudulent misrepresentation "if the public reasonably understands that substantially more" of the money raised would go to the charity. "There is no constitutional value in artificially contrived half-truths," the assistant attorney general said.
Objections from the justices came quickly. "Who's to say how much is too much" for a fund-raiser to keep, Justice Antonin Scalia asked, adding that "I'm not comfortable at all" with the state's view that there is a limit beyond which a presumption of fraud is justified.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked, "How would anyone know when the attorney general was going to charge them?" 
And Justice David H. Souter said, "I don't see where any charitable fund-raiser could draw a line in advance." If the state wins its case, he said, fund-raisers will be able to protect themselves only by disclosing their arrangements to every person called, "which would totally undercut our precedents that you can't require disclosure."
The Bush administration supported Illinois. Deputy Solicitor General Paul D. Clement told the justices that "it really will be open season for charitable solicitation fraud" if Illinois is not able to pursue its case.
Representing the telemarketer, Eric Copilevitz said small, new or unpopular charities often had to pay more to get their messages across.
"High fund-raising costs along with a failure to disclose cannot be the basis" for fraud charges, Mr. Copilevitz said. "I don't believe you can measure the worth of an organization by economic efficiency."
He said his client's fee covered not just fund-raising activities but also publishing a magazine and maintaining an 800 number for conveying information to veterans.
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy asked whether, assuming that most people would not give money if they knew the real extent of the fund-raising costs, "there is anything the state can do" to protect consumers.
Mr. Copilevitz said fund-raisers must disclose their arrangements if directly asked and must file regular statements with the attorney general's office.
So the rule is "if asked, must tell," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg observed, adding, "The sophisticated person who will ask is protected, but if a person doesn't ask, is it against the First Amendment" to require disclosure?
Yes, Mr. Copilevitz replied, in order to provide "breathing space" for the First Amendment.
The case, Madigan v. Telemarketing Associates, No. 01-1806, has drawn widespread attention in the nonprofit world. Independent Sector, a trade organization representing some 700 nonprofit agencies, filed a brief on behalf of the telemarketer. But a watchdog organization, the Wise Giving Alliance of the Better Business Bureau, supported the state, as did AARP, which said the elderly were particularly vulnerable to appeals from unscrupulous fund-raisers.
The justices typically do read the briefs in a case, but do not often refer to them as explicitly as they did in today's argument.
In the state courts in the earlier phase of the case, Illinois presented a statement from one potential donor who said she had asked what proportion of the money would go to VietNow and had been told 90 percent.
But the heart of the case before the justices was the state's assertion that fraud could be found not only in such direct misrepresentations but also in partial truths and incomplete disclosures. If a solicitor asks for money on behalf of people who died on Sept. 11 and it turns out to be for the solicitor's "parents who died in Topeka on Sept. 11, 1995," Mr. Huszagh said, "that's misleading."

Cavalli Turns a Legacy Of Flash Into a Carnival

BYLINE:  By Guy Trebay

DATELINE: MILAN 

 BODY:
According to an article once published in Vanity Fair, a conversational exchange took place some years ago between Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace on the Spanish Steps in Rome. 
 "You dress elegant women," Mr. Versace said to his older rival. "You dress sophisticated women." Of himself, Mr. Versace added an Italian phrase, the essential translation of which is, "I dress tarts." 
 A lot has changed in the world in the nearly six years since Mr. Versace was murdered on the steps of his house in Miami Beach, not least the loyalties of the particular customers Mr. Versace had in mind. With Mr. Versace dead, it falls to Roberto Cavalli to provide the tarts of the world with something to put on.
Looking back at the poured, fitted, sculptured, corseted, safety-pinned, fishtailed, bondage-belted and deeply decollete dresses that earned Mr. Versace fame, and a footnote in bad movie history (viz: "Showgirls"), the clothes seem sexy and not all that decadent in contrast to the current fashion scene. Given that a great majority of print advertisements today depict models in next to nothing, often with their legs spread wide, Mr. Versace's designs now seem charming and decidedly chaste. 
The clothes that Mr. Cavalli presents on the runway, by contrast, are deliriously, and vitally, vulgar. "Corsets like sheaths, feather-light body suits with architectural drapings," the program notes said of Mr. Cavalli's fall-winter 2003 show, which was presented on Monday. "Evening dresses in super-light glove leather, biker leggings that look sprayed onto the legs." 
If it is true that it takes as much work for a woman to look cheap as it does to put herself across as Grace Kelly, this is never plainer than at one of Mr. Cavalli's shows. Unlike a lot of the spectacles throughout Fashion Week, the civilian population of Milan treats Cavalli shows as an event, coming out in uninvited midday hordes, attempting to bootleg tickets, thronging the sidewalk outside the exhibition space, yammering on their cellphones to friends standing 10 feet away and then getting into operatic quarrels with the police, who insist that they move along. 
The truth about most runway presentations is that they are no more inherently glamorous than any trade show. This is not to suggest there is nothing stimulating about the vision of half-naked giantesses with pinheads stalking a catwalk, displaying slim calves, fragile ankles and the inner thighs of a 12-year-old. "I'm still amazed that I get paid to watch glamorous people walk around in glamorous clothes," said Sasha Charnin Morrison, fashion market director at Allure. But the varied images of putative glamour can bleed into one another, until the rose-strewn runway at Gucci becomes the rose petal patterns on Luisa Beccaria's dresses, which become the oversized and scentless mutant roses Dolce & Gabbana laid on each guest's numbered seat. 
There is no mistaking a Cavalli show for anything else, so unreconstructedly crude are its images and so important ultimately to an industry that dominates Milan's economy. The illusion of Fashion Week is that glamour is the capital, and that is as good a way as any of deflecting attention from the underlying commerce. More than 100,000 people descend on Milan during the Fashion Weeks for men's and women's clothes held four times a year: February, September, January and June. More than 100 shows are packed into each week (most last nine days.) By the mid-1990's, more than 70 percent of the profit side of Italy's national balance of payments was accounted for by fashion and design, according to the historian John Foot. Of the world's top 10 fashion houses, Mr. Foot writes in "Milan Since the Miracle" (Berg, 2001), six were Italian in 1999. Of those, four (Dolce & Gabbana, Prada, Versace and Armani) were based in Milan. 
In the years since the designer Walter Albini first broke with tradition in 1971 and moved his runway presentations here from Florence, this gray northern industrial city has used fashion to burnish its tough mercantile image. Over the last three decades, as the business of fashion has become more sophisticated, the culture of fashion has grown tonier and, some would suggest, put on airs. One of Gianni Versace's more bracing contributions was his shameless forthrightness. Mr. Cavalli is hardly Gianni Versace's equal in design terms, but he carries on his legacy, in a way, by pitching his fashions directly to the street.

PERSON: Daniel Robert Graham 

HEADLINE: An Elder Statesman Offers Steadiness, Not a Jolt 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3 

 BODY:
If only because Florida remains every bit the linchpin of presidential politics that it was in 2000, one Democratic contender stands out in the crowded field: Bob Graham. After all, he was the popular two-term governor of the nation's fourth most populous state. He has been in the United States Senate for 16 years and knows education, health and tax policy cold.
 He is a bona fide Southerner, a rancher and builder, in a party whose last three successful nominees have come from the old Confederacy. He has an extensive fund-raising network that could slow other candidates in one of the richest states. As chairman of the Senate intelligence committee and co-chairman of the joint Congressional inquiry into the Sept. 11 attacks, he had firsthand knowledge of the most alarming threats to national security. 
 He was scrappy enough to oppose President Bush's first $1.3 trillion tax cut on the ground that it would run up the deficit, and the Congressional resolution authorizing use of force in Iraq on the ground that it would distract from the global campaign against terrorism. He once even spat on a future publisher of The Washington Post (though he was 3 years old at the time and the publisher-to-be was Katharine Graham, who would become his half-sister-in-law). 
But Mr. Graham is also 66 years old, and if elected would be the second oldest man to begin service as president, after Ronald Reagan. He just underwent heart surgery -- a double bypass and valve replacement -- and is awaiting his doctors' clearance to campaign. He speaks, in his slight Southern drawl, in paragraphs, not sentences, in a style that is the polar opposite of flashy.
"I have a reputation, that is not undeserved, as being more of an understated person, and I'm not easily roused to fervent, some people would say charismatic, levels," Mr. Graham said in an interview in his town house on Capitol Hill the other day. "But I think maybe what the American people want right now is someone who can give them a sense of steady leadership, as opposed to an emotional jolt."
Mr. Graham is the first to say that he came slowly to his determination to run. He was first elected to the Florida Legislature in 1966, has never lost an election, and toyed with the idea of running for president in 1992, before concluding he was not ready.
"The thing I was missing was passion," Mr. Graham said. "I know how difficult the campaign for, and particularly the service as president is, and in order to undertake that, you have to want it very, very bad."
But beginning in 2001, Mr. Graham said, he found himself "concerned" at the Bush administration's willingness to undo the deficit-cutting of the 1990's, and "the thing that really fired it up from concern to outrage" was his conviction that the administration "was failing to protect the American people as it should and could from the threat of terrorism, and that Iraq, which is a minor relative threat to the country, had become a distraction from the major threat to the country, which are these shadowy groups of international terrorist organizations."
Last week, Mr. Graham filed papers to create a presidential campaign committee, becoming the ninth Democratic contender in the race. He has begun raising money and interviewing potential staff members. He has also been using his period of enforced recuperation to meet with policy experts for "an intellectual battery charge," and if doctors give him the go-ahead he expects, he plans a formal campaign announcement in Florida next month.
A number of other candidates, including three Senate colleagues -- John Edwards of North Carolina, John Kerry of Massachusetts and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut -- are months ahead of Mr. Graham in organizing, fund-raising and strategizing. Mr. Graham is not particularly well known outside Florida and Washington, he has little support among organized labor and his strength in a national campaign remains untested.
For all his vulnerabilities, Mr. Graham's prospects cannot easily be dismissed. At the very least, he could complicate the efforts by his rivals to tap the trove of Democratic donors in his home state.
"He could be a sleeper in that race, for a lot of reasons," said one longtime colleague, Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama. "One, he has maturity. He has executive experience. This is his 17th year in the Senate. That's a pretty good combination as far as depth. He's capable, decent, and he's smart and he'll work."
Mr. Graham said that "I'm not running for president to run for president, I am running to be president," and said that if he sought the nomination, he would not run for re-election to the Senate. Though he is a multimillionaire, he has not spent personal money on any of his campaigns since his first race for governor, and has no plans to do so now.
Foreign policy may have helped propel Mr. Graham into the race, but he is also familiar with the intricacies of taxes and Medicare financing, even if he is not always able to translate that expertise into easily understandable sound bites. Discussing the economy the other day, for example, he said: "We have a series of issues which are independent in terms of their analysis but are interconnected in their impact."
Instead of Mr. Bush's tax cuts, he would favor some form of "holiday" from the payroll taxes that make up the bulk of most workers' tax burden, or lowering the rates for lower-income workers, while also increasing federal aid to the states for Medicaid and new federal spending to replace aging infrastructure from schools to sewer systems.
Mr. Graham opposes what he sees as the Bush administration's efforts to move toward privatizing Medicare and Medicaid, perhaps by requiring the elderly to join health maintenance organizations to qualify for prescription drug benefits. 
Mr. Graham's friends predict he will run a dogged campaign.
Buddy Shorstein, an accountant in Jacksonville, Fla., who has known Mr. Graham since college and was his chief of staff in Tallahassee, said: "I've never seen him go after anything half-heartedly. When he makes up his mind, it's very difficult to change it. I think he really feels like the country is going the wrong direction in many areas."
Asked to name his biggest potential deficit as a candidate, Mr. Graham turned to his wife of 44 years, who was sitting in on the interview, and smiled, "Adele, do you want to answer?"
Mrs. Graham replied, "Well, I think that most important today is to get him back to good strong health, and I think we're on that path."
Mr. Graham, who raises Angus beef cattle and Holstein dairy cows, was quick to note that his doctors have been happy with his recovery, and added, "I was very happy when the doctor told me that I had a Holstein cow valve" in the replacement surgery.
Then there are the notebooks, the daily logs of personal and political activities that Mr. Graham has kept formore than 25 years, their covers color-coded by season. In their thousands of pages, Mr. Graham records his weight, changes of clothes and other minutiae. In 2000, Time magazine made such sport of the logs that some Democrats thought the habit spoiled Mr. Graham's prospects of becoming Al Gore's running mate.
Mr. Graham said he began carrying the notebooks during his first gubernatorial race, inspired by the example of his father, who always carried notebooks around his dairy farm, noting sick cows or fences in need of mending. Mr. Graham notes the names and needs of constituents, to remind himself to follow up.
"I guess I err on the side of inclusion," he said, recalling how Time noted that on the night before one of his four daughters gave birth to her first son, "She wanted to watch a light movie, and so we watched, 'Ace Ventura, Pet Detective,' and so I wrote that down."
Mrs. Graham interjected with a gentle smile, "And you rewound it, too." She called the notebooks "an important tool," and noted that her husband's official portrait as governor shows him with one in hand.
Mr. Graham's longtime pollster, Geoff Garin, dismissed the notebooks as "inside baseball" and "very much of a piece" with Mr. Graham's longtime practice of "workdays" -- the nearly 400 days in which he has spent time working at various jobs around Florida, beginning with 18 weeks of teaching at an inner-city Miami school. He plans to continue the practice in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
Again and again in the interview, Mr. Graham spoke of his concern that the Bush administration's drive to oust Saddam Hussein would undercut its broader efforts against terrorism. He said he found the notion that "we're going to bring democracy to a region which is more than 10 times older than the United States of America and has such deeply ingrained religious and cultural traditions" to be "a very far-fetched rationale."
He said his own visits to the Middle East had convinced him that a more likely result of an American attack would be "to energize the most extreme fundamentalist elements, and you could end up with a series of Irans throughout the Middle East, rather than Vermonts."
Then he paused, apparently contemplating one of his rivals, former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, and the political calendar, and smiled: "Perhaps I should say, 'rather than New Hampshires.' "

CORRECTION-DATE: March 5, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about Senator Bob Graham of Florida and his bid for the Democratic nomination for president misstated his relationship, at age 3, to Katharine Graham, longtime publisher of The Washington Post. She had already become his half-sister-in-law, by marrying his half-brother, Philip; it was not a future connection.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
For Exxon Mobil, Size Is a Strength And a Weakness

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE

 BODY:
If bigger is better, Exxon Mobil should never inspire doubt. It is among the richest companies in the world, certainly the biggest oil company, with its estimated revenue of $204.5 billion in 2002 exceeding the gross domestic product of Turkey. 
 While Exxon Mobil's size is its great strength, according to most analysts, it is potentially its most obvious weakness, some dissenting voices say. With the mergers in the late 1990's having created behemoths like Exxon Mobil, BP, TotalFinaElf and others, some analysts and industry executives now wonder, how big is too big? 
 In a speech at the Cambridge Energy Research Associates conference in Houston in February, Exxon Mobil's chairman and chief executive, Lee R. Raymond, described the challenge the oil industry, and perhaps most acutely his company, faced: "When we consider, that as demand increases, our existing base production declines, we come squarely to the magnitude of the task before us. About half the oil and gas volume needed to meet demand 10 years from now is not in production today."
Exxon Mobil's production has remained essentially flat for the last four years. It faces the enormous task of replacing the 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalents, a unit of measurement that includes crude oil and natural gas, that it draws from its wells each year. That task is made more difficult by the locations of its fields.
Much of its production is concentrated in North America and the North Sea, which are largely in decline, while the company's new, rich finds are still being developed. The question over the next decade or so, which is relatively brief in oil industry terms, is whether those new areas will be enough to replace what will be lost. 
Exxon Mobil has the money and influence to vie for the world's biggest oil and gas reserves. But some industry executives and analysts warn that Exxon Mobil takes such a tough negotiating stance that it often alienates the countries across the table. That could become a problem because more than 90 percent of the world's proven oil reserves are owned by countries, national oil companies and the Russian oil companies, according to PFC Energy, a Washington consulting firm. 
"As competition in the oil industry gets tighter, the challenge is accessing the reserves in the new areas, and every issue counts," said Gerald J. Kepes, a managing director at PFC Energy. "If all else is equal, and Exxon Mobil comes across as arrogant or makes it hard for a government to respond, and it's a problem they can fix, they should."
Exxon Mobil, which is based in Irving, Tex., declined to comment on issues critics have raised until its analysts' presentation today in New York.
For years, Exxon Mobil has argued that it surpasses its competition by most measures, mainly by hewing to a tradition of generating profits by squeezing savings from its businesses rather than increasing production. Because of its success, its stock is seen by analysts as trading at a premium. Its return on capital employed has consistently led the industry, though some analysts say Royal Dutch/Shell, BP and TotalFinaElf may soon challenge that supremacy. Since Exxon's merger with Mobil in the late 1990's, the company has saved nearly $7 billion through numerous efficiencies, and that could reach $8 billion by the end of this year, Deutsche Bank estimated in a recent report. 
But the report points out that most remaining savings may now come from refining and chemicals businesses, where companies have historically struggled to hold onto cash because of stiff competition. "How will Exxon Mobil track performance going forward?" the report asks.
Charles Maxwell, a senior oil analyst with Weeden & Company, said, "The company faces a huge public relations problem coming, due to lack of growth." 
The company, Mr. Kepes said, has been gradually broadening its focus over the last few years from its financial goals to include production targets. With projects in about 200 countries and territories, many of its most significant recent investments are in regions where oil and gas production are expected to surge over the next decade, like the Persian Gulf, West Africa, the Caspian Sea and the Russian Far East.
The company plans to spend $100 billion on exploration and production through 2010 as it strives to increase production capacity by about 3 percent a year. Production capacity growth, however, is not the same as increasing output. "Capacity is rising," the Deutsche Bank report notes, "but actual production volumes are going nowhere." 
Whether it wants to expand production capacity or output, Exxon Mobil will need access to the world's best new oil reserves, and they are in countries that guard their resources jealously. Those countries offer far less favorable contract terms than the United States and European countries, which is a problem for all oil companies but perhaps most difficult for the largest companies like Exxon Mobil, which need huge reserves to replace the huge amounts they deplete every year.
Recently, BP took the gamble of investing $6.8 billion to create a new Russian oil company with local partners in an effort to pluck a piece of Russia's vast oil reserves. Analysts think it unlikely that Exxon Mobil will take such a risk. Instead, it negotiated for about a decade to lead the Sakhalin I offshore project in the Russian Far East. That methodical approach is Exxon Mobil's signature style: the company is highly centralized, and decisions about new investments are made at the very top, analysts said. 
Exxon Mobil, most analysts say, has the money and stature to drive a hard bargain with oil-rich countries. And certainly, its shareholders insist that it sign a deal only if the terms are highly favorable. But Exxon Mobil's drive to stake a claim in some oil-rich areas has hit a few snags that some industry executives and analysts ascribe to what they see as the company's inflexibility and high-handedness. Its projects in Angola were delayed in part because of friction with the government, analysts said, and it failed to win the operator's position at the huge Kashagan field in Kazakhstan for similar reasons. 
"It's not black or white, but that kind of position makes things difficult at times," Mr. Kepes said. "They're perceived as going in with the attitude of 'it's the Exxon way or the highway.' "

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ANKARA; 
Turkey Needs Week or More To Reconsider U.S. Request

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, March 3 

 BODY:
Turkish lawmakers said today that it could be at least a week and maybe closer to two before they reconsider a plan to allow thousands of United States troops into the country, a stance that may prompt American officials to look elsewhere for help. 
 Senior members of the ruling Justice and Development Party indicated here that they would probably wait until after local parliamentary elections this weekend to take up the measure, which the Turkish parliament narrowly defeated last Saturday. 
 The elections this Sunday are expected to propel Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the party's mercurial leader, to the prime minister's office. Turkish officials said Mr. Erdogan would probably need several days to form a government, and so would probably be unable to take up the American plan for at least two weeks. 
Such an approach might allow Turkey's leaders to see if the Security Council approves a resolution authorizing the use of force against Saddam Hussein. But it might prove too late to allow them to bring the country into America's war plans. 
In an appearance today before reporters, Prime Minister Abdullah Gul declined to say whether his government would give the American request another try.
"We will see what happens in the next few days," Mr. Gul said. He was set to leave the country for a summit meeting of Islamic countries for two days.
Turkish officials said opposition to the American plan within the Justice and Development Party, an Islamic-based political movement, was still too strong to try again. Another defeat, they said, could bring down Mr. Gul's government. "If they tried and failed again, it would be a disaster," said one Turkish official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Cuyned Zapsu, a senior party official, echoed those remarks today, saying Mr. Erdogan was unlikely to push the plan again without some new offer from the United States. 
"We have to have something which would justify the risk of bringing another motion to the Parliament," Mr. Zapsu said. "Tayyip Erdogan, a former Islamist, took this risk for the U.S., and he lost a lot of prestige. He cannot afford to take this risk again."
The statements today appeared to dampen hopes that the Turks might reverse ground and quickly approve the measure, which would have allowed as many as 62,000 American troops into the country for an attack on Iraq. Some members of the Turkish government, including the foreign minister, Yasar Yakis, had suggested that the government might try again.
Today Mr. Yakis suggested that the Americans should be ready for a long wait. "We don't want to raise their hopes first and then disappoint them," he said.
 About two dozen American military vessels continued to idle off the Turkish port of Iskenderen today, and American diplomats continued talking with Turkish officials.
Today, Kuwait's defense minister, Sheik Jaber al-Hamad al-Sabah, said it was willing to accept those American troops who had been bound for Turkey. 
The uproar over the American request has left the Justice and Development Party bitter and divided, torn between the demands of its most important ally and the Turkish people, who overwhelmingly oppose their country's involvement in a war. Since Saturday's vote, there has been speculation here that the party could even break up, with the 90-odd legislators who opposed the American request leading the way.
The rejection by the parliament over the weekend sent Turkey's financial markets reeling today. The main index of Turkey's stock market fell by 12 percent, and the Turkish lira fell by five percent against the dollar.
Investors appeared to be reacting to the loss of $6 billion in direct aid the United States had promised Turkey in exchange for its help in a war. Turkey's leaders had hoped to use the money to borrow billions more to service the country enormous foreign and domestic debt.
"We lost a lot of our money today," said Volkan Dincer, a private fund manger in Istanbul. "Investors are not happy with the government's decision. We were looking forward to the funds from the United States."
"The parliament didn't stop the war," he said. "But we're not going to get any help."
To shore up the financial markets, Mr. Gul unveiled his government's long awaited 2003 budget today. The document contained many of the elements, like a budget surplus and tax hikes, insisted upon by the International Monetary Fund. The fund has been overseeing many aspects of the Turkish economy.

HEADLINE: Canada Raises a Major Interest Rate a Quarter Point 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, March 4 

 BODY:
Putting fears of runaway inflation ahead of signs of a faltering economy, the Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate today for the fourth time in a year.
 The move, after a vigorous debate among private-sector economists, contrasts with monetary policy in other developed countries, where authorities have held off on interest rate increases and in some cases have even cut rates in an effort to stimulate economic growth. 
 But the central bank in Ottawa said it was stepping up its overnight lending rate by one-quarter point, to 3 percent, because price data showed inflation "well above" the bank's target of 2 percent a year. According to Statistics Canada, consumer prices rose 4.5 percent in the 12 months ended Jan. 31. Though energy prices accounted for much of the increase, the Bank of Canada said there was also "an underlying firmness in the price-setting environment." 
Peter Drake, deputy chief economist at the TD Bank Financial Group in Toronto, interpreted the rate increase chiefly as a move to damp inflationary expectations. "If you give people the impression that you're no longer fighting the battle to keep within your targets, you invite them to act accordingly, and it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy," Mr. Drake said.
TD Bank has forecast that the Bank of Canada will raise short-term rates another full percentage point, to 4 percent, in stages over the course of this year.
But some analysts questioned the need for the policy. Dale Orr, a managing director for the Global Insight economics consultancy in Toronto, said that "there wasn't a lot of evidence that they should be concerned." Mr. Orr attributed the pickup in inflation mainly to temporary factors like oil prices and to increases in prices that the government itself sets, not strong demand.
With unemployment above 7 percent, upward pressure on private-sector wages has been muted, Mr. Orr said. Global Insight expects inflation to retreat below 2 percent in 2004, he said.
Canada's economy was the strongest performer among the Group of Seven large industrial nations last year, with gross domestic product expanding 3.3 percent, adjusted for inflation, compared with 2.4 percent in the United States.
But "all the latest data shows that the economy slowed at the end of last year," said Patricia A. Croft, chief economist at Sceptre Investment Counsel in Toronto. Statistics Canada reported last week that in the fourth quarter of 2002, the economy grew 1.6 percent at an annual rate and that the rate was falling in November and December. Motor vehicle sales were 7.8 percent lower in January and February than a year earlier.
The Bank of Canada acknowledged today that business activity had softened, but it said that the economy was still running near its full capacity. "In these circumstances, the persistence of above-target rates of inflation has elevated the risk of an increase in inflation expectations," the bank said.
It also expressed confidence that growth would pick up again in the second half of this year "as global uncertainties diminish." Mr. Drake said he expected the economy to grow 2.6 percent for 2003 as a whole, but at an annual rate of close to 4 percent in the second half of the year.
The Canadian dollar has strengthened markedly since interest rates started going up last April. One Canadian dollar was worth 67.70 United States cents in early-afternoon trading today, up a third of a cent.

HEADLINE: Sales Slow as Germans Pile Up Empties 

BYLINE:  By OTTO POHL 

DATELINE: BERLIN, March 4 

 BODY:
A new deposit law on cans and bottles has sharply reduced beverage sales, causing at least a temporary hardship in a $15 billion industry at a time when the German economy may be on the brink of a recession.
 "It's chaos," said Christian Berner, chairman of Lekkerland-Tobaccoland, a wholesaler that handles about half the 1.5 billion canned drinks sold in Germany each year. Mr. Berner said his company's sales had fallen 30 percent since the law took effect on Jan. 1. 
 Makers of cans and bottles are reporting 20 percent to 60 percent drops in sales. 
Since Jan. 1, customers have had to pay a deposit on all carbonated soft drinks as well as beer sold in cans or plastic bottles. The deposit ranges from 0.25 euro to 0.50 euro a container (27 to 54 cents),depending on its size, much higher than the 5-cent deposit in many American states. 
The new law is meant to stem the growing popularity of disposable containers at the expense of refillable glass bottles, which have been covered by a deposit law for years. And it appears to be slowly working. Some of the lost demand for canned drinks has already shifted to refillables, and industry analysts expect overall sales to return to previous levels eventually. 
But for now, the spirit of Oktoberfest is in hibernation. 
"We're missing 20 percent of the beer drinkers," said Udo Franken, a spokesman for Holsten-Brauerei, Germany's largest beer maker with about 8 percent of the market. Holsten has scaled back production and reduced working hours for almost a quarter of its 2,640 employees.
For Germany, where recycling is practically a national religion, government regulation is plentiful and planning is prized, the tumult has come as something of a shock.
Supporters of the law say that the beverage industry had more than enough time to prepare but chose to spend the time fighting a losing battle against the law. Many companies put off making the required investments, hoping that a favorable ruling in a series of legal challenges or a victory by Edmund Stoiber and his industry-friendly Christian Democrats in national elections in November would make them unnecessary. 
As a result, when Jan. 1 arrived, there was no nationwide return system in place for the disposable containers, as there is for refillable packaging. Consumers were faced with having to return used containers to the store where they were purchased and show a sales receipt to prove it, or forfeit the deposit.
It will be autumn at the earliest before a nationwide return system will be in place, industry executives say. In the meantime, beverage retailers like Getranke Hoffmann are struggling to cope with piles of returned containers. "This is going to smell pretty bad come summer," said Axel Zahsack, an employee at a Berlin branch of the beverage retailer, as he moved sacks of used bottles and cans that had piled up in the back of the store.
Schmalbach-Lubeca, the largest maker of drink cans in Germany, may be the company hardest hit by the law. Recently acquired by the Ball Corporation, the American packaging conglomerate, Schmalbach-Lubeca depends on the German market for a third of its annual sales of 1 billion euros, and those sales are down 60 percent since the law took effect. The company has begun rotating plant closings and furloughing employees without pay; even so, it expects to lose 50 million euros in the first quarter.
Retailers, who are in the front lines dealing with the new law's consequences, are watching competitors to make sure they are complying. Rivals have already filed suit against Wal-Mart Germany, accusing it of refunding deposits to customers without requiring them to actually return the containers. In a statement, Wal-Mart denied the charge.
The growing volume of returned containers represents a new business opportunity, but who will be able to seize it is still unclear. In the fall of 2002, investors bid up shares of Tomra Systems, the Norwegian company that dominates the worldwide market for "reverse vending machines," devices that let consumers return containers; Germany is thought to need some 30,000 of the machines.
But Tomra's stock fell 40 percent on the day in late January when the German beverage industry selected an untested new technical standard for handling the returns. Tomra must now compete with companies like Trautwein Sb-Technik, MRV and Prokent to develop machines that can accommodate the new standard. 
Some retailers, including the huge discount supermarket chain Aldi, initially reacted to the law by simply refusing to sell carbonated drinks in cans or plastic bottles. Now Aldi is slowly reintroducing the products with a small Aldi recycling logo on the label that allows customers to return them to any Aldi store without needing to show a receipt. Other chains are following suit.
The new deposit law grows out of a 1991 recycling law that set a ceiling on the percentage of deposit-free containers on the market. In recent years, growing price competition and aggressive marketing drove the market share of these containers up to almost twice the allowed limit. 
Many industry executives expect consumers to resume their past consumption habits once a nationwide return system is operating and deposit containers can be cashed in conveniently anywhere.
"We just can't believe that Germans are drinking less beer just because they have to bring the can back," said Mr. Frankel of Holsten-Brauerei. "At some point, their thirst will be greater than their irritation."

HEADLINE: Glaxo Loses Ruling in Patent Trial for Depression Drug 

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
GlaxoSmithKline said yesterday that it had lost a critical patent trial over its top-selling drug, significantly raising the risk that it would face generic competition for the medicine earlier than the company expected. 
 The case, which began last month in federal court in Chicago, concerns an essential patent covering Paxil, a popular treatment for depression. The court ruled that GlaxoSmithKline's patent is still valid, but that Apotex, a Canadian maker of generic drugs, does not infringe on it. 
 With sales of $3.2 billion, Paxil accounted for roughly a tenth of GlaxoSmithKline's total revenue in 2002. 
"This victory is a strong confirmation of what we have been arguing since 1998: our generic version of Paxil does not infringe any valid patents and therefore should be available to consumers today," Dr. Barry Sherman, the chief executive of Apotex, said in a statement. 
But GlaxoSmithKline, which introduced Paxil in 1993, still has the exclusive right to manufacture Paxil for now. The company says its patents extend its exclusive rights to 2006, and it plans to appeal the Chicago decision. In addition, the company will face Apotex in federal court again, in Philadelphia, over other Paxil patents.
"They lost this battle, but the war's not over," said Rita Freedman, an analyst with PNC Advisors, which owns the stock. 
GlaxoSmithKline's shares, which trade as American depository receipts in the United States, fell $1.12, to $34.15. 
Apotex wants to produce a version of Paxil, known by the chemical name paroxetine hydrochloride, in a form that it says does not infringe on any of GlaxoSmithKline's patents. The company said yesterday that it planned to introduce a generic version of Paxil no later than 2005.
In his ruling, which involved only one of GlaxoSmithKline's United States patents, Judge Richard A. Posner acknowledged that Apotex's version of the drug is likely to contain small amounts of the patented form of the medicine. The presence of the patented form appears to be a byproduct of developing the medicine, he said. But he described the amounts as "merely an impurity," which provide Apotex with no economic advantage. 
Judge Posner wrote that even if there is an infringement in the case, GlaxoSmithKline suffers no damages and Apotex should not be stopped from introducing its generic version of Paxil. 
"The grant of an injunction in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence in this case would be a travesty of equity," he said.
In its appeals of the ruling, GlaxoSmithKline plans to argue that the Apotex version of Paxil contains enough of GlaxoSmithKline's form to infringe on its patent. "We think it's important that the judge found the patent valid," a GlaxoSmithKline spokeswoman, Mary Anne Rhyne, said. 
The courts hearing appeals in this case will probably focus on the issue of whether the inadvertent creation of patented product constitutes patent infringement, given the language in existing laws. The judge "has taken it to the next step," said Brian D. Coggio, a patent lawyer with Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe. 
Although Judge Posner acknowledged the money and effort that goes into developing a drug, he dismissed GlaxoSmithKline's claim that Apotex is being too quick to come to market. "SmithKline deplores Apotex's eagerness to be first but of course that eagerness is the mirror of SmithKline's zeal to obtain the much more extensive protection conferred by a patent that excludes the competition of a bioequivalent drug as infringing," he wrote.
The earliest Apotex could introduce its generic Paxil would be this September. But it is unclear whether the company will begin selling its drug then or wait until the legal disputes are over. 
"The key is what is Apotex going to do," said Hemant K. Shah, an industry analyst based in Warren, N.J. Apotex is generally more aggressive than many generic drug makers, and thus more likely to take such a step, he said.
No date has been set for the next Paxil trial, in federal court in Philadelphia. But if Apotex wins there, it could decide to go ahead, despite GlaxoSmithKline's ability to appeal. "The decision has not been made yet," an Apotex spokesman, Bob Billings, said.
Robert F. Green, a Chicago patent lawyer at Leydig Voit & Mayer, said generic manufacturers should be heartened by the ruling because it takes a common sense approach to important patent issues. "It's refreshing to see a judge take a practical approach to law," he said.

HEADLINE: More Cuts Than New Taxes In Rowland's Budget Plan 

BYLINE:  By PAUL von ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 4 

 BODY:
In his annual address to lawmakers, Gov. John G. Rowland today laid out a $27.7 billion budget proposal for the next two years and urged the Democratic-led Legislature to adopt far more spending cuts than tax increases to close a roughly $900 million hole in Connecticut's 2004 fiscal year.
 The governor's 20-minute address, punctuated by reminders that tough choices and "difficult sacrifices" could not be avoided, came five days after lawmakers passed a bill closing a $650 million budget deficit in the current fiscal year and cutting more than half of what had been a $2 billion gap for fiscal 2004. 
 The new fiscal year begins July 1. Connecticut operates on a two-year budget cycle, though lawmakers typically tinker with the budget every year to rebalance it with adjusted revenue forecasts. The governor asked legislators today to switch to the annual cycle that most other states use. 
To fill a $900 million deficit in his proposed $13.5 billion budget for fiscal 2004, Mr. Rowland proposed reaping hundreds of millions of dollars through a combination of higher taxes and cuts to state programs. He also called for consolidating clerical staffs on several state commissions and combining several state agencies to eliminate redundancies in state government.
"We must ask if the size of our government helps or hurts our economy," Mr. Rowland said in his speech at the Capitol. He added, "A responsive government leads the forces of change; it does not protect the status quo."
The governor's plan would reduce current spending by about $1.2 billion in fiscal 2004, which begins July 1, and by $1.6 billion in fiscal 2005. It also includes about $301 million in new taxes over the two years, and a freeze on state borrowing for most projects, said Marc S. Ryan, Mr. Rowland's budget chief.
Connecticut's 169 cities and towns would get about $50 million less in direct aid from the state over the next two years. Mr. Rowland also wants to shave 3 percent off the amount that every municipal government receives in aid for public schools. The governor's budget would eliminate a tax break for property owners who pay at least $500 a year, raising about $12 million.
But today's proposal reflects Mr. Rowland's clear preference for cutting spending first and raising taxes only as a last resort. It includes no income tax increases and cuts aid to some of the state's poorest and most vulnerable residents.
"I do not accept the notion that local governments cannot trim their sails the same way we have at the state level," Mr. Rowland said.
Such talk unsettled many Democratic lawmakers and many municipal officials from both parties.
"You have some pretty massive shifts from the state to the municipalities," said Senator Thomas P. Gaffey, a Democrat from Meriden. "That will only mean increased property taxes."
Many Democrats seemed particularly annoyed that Mr. Rowland, after backtracking last week on his support for a tax on residents earning at least $1 million, seemed intent on protecting the state's wealthiest residents from sharing more of the tax burden. Donald E. Williams Jr., the Democratic caucus leader in the State Senate, said his party would insist that any 2004-05 budget package include many more tax increases than Mr. Rowland outlined.
"I think ideally we're going to want to see some more progressive taxation in the state of Connecticut," he said.
The state agencies that Mr. Rowland proposed eliminating included the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, the Office of the Victim Advocate and the Council on Environmental Quality. Three state commissions -- Ethics, Elections Enforcement and Freedom of Information -- would be consolidated. The Agriculture Department would be moved into the Department of Consumer Protection, and the state housing division would be merged into the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority. Beyond those changes, almost every state program would see cuts in funding or workers, Mr. Ryan said.

HEADLINE: Experts Conclude Oil Drilling Has Hurt Alaska's North Slope 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Even though oil companies have greatly improved practices in the Arctic, three decades of drilling along Alaska's North Slope have produced a steady accumulation of harmful environmental and social effects that will probably grow as exploration expands, a panel of experts has concluded.
 Some of the problems could last for centuries, the experts said in a report yesterday, both because environmental damage does not heal easily in the area's harsh climate and because it is uneconomical to remove structures or restore damaged areas once drilling is over. 
 The report, produced by the National Research Council, was immediately hailed by opponents of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which lies east of established oil fields and is the only part of America's only stretch of Arctic coastline that for now is off limits to drilling. Advocates of drilling called it biased. Administration officials said improved techniques would lessen the environmental impact of future drilling. 
The council, the research arm of the National Academies, an independent advisory body on science, produced the report at the request of Republican lawmakers supporting oil drilling in the Arctic refuge. (The report can be found on the Web at nas.edu.)
President Bush and many Republicans in Congress and Alaska lawmakers from both parties are pushing this year for legislation that would open the coastal plain of the refuge to development. 
The panel made no judgment on whether the environmental costs of Arctic oil development outweighed the economic benefits of wells that have, on average, supplied about 20 percent of America's domestic production since 1977 and provided cash to poor native communities.
The North Slope is a windswept, Minnesota-size region -- bereft of trees but brimming with wildlife -- that runs from the peaks of the Brooks Range north to the Arctic Ocean. In 1968, huge oil reserves were discovered in Prudhoe Bay, about dead center on the coastline, and a web of pipelines, roads, power lines, and faint trails left by ground-thumping seismic survey teams has spread outward ever since.
The report said some of the environmental problems result from lack of money to restore damaged ecosystems, from ill-defined layers of local and federal regulations and from the fact that the area is home to rare wildlife.
The committee judged it unlikely that most disturbed habitat on the North Slope would ever be restored. "Natural recovery in the Arctic is very slow, because of the cold; so the effects of abandoned structures and unrestored landscapes could persist for centuries and accumulate," the report said.
A particular problem was the lack of specific state or federal rules requiring cleanups of degraded areas, said the chairman of the expert panel, Dr. Gordon H. Orians, a professor emeritus of zoology at the University of Washington in Seattle.
"There's no vision and planning for where things ought to go," Dr. Orians said yesterday in a telephone news conference. "Unless this is improved substantially," he said, "undesirable effects in the future are likely to be greater."
The report's authors and officials from the research council defended the analysis, noting that the panel included several experts who worked for oil companies along with scientists from academia, one environmental group (the Natural Resources Defense Council), and Alaskan organizations. The panel endorsed the report unanimously, Dr. Orians said.
Critics of drilling, particularly in the refuge, welcomed the report. "It projects a chilling picture of a diminished landscape if the Bush administration's plans are realized," said Jamie Rappaport Clark, senior vice president for conservation programs at the National Wildlife Federation, a private conservation group. 
Industry officials and some lawmakers supporting drilling focused on the report's sections describing the economic benefits of oil extraction cited by native communities and the environmental benefits of advanced oil-exploration techniques.
The panel noted that the oil industry has made great strides in cutting its "footprint" on the fragile Arctic landscape and preventing oil spills.
But it concluded that the impacts were far-reaching nonetheless: from specific harms like a drop in reproduction in some nesting birds and a rise in diabetes in native communities to an erosion of the spiritual and aesthetic values of the barren yet majestic region.
It also said the sharp warming of the climate in the Arctic in recent decades could disrupt some techniques with which companies have avoided some harm to the landscape, including the building of temporary ice roads in winter instead of permanent gravel tracks.
The lack of specific federal or state rules dealing with abandoned facilities on the tundra has resulted in restoration of fewer than 1 percent of the dormant drilling pads, roads, or other abandoned, gravel-covered areas in the region, the experts said.
"Roads, pads, pipelines, seismic-vehicle tracks, and transmission lines; air, ground, and vessel traffic; drilling activities; landfills, housing, processing facilities, and other industrial infrastructure have reduced opportunities for solitude and have compromised wild-land and scenic values over large areas," it said. "The structures and activities also violate the spirit of the land, a value that is reported by some Alaska Natives to be central to their culture."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES; 
Exxon Chief Says Oil Industry Is Already Jarred by Fears of War

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
The oil industry is already feeling powerful repercussions from the current economic and political volatility spawned by fears of war in the Persian Gulf, according to Lee Raymond, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, the world's largest oil company.
 In a rare and broad-ranging meeting yesterday in New York with securities analysts and journalists, Mr. Raymond pointed out, for example, that oil prices near $40 a barrel create a number of problems for oil companies. 
 "Frankly, we're not comfortable with oil prices in the high 30's," he said. "They can have long-range impacts that are not all that attractive."
When prices rise so high, they usually fall quite far and quite rapidly, and such volatility "over a long period of time puts a damper on investment" in the industry, Mr. Raymond said.
"It's easy to live with the peaks, but the fear is what the valleys will bring," he said. When investment in new fields and projects declines, less oil gets produced and prices generally remain higher.
Mr. Raymond said he also worried that high prices would lead to a backlash against the oil industry. 
"We seem to have an investigation every time prices are high," he said. "Why is there never an investigation when prices go down?"
With the strike in Venezuela continuing and the looming possibility of war with Iraq, Mr. Raymond declined to predict how long oil prices would stay high.
Analysts estimate that Iraq currently exports a little less than 2 million barrels a day, legally and otherwise, and there is a very strong chance those exports would halt if the United States attacked.
"If the Iraqi oil disappears, you get into the question of whether it is transitory or whether capacity has been lost," Mr. Raymond said. "It's clear if there is a war, they will stop exporting. But what the markets will ask is, how long the war will be? Or will Saddam Hussein have torched his oil fields?"
Mr. Raymond said he thought the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would try to make up for any shortfall of Iraqi oil, although they were already pumping at near full capacity. But he also predicted that if supplies dwindled and an oil shortage became a real possibility, the Bush administration might step in.
"I think under those circumstances the United States government would start releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve," Mr. Raymond said, referring to an emergency stockpile of crude oil the country keeps to cushion disruptions of oil supplies.
Mr. Raymond said that the energy crisis of 1973 had taught the government and the oil companies how to cope with supply crises. He urged the government not to cap prices, as it did in the 1970's, or domestic supplies might dwindle and rationing might have to begin.
"You have to focus on whatever you need to do to keep the continuity of supply," he said. "It's very important not to have gasoline lines at service stations."

HEADLINE: A Prescription Plan Lauded as a Model Is a Budget Casualty 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., March 3 

 BODY:
In a state that says it is already so short of public money it does not have enough to keep all the schools open and prosecute many criminals, Oregon took another drastic step this week to cover budget shortfalls: it cut off medications to thousands of schizophrenics, manic-depressives, drug addicts and others who are poor and have no health care. 
 A decade ago, Oregon was widely hailed as a pioneer in providing health insurance, including prescription drug coverage, not only to the poor but also to people who make just enough money that they do not qualify for most federal Medicaid programs. 
 Now, in a reversal that has stripped a once ambitious program to its core, Oregon has pared back the insurance, and removed prescription drug coverage for things like mental illness and drug addiction. Most of the cuts went into effect March 1, but others started Feb. 1, just days after Oregonians voted in a referendum against a tax increase to balance their budget.
And while state officials are looking for some way to restore some of the health program, they admit that they will not be able to offer anything like the expansive benefits of the past. 
So throughout Oregon this week, about 100,000 poor people are suddenly scrambling for the basic medications that allow them to function.
For Dave Cesario, 45, who is H.I.V. positive, diabetic and on methadone to stave off addiction to heroin, it meant going cold turkey Saturday. 
"I'm just numb; I don't know what to do," said Mr. Cesario, who lives with his disabled wife and 12-year-old son. "My only hope is that the drug companies will have mercy and I'll be able to get some free samples."
For Karen Hansen, 50, who has prescriptions for everything from anxiety disorder to high blood pressure, the cutoff means taking only the few drugs that will keep her alive. She lives on $689 a month in Social Security disability payments, and her monthly prescription bill, without assistance, is $615.
"I don't buy the newspaper, I eat hot dogs that they give out free and get other meals from the food bank," Ms. Hansen said. "But that only saves about $200."
The step is the latest response to a budget crisis that led state officials to make nearly $600 million in cuts in the last two years, and will require another $2 billion in reductions, according to projections, in the new budget cycle that begins this June.
Hit by a harsh recession after a series of tax-cutting measures pared the budget to the bone, Oregon, which has no statewide sales tax, now lacks enough money for health care, schools, prisons and criminal prosecution. 
Portland schools had planned to cut nearly five weeks off the school calendar this year. But teachers agreed on Monday to work two weeks without pay, and that offer -- together with a plan for a temporary business tax -- looks as if it will now save the school year. But the state has announced plans to close a number of schools. 
Prisons have let out some criminals early. And starting today, prosecutions of people arrested for theft and drug crimes are being delayed because there is not enough money for prosecution or legal defense. Officials say those arrested are being released and may be tried later, in the summer, if the legislature can come up with new funds. 
The latest round of cuts came after Oregonians considered a referendum in January on whether to raise taxes temporarily. The measure was narrowly defeated, after opponents of the tax increase said the state could find ways to cut without major consequences.
Unable to raise taxes, and having cut financing for police, prosecutors and schools, state officials turned to the Oregon Health Plan. They ordered the board that governs the plan to decide how and where to cut. It chose to revert to more basic coverage, stop paying for many prescription drugs and charge higher premiums and co-payments.
Dr. Patricia Kullberg, medical director of the health department of Multnomah County, which covers Portland, said she just did something she had never done in 21 years as a family physician: she advised a patient which medications he could stop taking and suffer the least. The patient lost his prescription drug benefit for arthritis, depression, high cholesterol and hypertension. 
"I feel like I'm living in some foreign country where suffering is routine," she said. "It's scary. What we're doing is condemning people to the long-term consequences of their diseases."
The hardest hit, say state officials, are the mentally ill. Jim Underwood, a mental health specialist with Cascadia Behavioral Healthcare in Portland, said his patient Robert Seaman, 47, a paranoid schizophrenic, was likely to become delusional again without his medications.
Mr. Seaman had trouble responding to questions in an interview. "Without his meds, he has trouble with getting food, shopping, all the basic survival things," Mr. Underwood said.
The legislature is working this week on a temporary patch. The proposal would take video poker and cigarette tax money and drain a reserve fund to make up an immediate shortfall of $250 million. If this passes, and it appears it will, it would restore medications for only about two months.
Mary Ellen Glynn, a spokeswoman for Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a Democrat, said the next two-year budget could be even worse, because voters refuse to raise taxes. "We're in real double-bind," she said.
Advocates for the mentally ill put the issue more starkly. 
David Eisen, clinical director for Central City Concern, a private nonprofit agency that provides care for drug addicts and the mentally ill, said people whose basic medical needs were met by prescription drugs costing the state about $90 a month per person, were now going to start showing up in hospital emergency rooms, or jail, where they will cost the state far more.
"The people who made this decision thought they could save a few million dollars," Mr. Eisen said. "But the crime rate will rise, emergency rooms will be flooded with people, and in the end, the state is going to pay five to eight times more than they would have saved."
In most states, the federal Medicaid program covers the basic medical needs of the poor. Oregon was given a waiver to shape its own program because it promised to provide near-universal coverage for the poor, something only a handful of states have tried to do. In good times, the plan worked, and it was widely praised as a resourceful use of limited public funds for health care. 
One measure of its success was that Oregon has one of the lowest percentages of mentally ill people in institutions. Prescriptions and mental health clinics have allowed people to work, or live in community settings, without presenting a danger to themselves or others, state health officials say. 
Critics of the plan, however, said it was allowed to grow too fast, and even though Oregon rationed out services -- drawing up a list of what would be covered and what would not -- it still proved too generous. State Representative Jackie Winters, a Republican, said that over the last 20 years, social services in the state have quadrupled, far in excess of population growth.
"We expanded beyond the basics, and now we realize you can't cover everything you want," Ms. Winters said. 
Now a number of legislative committees are studying ways to redo the Oregon Health Plan. Even if state revenues become less anemic, the plan is unlikely ever to be as ambitious or far-reaching as it was, supporters and opponents say.
And for now, the cutbacks mean that most people who were given coverage have lost their prescription drugs. Some are now wandering the streets or screaming in public squares.
About one-fourth of the 400,000 people covered by the Oregon Health Plan lost prescription coverage in two rounds of cuts over the last month and half. 
Tony Tescara, 66, who lives on $630 in Social Security, relies on heart medication from the state. When he heard we was cut off -- after his pharmacists refused to fill a prescription -- he says he panicked. 
"It was a big shock," Mr. Tescara said. "I took extra nitro pills, just worrying about this medical thing. I called my caseworker and said, 'What am I supposed to do now?' She said call the doctor and ask for samples."
Mr. Tescara said he was ashamed to beg for medicine. "I feel like I'm a lowlife looking for handouts," he said. "I'm not. It's the first time in my life I have to ask for help." 
State officials say relying on free samples, which thousands of Oregonians are doing this week to get their medications, will help only the luckiest.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 6, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday described the effects of a decision by Oregon officials to help cover budget shortfalls by paring back prescription drug coverage and other benefits provided under a health care program for the poor. It said about 100,000 people lost drug coverage.
The article, written on Monday, said the state was looking for a way to restore some of the health program. But it took no account of legislation restoring some benefits, which was passed on Tuesday by the Oregon House and signed into law by Gov. Ted Kulongoski. 
An article appears today, on Page A25.

HEADLINE: What Would Genghis Do? 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It's easy to picture Rummy in a big metal breastplate, a skirt and lace-up gladiator sandals.
 Rummius Maximus Pompeius. 
 During the innocent summer before 9/11, the defense secretary's office sponsored a study of ancient empires -- Macedonia, Rome, the Mongols -- to figure out how they maintained dominance.
What tips could Rummy glean from Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar and Genghis Khan? 
Mr. Rumsfeld would be impressed, after all, if he knew that Genghis Khan had invented the first crude MIRV (a missile that spews out multiple warheads to their predetermined targets). As David Morgan writes in "The Mongols," when the bloodthirsty chieftain began his subjugation of the Chinese empire in 1211, he had to figure out a way to take China's walled cities:
"Genghis Khan offered to raise the siege if he were given 1,000 cats and 10,000 swallows. These were duly handed over. Material was tied to their tails, and this was set on fire. The animals were released and fled home, setting the city ablaze, and in the ensuing confusion the city was stormed."
In her new book "The Mission," about America's growing dependence on the military to manage world affairs, Dana Priest says that the Pentagon commissioned the study at a time when Rummy did not yet have designs on the world.
To the dismay of his four-star generals, the new secretary was talking about pulling American soldiers out of Saudi Arabia, the Sinai Desert, Kosovo and Bosnia. He thought using our military to fight the South American drug trade was "nonsense."
He hated to travel and scorned "international hand-holding," Ms. Priest writes, adding that the defense chief was thinking that "maybe the United States didn't need all these entanglements to remain on top." He canceled multinational exercises, and even banned the word "engagement." His only interest in colonization was in putting weapons in space.
Then 9/11 changed everything. At the Pentagon, Paul Wolfowitz talked about "ending states who sponsor terrorism." He and Richard Perle said our best bet for stomping out Islamic terrorism was to take over Iraq, rewrite those anti-American textbooks and spur a democratic domino effect.
Now, with the rest of the world outraged at the administration's barbed and swaggering style, the Bushies have grown tetchy about the word "empire." They insist they are not interested in hegemony, even as the Pentagon proconsuls prepare to rule in Iraq, the ancient Mesopotamian empire.
Bernard Lewis of Princeton, Newt Gingrich and others worked on the August 2001 report on empires, which noted: "Without strong political and economic institutions, the Mongols and the Macedonians could not maintain extensive empires. What made the Roman Empire great was not just its military power but its 'franchise of empire.' What made the Chinese Empire great was not just its military power but the immense power and might of its culture.
"If we can take any lesson from history it is this: For the United States to sustain predominance it must remain militarily dominant, but it must also maintain its pre-eminence across the other pillars of power."
Some demur. A classical scholar, Bernard Knox, said, "Empires are pretty well dead; their day is gone."
Niall Ferguson, a professor at Oxford and New York University who wrote the coming book "Empire," said that while "it was rather sweet" that the Pentagon was studying ancient empires, he thought the lessons were no longer relevant.
"The technological and economic differences between modernity and premodernity are colossal," he said.
Besides, he says Americans aren't temperamentally suited to empire-building. "The British didn't mind living for years in Iraq or India for 100-plus years," he said. "Americans aren't attracted to the idea of taking up residence in hot, poor places."
He's right. America doesn't like to occupy. We like to buy our territory, like the bargain Louisiana Purchase and the overpriced amount we were going to pay Turkey (the old Ottoman Empire) to use its bases, before its Parliament balked. At the outside, we prefer to time-share.
As the brazen Bush imperialists try to install a new democracy in Iraq, they are finding the old democracy of our reluctant allies inconvenient.

HEADLINE: Hydrogen Vans And Pumps Head For Washington 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4 

 BODY:
Drivers of some General Motors minivans will soon be pulling into a Shell station here to fill up on hydrogen, the two companies announced today. They said it would be the first hydrogen pump at an American service station and that hydrogen cars could be in showrooms by the end of the decade.
 But skeptics wonder if these supposed cars of the future will be powered mainly by an old-fashioned indigenous source of energy: politics. Critics say these experimental cars will be cruising Washington mainly to impress Congress so that the auto industry gets more subsidies and feels less pressure to improve the fuel efficiency of current cars. 
 Hydrogen-powered cars became Washington's hot wheels during the State of the Union speech in January, when President Bush proposed more research and predicted that the cars could be commercially practical by 2020.
The cars, which emit only water vapor from their tailpipes, could help reduce pollution and oil consumption, but some experts wonder if they will ever be affordable.
The six experimental minivans that are scheduled to arrive in Washington in May have cost more than $1 million apiece, said Larry Burns, G.M.'s vice president for research and development and planning. Each minivan, an Opel Zafira converted to house a stack of fuel cells that generate electricity through a chemical reaction that uses hydrogen, has enough power to accelerate crisply and reach 100 miles per hour, he said.
"We think we can build a compelling and affordable car by 2010," he said. "It's a big challenge, but as a technologist, you have to be optimistic. Four years ago, I never dreamed we'd have made as much progress as we have by now. So far, we haven't seen anything that says it can't be done."
The experimental cars will not end up in any home garages, at least not soon. They will be lent for test drives, and the managers of the program expect many of the test drives to start from Capitol Hill. "There's a real important reason for our policy makers to have exposure to this technology," Dr. Burns said. 
Experimental fleets of hydrogen cars built by Toyota and Honda have been operating in California since last year, and G.M. expects to put hydrogen-powered Federal Express trucks on the streets of Tokyo next week. The chief innovation in Washington is the cooperation between a car maker and an oil company. One obstacle to the spread of hydrogen cars is the chicken-and-egg problem of building cars for which there are no refueling stations.
"Shell's work with G.M. will show that filling up the car with hydrogen is as simple and safe as filling up with gasoline," said Donald Huberts, the chief executive of Shell Hydrogen. He said that a local Shell station would be reconfigured by October to dispense hydrogen during the rest of the experiment, which is to last until 2005.
The hydrogen dispensers are supposed to have the look and feel of regular gasoline pumps. Drivers will use hoses with specially fitted valves to fill their tanks. Some of the cars will use extremely cold liquid hydrogen; others will use hydrogen in a compressed, gaseous form.
The two companies are paying for this project themselves, but their executives said they hoped that the federal government would help pay for similar research in the future and perhaps buy fleets of cars. The Bush administration has announced plans to spend $1.7 billion over five years on two projects: the FreedomCar, to explore making the technology work in hydrogen cars, and FreedomFuel, which will study how to produce, store and deliver hydrogen.
Although environmentalists like the prospect of clean hydrogen cars, some of them criticized Mr. Bush for focusing on a car of the future instead of the ones on the road today. They said he was using the hydrogen car as a way to protect the auto industry from tougher standards for fuel economy and emissions today.
"The so-called FreedomCar initiative is really about freedom for the president not to support energy independence today," said Nathanael Greene, a policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
Daniel F. Becker, the director of the Sierra Club's global warming and energy program, said the FreedomCar was reminiscent of a Clinton administration program that spent more than $1 billion on a new generation of fuel-efficient cars but failed to produce any for sale. "It is a sham program," he said, "merely designed to create the impression that Detroit and the Bush administration are moving toward clean cars when they have no such intention."
The G.M. hydrogen cars coming to Washington were dismissed as "P.R. cars" by Jerry Taylor, the director of natural resource studies at the Cato Institute. He said he was skeptical that bringing them to Washington would yield any public benefit, because politicians here have never shown much of a knack for spotting the next great source of energy.
"The federal government's record in picking winners in the energy industry is so bad that random investments would have almost certainly yielded higher returns," Mr. Taylor said. "Nuclear power, synthetic fuels, solar and wind power, clean coal -- all have been sinkholes for tax dollars but bonanzas for well-connected industries."

HEADLINE: Albany's Divided Leaders Are United in Pessimism 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 4 

 BODY:
Disagreements between the governor and legislative leaders over revenue forecasts have traditionally hindered budget negotiations in New York, slowing down talks for months while every side waited to see if the tax revenue picture would improve.
 But like everything else about the budget, that historic pattern is not holding true this year, as leaders here struggle with an $11.5 billion deficit and a stagnant economy. 
 For once, the Assembly and Senate put out revenue forecasts today that are relatively close to the governor's projections. Indeed, Gov. George E. Pataki and the leaders of the Assembly and Senate, who seldom agree on anything, all agree that the state's economy is not going to improve much over the next year. Neither will tax revenues. 
"Our forecast, I do not believe, holds up anything in the budget," said Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly speaker, as he unveiled his projections. "If anything, it brings us closer."
John McArdle, a spokesman for Senator Joseph L. Bruno, Republican Senate majority leader, said the relatively minor differences in revenue estimates boded well for budget talks, though he added that the Republicans and Democrats were still far apart on several issues. 
Governor Pataki, a Republican, has predicted that the state faces a $2.2 billion shortfall in revenues for the fiscal year that ends on March 31, and $9.3 billion next year.
The Senate put out the most pessimistic projections today, saying the revenues for the next 13 months will be $295 million less than the governor had predicted, pushing the shortfall closer to $11.8 billion.
The Assembly, meanwhile, is forecasting that tax revenues will come in about $189 million below the governor's expectations this fiscal year but will rebound slightly in the next, bringing in about $336 million more than Mr. Pataki has predicted. 
Aides for the governor and legislative leaders say budget talks have progressed further this year than in previous years, and some are even holding out hope that a deal can be sealed in early April.
The major sticking points now revolve around how to borrow more than $4 billion to help stave off extreme cuts to services, and whether to restore about $1.2 billion in education cuts the governor has proposed.
The governor wants to leverage about $4 billion from a giant court settlement with tobacco companies to back bonds.
But Mr. Silver has instead proposed floating general obligation bonds, backed by state tax revenue, arguing that they will be cheaper in the long run. Mr. Bruno supports the governor's borrowing plan, though today he said he was not ruling out Mr. Silver's idea.
Mr. Silver has also vowed to restore proposed cuts to the education budget. He has not said how he will pay for those restorations, but he has not ruled out an income tax increase for the wealthy. 
Senator Bruno, meanwhile, has also said he wants to restore some of the proposed cuts to the schools, though he has not said how much.

HEADLINE: Here, Poverty And Privilege Are Neighbors; 
Income Gaps Are a Source Of Resentment and Guilt

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
The intricate geography of income difference in New York City is something Chastity Davis absorbed early, growing up in the 1980's in a tenement apartment in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, on a block of mostly brick row houses flanked by public housing projects at either end.
 At the neighborhood elementary school, Ms. Davis's friends were from the projects. But her mother bused her to Bay Ridge for junior high, hoping she might run with a better crowd. As for the children of the homeowners on the block, they did not go to public school at all. 
 "I knew they were there, but I never felt I had any reason to want to play with them," Ms. Davis, 28, recalled recently. "Even as a young child, there's a sense that you sort of stay with the people that you're most comfortable with -- people in the same income bracket or gender or ethnicity or class." 
A defining characteristic of New York City is its economic diversity, the juxtaposition of people of disparate circumstances in limited space. The gap between top and bottom is greater in New York than in most cities in the country, and people at the extremes often live closer together.
In the 1990's the disparity in many neighborhoods became more pronounced, census data show. As the economy boomed, income inequality grew. And as the population swelled and real estate prices soared and crime waned, the affluent pushed deeper into neighborhoods they had once shunned.
Now the city has dozens of census tracts -- clusters of just a few thousand people -- in which the average household income in the top fifth of the income spectrum is at least 24 times the average in the bottom fifth, according to an analysis of census data done for The New York Times. In 15 of those tracts, the average at the top is at least 40 times that at the bottom.
The analysis, by Andrew A. Beveridge, a professor of sociology at Queens College, identified the top 30 tracts with the biggest income disparity. Seventeen are in Brooklyn, seven are in Manhattan and four are in Queens. The Bronx and Staten Island have one each.
They range from Ms. Davis's neighborhood, where two public housing projects bookend a gentrifying corridor of brownstones and row houses, to an area along the beach in Brooklyn where West End Avenue appears to be a stark line of demarcation between the serene old-immigrant opulence of Manhattan Beach and the teeming new-immigrant enclave of Brighton Beach.
They also include tracts in Jamaica and St. Albans in Queens, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, in East Harlem and in Chelsea, where one tract encompasses everything from new luxury apartment houses and full-floor condominium lofts to small, decaying apartment buildings.
The city is etched with boundaries and borderlands that appear on no maps, areas where income groups intersect, overlap, collide, coexist -- along lines drawn and redrawn by quirks of history, differences in housing stock, patterns of immigration and the economy's perpetual rise and fall.
For some, the juxtapositions are a virtue, one of the city's fascinations; for others, they are a source of resentment and guilt. And despite New York's economic diversity, many say that meaningful contact across income lines in their neighborhoods is the exception, not the rule.
"The only contact that takes place for me and my wife is in the school," said Pablo Aviles, 39, apayroll worker for the Department of Education who lives in a public housing complex in Boerum Hill. "We've made friends with people who are on the other end of the income bracket; we've been to their homes and attended parties. There are PTA meetings. That's pretty much it."
William Kornblum, a professor of sociology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, said: "It's always an empirical question, to what extent propinquity matters to people. Because one of the outstanding features of life in a densely populated city such as ours is that you can live for a long time next to people and not necessarily have anything to do with them."
There are many reasons that income difference is more visible in New York City than elsewhere. Manhattan has the third-most-extreme income disparity of all counties in the United States, while the Bronx, Brooklyn and Staten Island are all in the top 50. (The two counties that top Manhattan are Kalawao County, Hawaii, where the census counted just 132 households, and San Francisco County.)
Density dictates proximity: if sprawl is the suburban response to inequality, it is not an option in New York, where many lower income people have been protected from displacement. The city's housing market has stronger controls than many, including rent laws, and more than 10 percent of all rental units are in the hands of the city's Housing Authority.
The affluent have their own protection. David J. Halle, a sociologist at the University of California at Los Angeles who lives in New York City, says the rich never abandoned New York the way they did other cities. He credits Wall Street, public transportation, the city's cultural institutions and the laws governing the co-op apartment system, which he calls "more gated than a gated community."
"What you have in New York City is a critical mass of well-to-do people," he said. "You don't have that in Los Angeles. It doesn't make sense for someone rich in Los Angeles to plonk themselves down in the middle. They definitely wouldn't feel comfortable with it. I think in many parts of the country they wouldn't. New York's a bit unusual."
On the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where the palatial town houses and co-ops of Carnegie Hill bump up against the tenements and public housing projects of East Harlem, there is a census tract just north of East 96th Street where the average income in the top fifth of the spectrum is $561,762, and the average in the bottom fifth is $11,634.
In one tract in Chelsea, the top and bottom averages are $370,713 and $8,844, census data show. In Boerum Hill, Bay Ridge and Bedford-Stuyvesant, the averages are lower but the gap is wide. At the western end of Manhattan Beach near the border of Brighton Beach, the average at the top is $415,388 and at the bottom, $6,868.
"In an odd sort of way, they're both one neighborhood and starkly divided," said Annelise Orleck, who grew up in both communities, is now a historian at Dartmouth and has written about the area. "Manhattan Beach people consider Brighton Beach their neighborhood; they use the boardwalk, they shop there. But there's definitely a sharp divide."
To the east of West End Avenue, large single-family houses line hushed suburban-style streets with Anglophile names like Coleridge, Dover and Exeter where S.U.V.'s and BMW's are parked. To the west, Brighton Beach is packed with modest row houses, apartment buildings, dilapidated bungalows and frame houses, many of them subdivided, with an occasional sign: "Se Renta Cuarto"(Room for Rent).
In some parts of Brighton Beach, as many as three of four residents were born abroad; the bulk of them are from Russia and Ukraine but many are from Mexico, Pakistan and China. In Manhattan Beach, nearly two-thirds of the residents were born in the United States. Professionals predominate; most Manhattan Beach adults have college degrees.
History and housing stock help explain the differences.
Manhattan Beach was developed after 1907, on the heels of the heyday of the Manhattan Beach Hotel, which had attracted an elite clientele, including Henry Ford. In Brighton Beach, an apartment building boom in the 1920's turned the neighborhood into what Professor Orleck calls "the yuppie neighborhood of the moment," but the stock market crash in 1929 cut that short.
Brighton Beach residents, politically active during the Depression, boasted that no one would be turned out of their homes for failing to pay rent, Professor Orleck said. As a result, "whatever the 1920's version of yuppie buildings was became places where you had several generations of families crowding together in apartments."
"I don't think it ever recovered its earlier position from that moment," she said. "Indeed, you have people writing in the 1930's that Brighton went from being this upscale neighborhood to a slum in a few years."
Boerum Hill was a working-class community when Chastity Davis was young. Professionals had begun moving in as early as the late 70's and restoring run-down houses. Young families followed a decade later. Bodegas and thrift stores on Smith Street have given way to bistros. More and more newcomers now send their children to the neighborhood elementary school, P.S. 38.
Some oldtime P.S. 38 parents bristled at the influx at first, Mr. Aviles said. But the school has benefited from the new arrivals' energy and resources, he said. Parents helped land a $300,000 grant for a computer lab and arranged for the transformation of the schoolyard into a playground. They organized "enrichment clubs" specializing in areas like music and art.
Mr. Aviles admits he had been reluctant to invite some of his eldest son's classmates to the family's apartment in the Gowanus Houses, one of the two housing projects in the area. Anticipating their "negative thoughts," he said, "we tried to beat around the bush and get them not to come." But they came. Now he says he no longer worries about what people think.
Mary-Powel Thomas, a former magazine editor who moved from the Upper West Side nine years ago because she and her husband could afford to buy a house in Boerum Hill, said she too sometimes feels "a twinge of embarrassment about living situations."
It was "just luck," she said, that both her and her husband's families could afford to pay for their college education, so they graduated with no debt, and that her grandfather had left her stock that the couple sold to finance the down payment on their house. "I feel like, O.K., yeah, we both had jobs and worked hard and paid our bills, but that was part of the situation we were born into as well," said Ms. Thomas, the president of the PTA at P.S. 38. "There are plenty of people who work just as hard and pay their bills and are just as responsible, yet didn't have the head start we had."
And what does one do with that embarrassment? "Not a lot," she said frankly. "One sends one's children to public schools and does what one can to improve them."
Ms. Davis, who considers herself and her husband "approaching middle income but not there yet," would also like to buy a house in Boerum Hill. But she often doubts that will happen, and she is constantly aware of income differences. For example, she notices that she is treated differently in stores and other places depending on whether she is in jeans or dressed for her job as a recruiting assistant at J. P. Morgan.
"There's no question that there is a sense of resentment," she said. "Everyone is walking around subconsciously thinking the same things. I don't think anybody would disagree with what I'm saying. People who haven't faced that kind of experience would like to say it's not like that. But you always get the sense in the back of your head that things would be different if you looked a certain way or had a certain amount of money."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DIPLOMACY; 
Powell Says U.S. Can Wage War on Iraq Without Turks

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said today that the United States would make plans to wage war against Iraq without Turkish help if the government in Ankara did not reverse its refusal to take part "in the next several days."
 Speaking at a moment of extraordinary tension between Turkey and the United States, Mr. Powell said that although "we were disappointed in the Turkish votes," the United States military was "flexible enough" to handle an invasion of Iraq with or without the Turks. 
 His remarks came as Turkish officials said there would probably not be a vote on the issue until an election of several parliamentary seats on Sunday was concluded. 
Secretary Powell said that no matter what happened, the United States and Turkey would remain "close friends for many years in the future."
But State Department officials acknowledged that the Turkish refusal had strained relations and left top aides to President Bush somewhat uncertain how to proceed. "There is not a definitive plan on exactly what happens next," said one department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
One of the problems, officials said, was that Turkey's governing Justice and Development Party, which came to power at the end of last year, was still too inexperienced to be able to count votes in Parliament or even within its own caucus.
Just before Turkish lawmakers voted down a proposal to allow the United States to use Turkey for a second front in the war against Iraq -- in return for an aid package of roughly $15 billion in grants and loans -- Turkish leaders assured American officials that the measure would be passed.
"They were quite confident," the State Department official said. The official added that aides to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the party leader, were not even able to tell American officials exactly why the vote failed.
The official suggested that Mr. Erdogan had failed to impose party discipline on the members and overlooked the impact of abstentions. The Turkish Constitution requires that a measure be approved by a majority of those present.
Although there were more yes votes than no votes, there were so many abstentions that the measure failed by that standard.
American officials say there is no deadline for Turkey to decide. But Mr. Powell's comments suggested that something had to be decided by next week, when a resolution may come before the United Nations Security Council. Mr. Powell's timetable contrasts with the one put forward by Turkey, where officials say they need two weeks to turn Parliament around. 
Those officials also said there was no fallback package of arrangements with Turkey if this one failed. If Turkey does not reverse the vote, the State Department official said, the aid package and other parts of the agreement are "off the table."
Many experts are already assessing the failure to persuade Turkey to accept the deal as an embarrassing setback for Secretary Powell.
A Turkish official said it was a situation that had occurred because of the need for speed on the American side and the need for the new Turkish government to sort its way through several pressing problems -- particularly a disastrous economy -- before it could make a deal.
Administration officials say there are several obvious reasons why Turkey has refused to go along with the deal. The main one, they concede, is that opinion polls indicate that nearly 90 percent of the Turkish people oppose a war with Iraq, and a newly elected government cannot afford to defy the wishes of a majority on such a vital issue.
But officials also expressed resentment over the American insistence that, with billions of dollars in new loans, Turkey adhere to its austerity program negotiated last year with the International Monetary Fund.
The austerity measures include cutting farm subsidies, curbing wage increases, laying workers off at state-owned enterprises and cutting back on big and popular public works projects. Turks, remembering what happened after the last Persian Gulf war, feel that such harsh measures are only a prelude to worse suffering that would occur after a war.
Americans, on the other hand, say that Turkey can benefit economically if President Saddam Hussein is removed in Iraq and that, in any case, Turkey has no choice but to adopt the austerity measures because the international markets demand them.
"The bottom line," said an administration official, "is that if the Turks don't meet their financial targets, the markets will batter them. If they fail on their targets and there's a conflict in Iraq, they're in a really tough position."
The other points of contention relate to American demands that Turkish forces in Iraq be restricted to providing relief for refugees. Turkey says it will abide by such restrictions, provided there is no uprising of Kurds in northern Iraq that threatens to spill over to the Kurds of Turkey.
Just which of those factors led to the rejection of the American offer last weekend is a matter of dispute.
"You have 533 deputies voting," said a Turkish official. "I'm sure each one has a different balance sheet in his or her mind." On top of the economic, political and military factors, he added, was the media coverage in the United States depicting Turkey in a critical light -- "greedy Turks trying to exploit the situation," as the official put it.
That official said Turkey's leaders sometimes felt that the Bush administration failed to appreciate that Turkey was a democracy and that permission to use it as a base could not be worked out simply between the Pentagon and the Turkish generals with whom the American military had many decades of close ties.
"Military to military, they speak the same language, they work out their scenarios," said the Turkish official. "But ultimately it's the political authority that must take responsibility. The administration could have done a better job understanding that fact. They were told again and again this would not be an easy thing to do."
But within the Bush administration the mood has been one of frustration and puzzlement. "No question there was serious disappointment," said a State Department official. "There is still a desire to see what might be possible." But officials say they are not confident of success.

HEADLINE: Hugo Chavez and the Limits of Democracy 

BYLINE:  By Moises Naim; Moises Naim, minister of trade and industry of Venezuela from 1989 to 1990, is editor of Foreign Policy magazine.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For decades Venezuela was a backwater, uninteresting to the outside world. It could not compete for international attention with nearby countries where superpowers staged proxy wars, or where military juntas "disappeared" thousands of opponents, or where the economy regularly crashed. Venezuela was stable. Its oil fueled an economy that enjoyed the world's highest growth rate from 1950 to 1980 andit boasted a higher per-capita income than Spain from 1928 to 1984. Venezuela was one of the longest-lived democracies in Latin America.
 Venezuela is no longer boring. It has become a nightmare for its people and a threat not just to its neighbors but to the United States and even Europe. A strike in its oil industry has contributed to a rise in gasoline prices at the worst possible time. Hasil Muhammad Rahaham-Alan, a Venezuelan citizen, was detained last month at a London airport as he arrived from Caracas carrying a hand grenade in his luggage. A week later, President Hugo Chavez praised the arrest orders of two opposition leaders who had been instrumental in organizing the strike, saying they "should have been jailed a long time ago." Mr. Chavez has helped to create an environment where stateless international networks whose business is terror, guns or drugs feel at home. 
 Venezuela has also become a laboratory where the accepted wisdom of the 1990's is being tested -- and often discredited. The first tenet to fall is the belief that the United States has almost unlimited influence in South America. As one of its main oil suppliers and a close neighbor has careened out of control, America has been a conspicuously inconsequential bystander.
And it is not just the United States. The United Nations, agencies like the Organization of American States and the International Monetary Fund, or the international press -- all have stood by and watched. In the 1990's there was a hope that these institutions could prevent, or at least contain, some of the ugly malignancies that lead nations to self-destruct.
Instead, the most influential foreign influence in Venezuela is from the 1960's: Fidel Castro. The marriage of convenience between Cuba and Venezuela is rooted in the close personal relationship between the two leaders, with Mr. Castro playing the role of mentor to his younger Venezuelan admirer. Cuba desperately needs Venezuelan oil, while the Chavez administration depends on Cuba's experience in staging, managing or repressing political turmoil.
Another belief of the 1990's was that global economic forces would force democratically elected leaders to pursue responsible economic policies. Yet Mr. Chavez, a democratically elected president, has been willing to tolerate international economic isolation -- with disastrous results for Venezuela's poor -- in exchange for greater power at home.
The 21st century was not supposed to engender a Latin American president with a red beret. Instead of obsessing about luring private capital, he scares it away. Rather than strengthening ties with the United States, he befriends Cuba. Such behavior was supposed to have been made obsolete by the democratization, economic deregulation and globalization of the 1990's.
Venezuela is an improbable country to have fallen into this political abyss. It is vast, wealthy, relatively modern and cosmopolitan, with a strong private sector and a homogeneous mixed-race population with little history of conflict. Democracy was supposed to have prevented its decline into a failed state. Yet once President Chavez gained control over the government, his rule became exclusionary and profoundly undemocratic.
Under Mr. Chavez, Venezuela is a powerful reminder that elections are necessary but not sufficient for democracy, and that even longstanding democracies can unravel overnight. A government's legitimacy flows not only from the ballot box but also from the way it conducts itself. Accountability and institutional restraints and balances are needed.
The international community became adept at monitoring elections and ensuring their legitimacy in the 1990's. The Venezuelan experience illustrates the urgency of setting up equally effective mechanisms to validate a government's practices.
The often stealthy transgressions of Mr. Chavez have unleashed a powerful expression of what is perhaps the only trend of the 1990's still visible in Venezuela: civil society. In today's Venezuela millions of once politically indifferent citizens stage almost daily marches and rallies larger than those that forced the early resignations of other democratically presidents around the world.
This is not a traditional opposition movement. It is an inchoate network of people from all social classes and walks of life, who are organized in loosely coordinated units and who do not have any other ambition than to stop a president who has made their country unlivable. Two out of three Venezuelans living under the poverty line oppose President Chavez, according to a Venezuelan survey released in January.
This amorphous movement is new to politics and vulnerable to manipulation by traditional politicians and interest groups. For example, last year a military faction took advantage of a huge but civil anti-Chavez march and staged a coup that ousted the president for almost two days. By rejecting the antidemocratic measures adopted by the would-be new president, the leader of a business association, the movement helped bring about his quick downfall.
Today the Venezuelan opposition consists of several factions, some of which have participated in talks with the government. Yet it is a mistake to equate these formal bodies with the widespread and largely leaderless, self-organizing movement that has emerged in Venezuela. Many foreign observers discount the opposition as mostly rich or middle class, a coup-prone coalition of opportunistic politicians.
No doubt some protesters fit this ugly profile. Nor is there any doubt that the Venezuelan opposition is clumsy and prone to blunders. Still, it has helped millions of Venezuelans awaken to the fact that for too many years they have been mere inhabitants of their own country. Now they demand to be citizens, and feel they have the right to oust through democratic means a president who has wrought havoc on their country.
It is a measure of Venezuela's toxic political climate that even though the constitution allows for early elections, and even though President Chavez has promised that he will abide by this provision, the great majority of Venezuelans don't believe him. They are convinced that in August, when the constitution contemplates a referendum on the president, the government will resort to delaying tactics and dirty tricks. With international attention elsewhere, Mr. Chavez will use his power to forestall an election and ignore the constitution.
Venezuela's citizens have been heroically peaceful and civil in their quest. All they ask is that they be given a chance to vote. The world should do its best to ensure that they have that opportunity.

Fears of Reduced Consumer Spending Send Shares Lower

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks sank yesterday on fears that slack consumer spending will further weaken the economy, with shares of General Motors and Home Depot knocking the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average to a low not seen in almost five months.
"There's some fear, outside of the geopolitical sphere, that there are still some fundamental problems within the economy," said Charles Payne, market analyst at Wall Street Strategies. "Businesses really aren't spending or investing, and that creates a serious problem as it appears the consumer finally is running out of steam." 
 Shares of General Motors skidded nearly 6 percent after United States car sales fell for a second month in February. 
 Shares of Home Depot, the No. 1 home improvement retailer, fell 4 percent after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned that the housing boom would probably slow. Consumer spending has helped to prop up the struggling economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 132.99 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 7,704.87, hitting its lowest level since Oct. 10. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 12.52 points, or 1 percent, to 1,307.77. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 12.82 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 821.99.
A bombing at an airport in the Philippines that killed 19 people and wounded 144 yesterday gave the market an early scare, providing another reminder of the climate of fear that has sidelined investors.
Shares of automakers and their suppliers tumbled a day after car companies reported weak United States sales for February, and G.M. and Ford Motor cut production forecasts for the second quarter.
Deutsche Bank downgraded G.M. and Ford to sell from hold on concerns of a prolonged decline in demand. The bank also downgraded the automotive parts suppliers Delphi and Visteon to sell from hold.
G.M. fell $1.89, to $31.27. Ford lost 33 cents, or 4 percent, to $7.74. Delphi tumbled 62 cents, or 8 percent, to $7.08. Visteon skidded 49 cents, or almost 8 percent, to $5.78.
Housing stocks fell on Mr. Greenspan's remarks on the possible end of the five-year housing boom. Home Depot fell 99 cents, to $22.10. Lowe's, the No. 2 home improvement retailer, sank $1.72, or 4 percent, to $37.55.
Lennar, a home builder, dropped $3.91, or 7 percent, to $50.55. Shares of its competitors also declined. Pulte Homes stumbled $3.90, or more than 7 percent, to $46.80; Centex lost $3.82, or nearly 7 percent, to $51.68; and KB Home declined $2.79, or almost 6 percent, to $44.35.

Treasury Prices Mixed
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices were mixed yesterday as the United States and Britain pushed the United Nations to back a resolution authorizing an invasion of Iraq.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year note -- the rate banks use to set mortgage rates -- climbed to within 15 basis points of a 45-year low. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) 
Investors sought the safety of government debt as stocks slid on concern a war will curb economic growth.
The price of the 10-year note rose 6/32 , to 101 28/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 3.65 percent from 3.67 percent on Monday.
The 30-year bond, however, fell 1/32 , to 110 31/32 . Its yield was unchanged at 4.67 percent.

Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 99.907
High Rate: 1.190
Coupon Yield: 1.217
Low Rate: 1.160
Median Rate: 1.190
Total applied for: $50,585,170
Accepted: $26,561,320
Noncompetitive: $53,582

The four-week bills mature April 3.

HEADLINE: After 101 Years, Philip Morris Plans to Leave New York 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
Just weeks before one of the toughest antismoking laws in the country is to go into effect in New York City, Philip Morris USA announced yesterday that it intends to end a 101-year relationship with the city by moving its headquarters to Richmond, Va.
 A spokesman for the company, which has 682 employees in Manhattan and 6,800 in and around Richmond, said the decision was in no way prompted by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's antismoking legislation. 
 The company said the move was entirely motivated by a need to streamline operations, increase efficiency and cut costs at a time of fierce competition in the tobacco industry.
"It's a business story rather than a political story," said Brendan McCormick, manager of media relations for Philip Morris USA, a subsidiary of the Altria Group Inc., whose headquarters will remain in Manhattan. A spokesman for the mayor's office also said that Philip Morris's decision was unrelated to the antismoking law. 
The decision by Philip Morris USA, the largest cigarette maker in the country, comes at a time when the city has lost nearly 176,000 jobs over the last two years and unemployment has jumped to 8.4 percent. The Bloomberg administration is struggling to close a $3.4 billion budget gap for the fiscal year beginning July 1, and residents are facing the largest property tax increase in city history.
Even so, several economists said the broader implications of the company's decision, if any, remain unclear. The city has been losing corporate headquarters for decades. While having one's headquarters in New York City brings certain advantages, including access to a highly skilled work force, it is expensive; in a downturn, they said, all companies try to cut costs.
"Philip Morris may have made an internal decision which is obviously unique to Philip Morris," said Marc M. Goloven, the senior regional economist for J. P. Morgan Chase. "If we saw the outmigration of significant numbers at any one time at this juncture, then perhaps it would be more ominous. But for any one company to decide to move, I don't think it has very significant implications."
Marcia Van Wagner, chief economist for the Citizens Budget Commission, said: "It's not good news by any means. But I think that it's hard to really make a judgment about whether this is a trend across different industries at this point."
Philip Morris incorporated in New York in 1902, opened its manufacturing plant in Virginia in 1924 and throughout most of its history has had most of its employees in Virginia, Mr. McCormick said. Though it kept its headquarters in Manhattan, now on Park Avenue at 41st Street, it has repeatedly considered moving its headquarters to Virginia in recent years.
By relocating, it expects to save $60 million annually, in part by cutting the costs of transporting employees back and forth between New York and Richmond and by lowering the expense of maintaining two facilities. Mr. McCormick said most of the New York employees would be offered the chance to relocate. He said the move is to be completed by June 2004.
The Altria Group's other subsidiaries include Philip Morris International, 84 percent of Kraft Foods and 37 percent of SAB Miller PLC, a brewing company. Altria, formerly known as Philip Morris Companies Inc., has been a major donor to cultural and charitable organizations in New York, contributing $13 million to $14 million over the past several years.
Dave Tovar, manager for media relations at Altria, which has 750 employees in its Manhattan headquarters, said the relocation of Philip Morris USA would not influence the parent company's giving.
Philip Morris's announcement comes less than a month before March 30, the date Mayor Bloomberg's antismoking legislation, a sweeping ban on indoor smoking in public places, is to take effect. According to Mr. McCormick, Philip Morris had been exempted, along with other tobacco businesses and manufacturers, from the city's less stringent antismoking law enacted in 1995.
Asked whether the new law influenced the company's decision to move, Mr. McCormick said it did not.
"You wouldn't make a decision of this magnitude based on something like that," he said. "We have employees around the country, many of whom work in buildings where smoking is not permitted, and they certainly comply with the law. The law goes into effect at the end of March and we intend to comply with that."

HEADLINE: Bush Medicare Proposal Urges Switch to Private Insurers 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR and ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4 

 BODY:
President Bush opened a fractious new round in the Medicare debate today by proposing comprehensive drug coverage for elderly Americans, but only if they switch to subsidized private insurance plans.
 Democrats immediately accused the administration of trying to coerce the nation's 40 million elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries into managed care, in an effort to privatize one of the most politically popular government programs and consign the elderly to "the tender mercies of an H.M.O.," as Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, put it. The Democrats proposed far more generous, and more costly, drug benefits. 
 Several leading Republicans, courted by the White House for weeks, were surprisingly cool to Mr. Bush's proposal. They said it still did not offer enough drug benefits to people in the traditional government-run Medicare program, which serves more than 85 percent of all beneficiaries.. 
"We need a universal drug benefit so seniors who want to stay in traditional Medicare get a prescription drug plan that's just as good as those who choose a new option," said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the chairman of the Finance Committee. 
Members of both parties had urged the administration to avoid any hint of penalizing elderly beneficiaries who stay in traditional Medicare. But under Mr. Bush's proposal, the drug benefits available to people in traditional Medicare would be modest, compared with those that private plans would be required to offer.
Today's skirmishing reflected the power of an issue that figured prominently in the last three national elections and could be even more important in 2004. Republicans, now in control of Congress and the White House, feel immense pressure to deliver Medicare drug benefits to the elderly, a critical voting bloc, before the next election.
In a speech today to a friendly audience at the American Medical Association, Mr. Bush invoked the memory of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed the original Medicare law in 1965. But Mr. Bush insisted that "a modern Medicare system must offer more choices and better benefits to every senior" and that the way to do that is to introduce free-market competition into Medicare.
"When insurance providers compete for a patient's business, they offer new treatments and services quickly," Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Bush's proposal would offer comprehensive drug benefitsto people in private plans. Those in the traditional Medicare program would receive much less assistance: a drug discount card, which could be used at pharmacies, and protection against "high out-of-pocket prescription drug expenses."
The president did not define "high." Administration officials have previously suggested that beneficiaries might have to spend $4,000 to $7,000 of their own money on prescription drugs to qualify.
Three influential Republicans, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Representatives Billy Tauzin of Louisiana and Jim Nussle of Iowa, said Mr. Bush's proposal did not guarantee adequate drug benefits for people in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program. 
Senator Snowe, a pivotal member of the Finance Committee, said: "The president has taken a step in the right direction, but he has not gone far enough. Every senior should have access to comprehensive prescription drug coverage, regardless of which Medicare option they choose."
Mr. Tauzin, the chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, said some Medicare beneficiaries would be reluctant to join private plans, even if drug benefits were offered as an enticement. 
"You couldn't move my mother out of Medicare with a bulldozer," Mr. Tauzin said. "She trusts it, believes in it. It's served her well."
Mr. Tauzin said his panel "almost certainly will want a strong and adequate prescription drug benefit within fee-for-service Medicare." Drug benefits in private plans and in traditional Medicare "should be very similar, though not necessarily the same," Mr. Tauzin said.
As they begin drafting legislation, lawmakers face some of the most sensitive questions in the politics of health care: Will the nation's elderly get better care from H.M.O.'s and other private plans than from the original government-run Medicare program? How much should the government encourage the elderly to join those plans? Where is the line between financial incentives and economic coercion?
Republicans are keenly aware that one of the most devastating accusations against President Bill Clinton's plan for universal health insurance was that it would force Americans into H.M.O.'s.
President Bush said again today that he would spend $400 billion to "strengthen and improve Medicare" in the coming decade. That would cover 22 percent of spending on outpatient prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries in those years, as projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Bush's proposal lacked the details that would permit elderly people to decide what it would mean for them individually. He did not specify the premiums, co-payments or deductibles, nor did he say whether there would be significant gaps in drug coverage.
Medicare officials said they had drafted more detailed proposals, but Mr. Bush and his political advisers decided that it would be better to negotiate the details with Congress.
For months, administration officials have been promising a detailed proposal. They pulled back an earlier draft because of strong bipartisan criticism that it lacked drug benefits for people who stayed in the original Medicare program.
Mr. Nussle, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said of administration officials: "They are not just two weeks or two months late. They are two years late. They have been unrealistic and unfortunately unable to come together within the administration on what their plan ought to be."
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist of Tennessee, welcomed the president's proposal, but described it as one step in what will be a long, difficult legislative process.
The biggest innovation in Mr. Bush's proposal is to offer enhanced Medicare benefits through private plans -- not just health maintenance organizations, but loose networks of doctors and hospitals known as preferred provider organizations. Medicare officials would divide the country into 10 regions and would sign contracts with at least three preferred provider entities in each region.
"Seniors will be able to choose their specialists, their hospitals and their primary doctors," Mr. Bush said. But Medicare officials said that patients would generally have to pay more if they used doctors and hospitals not listed on the roster of "preferred providers."
Mr. Bush said he wanted to give Medicare beneficiaries "a broad choice among competing health care plans," like those available to federal employees.

HEADLINE: Ruling on Victor vs. Victoria Offers Split Victory of Sorts 

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4 

 BODY:
A closely watched intellectual property battle in the Supreme Court between the Victoria's Secret catalog and retail empire and the tiny Victor's Little Secret of Elizabethtown, Ky., ended in a unanimous but inconclusive decision today. The court offered something for both sides in its first interpretation of a new federal law intended to protect famous brand names from copycat uses that dilute their impact in the marketplace.
 On the one hand, the court held in an opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens that the owner of a famous trademark could win a case under the Federal Trademark Dilution Act without proving that it had suffered actual economic damages from the appropriation of its name or use of a sufficiently similar name. 
 On the other hand, the famous trademark owner has to show some form of current harm, a loss of its distinctive identity or blurring of its image, as opposed to a purely speculative anticipation of future harm. 
But the court left for the future the critical question of what factors to consider in proving such a case. The outcome made it likely that the 1995 law would remain controversial in intellectual property circles and that the major corporate trademark owners at whose behest Congress passed the law would now seek an amendment to give their interests more specific protection.
The justices overturned and sent back to the lower courts a judgment in favor of Victoria's Secret, which had sued to force Victor's Little Secret, a small shop selling sex toys, lingerie and novelty items from a suburban strip mall, to change its name. The owner, Victor Moseley, who said he named the shop for himself, fought back, arguing that Victoria's Secret was claiming more protection from the trademark dilution law than Congress had intended. 
Agreeing with the essence of Mr. Moseley's argument, the justices said today that the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, had used the wrong standard in concluding that Victoria's Secret did not have to show that Victor's Little Secret had yet caused it any particular harm. The decision relied heavily on the language of the statute, which authorizes the "owner of a famous mark" to obtain an injunction against another's use of a name that "causes dilution of the distinctive quality" of the famous trademark.
"This text unambiguously requires a showing of actual dilution, rather than a likelihood of dilution," Justice Stevens said. He noted that many of the state statutes that preceded the federal law used the "likelihood of dilution" formulation, but that Congress did not incorporate that phrase into the Federal Trademark Dilution Act.
Citing the statute's language, the court defined dilution as a reduction in "the capacity of the famous mark to identify the goods of its owner."
Trademark dilution is different from trademark infringement, which is addressed separately in federal law and requires proof that consumers have actually been confused. Dilution is a more elusive concept, Jonathan Moskin, an intellectual property lawyer at Pennie & Edmonds in New York, said in an interview today. "We know what it is to be confused, but as a cognitive event we don't know exactly what it is to experience a diminution of good will."
Mr. Moskin said that under today's decision, the task of a plaintiff in a dilution case "is clarified to some extent but not ultimately resolved."
In the absence of earlier guidance by the court, federal appeals courts had adopted widely divergent interpretations of the statute. The court today largely adopted an approach proposed by Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson on behalf of the Patent and Trademark Office: that the plaintiff must show current dilution, but not necessarily economic harm.
The court said it would not be enough to show a simple "mental association" between two trademarks: that consumers think of one when they see the other. Consumers must be shown to have formed a "different impression" of the famous trademark, a lessened ability to distinguish products it is intended to identify, Justice Stevens said. The opinion indicated it would not be enough to show only that a trademark's image had been tarnished.
Erik Cherdak, an intellectual property lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson here, said the court had given plaintiffs a "high but not insurmountable burden" that was consistent with Congress's intent. 
While the decision, Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue Inc., No. 01-1015, was fairly clear on what a trademark owner has to prove, it was less illuminating on the means of proving it, whether through consumer surveys, expert testimony, or circumstantial evidence. The difficulties of proof "are not an acceptable reason for dispensing with proof," Justice Stevens said.
Robert N. Phillips, an intellectual property lawyer at Howrey Simon Arnold & White in Menlo Park, Calif., said the decision invited new approaches to proving dilution cases. He said Victoria's Secret might still be able to prevail in the next phase.
The trademark bar's generally upbeat view of the decision was not shared by groups concerned about the ability of intellectual property rights to chill free expression by creating a kind of monopoly ownership of particular words. "The right people won, but not in a way that really advances the cause of keeping 'trademark creep' in check," said Peter Jaszi, a law professor at American University who filed a brief on Mr. Moseley's side for the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other public interest groups.
In another development today, the court overturned, by 6 to 3, a judgment won against the federal government by the Navajo Tribe for the Interior Department's alleged mishandling of a coal lease on tribal lands. 
A federal appeals court here had found the tribe entitled to damages of up to $600 million after deciding that Interior Secretary Donald Hodel had improperly intervened in the setting of new royalty rates for the extraction of coal and had favored interests of the Peabody Coal Company over those of the tribe. The disputed events took place in 1985.
Writing for the court today, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the 1938 Indian Mineral Leasing Act, requiring approval by the interior secretary before tribes enter into coal mining leases with outsiders, did not impose specific duties or standards that, when breached by the secretary, entitled a tribe to damages.
Justice David H. Souter dissented in an opinion joined by Justices Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor, saying the tribe was entitled to a trial on the issue. The case was United States v. Navajo Nation, No. 01-1375.

HEADLINE: Credit Suisse Banker Quits Amid Inquiries 

BYLINE:  By LANDON THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Frank P. Quattrone, the highflying investment banker who handled hot stock offerings like Cisco Systems and Amazon.com during the technology boom, resigned from Credit Suisse First Boston yesterday after refusing to cooperate with an investigation into his banking practices.
 Mr. Quattrone is the subject of an NASD investigation, and on the advice of his lawyers, he has declined to provide additional testimony to regulators in that office. According to Credit Suisse officials, Mr. Quattrone violated bank policy by choosing not to cooperate with the investigation. 
 Mr. Quattrone, who earned as much as $100 million annually in his peak years, and the firm have agreed to work out such issues as his severance pay and his accumulation of company stock later, pending a resolution of the civil and criminal inquiries. Credit Suisse will continue to pay his considerable legal expenses under terms of his contract.
Mr. Quattrone, who had been on administrative leave, is also the subject of two criminal investigations: one being conducted by New York state prosecutors and the other by the United States attorney's office in Manhattan.
Prosecutors and regulators now describe Mr. Quattrone's suspected infractions as symbolic of the excesses that inflated and then burst the Nasdaq bubble in the late 1990's.
From his base in Credit Suisse's offices in Palo Alto, Calif., Mr. Quattrone blurred the barriers between the disparate businesses of a Wall Street bank.
Nominally an investment banker in charge of bringing hot technology companies public, he also held sway over a research department, ensuring that companies he took public received positive coverage, the prosecutors now suggest, pointing to various e-mail messages. Regulators say that Mr. Quattrone guided the distribution of public offerings of new stocks to favored clients, a practice known as spinning. Investigators are also trying to determine whether he impeded a federal inquiry in December 2000, when he endorsed a colleague's suggestion that bankers clean up their files.
Mr. Quattrone's presence had become a burden for John J. Mack, Credit Suisse's chief executive, who has struggled to differentiate his staff of team players from the casino-like banking mentality that prevailed under the former chief executive, Allen Wheat. Just over a year ago, Mr. Mack added Mr. Quattrone to the firm's executive committee -- a surprise to many who saw Mr. Quattrone's legal baggage and Mr. Mack's reform effort as contradictory.
Now, after a global settlement between investment banks and regulators has been reached in principle and the details are imminent, Credit Suisse is looking to wipe its decks clean. Mr. Mack's chief legal adviser is Gary G. Lynch, a former enforcement official at the Securities and Exchange Commission, who also spearheaded the commission's investigation of Michael R. Milken, the 1980's-era junk bond innovator. Together, they have been taking aggressive steps to distance their bank from Mr. Quattrone.
The Credit Suisse Group, parent of Credit Suisse First Boston, recently set aside $600 million against future legal claims, and like other Wall Street firms, it is steeling itself for a barrage of class-action lawsuits when regulators release the results of their investigation. By cutting Mr. Quattrone loose ahead of the release of the findings, Mr. Mack and Mr. Lynch are hoping that the brunt of the class-action suits will be directed at Mr. Quattrone and his still deep pockets, lawyers involved in the investigation say.
Mr. Quattrone was one of the first investment bankers to set up shop in California, doing so in the early 1980's. Starting at Morgan Stanley, where he reported to Mr. Mack, and continuing at Deutsche Bank and then Credit Suisse, he operated an office far from the New York headquarters.
Mr. Quattrone -- who cultivates a brushy black mustache and at times wears garish sweaters -- did more than take companies public. He, his family and his many clients and friends made early-stage investments in technology companies and booked handsome profits when these companies started trading. The vast number of technology stocks he underwrote are trading at prices far below their levels when they were brought public.
Some have compared Mr. Quattrone more to Mr. Milken than to recent fallen stars on Wall Street like Henry Blodget, Merrill Lynch's Internet stock analyst, and Jack B. Grubman, Salomon Smith Barney's telecommunications stock analyst.
Just as Mr. Milken became something of an evangelist for small, high-growth companies in need of leverage in the 1980's, Mr. Quattrone helped technology and Internet companies looking to cash in on the 1990's craze for technology stocks. Like Mr. Milken, Mr. Quattrone demanded a big chunk of his company's profits.
And just as Mr. Milken remained a hero for many of the growth companies he financed, Mr. Quattrone still has the support of many of his friends in Silicon Valley.
"Would I work with Frank again? I would," said C. Richard Kramlich, a general partner at New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm. "I've been in business with Frank since the mid-80's. I think you are innocent until proven guilty."
Despite sundry inquiries that date back to June 2000, no definitive legal action has been brought against Mr. Quattrone. Eliot Spitzer, the New York State attorney general, has been investigating Mr. Quattrone on broad accusations involving fraud since the fall of 2001. Federal prosecutors are focusing on obstruction of justice possibilities.
Mr. Quattrone's legal team, which includes three law firms and two public relations agencies, has held its own. His lawyers contend that there are no legal grounds for fraud suspicions and that Mr. Quattrone was following Credit Suisse policies when he endorsed the file-purging initiative. Cleaning out old files is a standard practice, but once a federal investigation has begun, nothing related to the matter is to be destroyed.
Lawyers involved in the investigations say that prosecutors and regulators have, in recent months, been focusing their efforts on the narrower charge of obstruction of justice.
"Obstruction of justice charges are easier cases to prove," said Robert G. Heim of Meyers & Heim, a former lawyer for the S.E.C. "The case would be far less complex and wouldn't involve digging through research reports and I.P.O.'s. It's what federal prosecutors did with Arthur Andersen as opposed to accusing them of accounting fraud."

HEADLINE: Malpractice Insurance: No Clear or Easy Answers 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
To control the rising costs of medical malpractice insurance, President Bush is urging Congress to impose limitations on lawsuits like those introduced in California in 1975, which insurance companies and doctors say have sharply reduced their expenses.
 President Bush, the American Medical Association and the medical malpractice insurers all say that the linchpin of the California action -- a limit of $250,000 on payments for pain and suffering in malpractice lawsuits -- will benefit doctors, insurers and patients across the country. 
 "If one of the goals of a good health care system is for it to be affordable and accessible, and if lawsuits are running up the cost of medicine and/or driving docs out of business because the practicing of medicine is too expensive, we've got to do something about it," Mr. Bush said in a speech yesterday to a national conference of the A.M.A. in Washington.
But a closer look at the California experience with medical malpractice suggests that the lessons of liability caps are not so clear for either the doctors or the patients. Since 1975, doctors in the state have had a drop in the level of their premiums. But the greatest drops in premiums and, so far, the most consistent, did not come until after California adopted price controls in 1988, throwing into question the effects of the caps alone. 
Where the caps have had an effect, according to many plaintiffs' lawyers and consumer advocates, is on the chances of compensation for a whole category of malpractice victims. Consumer advocates and plaintiffs' lawyers say thousands of victims of malpractice have been unable to get lawyers to take their cases because of the limited payouts and that those who do get lawyers generally receive much less than victims in other states. 
A bill that would limit payments for pain and suffering in medical malpractice cases to $250,000 was endorsed on a voice vote by a subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce yesterday and it is expected to be voted on by the full committee in a few days. Tom DeLay, the House majority leader, said the House might vote on the measure as early as next week. Democrats in the Senate have promised to block the bill, which they say protects insurance companies at the expense of victims. 
Over the 27 years since the limit on lawsuits was established in California, the state has shifted from being one of the most expensive places for doctors to buy insurance to one of the least expensive. For example, some of the largest insurers in California estimated that calculated in current dollars, premiums have fallen about 40 percent during that time, to about $14,000 a year.
An analysis by the Consumer Federation of America, puts the premiums even lower, although that calculation includes some doctors working as researchers and others who do not actually buy insurance. 
At $14,000, California doctors are paying roughly half the average cost of coverage in states like New York and Pennsylvania and a little more than a third the cost in West Virginia, the highest in the country at $39,050. Some doctors in New York pay more than $100,000 a year for insurance, and obstetricians in South Florida pay $200,000 a year.
But it took several years after the imposition of the caps in 1975 before doctors in California saw a benefit in the form of lower premiums. There are varying interpretations of what caused that delay. 
Frank A. Sloan, an economics professor at Duke University specializing in health policy and management, said he had tracked similar lags in other states that imposed limits on awards for pain and suffering. 
"If anyone thinks caps on pain and suffering are going to work miracles overnight, they're wrong," Mr. Sloan said. "Bush will probably be out of the White House before we see appreciable relief from this policy."
Jamie Court, the executive director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica, argued that the main reason for the decline in premium costs in California had not been the limits on lawsuits, but the law in 1988, first proposed by his group, that prohibited annual increases greater than 15 percent by insurers without a public hearing. The measure, known as Proposition 103, required insurers to rebate earlier premiums and led to a freeze on premiums for several years. 
"Caps don't have any effect on premiums," Mr. Court said. "If you don't limit what the insurers can charge, they will just make more profit as the cost of claims goes down."
John Garamendi, the insurance commissioner of California, said both measures had helped keep costs down. However, there is no provision for controlling insurance rates in the Bush proposal. 
As a result of premiums being held in check, doctors and medical malpractice insurers say, doctors are not fleeing California or retiring early as they are in states like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida where costs have skyrocketed.
The insurance companies say the limits on awards for pain and suffering eliminate an emotional wild card in dealing with claims. They are prepared to pay for such measurable damages as lost income and medical expenses, which can easily run into the millions. But they say they need protection from huge awards by sympathetic juries for pain and suffering, which cannot be objectively defined.
"One jury might award $250,000 for an injury; for the next jury, it might be $250 million," said Dr. Richard E. Anderson, the chairman of the Doctors Company, the third-largest insurer of doctors in California.
But consumer advocates and plaintiffs' lawyers say that because of the limited payouts, many people with valid cases are unable find lawyers to take their cases. No one has kept track of the rejected cases. But Mary E. Alexander, the president of the Association of American Trial Lawyers who practices law in San Francisco, said, "You're talking thousands."
Moreover, they say, those patients who do find lawyers are likely to receive far less in compensation in California than in most other states. 
"There are certainly cases where an individual who has been seriously harmed by a true malpractice has not been able to receive benefits that most people would think appropriate," Mr. Garamendi said.
In 2000, for example, the average payment to a victim of malpractice in California was $142,637 -- lower than in every state but Michigan, and about a fourth that in Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania, the two most generous places. According to the American Medical Association, payouts of more than $1 million to victims occurred about three times as often in New York and New Jersey as in California.
California still has a higher percentage of lawsuits per doctor than the national average, according to an association of insurance companies, hospitals and medical associations called Californians Allied for Patient Protection. But consumer advocates and plaintiffs' lawyers say that many legitimate cases in California are not being pursued.
Those least likely to find a lawyer, the consumer advocates and lawyers say, are the survivors of infants, elderly people and homemakers who are killed in a medical mistake. For their survivors, citing pain and suffering is frequently the only legal recourse. Since no one is financially dependent upon these victims, there is legally no economic loss; because of their deaths, there can be no future medical costs. That leaves the survivors -- whether there is one or several -- with a maximum payment for their pain and suffering of $250,000.
"Where the liability is obvious, the settlement will be almost instant -- for $250,000," Dr. Anderson said. "It requires almost no legal effort at all if the liability is obvious."
But plaintiffs' lawyers say the liability is seldom obvious to the insurance companies. 
"If you're talking about getting the full $250,000, you're going to have to go to trial," said Ken Sigelman, a doctor and lawyer who is the chairman of the medical malpractice committee of the Consumer Attorneys of California, the state's organization of trial lawyers. "If the insurance company knows that's the most they have to lose, they're usually not going to offer that much before trial."
Even in those cases resolved on the eve of trial, lawyers say, they typically have to invest up to $100,000 to hire experts and develop the cases. They would do the same work and invest the same amount of money to tackle a case with a potential payoff in the millions. So they choose the more lucrative cases.
Mr. Sigelman said he rejected about 100 of the limited-payout cases a year, about half of which he regarded as very strong cases. The others looked promising, he said, but would require research to determine their true strength. 
Another lawyer, Ned Good, a former president of the California trial lawyers association, said, "There's isn't a week that goes by that I and most of the better lawyers I know in my state don't turn down a medical malpractice victim." Mr. Good now has a form letter that he sends out, rejecting these cases.
In stark contrast to an an infant who dies as a result of malpractice, one that lives and is likely to need decades of expensive medical care can be worth millions to a lawyer and client.
That contrast is painfully evident in the case of the Kaiserfamily of San Pedro, Calif. On July 25, 2000, Dennis and Wendy Kaiser became the parents of a 4-pound, 9-ounce baby boy. The child, who they named Casey, was born five weeks earlier than expected and suffered severe brain damage. 
When the couple -- he is a public relations executive, she a dental hygienist -- realized months later that they were probably facing millions in medical expenses, they found several lawyers willing to work with them. They decided to go with Russell S. Kussman, a doctor who had become a trial lawyer specializing in medical malpractice.
But last September, Casey Kaiser died. Soon after, Mr. Kussman said that he was sorry but that he could no longer represent the Kaisers.
Since then, Mrs. Kaiser said, she has spoken to seven other lawyers. None would take the case. One asked the Kaiser's to pay an hourly charge for him to review medical records, Mrs. Kaiser said. Another would take the case, she said, if the Kaisers agreed to pay the expenses. They are now on the verge of giving up.
"I know it's just going to bring up emotions that I've tried to put to rest," Mrs. Kaiser said. "All it's going to do is stretch out the hurt."

HEADLINE: U.S. BUDGET DEFICIT SEEN RISING FAST 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4 

 BODY:
The federal deficit is growing much more quickly than expected, even before Congress takes up President Bush's tax-cutting proposals and without factoring in the costs of a war in Iraq, Congressional analysts have concluded.
 Analysts for the Republican-controlled House Budget Committee have raised their estimates of this year's budget shortfall by about $30 billion, some 15 percent beyond the forecast that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issued only five weeks ago. 
 The budget office itself has reached conclusions similar to the committee's, House Republicans say, and is expected to reflect them in its regularly scheduled reassessment of the budget outlook to be issued this Friday.
The deterioration appears to stem from the continued weakness of the economy and the stock market, and those problems could remain for a while: many economists predict anemic growth for at least the first half of 2003. 
The new projections mean that the government's 2003 shortfall could soar to $400 billion if Mr. Bush's tax cuts are approved and if war costs this year run into the tens of billions of dollars.
They also mean that Mr. Bush will face new pressure either to scale back his proposals for cutting taxes by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, or to rein in favored programs like a military buildup, domestic security and prescription drugs for the elderly.
The White House has already estimated that the budget deficit this year will hit a record $304 billion, a calculation that includes the effect of the administration's tax-cutting proposals, though not the costs of a war with Iraq.
But Congressional analysts say the outlook has grown considerably worse in the last few months. From October through January, the first four months of the current fiscal year, tax revenue plunged, and the deficit ballooned to $94 billion. 
By contrast, the government ran a surplus of $8 billion in the corresponding period last year. That adds up to a $102 billion deterioration from last year to this, and last year proved to be a bad year in its own right.
Democrats are accusing Mr. Bush daily of being reckless in pushing tax cuts so large and in his lack of concern about running deficits for at least the next decade. But Republican lawmakers contend that the yawning budget gap reflects the weak economy and so actually increases the urgency of stimulating that economy with tax cuts. 
"The tax code is not performing, and it's making a mess out of the budget," said Representative Jim Nussle of Iowa, chairman of the House Budget Committee. "Unless we get the economy growing again, we're going to keep getting these kinds of corrections."
In testimony today before the House Ways and Means Committee, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow reiterated the administration's argument that budget deficits over the next several years posed little danger. The deficits envisioned by the administration, Mr. Snow said as the committee opened hearings on the tax-cut proposals, "are really modest and clearly manageable and will not have any impact on long-term interest rates, which is the real concern."
But some independent analysts say the administration and Congress alike may be overly optimistic. Asked about House analysts' increasing their estimate of this year's deficit by $30 billion, Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said he thought the figure was too small. Beyond the revenue shortfall from October through January, Mr. McKelvey said, tax refunds during February ran about 10.9 percent higher than in February of last year.
Administration officials know they face resistance from Democrats as well as some moderate Senate Republicans to Mr. Bush's "jobs and growth" package of tax cuts. The main fight is over the plan's proposal to eliminate taxes on most stock dividends, a provision that the administration estimates would cost the Treasury about $385 billion over 10 years.
To shore up wavering Republicans and bring at least a handful of Democrats to the White House's side, top administration officials are lobbying lawmakers, organizing businessgroups to lobby on their behalf and barnstorming around the country.
The budget issues are already intensifying a behind-the-scenes battle in Congress about the best way to calculate the cost of tax cuts. Republican lawmakers want at least some projections based on "dynamic scoring," under which tax cuts can be portrayed as partly paying for themselves by stimulating faster economic growth. Democrats generally oppose that effort.
In its report this Friday, the Congressional Budget Office is expected to evaluate the president's tax proposals the traditional way. But in the next week or so the agency, headed by a new Republican director, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, will also provide "dynamic" analyses of parts of Mr. Bush's plan.
Mr. Nussle, chairman of the House Budget Committee, voiced some skepticism on dynamic scoring.
"I'd rather be conservative in my projections," he said, "and be surprised by the positive rather than by the negative."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: TURKEY; 
In Defeat of U.S. Plan, Turks See a Victory for Democracy

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, March 4 

 BODY:
When Turkish lawmakers rejected a resolution last week that would have allowed as many as 62,000 American combat troops to set up a base against Iraq, they did not just complicate the Bush administration's plans for war. 
 In the eyes of many Turks, they ushered in a new era in Turkish democracy. Messier and more unpredictable than what came before it, perhaps, but a system that is proving more open than what most Turks have seen. 
 "People said they wanted a democracy in Turkey, and now they have one," said Cuneyd Zapsu, a senior adviser to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party. "Turkey is a real democracy." 
As the Turkish people continued today to mull over the dramatic vote of last Saturday, in which the Parliament rejected the American military plan by a narrow margin, the idea that something profound had changed in Turkey's politics continued to reverberate here.
There was shock, especially in financial circles, that the Turkish government had gravely miscalculated, spurning its most important ally, the United States, as well as $6 billion in direct aid the country could have used to draw down its dangerously high public debt.
There was a concern, too, that Turkey's inexperienced leaders might have forfeited their best opportunity to influence events in northern Iraq, where the prospect of a Kurdish state represents, for most Turkish leaders, a danger of the first order. 
That sense of disappointment was magnified by the fact Turkey's leaders, after weeks of debate, had endorsed the American plan and predicted its passage. On Saturday evening, they discovered that they had underestimated the number of favorable votes in their own party. 
"It was a real disaster," said Sule Mazuri, a director at ABN Amro Bank in Istanbul. "This showed that they couldn't even do what they wanted to do." 
But in a another sense, some Turks saw in the vote a break with the politics of the past. For 50 years, Turkey's political system has been dominated by tightly controlled political parties, with many of their leaders drawn from the same political class, and by the Turkish military, which has long acted as a primary force in domestic politics. Both were stalwart, and sometimes unquestioning, American allies. 
This time, there was something different. The Turkish people overwhelmingly oppose the American effort to bring Turkey into the war. Turkey's military stayed quiet, and the country's democratically elected Parliament turned America down. In that way, for many Turks, the vote represents a singular moment. 
"The people now are not following what their leaders say," said Neyazi Oktem, a law professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul. "Quite honestly, the concept of democracy has changed in Turkey." 
Twelve years ago, the Turkish people also opposed their country's involvement in the Persian Gulf war. But the government, led by the charismatic President Turgut Ozal, thwarted the popular will and practically destroyed itself in complying with America's request. The foreign minister, the defense minister and the chief of the military resigned. The economy went into a tailspin. 
This time, the American request was met by a raucously democratic response. Recalling the economic problems prompted by the first gulf war, and the divisions in international attitudes, ordinary Turks marched in the streets against the war in numbers that far exceeded those of a decade ago.
Most important, though, was the election in November of Mr. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party. The party brought to power a group of men and women who had flirted with Islamist ideas but who had pledged to work within the boundaries of Turkey's secular state.
In bringing Mr. Erdogan and his followers to power, the Turkish people swept away much of the old political establishment and opened the door to a new generation of elected leaders, many of them political novices from the Turkish heartland of Anatolia.
That proved crucial as the debate over the American bases ground on. The Turkish people gathered and demonstrated and denounced the prospect of their country becoming involved in a war. The new parliamentary deputies seemed to listen. 
"This Parliament, particularly the ruling party, is filled with ordinary people, like the ordinary people you would run into on the streets," said Kaya Guvenc, who helped an organize a huge antiwar demonstration in Ankara on the day of the vote. "These people are not yet part of the establishment." 
Indeed, as much as anything, it was democracy within the ruling party that killed the plan that would have brought the American troops. Prime Minister Abdullah Gul and Mr. Erdogan endorsed the plan, and they urged their party members to support it.
But in a crucial decision, they decided not to enforce what is known here as a "group decision," in which every legislator is required to vote in lock step with the leadership. Mr. Erdogan said the decision on peace and war was too important to be dictated from above.
Even then, Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Gul thought the resolution would pass. When they took a straw ballot on the morning of the vote, only about 50 legislators, most of them the party's Islamists, voted against it. Hours later, the number of defectors nearly doubled, and the measure went down to defeat.
Mr. Zapsu, the aide to Mr. Erdogan, was busy this week trying to decide whether, and how, the American request might be brought back to Parliament. But he seemed willing to live with Saturday's result.
"For 40 years, the U.S. got whatever it asked for here," he said. "But Tayyip Erdogan is not that way. He really believes in democracy."

Keeping the Streets of Havana Safe From the Billboard Monster

BYLINE:  By FRED BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
The beguiling streets of colonial-era buildings in Havana are almost entirely free of billboards and neon. Groups in the United States have been organizing to keep them that way and to do even more -- if the American embargo against Cuba is lifted and the island faces rapid development. Last week, a delegation led by Jeffrey Horowitz, an architect and the founder of Urbanists International (www.urbanists.org) of Berkeley, Calif., met with officials in Cuba to urge preventing "ugly Western hotels from popping up all over," Mr. Horowitz said. (Top left: Mr. Horowitz, center, in Havana with Representative Sam Farr of California, right, who was part of his group, and Eusebio Leal, left, a Havana city historian.)
 Representatives of Storefront for Art and Architecture, a New York group (212-431-5795), were in Havana at the same time gathering material for a fall exhibition of photographs and models of midcentury modern buildings, "a harder sell to preservationists than the earlier stuff," said Sarah Herda, the organization's director. Zack McKown, of Tsao & McKown Architects in New York, was a member of the delegation. 
 At the same time, Sam Adams Green, director and founder of the Landmarks Foundation in New York (www.landmarksfoundation.org), which preserves sacred sites, is working quietly to save La Reina cemetery, above left, in Cienfuegos. The cemetery's neo-Classical monuments are endangered not by development but by hurricanes and neglect. FRED BERNSTEIN

HEADLINE: China Steps Up Its Output of Metals 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, March 5 

 BODY:
To many Western companies, China is the future, either as a huge potential customer or a looming low-cost competitor. But in the world's metal markets, that future has already arrived, and Noranda, the Canadian mining group, has the bruises to prove it. 
 Noranda, a unit of Brascan, and its partners spent years and 733 million Canadian dollars ($496 million) to build the world's biggest magnesium smelting plant, at Danville, Quebec, and planned to have it go into commercial production around now. Instead, it is being mothballed, and Noranda has written off its 80 percent stake in the plant. 
 Noranda says that the plant cannot be run economically now chiefly because so much magnesium, a lightweight metal used mainly in the electronics, auto and aviation industries, is pouring out of China. From hardly any production a decade ago, China has shot up to become the world's biggest exporter. According to Richard Opatick, director of the International Magnesium Association in Washington, magnesium prices have fallen by half in the last three years, as Noranda's plant was being completed. 
China "is the subject on everyone's mind," said David Humphreys, chief economist with Rio Tinto, the mining giant. "It is very big indeed, and growing bigger by the month." 
And not just on the supply side. Inco, the West's biggest nickel producer, told analysts last month that demand in China for stainless steel, which is made with nickel, expanded so fast last year that the growth alone was equal to more than half of total consumption in the United States or Japan. In the presentation to analysts, much of which was devoted to China's impact, Peter Goudie, Inco's executive vice president for marketing, said, "It is easy to understand why China has become such a dominant influence in nickel and across the full range of metals." 
China's fast-growing economy is one of the world's few bright spots for some industrial commodities that China imports. But for others, the combination of government subsidies, cheap credit, cheap electricity and lax environmental controls has fueled huge increases in production, far in excess of domestic demand. 
"The Chinese business model is based on creating a critical mass and then finding the market," said Simon Hunt, a British consultant who specializes in China and spends several months a year there. According to Mr. Humphreys at Rio Tinto, "Rapid growth of China's exports has hit prices and put huge pressure on producers elsewhere in the world." 
China is becoming the most important actor in the market for one metal after another. 
Copper is one example. Bloomsbury Minerals Economics, a London consulting firm, estimates that China's use of refined copper grew 21 percent in 2001 and 13 percent last year, moving it ahead of the United States as the world's biggest consumer.
Bloomsbury forecasts a further 10 percent rise in 2003, reflecting the rapid expansion of China's electric power grid and rapidly growing demand for domestic appliances. By contrast, copper consumption in the United States is expected to inch up by just 1.4 percent. 
China also accounted for two-thirds of the increase in global demand for nickel in 2002. Its purchases of alumina, the raw material used for aluminum, have helped almost double world prices in the last year. 
China is now the world's second-biggest importer of iron ore and of lead, and has become the top producer of steel, aluminum and tungsten. Its exports of tin, coal and a number of industrial minerals are rising fast. 
These trends generate both excitement and worry among metals executives in the West. Copper producers, for example, are delighted, because little high-grade ore has been discovered in China and the country must import refined metal to meet its needs -- a rare source of strength in a largely depressed industry. Bloomsbury calculates that Chinese imports have surged by an average of 37 percent a year since 1999, and are probably still growing at that pace.
"There is certainly no sign of a reversal just yet, with booming domestic consumer spending rather than exports driving the market," the consulting company reported in February. "China, yet again, appears to be the savior of the copper market." 
But China sends shivers through other markets. The United States and the European Union have moved to impose duties on Chinese magnesium, saying that China is dumping the metal on the market at prices below the cost of production. In addition to the Noranda plant in Quebec, the slump in prices has recently forced the closings of the last two primary magnesium producers in Europe, one in France and one in Norway. 
Mr. Humphreys of Rio Tinto said that aluminum was "potentially another magnesium situation." China has gone from importing 132,000 tons of aluminum in 2001 to exporting about 220,000 tons last year. China has a substantial advantage, according to Carmine Nappi, director of industry analysis at Alcan, a major producer based in Montreal. "They can build a smelter in less time than us, and the cost is half that in the Western world," Mr. Nappi said. 
Mr. Nappi, however, expects that surge in Chinese exports to be short-lived. The sharp rise in world alumina prices over the last year is likely to encourage Chinese producers to shut down old, inefficient plants and limit their output to domestic needs, which are expanding because of a boom in construction, in car production and in erection of power lines, he said. 
Doing business with China can be a headache for Western producers because of uncertainties about government policies and the legal system there. Peter Hollands, head of research at Bloomsbury Minerals, said that while Western producers and buyers of metals commonly sign long-term contracts, most business with China is conducted on spot markets through trading companies. 
Still, Western analysts said that China's recent entry into the World Trade Organization and the country's growing contacts with foreign companies have helped promote mutual understanding. 
"You've seen a wholesale change in attitude, both in the state-owned companies and the private sector," Mr. Hunt, the consultant, said of China. 
The Chinese government is taking steps to modernize the industry and its practices. Kaihui Yang, a University of Toronto research geologist, said in an e-mail interview from Yunnan in southwest China that more than 150,000 small mines in the country have been closed for environmental or safety reasons since 1998. According to Dr. Yang, subsidies for small or unprofitable mines and processing plants have been "largely removed." 
A new mining law, due to take effect this month, "will be more favorable for foreign investments," Dr. Yang said. 
According to Mr. Humphreys, the Chinese government "has become increasingly aware that uncontrolled selling has damaged its own interests, suppressing world prices and encouraging the over-rapid depletion of its domestic resources." 
China's shifting role in the zinc market may offer lessons for other metals. A burst of zinc shipments from China severely disrupted world markets in the late 1990's and 2000. But, according to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group in London, mine closings since then have resulted in the first drop in Chinese refined zinc output in almost two decades. Last year, China became one of the biggest customers for Western zinc producers.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Up as a Couple of Earnings Reports Stir Optimism

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday for the first time since Friday, and more than two-thirds of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced on investor optimism that profit growth may pick up.
 Kohl's, the fastest-growing United States department store chain, rallied after it said earnings had jumped. Pall, which makes filters used by biotechnology companies and chip makers, had the biggest gain in the S.& P. after reporting better-than-forecast results. 
 "Earnings continue to improve," said Lawrence Weissman, a money manager at Citigroup Asset Management, which oversees about $480 billion. "That should stabilize the market." He said the prospect of war with Iraq might limit stocks' gains. 
The S.& P. 500 rose 7.86 points, or 1 percent, to 829.85. Financial and health care stocks contributed more than half the advance. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 70.73 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,775.60. The Nasdaq composite index added 6.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,314.40.
Seven stocks rose for every six that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, while advancing and declining shares were about even on the Nasdaq. About 1.31 billion shares traded on the Big Board, in line with the three-month daily average.
"Nobody wants to commit until we get a resolution in Iraq," said Edmund Cowart, who helps manage $6 billion at Eagle Asset Management in St. Petersburg, Fla.
One of the chief weapons inspectors for the United Nations, Hans Blix, said yesterday that Iraq was taking steps to disarm and that he would welcome more time for monitors to do their work.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said later that Iraq continued to build and hide the same type of missiles that it was destroying to comply with a United Nations mandate. He also said that Iraq was moving other banned arms to keep them from inspectors.
France, Germany and Russia called for peaceful disarmament of Iraq and said they would not support a new United Nations resolution backed by the United States authorizing force.
George Soros, the financier, who was speaking at a meeting in Washington, said: "If the war does come to an end rather quickly, there will be some kind of upward move in the markets, but I think it will be rather short-lived because other problems, both political and economic, would surface."
Kohl's surged $3.29, to $49.55. Earnings increased 19 percent last quarter. The company earned 81 cents a share, a penny better than analysts had forecast.
Pall rallied $2.53, to $18.45. Profit rose 70 percent, to 26 cents a share, excluding restructuring and some other costs, as sales rose from a year earlier. On that basis, analysts had forecast 20 cents.
Financial and health care shares contributed the most to the S.& P. 500's gain. Citigroup gained 80 cents, to $33.17, and Pfizer added 55 cents, to $29.19.
Coca-Cola and PepsiCo declined after the Pepsi Bottling Group cut its profit forecast for the first quarter. Costco Wholesale declined as its profit was hurt by the increasing cost of worker claims for on-the-job injuries.
Coca-Cola slipped 82 cents, to $37.55. PepsiCo, Coca-Cola's smaller rival, shed 75 cents, to $37.30. Pepsi Bottling said earnings would trail estimates because winter storms in the Northeast reduced sales. Shares slid $3.99, to $18.20.

Treasury Prices Gain
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices were higher yesterday as investors preoccupied with developments in Iraq also took a look at soft spots in fresh economic data.
The benchmark 10-year note rose 5/32 , to a price of 102 1/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.63 percent from 3.65 percent on Tuesday.
The 30-year bond climbed 3/32 , to 111 2/32 . Its yield dropped to 4.66 percent from 4.67 percent.

Aspirations Bump Into Practicalities at Ground Zero

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap 

 BODY:
FROM the northwest corner of the World Trade Center site, a tapering spire reaches higher into the sky than the twin towers did. More than a symbol, it is a functioning antenna, a beacon of communication.
 A memorial greensward stretches to the south, leaving the towers' footprints untouched. Overlooking it is a cultural institution. 
 Wrapped around the greensward are tall office buildings with more floor area among them than the twin towers had. Their polygonal facades form a wedge across a restored Fulton Street. A new St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church stands south of Liberty Street, alongside a large housing development.
The plan, called Memorial Plaza, was drawn up by Beyer Blinder Belle and unveiled last July, with five others, to considerable derision. Within a month, these concepts were conspicuously discarded by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Or:
The plan, called Memory Foundations, was drawn up by Studio Daniel Libeskind and Gary Hack and selected as the winning design last week by the development corporation and the authority, to considerable acclaim.
To be sure, there are important differences between the plans. Foremost among them is the reborn intersection of Fulton and Greenwich Streets, an amorphous space in Memorial Plaza but a vibrant crossroads in Memory Foundations, with a train station, a museum, a performing arts center and an office tower.
"The closer you study the Libeskind plan, the differences become striking," said Matthew Higgins, vice president for communications at the development corporation.
Yet the similarities are striking, too. And they are likely to grow more so, as distinctive edges are shaved off the winning plan.
And that gets back to the limits imposed by the program, which is meant to accommodate the long-term lease held by Silverstein Properties and a general desire to preserve as sacrosanct the acreage on which the towers stood.
"Site, climate and program are pretty fundamental influences on any architect," said John Belle of Beyer Blinder Belle. "What can one expect to have changed other than idiosyncratic form?"
As it happens, both Mr. Belle and Mr. Hack once worked together in the officeof Victor Gruen, an important planner in the 50's and 60's. Mr. Hack, now dean of the Graduate School of Fine Arts at the University of Pennsylvania, is the urban planner on the Libeskind team.
"The logic is, if you want an open space with plenty of sun, it has to be on the south side of the 16 acres," Mr. Hack said. "You want to put the tall buildings on the north side and you want all the buildings adjacent to the built-up portion of Church Street."
The Libeskind proposal to depress the memorial site 70 feet, to the base of the trade center foundations, has already been whittled to 30 feet. There were concerns that the retaining walls could not indefinitely withstand the force exerted against them by the Hudson River without the kind of lateral bracing that the trade center's basement floors once provided.
The prospect of a 70-foot-deep memorial has also been rendered moot by an electrical substation on the south end of the site that has been built to provide power to PATH trains. It avoids the south tower footprint, said Michael A. Petralia, chief of public and government affairs at the Port Authority, and would sit beneath the floor of a 30-foot memorial site.
Mr. Hack said the quality of the memorial setting would be improved by the change. "Having it more accessible to the street was more desirable," he said. "Having less shadow in it was more desirable."
ANOTHER feature of the Libeskind plan that is almost sure to change is the 1,776-foot tower, though the architect said last week that he "would not give up" that height. Besides the symbolic value, 1,776 feet would be almost exactly the altitude of the broadcast mast on the north tower of the trade center.
But will the broadcasters come? "We would love to be on that tower," said Edward Grebow, president of the Metropolitan Television Alliance, composed of 11 New York area stations. "The problem is the timing."
The broadcasters are planning a 2,000-foot tower, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, in Bayonne, N.J. They could be persuaded to change their plans, Mr. Grebow said, if the city allowed them to construct an interim tower on Governors Island. That tower would be dismantled when the trade center site was ready.
A spokeswoman for the Economic Development Corporation said city officials were trying to find a way to keep the broadcasters in New York. But Mr. Grebow said the alliance had not received a response to the Governors Island request, which it made in October.
"We're going to build a 2,000-foot tower in Bayonne," Mr. Grebow said. "That will dwarf the Libeskind tower at the trade center, which, believe us, is not what we want but where we are being forced to go."

HEADLINE: Slovakia to Investigate Charges Gypsy Women Were Sterilized 

BYLINE:  By PETER S. GREEN 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, March 5 

 BODY:
Slovakia's Interior Ministry has announced that it will send a special team of investigators, headed by a woman, to look into claims that Gypsy women in eastern Slovakia have been sterilized against their will.
 In January, two nongovernmental organizations issued a report alleging that at least 110 Gypsy women had been sterilized without their consent since the fall of Communism in 1989. Local doctors and regional officials denied that the practice was continuing, and newspaper columns and television newscasts attacked the authors of the report, the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights and the Center for Civil and Human Rights, based in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 
 "Given the sensitivity of the issue, the headquarters of the team was established in Zilina, Central Slovakia and it will be headed by a woman," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Boris Azaltovic, told Slovak reporters.
An initial investigation by the Health Ministry reported that the allegations appeared unfounded, but the new announcement suggests the government is worried that the treatment of its large Gyspy minority -- an estimated 10 percent of Slovakia's 5.4 million people are Gypsies -- could become a bone of contention in final talks before Slovakia joins the European Union next year.
Sterilizing Gypsies was government policy during Slovakia's World War II collaboration with Nazi Germany. During the 42 years of Communist rule, the authorities paid Gypsy women sums far above annual salary expectations to be sterilized.
Police are now investigating cases of sterilization of Gypsy women since 1999 for evidence that alleged forced sterilizations could constitute a crime.
The charges were brought by a government advocate for minority rights, Jana Kviecinska, and two Gypsy women.
Many Gypsy women contend that they were coerced into signing consent forms or even blank sheets of paper while in the hospital to deliver babies. Some say they did not know what they were signing. Others are illiterate and could not have read the papers to which their signatures are affixed.
In general, Slovakia's Gypsies are among the poorest people in a country that is still struggling economically after the collapse of Communism, and they are often the object of verbal abuse and other discrimination. Many Gypsies live in shantytowns on the outskirts of Slovak cities.
Often, Gypsy women have half a dozen children by their late 20's.
Contributing to the controversy over the sterilization allegations is a fear fueled by tabloid speculation and populist politicians that the high birth rate of the mainly darker-skinned Gypsies will leave ethnic Slovaks outnumbered by 2060.
Before today's promise of a government inquiry, Slovakia's deputy prime minister for minority rights, Pal Csaky, had threatened to file charges against the organizations that first reported the sterilization allegations. If the allegations were false, he said, they would be prosecuted for spreading false rumors and damaging the country's good name. If they were true, he said, the authors would be prosecuted for not taking their evidence directly to the police.

HEADLINE: Report by Fed Describes a Subdued Economy 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5 

 BODY:
The economy was stuck in low gear in late January and much of February, weighed down by worries over the economy and fears of war, the Federal Reserve said today.
 According to the Fed's so-called beige book, an anecdotal summary of economic conditions around the country, "reports from the 12 Federal Reserve districts generally suggested that growth in economic activity remained subdued in January and February." 
 It continued, "Many reports indicated that geopolitical and economic uncertainties were constraining consumer and business spending and tempering near-term expectations." The Fed, the nation's central bank, has often used phrases like "geopolitical uncertainties" to refer to the possibility of a war with Iraq. 
The report also said consumer spending was weak in recent weeks, and businesses were wary of adding permanent workers to their payrolls. Manufacturing was described as "weak or lackluster," but in a positive note, the Fed said 6 of the 12 regions reported "some degree" of improvement.
In a separate report today, the Institute for Supply Management said that the services sector slowed its pace of growth last month and that the number of service jobs fell.
From entertainment to banking, the services sector, which accounts for most of the economy, expanded for the 13th consecutive month in February.
The index slipped to 53.9 from 54.5 in January, still comfortably above the 50 level that distinguishes growth from contraction. Economists had expected a reading of 53.4.
A powerful blizzard in February left mounds of snow in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions and slowed traffic for many services-related companies. Business is also being affected by the surge in oil prices to their highest in 12 years, which has left consumers with less discretionary income.
Service jobs fell in February after increasing in January. The institute's employment index fell back under the 50 level, to49.0 from 50.3 in January.
The Fed's report was prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, for use at the March 18 rate-setting meeting. It was based on information gathered before Feb. 24.
Few expect that the Fed's March 18 meeting will bring a lowering of short-term interest rates, currently at their lowest in more than four decades. But the financial markets have not dismissed the possibility that the central bank could cut rates later in the year if the economy remains sluggish.
One of the Fed's worries is the slack job market, and there were signs of that in the report. "Most districts reported that businesses were still very cautious about hiring permanent workers," it said, "although Cleveland and Atlanta noted a pickup in the use of overtime and part-time employees."
On Friday, the Labor Department is to release the employment report for February, giving the Fed and the financial markets a more up-to-date reading on the job market.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "Economy Remained Sluggish in January and Early February"A roundup of regional economic conditions in recent months for the Federal Reserve's 12 districts, according to the beige book report issued by the Fed yesterday. Minneapolis -- The economy was mixed. Agriculture, home building and mining were strong, while consumer spending fell. San Francisco -- Sluggish growth was reported in much of the region. Consumers were cautious about spending on autos and travel. (Includes Alaska and Hawaii) Chicago -- Business conditions were soft. Companies were restrained in their capital spending and hiring. St. Louis -- In manufacturing, reports of weak sales, closings and cutbacks continued. Auto sales slowed, while retail sales were flat. Kansas City, Mo. -- The economy showed signs of strengthening. Retailers had slight gains and manufacturing improved. Home sales were strong. Dallas -- The economy was stagnant, with lackluster manufacturing, weak retail sales, minimal hiring and rising energy costs. Cleveland -- Labor markets deteriorated since the last report. There was little to suggest conditions would change in the near future. Boston -- There were few signs of improvement. Manufacturers and software companies reported weak demand. New York -- The economy generally softened. The housing market regained momentum. The labor market was weak. Philadelphia -- Commerce was steady. Factory orders increased. Businesses did not foresee stronger growth. Richmond, Va. -- Modest growth was reported, with improvement in services and manufacturing offset by a weak retail sector. Atlanta -- The economy remained slow, with sluggish retail sales and weak manufacturing outside of the military and auto industries.

HEADLINE: A Withdrawn Aid Offer Leaves Yakima Bruised 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: YAKIMA, Wash. 

 BODY:
When the apple trees have been picked clean and only leftover twine flutters from the skeletal hops trellises, about 55 percent of the Yakima Valley's 31,000 seasonal farm workers scramble to find odd jobs.
 Thousands of other poor Hispanics and Indians work at low-paying jobs at farms and tortilla factories and in the warehouses that distribute the valley's bounty. 
 So when the Northwest Area Foundation said two years ago that it was considering investing $15 million to reduce poverty here -- and that it wanted residents, not politicians or businessmen, to decide how to spend the money -- it beamed a rare ray of hope into an area where more than 20 percent of residents live in poverty.
Normally divided by ethnicity and economics, people with little experience in community leadership united and took time from their families and their jobs to attend a series of planning meetings.
Then, last August, the foundation suddenly rescinded its offer, saying residents failed to bridge their differences and develop a plan quickly enough. 
"What they did was an insult, but even worse, it destroyed our hope," said David Silva, a labor and community organizer the foundation hired as a consultant. "By abandoning us, they are telling the world we are a lost cause. It's like a curse."
"The foundation raised our hopes and made a lot of promises orally," said Julio Romero, an unemployed farm and factory worker, who attributes his joblessness to all the time he spent on meetings intended to devise a regional antipoverty plan to present to the foundation.
Mr. Romero was so outraged that he has filed a lawsuit against the foundation, seeking $1.25 million he and others say the foundation promised the community so that it can finish the plan it was developing.
Karl Stauber, president of the foundation, which is seeking dismissal of the suit, said the foundation's staff in Yakima reported in June that it would take the community three to five years to overcome its traditional divisions and produce a plan.
The Yakima project was part of a new strategy by the foundation. It seeks to spend $150 million to finance grass-roots plans to reduce poverty in 16 communities in the eight states it serves: Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa.
The $425 million foundation, which was founded by the heirs of railroad baron James J. Hill, has financed such plans in Oregon and South Dakota, in communities that are smaller and more homogenous. 
Mr. Stauber said that the foundation had set a rough goal of two years for the planning process in each community, though residents here say they were unaware of that.
"We came to the conclusion that our approach, which is inclusive and regional, would not work in that divided place," Mr. Stauber said of Yakima, in south-central Washington.
Several residents said the problem was that the foundation's approach was poorly considered and changes in its staff impeded the process, rather than helped it.
"You aren't going to resolve these kinds of issues among disparate groups who have equally little power by simply putting them all in the same room and asking them to work together," said Sister Kathleen Ross, dean of Heritage College, in the mid-county town of Toppenish. "You need community leaders to help pull them together, but the foundation was determined not to involve those leaders."
Between January 2001, when the foundation declared it was considering Yakima for its largesse, and August, when it abandoned the project, leadership of its team here changed three times for various reasons. The last team leader spent only a few weeks here, residents said. The changes led to long hiatuses in planning and forced the community to retrace its progress for each new leader. 
"Some of the little committees that had formed were getting a lot done," Dr. Ross said. "They had staff turnover and so there wasn't really anyone here to notice that and tell the people in Minnesota."
Howard D. Valandra, who was the second team leader here and is now involved in another foundation project, said he was surprised by the decision to pull out.
"I thought it was a slam-dunk," he said. "This is a group of people who really committed themselves."
No one disputes that there are ethnic, geographic and economic divisions here. The upper valley is home to the county's largely white business community. The so-called middle valley is dominated by the Yakama Nation, the largest landowner in Yakima County. 
South of the reservation, the lower valley is centered around Sunnyside, whose residents include many of the more than 79,000 Hispanics who pick apples, harvest hops and spearmint and tend to cattle. 
The foundation's staff spent about 10 months meeting individually with community residents. It then invited 700 of them to a communitywide meeting to identify issues and potential strategies to address them, expecting perhaps 200 to show. The foundation's team was shocked when 400 attended.
Two more large meetings were held, and seven committees were formed to create plans to address education, job creation and other areas of concern, as well as how to allocate the money to those efforts.
The committee members represented the community. For instance, Mr. Romero was co-chairman of the finance committee with Aurolyn Stwyer-Watlamet, a business consultant and member of the Warm Springs tribe who lives on the reservation. Enough committee members spoke Spanish to require a translator, and some members drove 30 and 40 miles to attend meetings.
But Mr. Stauber insisted that divisions hurt the project. White business leaders, he said, declined to merge a community revitalization effort they were planning for the northern end of the county with the foundation's efforts. He said the foundation had also failed to get an official blessing from the Yakama Nation.
And he said the foundation had made a mistake in picking Mr. Silva as its main liaison with Hispanics. Mr. Stauber said Mr. Silva, an activist who works with the valley's recent immigrants, had few ties to its more established second- and third-generation families. 
Indian community leaders said official approval from the Yakama tribe was unnecessary. "They held one of their big meetings at the Yakama cultural heritage center," said Carrie Schuster, a Yakama tribal elder who took part in the foundation's efforts. "There were 400-plus people there, a good many of them Native American. It is not as if there was a lack of awareness of the foundation and its activities among the tribal leadership."
And David McFadden, president of the Yakima County Development Association, an economic development organization, and a participant in the foundation's efforts, said that the revitalization plan for the northern end of the county was already well under way when the foundation proposed integrating it into its project.
In his lawsuit, Mr. Romero contends that residents spent more than 10,000 hours attending more than 50 meetings, taking time off from work, cobbling together child care and scraping up enough money to pay for gas to travel to and from meetings. The foundation provided some child care and a van, but Mr. Romero and others said those efforts were not enough.
"Many people in this community work two jobs to survive or work full-time and go to school, and the foundation was asking us not only to fit all these meetings into that kind of schedule but to drive 30 or 40 miles to get there," Ms. Stwyer-Watlamet said. "I had to pick up my 7-year-old son and take him along with me. It was an inconvenience for a lot of people and turned out to be a waste of our time."
Ms. Schuster said she felt the foundation had violated its mission to help communities reduce poverty. "They can't claim to be reducing poverty in the region and ignore us," she said. "Who is going to hold them accountable, that's what I want to know."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: CATHOLICS; 
Conservative Catholics' Wrenching Debate Over Whether to Back President or Pope

BYLINE:  By LAURIE GOODSTEIN 

DATELINE: McLEAN, Va., March 5 

 BODY:
As Ash Wednesday dawned gray and misty over St. John's Parish, 12 Roman Catholics set off after the 6:30 a.m. Mass, as they do every weekday, for coffee, fellowship and argument at a nearby Starbucks. 
 No scones or pastries today, they told the servers at the counter. Pope John Paul II asked all Catholics to fast and pray on Ash Wednesday for peace, especially in Iraq. The ash still dark on their foreheads, the parishioners offered a prayer before downing their caffe lattes. 
 On the prospects of war with Iraq, almost all of them find themselves in a bind: as conservative Catholics, they follow the pope, but as conservative Americans, they support the president. They, like many other religious Americans, are more deeply indecisive and ambivalent than their religious leaders appear to be.
The pope has repeatedly appealed to world leaders to avoid a war, and today a papal envoy, Cardinal Pio Laghi, carried the message directly to President Bush. Last week, Catholic bishops in the United States issued their third antiwar declaration of the last four months.
"Read the pope's last statement," said Brian J. Doherty, 44, a union official and outspoken antiwar voice at the session. "Our Holy Father said we are on our way to giving in to the logic of war. He warned us about falling into this trap."
Charles R. McCarthy, a corporate lawyer who is 64, quipped, "We may go to war with the Vatican, who knows." He added somberly, "I am for this war, but I'll tell you, we are on shaky ground ecclesiastically."
Religious leaders of nearly every denomination and faith have condemned an American attack on Iraq. Only the Southern Baptist Convention and some evangelical and Pentecostal leaders have rallied behind the president. Jewish leaders are deeply split. 
In religious journals, seminaries and informal discussions like this coffee after Mass, the prospect of a pre-emptive attack on Iraq has set off an intense debate among people of faith over whether such a war would qualify as a "just war" in Christian teaching.
"The rest of the world sees us as a big bully," said Lucas Gallegos, 80, a retired pastry chef who travels frequently to Europe to teach his craft. "But if we can come out of this and show the world that we didn't go in there to conquer and take the spoils, but to bring about peace, then we will show that it was a just war."
The regulars at the coffee circle here range in age from 32 to 84; most are men, and while many work as lobbyists or government staff members across the Potomac River in Washington, there are also two union officials, a retired dermatologist and his daughter, a teacher. They are members and daily communicants in a conservative parish in the conservative diocese of Arlington, one of only two Catholic dioceses in the United States that still bans altar girls. 
Polls have shown that while many American Catholics revere the pope, they disregard church teaching on issues like birth control and the death penalty.
The principles of a "just war" were first developed by St. Augustine in the fifth century and expanded upon by St. Thomas Aquinas in the 13th. For a war to be considered just, it must meet the following criteria: have a just cause, meaning that it confronts a danger beyond question; be declared by a legitimate authority acting on behalf of the people; be driven by the right intention, not ulterior economic or other motives; be the last resort; be proportional, so that the harm inflicted does not outweigh the good achieved; and have a reasonable chance of success.
Today and Tuesday after dawn Mass, St. John's parishioners settled into velveteen club chairs at Starbucks and whittled down the just war principles until the point of contention was reduced to whether an attack on Iraq was a pre-emptive offense or defensive.
Several argued that in an age of biological warfare and nuclear weapons, the traditional understanding of just war theory had grown obsolete and was due for revision. 
"You have already seen the damage that can be inflicted, and that was 9-11, so what more convincing do you need?" William C. Doherty Jr., Brian Doherty's father, who is 76 and retired from working in the labor movement said at the Tuesday session.
Mr. McCarthy, the lawyer, said, "Kind of Crusade-like, isn't it?" 
On Tuesday morning, the group was joined by their pastor, the Rev. Edward C. Hathaway, who has been in the parish for three years. His father was a Navy pilot and his two older brothers went to the Air Force Academy, he said, "So maybe I'm more trusting" when the commander in chief says war is necessary. 
He asked questions and floated the notion that war could be seen not as a pre-emptive strike, but a continuation of the Persian Gulf war, which was never completed because Saddam Hussein failed to disarm. 
He told the group that the pope is not a pacifist, but said he was not surprised at the pontiff's interventions to prevent war.
"You're never going to hear the Holy Father say, go to war. You can wait forever to hear that," Father Hathaway said. 
At that, Bill, 37, a government relations specialist who would not give his surname for fear of his employer's disapproval, said, "I expect the Holy Father to pray for peace, and the U.S. Marines to bring it about."
Last Sunday, the homily at St. John's was delivered by the Rev. Cosmas R. K'Otienoh, a Kenyan priest serving as a pastor in residence. He lost friends in the bombing of the United States embassy in Nairobi and moved to the Washington area only to experience the terror of Sept. 11 from a Metro train. 
However, he gently suggested that although the American goal of ridding the world of a tyrant is noble, it may not justify the risk of harming Iraqi civilians, of whom "50 percent are 15 years and younger." 
Afterward, Father K'Otienoh said, about half the parishioners who responded thanked him, but the other half said he was misguided. 
He said in an interview that he understood the mixed reception.
"On the one hand they take the teachings of the Holy Father very seriously, and on the other hand, there is this actual threat, particularly after Sept. 11, that has put people on edge, and I can understand those fears," Father K'Otienoh said. "It's a tall order for many Catholics to say, let's listen to the Holy Father."

HEADLINE: The Bold Struggle For China's Belly 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
Inside a flashy new Carrefour supermarket, a group of sales clerks are evoking the sounds, if not the sights and smells, of China's traditional open-air food markets, hawking meat and fish to passing customers.
 "Come on. Take a look!" a clerk in a neat blue-and-white apron shouts, offering squid and prawn. "The price is even lower today." 
 But the giant supermarkets that are slowly coming to dominate the biggest cities in China are hardly traditional. Much of the meat and fish at Carrefour, a giant retailer based in Paris, is displayed in glass cases or wrapped in plastic. To attract shoppers last week, the store piped Western pop music into the streets and hired a troupe of dancers to perform in slinky golden dresses. 
The losers in this modernization push are the city's old "wet markets" -- bustling, chaotic food bazaars that truck in fresh vegetables and live animals every morning for people to buy and cook later in the day.
As a growing number of urban dwellers with refrigerators and microwaves flock to giant modern supermarkets, experts see the beginnings of what could be a food revolution in China. With supermarkets come new food systems, supply chains, food safety regulations and national brands, like Long Feng, a line of frozen foods.
Ultimately, the rise of a modern food distribution system is changing the Chinese diet, as people consume more processed foods and products like milk that the new food industry is delivering to store shelves.
"There's a big impact on farmers and consumers," said Thomas Reardon, a professor at Michigan State University who has studied the growth of supermarkets in China. "This will reshape the whole food economy."
Much of China still buys its daily food supplies at wet markets like the Yuping market in the Changning district of Shanghai, not far from the Carrefour market. There one day last week, Ke Guo Bin, a 32-year-old butcher, proudly displayed his wares: two freshly chopped pig's ears, a pig's tongue, three snouts, one tail and an assortment of other tender cuts from the hog.
"This is all very fresh," Mr. Ke said, sharpening the blade of his knife to butcher-to-order for customers who have just stopped by his booth. "That's why people come here."
The traditional markets retain their appeal for the many Chinese who still prefer fresh foods like carrots, eggplant, celery, jellyfish, squid and the live turtles, eels, frogs, chickens, ducks and pigeons over packaged or frozen goods. 
But not many expect markets like Yuping to survive for long in the face of stores like Carrefour or the giant Hymart supermarket at the base of a sports stadium a few blocks west of Mr. Ke's stall. Stadiumlike itself, the Hymart has 18 checkout lanes, dozens of lockers for customers to store shopping bags and aisles the length of a football field.
"The wet markets in the cities are in decline," said Scott Sindler, who works for the United States Agriculture Department office in Shanghai. "What you're seeing is a real explosion in the retail sector, like what we have in the U.S."
Carrefour, Wal-Mart and the Lotus chain of supermarkets, the last owned by a Thai conglomerate, Charoen Pokphand Foods, are expanding rapidly in urban China. Altogether, there are already over 1,000 supermarkets in Shanghai, a metropolitan area of 13 million, and young people and an emerging Chinese middle class are streaming to their aisles and aisles of candy, boxed goods, instant noodles, milk and imported products like Coca-Cola and Danone yogurt. 
Visits to three big supermarkets in Shanghai suggest that older people, too, find them appealing. He Wenying, 55, shops at the Carrefour here for the same reason that Americans and other Westerners frequent shopping malls and supermarkets -- convenience. "I come here more than 10 times a month," she says, holding the hand of her grandson, who stared at a package of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum near the bottom of her cart. "You can get everything here. And you can do all your shopping at once."
Others think that at least a few traditional markets will survive for some time, because the supermarkets rarely carry live fish and animals. Local people like to see the crayfish swimming in tubs of water, the crabs snapping their claws and the turtles ducking in and out of their shells, a sign that dinner could not be any fresher.
And in a country where it is common in restaurants for a waiter to stop by the table with a live, flopping fish minutes before it goes into the skillet, there are many people who will not easily give up the chance to hand-select the soon-to-be slaughtered or fried.
Customers also like to bargain, even over already low prices like those at Yuping, where well-fed chickens go for about $3 a head and a small pigeon can be yours for just $1.75. You can't beat that at Wal-Mart.
One thing that could accelerate the demise of wet markets is anxiety over food safety. A series of widely publicized food-poisoning outbreaks in China in recent years has hurt neighborhood markets because of the perception that they are unclean.
Vendors at Yuping, most from the countryside, are annoyed at the suggestion that they are to blame. "People have the perception that the big supermarket chains are managed by the government and the food is safer, but it's the same meat -- the very same meat," said Sun Yu Jun, a 23-year-old butcher at Yuping. "We are very clean."
The wet markets are supposed to abide by government sanitary standards, and one evening last week, men could be seen scrubbing and hosing down their booths.
But nearby, two other men were spitting in the vicinity of fresh meat, which often hangs unprotected in the open-air markets. Some meat hangs exposed in supermarkets, too, but a large share of supermarket meat is packaged and refrigerated.
In conversations at Yuping last week, some vendors said they expected to make the transition to working in supermarkets. Others said that they were not prepared to leave behind a world of fresh-bludgeoned fish, and they worried about no longer being able to let the entire family hang out in the butcher's booth during the day -- quite a common habit. 
"The supermarkets are selling everything, and eventually they'll take over places like this," said Mr. Ke, the butcher, taking a drag from a cigarette.
And what will he do if that happens? 
His answer came quickly and acidly. "I'll just go back home and plow the land again," Mr. Ke said.

HEADLINE: YACHT RACING; 
Team New Zealand Given Financial Aid

BYLINE:  By WARREN ST. JOHN

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand, Thursday, March 6 

 BODY:
The New Zealand government announced today that it had given $3 million to Team New Zealand to help it retain crew members who might be approached by sailing rivals in the coming weeks.
 On Sunday, Team New Zealand lost the America's Cup to the Swiss team Alinghi, 5-0. 
 After Team New Zealand won the Cup in 2000, big-money syndicates poached 30 of its members, including its skipper, Russell Coutts, and its tactician, Brad Butterworth. Coutts and Butterworth signed with Alinghi and led its sweep of Team New Zealand. Trevor Mallard, New Zealand's minister of the America's Cup, said the money from the government would allow the team to re-sign crew members. 
"I think there is a real danger that the key personnel could be signed if they don't move quickly," he said. "We have gained so much from Team New Zealand that it would be a tragedy if the team was split up."
Some politicians in New Zealand have questioned the use of public money to support an America's Cup team. Mallard argued that the government's investment in the team made sense because the syndicate acted as a public relations tool to promote tourism and investment in New Zealand.
"It's an economic decision," he said, "not one based on romance."
After losing over the weekend to the Swiss, the Kiwi team has begun an inquest of sorts into what went wrong with its Cup defense. Despite a series of radical design innovations on its yacht, Team New Zealand sustained numerous breakdowns and managed to finish only three of the five races.
"We're in an ongoing process of looking at all aspects of the design, to get all the lessons to be got out of this campaign," said Tom Schnackenberg, the head of the team. "A lot of people have been concerned about various aspects of the campaign, but we'll not be making those findings public because we are an ongoing campaign."
Schnackenberg said his team was devastated by the loss but had no regrets about its radical yacht.
"I can say that there is a common thread through the campaign in that we were gung-ho in all aspects of the design," he said. "We pushed the design envelope in every single area. Another thing that comes through is that there's no problem with the workmanship."
Schnackenberg dismissed speculation that his yachts had collided in practice before the regatta, causing damage that ultimately led to the breakdowns during the races.
"There were no collisions between the boats," he said. "We just pushed the yachts harder than we had and we fell short in a few areas."
Dean Barker, the skipper of Team New Zealand, said that his team was looking at the viability of a challenge for the next Cup, which will take place in Europe, probably in 2007.
"This loss has only made us hungrier to succeed," he said. "The unconditional support we've had since Race 5 has shown me just how much unfinished business we've got with this Cup."

HEADLINE: For PC Buying, a New Picture 

BYLINE:  By MICHEL MARRIOTT 

 BODY:
GERRIT VOOREN braved an icy Manhattan morning last week to press his search for just the right new computer. It had to be powerful, crammed with hundreds of megabytes of memory, and have enough hard-drive space to hold a vast music library and hours upon hours of digital video.
 For Mr. Vooren, a 40-year-old native of the Netherlands who moved to New York 16 years ago to pursue acting and visual art, his new computer essentially had to do what his old one could barely manage: handle the latest high-performance programs to help him edit short films in his Brooklyn apartment, where he recently started a business, Reels 4 Artists. A DVD burner was essential, too, to save the video onto disks. 
 "Smoke was coming out of the back of my computer," at least in the figurative sense, he recalled. "What I was doing with it was more than it could. It was just too much for it." 
 He replaced his aging Apple PowerBook G3, which ran on a single 400-megahertz processor, with a $2,000 Apple Power Mac G4, which uses two processors, each running at more than twice the power of his old computer's central processor. A 17-inch, $700 flat liquid crystal display replaced his old tube-based monitor. 
 It is shoppers like Mr. Vooren, and their demanding needs, that personal-computer makers hope will end their sales doldrums. 
 For the first two decades of the PC era, a fairly steady cycle prevailed: a succession of innovations (like the spreadsheet), opportunities (like getting on the Internet) or new operating systems (like Windows 95) drove waves of computer buying as each generation's processors, memory and hard drives proved unequal to new tasks. 
 But after peaking in 2000 at 16.4 million, the number of computers sold in the United States has declined two years in a row, to an estimated 13.8 million last year, according to the Consumer Electronics Association. 
 Consumers "just had no reason to buy," said Justin Udelhofen, a research assistant for Needham & Company. The advent of the World Wide Web stimulated PC sales in the 1990's, Mr. Udelhofen said, but by 2000 that buying cycle had played out, along with the economic boom.
 Now the elements may be in place to inspire a new wave of interest in upgrading. As the average price of a new PC continues to fall -- to $835 last year, roughly half the outlay of six years earlier -- an army of power-hungry software programs are beginning to explode the boundaries of what those computers can do.
 Those who see the tide turning make this case: high-performance applications like Microsoft's Windows XP Media Center Edition are transforming computers into ever more sophisticated music studios, digital darkrooms and video-editing bays -- even so-called entertainment servers that can record and play back television shows with the touch of a special remote control. 
 But such uses require up-to-date operating systems and processors. And the very volume of digital photos and music that consumers are using PC's to store and transfer to and from other devices is also feeding a demand for bigger hard drives. With factors like those, the electronics association is projecting a modest increase in sales this year, to 14.3 million. 
 Some computer industry analysts, however, warn that it is likely to take more than flashy new applications to lift computer sales significantly anytime soon.
 Andrew J. Neff, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, said it was too early to see now, but that an upturn in computer sales would be more apt to happen when broadband and wireless computing becomes more prevalent as well as home networking of computers sharing those high-speed connections. "It's never one thing," he said, "but a combination of things that drive the market."
 Still, as more software makes fuller use of late-model operating systems like Windows XP and Mac OS X, the industry seems optimistic about an eventual effect on PC sales.
 "An ever increasing multitasking lifestyle and a set of killer applications in music and video as stand-alone products are definitely driving greater appreciation for power," said Ralph Bond, Intel's consumer education manager. He said that owners of low-powered computers only three to five years old often face a phenomenon he calls the "multimedia oven": the computer becomes so overwhelmed by a power-intensive task like making a music CD that it cannot do much else for an extended period.
 Mr. Bond said consumers were growing impatient with having to "give up the machine for some kind of intense activity." The newest Intel Pentium 4 class microprocessors, for example, have more than enough power at two to three gigahertz to perform several intense tasks simultaneously, he said. 
 This year Intel is also introducing a technology called hyperthreading, which was first used on commercial servers. Hyperthreading is designed to boost computer performance significantly by handling software instructions as if the PC had two processors rather than one.
 The effect of all this processing power, Mr. Bond said, will be "going from frustration to fun."
 Kevin Wasielewski, vice president for marketing at Alienware, a maker of high-end computers that are a favorite of hard-core game players, said his company experienced a spike in sales with the release of any hot game that pushed the limits of current computers. "We have people waiting for the release of Doom 3 before they buy their next game PC," Mr. Wasielewski said.
 Steve Thomas, a spokesman for Cakewalk, a Boston-based company that specializes in developing software for creating music and sound, agreed: "Faster is always better."
 "The more horsepower of the processor and memory, the more unlimited possibilities are afforded the user," Mr. Thomas said.
 He pointed to his company's latest virtual music studio, called Project 5, which is to reach store shelves late this month. Project 5, which allows even non-musicians to create rich, multi-tracked CD's from hip-hop to electronica to jazz, will work on computers with no more than 800-megahertz processors and 256 megabytes of random access memory. But Mr. Thomas said that computers with twice the power and memory would give users a far more satisfying experience.
 "You need the hardware to do it," he said.
 And more hardware is available for less money. Venancio Figueroa, a spokesman for Dell Computer, said that a Dell computer selling for $999 in January 2002 had a 1.7 gigahertz processor, 256 megabytes of RAM and a 20-gigabyte hard drive. For the same price this year, Mr. Figueroa said, a Dell customer could expect a 2.4 gigahertz process with 512 megabytes of RAM and a 30-gigabyte hard drive, along with other extras.
 "Our view of what we're seeing here is not so much a price decrease, but a technology and performance increase," he said. 
 In Dell's case, that also means a sales increase in raw numbers: the company recently reported that 38 percent more units were sold in the fourth quarter of last year than a year earlier. 
 Carlos Arriaga, co-founder and chief technology officer of Digital-Reign, a Web site development company in Los Angeles, said he was seeing signs of a new techno-lust among shoppers. 
 "Every time I go to Best Buys, there have to be dozens of people buying computers to take home," Mr. Arriaga said. "It's not like they're geeks; they are people buying for home offices. You see mothers with children, husbands and wives, buying computers to run their home entertainment, to work with their photographs and things like that."
 Here is a look at some of the potential uses for those computers. 

Entertainment
 Home computers that can record and replay movies and television programs from cable and satellite signals have been around for years. But they have largely been the purview of enthusiasts who purchased expensive, high-performance graphics cards and retrofitted their PC's to operate as digital video recorders. Even then, low-powered computers need not apply.
 After noticing that consumers were increasingly using their home computers for music, pictures and video, Microsoft engineers created Windows XP Media Center Edition. It is an all-in-one approach that marries a variety of hardware components with enhancements to the Windows XP operating system.
 "It is connected and enables media to go to lots of places," Joe Belfiore, general manager of Windows eHome division of Microsoft, said of the Media Center.
 The system, licensed to some two dozen computer makers, comes with an infrared remote control that directs the PC -- either on its monitor or on a television set elsewhere to which it is hard-wired -- to display digital photos or video, or even programs and movies captured from television with the PC's own tuner card. It also offers functions like those found on TiVo and other digital television recorders, like pausing live action.
 The high-powered Media Center computers, some of which feature Intel's new hyperthreading capability, can also play back digital music on the computer itself or on a linked stereo system, all while performing standard computer functions.
 Sony makes a similar system called a Giga Pocket for its VAIO series of desktops. A $1,600 model has a 2.66-gigahertz Pentium 4 processor, one gigabyte of RAM, DVD-RW and DVD-ROM drives and a 120-gigabyte hard drive.

PC Games
 When Wolfenstein 3D became a favorite among computer game players in the early 1990's, all of its programming fit on a 1.44-megabyte diskette and played on pre-Pentium computers. Recently that World War II-themed classic from Id Software was reborn as Return to Castle Wolfenstein. It now requires, at a minimum, computers with Pentium II processors and more than 500 times as much storage space -- a full 800 megabytes on the hard drive -- for its programming.
 State-of-the-art computer games have long pushed consumers to upgrade their computers so they could literally stay in the game. Little has changed, said Mr. Wasielewski of Alienware, which promotes its PC's as "the ultimate gaming machine."
 The machines are custom-made to take advantage of the latest, most sophisticated components, like high-performance graphics cards and processors, and can typically cost from $2,500 to $3,500.
 Mr. Wasielewski said his current customers were waiting for Doom III (also by Id Software) to be released before they bought their next PC's. Spokesmen for Id have indicated that, unlike many games that aim for a mass market, the latest version of this spooky, futuristic battle game would aim higher, testing the limits of personal computers.
 Unreal II: The Awakening, published this month by Infogrames Entertainment, is not unusual in its PC requirements: more than two gigabytes of hard-drive space and at least a two-gigabyte processor. A high-end graphics card, a Nvidia GeForce4, is recommended along with a computer that can produce Dolby sound.

Photos
 One of the fastest-growing segments of the consumer electronics market in the last few years has been digital cameras: the Consumer Electronics Association projects that more than 11 million will be sold this year. And practically all digital cameras depend on the power of personal computers to edit, store, display and print their pictures.
 But managing and organizing hard drives brimming with photo files has become daunting. New tools like Photoshop Album by Adobe are designed to make that much easier, says Johnnie Manzari, user interface designer for Adobe.
 The software can handle tens of thousands of photo files, quickly sorting and grouping them by the date they were taken. Each picture can also be given simple tags and then organized or individually retrieved by the tags assigned. The program, which works best on Pentium III-class computers and higher with at least 128 megabytes of RAM, also helps fix photo flaws and archive photos on CD's and DVD's.
At a more basic level, Microsoft and Apple have incorporated digital photo management suites into their latest operating systems, Windows XP and Mac OS X. Neither will run on lower-powered computers.

Video
 For capturing and editing digital video images, Apple's Final Cut Pro 3, which runs best on high-performance personal computers, is practically an industry standard. For Windows-based computers, Mr. Bond, Intel's consumer education manager, gives Pinnacle Studio Version 8 high marks for giving Hollywood-type editing tools to weekend filmmakers. Pinnacle Systems recommends that Pinnacle Studio be used on computers with at least a one-gigahertz processor and 256 megabytes of RAM and a high-end graphics card.
 Other notable programs include Adaptec's VideOh!, the Ulead DVD MovieFactory 2, and Roxio's Easy CD and DVD Creator 6, a hard-drive-hungry suite of programs that can manage computer data backups, digital music, digital photos and video.
 Kathryn Kelly, a spokeswoman for Roxio, said the product, released two weeks ago, was intended for novice-to-average computer users. Nonetheless, she said, "you definitely want to have a fast machine to do a lot of the video and photo work."

Music
 Just as digital recording and mixing have invaded professional recording studios, digital music studios in a box are steadily finding converts among home-computer users who are learning that they can make music with the click of a mouse.
 Mr. Bond said that while many of the newest music studio programs would run on Pentium III computers as well as more powerful Pentium 4's, users should "be prepared to wait" to hear the results on a slower machine. Multitrack mixing and recording are especially power-hungry, he cautioned, adding that some of the newest software takes advantage of the latest processor designs, including Cakewalk's Home Studio and Sonar 2.0 (for more advanced users), Steinberg's Cubase and Nuendo (for more advanced users).
For best results, Mr. Bond recommends using music-creation software on the PC in conjunction with U.S.B.-connected external digital-recording devices -- sleek boxes that include high-performance sound cards and pre-amps like Aardvark's Q10 and M-Audio's Duo.

HEADLINE: Yale Oxymoron: Labor Relations 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, March 5 

 BODY:
Yale University is being rocked by its eighth strike since 1968, and Ron Altieri, an electrician at the university for 27 years, spoke for many workers when he sought to explain Yale's unusually rancorous labor history.
 "They're such an elitist institution," he said. "They just look down at the workers. They can't come to terms with looking at their unions as an equal." 
 Dismayed by such bitter attitudes, the university's president, Richard C. Levin, set out two years ago to put labor relations on a smoother path. After consulting with Yale's two main unions, he hired a consultant to get Yale and its unions to cooperate more.
"The long history is an unfortunate one," Mr. Levin said. "It's something I'd love to escape from and turn around."
Fourteen months ago, the consultant issued a report urging Yale to treat workers with more respect and urging the unions to stop protecting workers guilty of misbehavior and poor performance. The consultant helped the two sides agree on several issues, including job security. 
For a while last year, Yale and its unions were pledging more cooperation and appeared on the verge of putting their hostile history behind them. But then they were left to negotiate wages and other economic issues, and now Yale and its unions are again at war, solidifying Yale's reputation as the university with the worst labor relations in the nation.
This week's strike at Yale is unusual because it involves four groups representing 2,900 clerical workers; 1,200 dining hall, janitorial and maintenance workers; more than 1,000 graduate teaching and research assistants; and 150 food workers at Yale-New Haven Hospital.
Today, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, John J. Sweeney, spoke in the rain at a unionrally, calling Yale "a symbol of greed and oppression."
Yale's administrators and unions blame each other for the walkout. Officials from the university's two main unions -- Local 34, the clerical workers' union, and Local 35, the technical and service workers' union -- accuse Yale of refusing to budge from a contract offer that they say would provide insultingly small pensions. Saying it has offered many workers raises of more than 30 percent over six years, Yale asserts that the unions are holding out not over money, but to bolster efforts to unionize the graduate students and 1,800 workers at the hospital.
Mr. Levin said that thanks in part to the consultant's work, the two sides had been heading toward friendlier relations. But the union leaders' decision to link their contract fight to their organizing goals undercut that progress, he said.
"The strike is a way of demonstrating that these four unions are all pursuing an agenda -- an organizing agenda," Mr. Levin said. "I believe we could reconcile our differences with Locals 34 and 35 relatively easily if they decoupled the organizing issues from the issues of the contracts."
Union officials deny any such link, insisting that the strike is over management's unsatisfactory economic offer.
John R. Stepp, the consultant who worked with Yale and its unions, saw other reasons for the strike. Over the last 40 years, he said, "an enormous amount of distrust" has developed. 
"All the adversarialism and all the distrust have accumulated like barnacles on a ship's hold," he added.
Mr. Stepp, a senior associate with Restructuring Associates Inc. of Washington, said he was convinced that Mr. Levin and John W. Wilhelm, a 1967 Yale graduate who is president of the parent of three striking unions, "in their heart of hearts want to see the labor relations climate turn around and become positive." 
"Yet," he said, "the amount of distrust that existed was such that any time anything happened that was either the least bit negative or the least bit unexplainable, both sides would attribute malicious motives or ill intent to the other side."
Yale's administrators, professors and union officials offer various reasons for the eight strikes since 1968, including bitter town-gown relations, aggressive union leaders, and university administrators who are seen as uncomfortable with workers and antagonistic toward unions.
Mr. Levin said many of the past tensions stemmed from "a kind of indifference on the part of the university" and from the sharp decline of New Haven's manufacturing sector. "Unionized workers who lost jobs had a lot of energy and animus about that unfortunate development and focused on the remaining target, and that was Yale," he said.
Mr. Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, had a different explanation. He attributed many of Yale's labor problems to a lack of labor expertise, contrasting the university with Harvard, where John T. Dunlop, a former labor secretary and longtime Harvard professor, helped the university negotiate its first union contract with its clerical workers without a strike. At Yale, the clerical workers went on strike for 10 weeks in 1984 before obtaining their first contract.
"That kind of labor expertise doesn't exist at Yale," Mr. Wilhelm said. "There's no one at Yale who knows anything about labor relations."
What has happened over the pension issue underlines the distrust. Yale officials say they have made a generous proposal, offering to raise pensions by 11 to 18 percent. The union responds that even with such increases, many workers retiring after 30 years would receive pensions of less than $1,000 a month. 
But Yale responds that with Social Security included, most employees retiring after 30 years would receive retirement income exceeding 80 percent of their after-tax pay. Union officials respond that retirement income would exceed 80 percent of take-home pay only because take-home pay is so paltry. Yale said its clerical workers earned $33,717 last year on average and its technical and service workers $30,342.
Complicating matters, each side accuses the other of not being serious about bargaining. Mr. Levin said the clerical union's demand for raises of 8.5 percent a year could not be taken seriously. Union officials respond that they have reduced their wage demands four times, but that Yale has not altered its wage proposal.
For now, each side appears dug in, intent on waiting for the other to make the next big step. 
That could be a recipe for another strike this year. The current walkout is scheduled to last five days, but union officials say they may begin another strike after spring break if there is no significant progress soon.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSIT INCREASES: OVERVIEW; 
TRANSIT AUTHORITY SEEKS AN INCREASE IN FARES AND TOLLS

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
The base subway and bus fare will increase to $2 from $1.50, average commuter rail fares will increase by 25 percent and drivers will pay 50 cents more at many tunnels and bridges under a plan that will be presented today to close a $1.1 billion deficit for the region's transit system.
 The increases, almost certain to be approved by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board and to go into effect in May, will have much broader implications for transit ridership than those in the past, in which the price of a token was the only change. 
 Under the plan announced yesterday by Peter S. Kalikow, the board's chairman, riders who pay in advance for a monthly unlimited MetroCard will have even more incentive to do so. The price of the cards will rise to $70 from $63, an 11 percent increase, while the price of a single ride will increase 33 percent. The cost of weekly unlimited MetroCards, which have become more popular among poor and working-class riders, statistics show, will rise more steeply, to $21 from $17, a 24 percent increase. Chart, Page B4. 
The specter of a fare increase has largely failed to generate the widespread opposition that greeted previous increases. News analysis, Page B4. 
Over the last four months, the authority has repeatedly stressed the need for the increase to repair the biggest gap it has ever faced in its operating budget, a deficit officials say has been caused by flat revenues and increasing expenses over the last several years.
But the agency's critics, among them both the state and city comptrollers, have questioned the need for an increase this year and accused the M.T.A. of being far less than forthcoming about the true nature of it finances.
In the end, there were few surprises in the plan presented yesterday. Transit officials originally said they would consider a smaller fare increase, to $1.75, along with some service cuts, to fix the agency's budget problems, but the $2 figure was long the heavily favored option.
The only real uncertainties about the plan to be presented to the board were the levels of discounts and the numbers of token booths that would be closed as part of an effort to save $25 million a year. The authority initially planned to close 177 part-time and full-time booths, replacing them with automated turnstiles and MetroCard machines, but the plan now is to close no more than 62 part-time booths. Officials hinted yesterday that the number of closings could dwindle to 50 or fewer when the issue was brought up at today's board meeting.
In a statement, Mr. Kalikow said he thought the fare-increase proposal, elements of which were reported yesterday in The Daily News, balanced the interests of riders with the authority's financial realities. "First and foremost, our customers said that they did not want any service cuts," he said. "They also did not want to lose a physical presence in station booths, and lastly they felt the fare discounts must be maintained."
Among the other proposals expected to be approved today, transit officials said, is a gradual phasing out of the token. Though planners have encountered some technical and logistical problems in trying to retire the token and replace it with a single-ride MetroCard, officials said they thought the switch could be made by the end of this year.
Officials said they would also begin a pilot program to test the feasibility of a "city ticket" program, which would allow passengers to travel within New York City on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North for 50 cents more than the nominal subway fare. The program had been advocated by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as a way to use the excess capacity on the commuter rails in off-peak hours to relieve the crush in the subway.
Transit officials said yesterday that they thought once discounts were factored in, the increases in subway and bus fares would closely match those for the commuter rails -- a sensitive issue at a time when the state gives proportionately higher subsidies to suburban commuters than to city transit riders. Transit officials said yesterday that the average commuter-rail increase would be 25 percent, but gave no details about specific fares. 
In 1995, when the M.T.A. voted to increase transit fares by 20 percent while increasing those for the commuter lines by an average of 9 percent, the New York Urban League and the Straphangers Campaign filed suit, leading a federal judge to block the increase. The effort to maintain the fare was ultimately unsuccessful.
The proposal that will be presented today for bridge and tunnel tolls will mean that drivers will pay a smaller percentage increase than their mass transit counterparts -- a little more than 14 percent more, $4 one way instead of $3.50 -- for the basic toll on the Verrazano-Narrows, the Triborough Bridge, the Throgs Neck Bridge, the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. Drivers with E-ZPass will continue to receive discounts.
Opponents of the fare and toll increases said yesterday that they considered the rolling back of the number of subway token booths to be closed a major victory. But they questioned whether the fare proposals too heavily favored wealthier transit riders at the expense of the poor and working class, by giving those who can afford monthly cards a bigger break.
Transit officials have long wanted to encourage New Yorkers to buy more subway and bus rides in advance. Increased sales of the monthly card, for example, mean fewer transactions at token booths and MetroCard machines and a significant float for the agency -- in other words, services paid for in advance.
Under the proposal, however, pay-per-ride MetroCards will offer a bigger bonus for less money, perhaps encouraging greater use of that type of discount by lower-income riders. For example, a person buying a $10 card would get one free ride; now, riders must put at least $15 on such a card to receive a free ride. Transit officials also said they would study the feasibility of a two-week unlimited MetroCard, which would be more easily within the reach of lower-income riders.

BELLSOUTH SELLS STAKEIN BRAZILIAN WIRELESS COMPANY

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 BellSouth, the regional telephone company, and Verbier, the holding company of Brazil's wealthy Safra family, said yesterday that they had agreed to sell their 95 percent stake in BSE, a wireless telephone company in northeastern Brazil, to America Movil of Mexico. 
The deal will give America Movil, the biggest wireless telephone company in Latin America, a larger presence in Brazil, and allow BellSouth to reduce its exposure to the weak economy and currency fluctuations that have hurt its investments there. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. America Movil said BSE, which provides service to an area with about 29.5 million residents, was worth about $180 million in total.

 The Bloomberg administration wants to allow garbage carters to charge by weight, as an alternative to charging by volume. 
Jose Maldonado, the chairman of the Business Integrity Commission, proposed letting carters charge up to $8 per 100 pounds, while keeping the current rate cap of $12.20 per cubic yard as an alternative. Many carting firms complain it is no longer economical to pick up heavy trash, because they must pay to get rid of it by weight. Michael Cooper (NYT)

HEADLINE: How Medicaid Was Set Adrift 

BYLINE:  By Jonathan Cohn; Jonathan Cohn, senior editor at The New Republic, is a media fellow with the Kaiser Family Foundation.

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich. 

 BODY:
As President Bush kicked off his plan to reform Medicare and the country's malpractice laws on Tuesday, he didn't mention one of the most important policy achievements of recent years: the expanded role of Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income Americans. But then, Medicaid is the success story that almost nobody has paid attention to.
 Since the late 1980's, the proportion of Americans receiving health insurance through their jobs has declined. So during the late 1990's, the Clinton administration and the states tapped their unexpected budget surpluses to make Medicaid more widely available. They eased eligibility requirements and got more aggressive about enrolling people. As a result, 47 million people receive Medicaid today, up from 40 million in 1998. Despite the waste and abuse common to public and private health programs, Medicaid has done a remarkably good job of serving a low-income, poorly educated and multicultural population. And without it, the high number of Americans without health coverage today -- some 42 million -- would likely be a few million higher. 
 Unfortunately, that progress is now in jeopardy. With more people out of work and private health insurance increasingly unaffordable, there is a new wave of struggling Americans looking to the government for help. But the states, suddenly beset by budget deficits, are in no position to provide it this time around. That's why the country's governors went to Washington last week, literally begging for temporary assistance, and why even normally spendthrift Republicans in Congress seemed inclined to support them.
President Bush, however, has proposed something quite different. Instead of helping states bolster Medicaid, he wants to help them cut it. It's an odd way to preserve such an important piece of public policy; then again, preserving Medicaid may not be the precise goal Mr. Bush has in mind.
When he first unveiled his Medicaid plan in January, he boasted of its generosity, since it included more than $3 billion in new money for the states next year -- part of an additional $13 billion they would receive over the next seven years. But given that the states are looking at about $70 billion in overall deficits next year, that's hardly enough to keep Medicaid going as is, let alone allow it to accommodate additional needs while unemployment remains high. (By comparison, a bipartisan bill would give the states an immediate infusion of $20 billion, half of it explicitly dedicated to Medicaid.)
And when you read the fine print in the president's plan, you discover the real dangers. Like a bank making a loan -- or, as critics have put it, like a loan shark exploiting a client's vulnerability -- the president would require the states to pay back all of the $13 billion in the three years that follow the initial seven. In addition, states accepting the upfront money would have to sign off on a major shift in the program's overall financing scheme: 
Washington would stop providing the bulk of its Medicaid financing as matching funds, which rise as states enroll more people. Instead, it would provide a fixed sum each year, based on a formula that could easily underestimate the true need for services. 
When asked about these reductions, Bush administration officials have insisted they won't really hurt -- that through "innovation" the states would learn to do more with less money. But a look at the regulatory changes in the plan suggests just what sort of innovations they have in mind. The Bush scheme would make it easier for the states to cut services like prescription drug coverage, prosthetics, eyeglasses and most nursing-home care. 
Although this may not sound like "compassionate conservatism," it's entirely consistent with the administration's broader approach to health policy. President Bush has repeatedly made it clear he wants the government out of the business of providing health insurance -- if the poor find themselves uninsured, he'd prefer the government give them tax credits to buy private policies. 
But while that private-sector approach may sound appealing as part of a stump speech, in the real world it doesn't work. Mr. Bush's tax credit proposal, for example, would give individuals up to $1,000 annually to buy a policy -- which would cover only a few months of decent insurance in most parts of the country. In addition, Mr. Bush has shown no willingness to enact the kinds of regulations necessary to guarantee that insurance is available to the people who need it most, including those with pre-existing conditions like chronic diabetes.
It was precisely because the poor couldn't afford health insurance that the federal government created Medicaid in 1965. It's also the reason that, in trying times like these, previous administrations have dipped into the treasury to keep the program going. Maybe President Bush just doesn't understand this history. Or, sadly, maybe he's intent on reversing its course. Either way, his plan would force many states to cut back a vital and effective health insurance program at the very moment their citizens need it most.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NORTHERN FRONT; 
Turkish Military Backs Role in U.S. Drive on Iraq

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, March 5 

 BODY:
Turkey's military stepped into the political battle over the country's role in a conflict with Iraq today, signaling its support for a measure that would allow thousands of American troops to launch an attack from Turkish soil. 
 In a rare public statement, Gen. Hilmi Ozkok, the chief of the Turkish general staff, appeared to back efforts by the country's political leaders to ask Parliament to reconsider a resolution that would allow as many 62,000 American troops to attack from bases here. The measure was voted down by Parliament on Saturday. 
 "The Turkish armed forces' view is the same as the government's and is reflected in the motion that our government sent to Parliament," General Ozkok told reporters. "The war will be short if a second front is opened from the north."
Only hours before General Ozkok's remarks, a senior member in the ruling Justice and Development Party said that Turkey's leaders were determined to take the measure back to the Parliament and push harder to guarantee its success. The official said the government probably would not act until after elections Sunday that are expected to lead to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the party leader, becoming prime minister.
Today's events appeared to set the stage for a political struggle in which Turkish political and military leadership would push the Parliament against public opinion.
The measure authorizing American troops had been endorsed by both Mr. Erdogan and the current prime minister, Abdullah Gul, and both men had predicted its passage. But nearly 100 members of the ruling party defied their leaders and voted against it. The measure failed by three votes. 
Many of those who voted against the resolution cited the opinions of Turkey's voters, who polls show oppose their country's involvement in a war by an overwhelming margin. 
Turkish officials and commentators said it was unlikely that the Turkish military was trying to force the government to reconsider the motion, but rather that it was trying to provide political cover for them so they could push the Parliament against public opinion.
"It's a good statement," Mr. Gul said of the general's remarks. 
Turkish officials close to Mr. Gul and Mr. Erdogan said neither man approves of America's plans for Iraq, but that both have concluded that they cannot afford to spurn Turkey's most important ally or the $6 billion in direct aid the United States has offered.
Turkey's leaders have been under intense American pressure to ask the Parliament to reconsider the measure. On Sunday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell telephoned Mr. Gul to talk about the issue. 
American diplomats here have been busy pressing their case, meeting privately with members of the majority party, including legislators who voted against the measure. 
Emin Sirin, a legislator in the governing party who opposed the American plan, said American diplomats asked him what they could do to improve relations between the two countries, but he said he had not been asked to change his vote. 
"They had a very gentlemanly attitude," Mr. Sirin said. "They didn't have that attitude a month ago."
Mr. Sirin said he had not decided to change his vote, but might if the United States government offered a more generous economic package. 
There were indications that others who had opposed the measure would be willing to change their minds, if only to prop up a government that had seen its credibility badly damaged by Saturday's defeat. 
In an interview in Sabah, a daily newspaper, one influential member of Parliament who had opposed the measure suggested many of the 96 legislators who opposed the resolution last week would change their minds.
"If the same motion comes today, it would 100 percent be accepted," said Mehmet Elkatmis, a member of the ruling party who voted against the deployment.
It was unclear what motivated the Turkish generals to intervene in the debate over American troops. The military had assumed a low profile in the days leading up the vote, refusing to offer an opinion on the question of American troops. Some Turkish officials said the hands-off approach was due primarily to the generals' dislike of the ruling party, which they regard with suspicion for its Islamist past. 
The Turkish military has had an extensive role in domestic politics, having deposed civilian governments in several times in the last four decades. In 1997, it orchestrated the removal of an Islamic-minded government; many members of that body are now in the present government. 
A Turkish official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the generals were particularly alarmed that Saturday's vote, by canceling the deployment of Turkey's troops into northern Iraq, had effectively forfeited Turkey's role over the future of northern Iraq.
Turkey's leaders are worried that the Kurdish region in northern Iraq could become an independent state. That, they fear, could rekindle desires for independence among the Kurds in Turkey. 
The Turkish official said that Turkey's generals were skeptical of the ability of the United States to ensure that the Iraqi Kurds did not try to break away if the Saddam Hussein were deposed. 
In his remarks, General Ozkok alluded to those concerns, and sent a terse warning to the Kurds of northern Iraq. 
"I remind them of our legitimate right to defend our national interests, and I hope they will be prudent and cooperative," General Ozkok said. "Those who want to replace peace with confrontation will also take the responsibility and bear the consequences."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
It looks like red ink and the ills that can go with it are back to stay for a while.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and a co-editor of The Journal of the European Economic Association. E-mail:akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
THE budget President Bush submitted last month should have come with the warning, "They're baaack!" Deficits are re-emerging as a major problem. Goldman, Sachs recently raised its estimate of the federal budget deficit this year to $375 billion, and warned that it could go even higher. That works out to more than $1,400 for every man, woman and child. With the impending retirement of the first baby boomers, the red ink is expected to last as far as the eye can see. 
 This dire predicament inspired the Committee for Economic Development, a nonpartisan business organization, to issue a report yesterday calling urgently for tax increases and spending cuts to put the government's fiscal house in order. Unless corrective action is taken, the group warned, investment, productivity and living standards will suffer. 
 Although the group's recommendation of higher taxes is unlikely to be popular, past experience with deficits suggests that tax increases are virtually inevitable before the decade is out. Even Ronald Reagan ended up raising taxes to try to make up for the big shortfall from the 1981 cuts. 
Smart consumers would start tucking money away now for future tax increases. But such foresight is uncommon. In a National Bureau of Economic Research paper -- titled "What Have We Learned From the Reagan Deficits and Their Disappearance?" -- Benjamin Friedman of Harvard documents that personal savings declined as the deficit ballooned in the 1980's and early 1990's. As a consequence, government borrowing crowded out private investment and caused interest rates to rise. 
Four other less obvious political-economic responses are likely now that we are back in an era of persistent deficits.
First, there will be renewed interest in indexing Social Security benefits to an inflation gauge that is growing more slowly than the Consumer Price Index, the current yardstick. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, for example, recently urged Congress to switch to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' new chained price index, which adjusts the market basket if consumers' spending patterns change. Changing the index is appealing to many politicians because it is a stealth way to curb benefits. 
There may also be sound reasons to believe that -- at least under certain technical assumptions about the nature of tastes and price shocks -- the new series provides a more accurate gauge of changes in the cost of living than the old one, which reflects the cost of purchasing a fixed basket of goods. It should not go unnoticed, however, that inflation is the main indicator by which the Federal Reserve is judged, so Mr. Greenspan is not a disinterested observer. Indeed, so much intellectual firepower has gone into searching for reasons the C.P.I. might overstate inflation that one worries that factors that cause the index to understate inflation have been overlooked. 
Although the traditional inflation index has its shortcomings, there is no reason to limit the debate on indexation to technical issues concerning price indexes. Why not adjust retirees' benefits so they rise in lock step with the average worker's wage? This would connect benefits to the tax base that finances the program, and one could argue that it is fair to treat retirees and workers comparably.
Also, why not consider gradually increasing the normal retirement age beyond the scheduled rise to 67 in 2027? When Social Security was enacted in 1935, life expectancy for a 65-year-old was 77; in 2035 it is forecast to be 84. 
Second, with miles of red ink ahead, unfunded government mandates will become a relatively more attractive option to federal lawmakers. The need for politicians to demonstrate that they are responsive to crises like terrorist attacks or natural disasters will not diminish. Mandates on state governments will satisfy this need without showing up on the federal budget ledger. This is already happening: the Homeland Security Act and No Child Left Behind Act are quickly becoming two of the largest unfunded mandates ever. The 1995 Unfunded Mandates Act is unlikely to curb this tide. 
Third, compared with spending, regulation will also become relatively more attractive. Instead of paying for more fire trucks, the government could tighten safety regulations. Of course, a major problem is that there are not enough inspectors to enforce regulations already on the books. 
Finally, look for budget rules and rhetoric to change, although it is hard to predict how. If the government becomes serious about reducing deficits, it will reinstate provisions that capped discretionary spending and required offsets elsewhere in the budget for every spending increase or tax cut. These provisions helped eliminate the Reagan-Bush deficits, but have recently expired.
If the government remains in a state of deficit denial, the accounting rules applied to the budget will probably change to conceal the problem. The Bush administration, for example, provided only five-year forecasts of the unified budget in its latest documents; the practice had been 10 years. Also, don't expect to hear the term "lockbox" -- a rhetorical device that helped protect the Social Security trust fund from other uses -- from the president any time soon. 
With the suddenness of a winter storm, budgetsurpluses were snowed under by deficits in the last two years. Because the confluence of tax cuts and spending increases is responsible for more than half the disappearance of the surplus in the 10-year budget, Peter R. Orszag, an economist at the Brookings Institution, warns that there is no reason to suspect the tide of red ink will recede as suddenly as it appeared, even if the economy improves more than expected. The official deficit projections are already overly optimistic because they exclude the costs of extending popular tax provisions due to expire, a possible prescription drug plan, and the substantial costs of any war with Iraq.
So it would be wise to prepare for another era of deficits.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSIT INCREASE: REACTION; 
This Time, Outrage Is Harder to Find Among Riders

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
It might seem like the recent past, but when viewed through the prism of the subway, 1995 feels like another era altogether.
 That year, when the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said it would raise the price of a token by a quarter, to $1.50, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani lashed out at the agency, accusing it of poor management. The State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, tried to make a deal to stave off an increase. A state assemblywoman blocked state aid to try to derail the increase, and community groups filed a civil rights lawsuit that eventually delayed it. 
 This year, probably by May, the basic fare will rise to $2, a 33 percent increase, making it the highest in the country. But the contrasts could hardly be more stark:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, trying to fix his own tremendous budget problems, has all but publicly championed an increase and said yesterday that his four representatives on the M.T.A. board would probably vote to approve one. Dissenting voices from Albany have been weak. And even the city's labor leaders have been muted. In 1995, for example, Dennis Rivera, the powerful president of the state health care union, helped organize widespread opposition to a fare increase. In 2003, he has been absent from the debate, having moved closer politically to Gov. George E. Pataki, who controls the M.T.A. board.
In other words, in a city where transit fares have risen 13 times over the last 99 years -- nearly every one of those greeted with great yelling, screaming and political teeth-gnashing -- the 2003 version of this drama could be considered, as one opponent of the plan described it, "the first stealth fare increase."
People on both sides of the debate offer many explanations for this anomaly, some of them at odds. Transit officials say that the system, after billions of dollars of rebuilding, is far better than it has been in decades, and that they believe New Yorkers are simply willing to pay more to keep it that way.
But their opponents counter that grass-roots anger about a fare increase has been muted in large part because Mr. Pataki and the M.T.A. have been extraordinarily successful at quashing debate on the issue.
From almost immediately after the governor's re-election, a fare increase has been portrayed by his appointees as inevitable, the only way to repair a $1.1 billion budget gap over the next two years. At the same time, the opponents contend, transit officials have made it next to impossible to figure out whether they are right or wrong, because M.T.A. budget documents are at best opaque and at worst dishonest.
"I wouldn't discount the corrosive effects of cynicism in this, on the failure of a movement to oppose this fare increase to materialize," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who has been active on transportation issues.
"I think the community got the feeling of clawing at the feet of a giant," Mr. Brodsky said, "and it really doesn't have to be that way."
Of course, one of the best explanations for the relative absence of opposition may be the simplest: it has been eight years since the last increase, the longest stretch since the years 1953 to 1966, when the fare was held at 15 cents.
In making their case for an increase this year, transit officials have repeated the words "eight years" like a mantra. They have also stressed that, because of MetroCard discounts, the average fare has actually decreased for the first time in the history of the system -- to $1.04 now, as riders take advantage of the discounts.
Officials have also tried to remind riders that over the last 20 years, more than $35 billion has been invested to rebuild the subway. Hundreds of new subway cars are on the tracks and new buses on the roads. And by next year, nearly half the city's 468 subway stations will have been renovated. In addition, crime in the subway has dropped to the lowest level in 34 years.
Even though most of those billions used to improve the system have been borrowed -- and the cost of that extensive borrowing is among the main reasons the fare will rise -- many subway and bus riders are sympathetic to the M.T.A.'s message. Anthony Johnson, a stockbroker who lives on the Upper West Side, said yesterday that he considered the transit system "the cheapest ride around," even at $2 a ride.
"I think they run it incredibly efficiently for the number of people who take it," he said.
While many riders say they feel the same way, some add that a fare increase will still be a huge burden for them. For example, Carlos Cortez, 18, a cook at a restaurant in Midtown, said yesterday that it would mean less money sent back to his family in Mexico.
Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, said yesterday that, paradoxically, strong opposition to a fare increase might have failed to develop because of the dire economic condition of the city and state themselves. While higher property taxes and cuts in city service could have angered residents, leading them to condemn a fare increase as piling on, those economic burdens instead could be having the opposite effect.
"These are much tougher economic times," he said, "And I think there is a feeling -- like in the fiscal crisis -- that bad things are going to happen and maybe there's not a whole lot you can do about it."
He added: "That's a very difficult atmosphere to advocate in."

HEADLINE: Give Freedom A Chance 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
How should free people feel in our hearts, brains and guts -- about launching a pre-emptive strike? 
 Note that we are not "starting a war" with Iraq. That was begun by Saddam more than a decade ago. We won the first battle, but he has since been secretly violating the terms of surrender. Either we will allow him to become capable of inflicting horrendous casualties in our cities tomorrow -- or we must inflict and accept far fewer casualties in his cities today. 
 That's a Hobson's choice, which is no choice at all. We will now get on with it. We will not whip ourselves into jingoism, or become fascinated by our exercise of ultra-tech superpower or suppress our sadness at the pictures of Iraqi civilians Saddam will thrust into the line of fire as human shields. 
But we should by no means feel guilty about doing our duty. War cannot be waged apologetically. Rather than wring our hands, Americans and our allies are required to gird our loins -- that is, to fight to win with the conviction that our cause is just. We have ample reason to believe that Saddam's gangster government is an evil to be destroyed before it gains the power to destroy us. 
It is futile to try to reason with passionate marchers waving signs proclaiming that America's motives are to conquer the world and expend blood for oil. 
Nor should we waste more precious time trying to beg or buy moral approval from France or Russia, their U.N. veto threats largely driven by economic interests in Saddam's continuance in power. Nor should we indulge in placing second thoughts first: How much will it cost? How many will be killed? How long will it take? Will it kill the snake of terror or only poke it? Will everybody thank us afterward? Where's the guarantee of total success? Too cautious to oppose, these questioners delay action by demanding to know what they know is unknowable. 
Our task now, as citizens of nations burdened with the dirtiest work of mankind -- a pre-emptive attack to finish a suspended war -- is to call up the national spirit and determined attitude needed to sustain a great effort. Skepticism is a fine American trait and many find patriotic fervor uncool, but the eve of hostilities is the moment for opening the mind to exhortation.
We are launching this attack, already too long delayed, primarily to defend ourselves. This is a response to reasonable fear. We know Saddam is developing terror weapons and is bound on vengeance; we know he has ties to terror organizations eager to use those weapons for more mass murder; we know he can bamboozle the U.N. inspectors again; we know Americans are terror's prime targets. That's plenty of reason to take him out.
But this reasonable fear should be accompanied by a strong dash of hope. Wilsonian idealists have found a soulmate in President Bush, who surprised us all with his challenging vision -- not merely a "vision thing" -- for the coming generation. 
The defeat of Saddam may just send a clear message to Kim Jong Il and other tyrants that we will respond with more action than ransom to nuclear blackmailers, thereby making the world a safer place. But safety is not all.
The liberation of 23 million Arabs and Kurds now ruled by a bloody-handed dictator, followed by a transition to a confederation (aided by an Arab-American general like John Abizaid, now Gen. Tommy Franks's deputy), may just make it possible for a rudimentary democracy to take root in this major Muslim nation. 
Such a birth of freedom in Iraq, a land of oil wealth and a literate population, may just spread to its neighbors and co-religionists. This would counter the cancerous growth of repression and rancor that has roiled the Middle East and impoverished the people of 20 nations.
If Bush's vision of a transformed region fails, it will fail while daring greatly -- a nobler course than that weakly advocated, in Teddy Roosevelt's words, by "those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat."
This campaign near the Ides of March will make us safer, allaying our fears; it has the potential of making the world freer, justifying our hopes.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE DEMOCRATS; 
Criticism of Bush's Policy on Korea Sharpens

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5 

 BODY:
In the Democrats' sharpest critique of President Bush's foreign policy, a group of Clinton administration officials joined Senate Democrats today in attacking the handling of North Korea. The group called for immediate direct talks with Pyongyang to prevent a nuclear arms race in Asia.
 The group, which included former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and former Defense Secretary William J. Perry, said that North Korea appeared inexorably headed toward "serial production" of nuclear weapons but that the administration seemed too distracted by Iraq or too paralyzed by internal squabbling to stop the advance. 
 Several Democrats asserted that the administration appeared resigned to North Korea's building up to six nuclear weapons in the coming months, a move that would let Pyongyang conduct tests or sell fissionable material to terrorists. The Democrats referred to the situation as a crisis, a characterization that the administration has refused to make. 
"In spite of the high stakes," the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said, "the White House continues to sit back and watch, playing down the threat and, apparently, playing for time." 
The spokesman for the White House, Ari Fleischer, said, "I think North Korea would like nothing more than to make this a crisis, because the more they can make this a crisis, the more they think they will get things in return."
A senior administration official involved in North Korea policy strongly denied that the United States was prepared to accept nuclear arms in North Korea. He said the administration had made headway in the last week in developing ideas for a multilateral forum.
The official also argued that it might take the reprocessing of spent fuel rods to bring a real sense of urgency to China, South Korea and Japan about the weapons programs. 
In Seoul, newspapers printed dovish comments by officials here today, illustrating a gap between Washington and the new government of President Roh Moo Hyun.
While Washington argues that the nuclear program should be ended through multilateral talks, Mr. Roh said, "Ultimately this problem has to be resolved by President Bush and Chairman Kim Jong Il, and they have to be moved to solve the problem."
Mr. Roh's office confirmed today that on Feb. 20, five days before his inauguration, an aide made a secret trip to Beijing to meet a high North Korean official. A South Korean newspaper, JoongAng Ilbo, which broke the news, said the aide, Ra Jong Yil, who is now the president's national security adviser, had proposed an early meeting between the leaders of the North and the South, ideally before Mr. Roh's expected trip here in May. 
The newspaper said Mr. Ra had offered extensive economic aid to the North in return for ending the nuclear weapons program. Today, a spokeswoman for Mr. Roh, Song Kyoung Hee, declined to say what he discussed in Beijing.
Before taking office, Mr. Roh ruled out the use of military force in dealing with the nuclear program, a position that Unification Minister Jeong Se Hyun echoed today. Addressing concerns that the 24 American bombers en route to Guam could be used against North Korea, 2,115 miles north, Mr. Jeong dismissed such fears as "baseless anxiety." 
"How can the U.S. ignore South Korea and go against our will in pursuing its North Korean policy?" he asked on SBS radio.
In Washington, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said deploying 24 long-range bombers in easy striking distance of North Korea should not be interpreted as "aggressive or threatening or hostile."
"As the situation with respect to Iraq becomes somewhat tense," Mr. Rumsfeld said, "it seems to me that it's appropriate for the United States to look around the globe and say, 'Where might someone think of taking advantage of that situation with respect to Iraq?' " 
The Democrats' critique initiated a new advisory panel formed by Mr. Daschle to help Senate Democrats articulate forceful alternatives to Mr. Bush's foreign and national security policies. Many Democrats say the party was hurt in the elections last year by not presenting clear rebuttals to the Republicans' positions on Iraq and domestic security. 
The former officials who appeared with Mr. Daschle, including Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, and Ashton B. Carter, a former Pentagon official -- were intimately involved in Korean policies, and their remarks were in part intended to defend those policies against Republican criticism. 
The policies included the 1994 framework under which North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear programs in exchange for food and fuel. Last fall, Pyongyang declared that accord invalid after conceding that it was developing a covert program to enrich uranium.
The Democrats also clearly believe that North Korea represents the Achilles heel of Mr. Bush's foreign policy. Unlike Mr. Bush's forceful positions on Iraq, they contend, his positions have dithered on North Korea, allowing conflicts between hard liners and moderates in the administration to fester while sending confusing messages to allies. 
"China doesn't know which part of this administration is in fact calling the shots," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "If this is for regime change, China's not for it. If this is for denuclearizing the peninsula, China is for it."
In addition to calling for direct talks, the Democrats argued that the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel rods, which can produce plutonium for bombs, should be a "red line" that would set off forceful responses from the United States and its allies, including economic sanctions and, perhaps, military strikes.
"The proposed policy of isolation -- isolation and containment -- will not work," Mr. Perry said as he called North Korea "the most dangerous spot" in the world. "We can hardly isolate North Korea more than they are already isolated."
The administration has declined to engage in direct talks with North Korea, arguing that doing so would reward what it considers blackmail and brinksmanship.

HEADLINE: Drug Benefits Are Restored Temporarily In Oregon 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 5 

 BODY:
Thousands of poor people in Oregon who were cut off from their prescription drug coverage by the state will have their medications restored, at least temporarily, under an emergency spending package the House passed and the governor signed on Tuesday. 
 The spending measure will restore prescription drug coverage, at least until June, for most people who lost medications after two rounds of cuts over five weeks, state officials said. 
 But other people who had their medications covered for drug and alcohol treatment will not have their benefits restored under the emergency spending plan, said Jim Sellers, spokesman for the Oregon Department of Human Services. 
For those who are having their medications restored, it will be a wait of up to two weeks until they can be served, state officials said, because of logistical problems. 
The emergency spending bill affects about 100,000 people who lost prescription drug and other benefits, Mr. Sellers said. Not all the benefits are being restored. 
All 100,000 people, who were brought onto Oregon's health plan as part of an effort to provide near universal health coverage to the poor, may yet permanently lose their coverage when the stopgap money runs out in June, state leaders said. 
"What we've done is just given people a little more time to find other areas of help, because we have got to reduce this program," said State Senator Beverly Clarno, the Republican leader of a chamber evenly divided between the two parties. 
Mary Ellen Glynn, a spokeswoman for Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski, a Democrat, said the governor was happy that many people were given a temporary reprieve, but she said the governor's budget proposal did not call for restoring prescription drug coverage beyond June. 
The 100,000 people lost coverage in two waves, beginning on Feb. 1, after voters turned down an attempt to raise taxes as a way to deal with budget deficits. Over the last week, as thousands of people have complained about medical and mental emergencies when their prescriptions were cut off, Oregon leaders have worked frantically to put together a temporary reprieve. 
People who run mental health clinics say the emergency measure will keep some people alive and functioning. But they said the failure to restore the coverage of others would be be hard on addicts who relied on methadone to stay off drugs like heroin. 
"This doesn't mean much to the 2,600 people we serve who lost their benefits," said Leslie Ford, chief executive officer of Cascade Behavioral Healthcare, a private nonprofit group in the Portland area. She said further problems were being caused by health program staffing cuts. "They still cut the money for support staff, and most of our folks are unable to take their medications without the support staff."
By borrowing money from Oregon's share of the national tobacco settlement and from an education reserve fund, state leaders were able to close a $340 million hole in the budget that hit schools, police forces, the courts and the poor. 
Officials emphasized that Oregon's budget crisis was not repaired by this measure. Oregon faces a deficit of $2 billion going into the two-year period that begins at the end of June, and the state is in a severe recession, with unemployment at 7.5 percent.
"We're in an unprecedented situation here," said Mike Beard, spokesman for Oregon Senate Republicans.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday described the effects of a decision by Oregon officials to help cover budget shortfalls by paring back prescription drug coverage and other benefits provided under a health care program for the poor. It said about 100,000 people lost drug coverage.
The article, written on Monday, said the state was looking for a way to restore some of the health program. But it took no account of legislation restoring some benefits, which was passed on Tuesday by the Oregon House and signed into law by Gov. Ted Kulongoski. 
An article appears today, on Page A25.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
A Deepening Fissure

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5 

 BODY:
The declaration issued today by Germany, Russia and France against war in Iraq now -- with its implicit threat of veto -- may go down as the loudest "No!" shouted across the Atlantic in a half century or more. 
 The nine-paragraph statement may not have slowed the seemingly inexorable drive by the Bush administration to commence military operations as early as next week. 
 But the fact that Europe's largest powers felt compelled to present President Bush with an 11th-hour challenge deepened fissures that have opened in the last year with major allies. 
It also set up a final confrontation at the Security Council over a resolution authorizing war in Iraq, a step that increasingly looks as if it could be forsaken for lack of majority support among the 15 members. 
Beyond the immediate issue of war, the declaration was a broad affront to Washington that admonished the Bush administration that the international system is "at a turning point" on establishing the rules of the road after the cold war, and the Franco-German bloc is too large a force, if not in military power, then in economic and cultural terms, to ignore. 
Their criticism extended to Mr. Bush's overall Middle East policy, where they faulted his administration for delays in "publishing and implementing" a road map that would return the promise of negotiations and peace to the Arab-Israeli dispute, something most Europeans feel Mr. Bush has neglected. 
The Bush administration, it seemed clear from public remarks today, did not see the European announcement coming. Even after the statement from Paris was issued by the three foreign ministers, Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, was trying to play down the significance of their warning, "we will not let a proposed resolution pass that would authorize the use of force." 
Private bristling and public bluster had been building for days as Igor S. Ivanov of Russia, Dominique de Villepin of France and Joschka Fischer of Germany consulted in advance of their thunderbolt while American and British diplomats tracked their movements and conversations as if they were adversaries. 
Allies do not act this way, Henry A. Kissinger, a former secretary of state said. For members of the Western alliance "to go into open opposition" on a matter like Security Council resolution No. 1441, which clearly frames a war issue affecting American security after the Sept. 11 attacks, "that's a very grave decision," Mr.. Kissinger said.
"If this keeps up," he added, "we will wind up in a sort of 19th-century balance-of-power game, in which it is not self-evident that we will lose." 
But German and French diplomats said today they were simply declaring their independence, something Washington has long expected in the wake of the cold war.
"I don't see it as a permanent rift," said Karsten D. Voigt, the German diplomat who coordinates policy toward America. For Germany, the trans-Atlantic relationship remains a "fundamental pillar" of its foreign policy, he said. 
But today's declaration should be a reminder to Washington not only of the deep "moral and ethical" aversion to war on the Continent, but also of the negative reaction to the tone emanating from the administration. 
That tone, Mr. Voigt said, was that "the Europeans are not needed, that they reflect something old and that, at best, they are irrelevant." 
For France and Germany, today was also an opportunity to strike a pose of unity to an audience within Europe, where new democracies among East and Central European states are clamoring to join the European Union and have declared support for Washington's Iraq policy. 
In backing President Bush so strongly these newly liberated states have undermined Paris and Berlin as the dominant voices in shaping the continent's foreign policy. 
But the continent's traditional powers -- "Old Europe" to some Bush aides -- may have recovered some of that influence today. 
The declaration also dispelled the notion among senior Bush aides that Germany, France and Russia could be peeled away from the opposing camp one by one and it may render moot the Security Council meeting on Friday in New York. 
There, Hans Blix, one of the chief United Nations inspectors, is to summarize his views that inspections have shown progress but that Iraq has not made the fundamental decision to disgorge the materials and the secrets of programs to produce weapons of mass destruction. 
Secretary Powell argued forcefully today that this should be proof enough that the time for diplomacy has ended. The meetings at the White House today between Mr. Bush, his national security advisers and Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the commander in the Middle East, signaled that Mr. Bush may have already moved beyond diplomacy.
Others hold out hope. 
"Russia is prepared for a kind of compromise," said Vladimir P. Lukin, a former ambassador to Washington. "But what kind of compromise can you have if the U.S. doesn't want to hear anybody?" 
For Bush aides, like Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, an expert on Russia, the apparent defection of President Vladimir V. Putin and Russia's threat to exercise its veto was something of a repudiation of the administration's policy toward Russia. 
Even though Mr. Putin stepped up intelligence cooperation and made a profound strategic adjustment to welcome American forces into former Soviet territory on Afghanistan's northern flank, "No Russia expert can cite a net gain or a tangible benefit from Russia's relationship with the United States after Sept. 11," said Michael McFaul, a Russia specialist with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. 
As the hourglass empties on Iraq, the gap between Washington's disarmament demands and Europe's strategy for achieving them with "speeded up" inspections and "detailed timelines" seems very narrow. "Timelines" sounded very much like deadlines to give a final answer on where VX nerve gas and the mobile biological weapons labs are hidden. 
"These inspections cannot continue indefinitely," the European statement said. It failed to suggest an alternative that might form the basis of a reasonable offer to Mr. Bush, who appears to be under pressure to act quickly if only to stanch the slide in public support for the war and for his handling of foreign policy. 
For every diplomat who today said that compromise was still possible, another expressed pessimism. "This is now the endgame of a very complicated situation," Mr. Voigt said.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

Now Playing

* "ABOUT SCHMIDT," starring Jack Nicholson, Kathy Bates and Hope Davis. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 125 minutes). Mr. Nicholson's portrayal of Warren Schmidt, a retired insurance executive from Omaha at loose ends after the death of his wife, may be the most astonishing dramatic transformation of his 44-year screen career. Plodding in a weary, stiff-legged shuffle, this great actor reins in his bad-boy mannerisms to convey a deep, sorrowful awareness of human complexity. As the movie follows the attempts of this staid 66-year-old everyman to regain his equilibrium, it sustains an exquisite balance between a satire of Middle American life and the wrenching pathos of Warren's situation as he tries to form a bond with his resentful grown-up daughter (Ms. Davis). Much of the story takes place on the road from Nebraska to her wedding in Colorado. Ms. Bates has a flashy comic turn as the bridegroom's garrulous overbearing mother (Stephen Holden).

"ALL THE REAL GIRLS," starring Paul Schneider, Zooey Deschanel and Patricia Clarkson. Written and directed by David Gordon Green (R, 108 minutes). Mr. Green follows "George Washington," his luminous found fable of Southern childhood, with a more conventional story of young love. Mr. Schneider plays a small-town cad whose easygoing promiscuity is derailed by Ms. Deschanel, whose character has just returned home from boarding school. Their sweet, fumbling romance is captured with scruffy, low-key lyricism. The film is an awkward hybrid of free-form, do-it-yourself filmmaking and professional discipline (supplied by the wonderful Ms. Deschanel, and by Ms. Clarkson), but its beauty and sincerity overcome its flaws and hesitations (A. O. Scott).

"CHICAGO," starring Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere. Directed and choreographed by Rob Marshall (PG-13, 108 minutes). It's rare to find a picture as exuberant, as shallow -- and as exuberant about its shallowness -- as Mr. Marshall's film adaptation of the Broadway musical "Chicago." The movie, set in Prohibition-era Chicago as it follows the murder trial of the manipulative Kewpie doll RoxieHart (Ms. Zellweger), is tough, brittle fun. It's the raw expenditure of energy and the canniness of the staging that should pull audiences in and keep them rooted. This, of course, is undoubtedly the best way to present a movie take on Bob Fosse's digressive musical version of "Chicago." This new picture maintains the relentless spirit of Fosse's blunt suavity and the breathless, black-silk enthusiasm of Kander and Ebb's songs. Ms. Zeta-Jones, in Louise Brooks wig and ruthless smile, is Roxie's fellow felon and jailbird, Velma. She pumps her majestic long legs like the cylinders of a Corvette about to redline, but always knowing exactly when to stop short of throwing a piston. And as the big-ticket defense lawyer and jury barometer Billy Flynn, Mr. Gere has never been better, turning spoiled princeling arrogance into a witty revel (Elvis Mitchell).

* "CITY OF GOD," starring Alexandre Rodrigues, Leandro Firmino da Hora and Seu Jorge. Directed by Fernando Meirelles (R, 130 minutes; in Portuguese, with English subtitles). A scorching anecdotal history of gang warfare in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, "City of God" is narrated by Rocket (Mr. Rodrigues), a young photographer who chronicles the deterioration of the housing project in which he grew up from a shantytown into a war zone. The movie, which begins in the 1960's and ends in the early 80's, parallels Rocket's story with the rise of his childhood playmate, Li'l Ze (Mr. da Hora), from a petty thief into a ruthless drug dealer and neighborhood kingpin commanding a small army of gun-toting children. The history is told in a loose, tall-tale style that suggests a quasi-cinema-verite version of Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas" (Holden).

"DAREDEVIL," starring Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan. Written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson (PG-13, 96 minutes). Sometimes playing a comic-book hero gives actors a chance to show suave, stylized moves. After stripping off their civvies, they emerge from the phone booth a star. Christopher Reeve gave a breezy, farcical charge to Superman and Clark Kent. As Batman and his alter ego, the wastrel playboy Bruce Wayne, Michael Keaton seemed to have a thousand things on his mind, most of them unpleasant. But poor Ben Affleck is lost in the minor, passable "Daredevil," in which he portrays the blind, red-costumed and horn-headed crime fighter whose other senses -- hearing, touch, taste -- were exaggerated in the chemical accident that cost him his sight. A big man, Mr. Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role. Even his scarlet leather outfit makes him diminutive. The interlocked double D on his left breast makes him look like part of the food-service industry: "Hi, I'm Daredevil, and I'll be your superhero this evening" (Mitchell).

"DARK BLUE," starring Kurt Russell, Scott Speedman and Ving Rhames. Directed by Ron Shelton (R, 118 minutes). Mr. Russell, in his best performance in years, is Eldon Perry, a charming and utterly corrupt Los Angeles police detective who is part of a lawless cabal of brutal, bigoted cops. Mr. Shelton and the screenwriter David Ayer (who also wrote the similar "Training Day") conjure up an atmosphere of multicultural urban criminality and seething racial tension. It is 1992, and the city is perched on the edge of anarchy, holding its breath waiting for the verdict in the Rodney King beating trial. Unfortunately, the knot of plotlines involving Perry, his young partner (Mr. Speedman) and a reform-minded African-American deputy chief (Mr. Rhames) often slides into televisioncop-show contrivance. And the post-verdict riots, rather than throwing the fictional story into sharp relief, makes it feel curiously stale and irrelevant (Scott).

"FINAL DESTINATION 2," starring Ali Larter, A. J. Cook and Michael Landes. Directed by David R. Ellis (R, 97 minutes). This gleefully morbid sequel may, in the end, be as nonsensical as its title, but it's also much more imaginative. Ms. Larter is Clear Rivers, the sole survivor of the first "Final Destination," who has locked herself away to hide from the grisly death she is sure must be stalking her. Ms. Cook is Kimberly, who has foreseen, and escaped, a horrific traffic accident and is now similarly stalked. But death, which turns out to have a macabre and elaborate sense of humor, gets all the best material, and the filmmakers delight in staging a series of ghoulishly slapstick demises involving pigeons and refrigerator magnets as well as the more traditional exploding cars and out-of-control elevators. The spirit of the movie is best summed up in the following line, spoken by a television news reporter after one such death. "Ironically, the woman was impaled through the head after her air bag inflated." Ironically indeed (Scott).

* "GANGS OF NEW YORK," starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz. Directed by Martin Scorsese (R, 165 minutes). Long awaited, enormously expensive, endlessly gossiped about, Mr. Scorsese's brutal epic of mid-19th-century Manhattan is a near-great film that, as time goes by, may well make up the distance. As has happened before with this director's films, the fairly conventional story -- a revenge tragedy pitting a young Irish immigrant (Mr. DiCaprio) against his father's killer, a nativist warlord (Mr. Day-Lewis) -- is less interesting than the setting. Mr. Day-Lewis gives his character, known as Bill the Butcher, an earthy Shakespearean grandeur. In his mouth the rough vernacular of the old New York streets becomes poetry. If Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Diaz (in the underimagined role of a spirited pickpocket) don't shed their movie-star auras, they do show themselves to be intrepid and engaging actors. But the real achievement of the movie is the way it brings history to life, not merely by meticulously recreating its details but by offering a troubling and timely interpretation of how the violence and iniquity of the past continue to ramify into the present. The film, flawed and indelible, is nothing less than an attempt to reimagine the germs of America's historical identity. It suggests, with vivid plausibility, that clues to the national character can be found in the violent, contradictory and often tragic story of the urban immigrant working class (Scott).

"HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS," starring Kate Hudson, Matthew McConaughey and Bebe Neuwirth. Directed by Donald Petrie (PG-13, 100 minutes). Yet another mediocre New York romantic comedy, yes, but notably less mediocre than "Maid in Manhattan" and "Two Weeks Notice." This is because Ms. Hudson and Mr. McConaughey are an energetic, well-matched comic pair and because the writers have smuggled a few sharp, funny jokes into the lockstep conventions of the plot. The premise, too, has a nice frost of screwball cynicism, as the two principals woo each other for venal, professional reasons. Ben (Mr. McConaughey), a tomcatting ad man, must make a woman fall in love with him if he is to win a big account; to write a feature story for a women's magazine, Andie (Ms. Hudson) must drive a man away. Would you believe that they actually fall in love? Nobody would, but it's sometimes fun to pretend, just as it's fun to pretend that the advertising and magazine industries are untouched by recession, the Knicks are in the N.B.A. finals and Staten Island is full of people who talk as if they're from Texas (Scott).

"THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE," starring Kevin Spacey. Directed by Alan Parker (R, 130 minutes). In this would-be thriller, Mr. Spacey plays a death-penalty opponent facing execution for murder. As the title character, a downtrodden philosophy professor and activist who has become an alcoholic criminal, he evinces a weariness in his voice. The words float out of his mouth as if he were too tired to muster the strength for a single inflection, and this gives the picture the merest trace of believability. But that's before the crude, bullying narrative begins peppering the audience with kidney punches: "David Gale" may be the first liberal-leaning movie that could be brought up on assault charges since its director made "Midnight Express." Mr. Parker seems to think audiences are incapable of coming to their own conclusions, so he relieves them of that burden by doing it for them (Mitchell).

"LOST IN LA MANCHA," with Terry Gilliam. Written and directed by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe (R, 89 minutes). After watching this fascinating and compelling new documentary, you may forever wonder how it is that movies are made at all. "Lost" may not be a great piece of filmmaking, but it is a great story; its directors display dramatic intelligence. "Lost" is an inside view of how a film -- in this case, Mr. Gilliam's "Man Who Killed Don Quixote" -- can fall to pieces, even under the guidance of a master director. Imagine watching a real-life version of Ian McKellen's kindly, indomitable Gandalf in "The Lord of the Rings" give his life for his cause, only to find that his supreme gesture is meaningless because his fellows are slaughtered anyway. That's what "Lost" is like. What's clear and astonishingly entertaining about "Lost" is that the directors' only good luck was that they happened to be safely behind the scenes when epic mishaps struck on the set -- and they struck so often that Beelzebub probably put in for overtime (Mitchell).

"THE RECRUIT," starring Al Pacino, Colin Farrell and Bridget Moynahan. Directed by Roger Donaldson (PG-13, 105 minutes). The C.I.A. setting, the utterly predictable plot twists, the chase scenes and the climactic bout of gunplay may suggest a thriller, but really this slick and pointless exercise belongs to a more specialized genre: the Al Pacino crazy-mentor picture. This time Mr. Pacino is Walter Burke, whose job is to recruit and train intelligence operatives. "I have a scary eye for talent," he says. What Mr. Pacino displays is his peculiar, and often amusing, gift for ranting, spluttering and braying, and his wildly unpredictable, borderline-incoherent performance is the only interesting thing in the movie. Mr. Farrell, as Burke's troubled protege, James Clayton, an M.I.T. graduate student who seems to have misplaced his shaving kit in all the excitement, works very hard without producing anything like the casual, nutty intensity Mr. Pacino can summon so effortlessly. Ms. Moynahan is James's fellow trainee and love interest, who may or may not be a mole (Scott).

* "SPIDER," starring Ralph Fiennes, Miranda Richardson and Gabriel Byrne. Directed by David Cronenberg (R, 98 minutes). This bleak minimalist film adapted from Patrick McGrath's novel (with a screenplay by the author) crawls into the mind of Dennis Cleg (Mr. Fiennes), a paranoid-schizophrenic man in his 30's who is discharged from a mental hospital into a grim halfway house near where he grew up in East London. The desolate urban environment mirrors the mental condition of a man whose warped memories of a homicide two decades earlier come flooding back as he revisits childhood landmarks. Mr. Fiennes's mumbling, agitated psychotic is an uncompromising portrait of a sad, creepy wreck. Ms. Richardson is equally disturbing in the dual roles of his demure mother and a Cockney tart, who personify the mother-whore dichotomy that obsesses Dennis. The recurrent imagery of spider webs, jigsaw puzzles and tangled string adds a layer of poetic creepiness (Holden).

HEADLINE: JOURNEYS; 
Their Little Secret, But for How Long?

BYLINE:  By JANELLE BROWN 

 BODY:
THE tiny fishing village of Sayulita, Mexico, just an hour's drive north of Puerto Vallarta, is still only a footnote in most travel guides, which give it a half-page at most. But to those visitors who have discovered its charms in recent years -- the uncluttered white beaches, the tidy surf break, the amiable fishermen gutting their catch by the sea, the tranquil town square with its rustic taco stands and tortillerias -- there's only one thing wrong with Sayulita.
 It's beginning to get a little too popular. 
 Sleepy Sayulita is in danger of becoming a hot spot, and the longtime winter resident and newcomers alike sit in their vacation homes, suspiciously eyeing the construction taking place farther down the beach and worrying that the authentic local way of life will vanish if more people arrive. 
"We know Sayulita is being discovered, and it's inevitable," said Janet Jamieson, a 57-year-old Oregonian and six-year resident who, with her husband, spends several months a year in Mexico. She sat on the hillside deck of her Sayulita villa and sighed. "The first time I saw a bagel here I thought, 'Oh no, it's happening,' " she said. "Now you have espresso stands, Internet cafes, a fancy galleria. And building, everywhere. We think of Puerto Vallarta, and just hope Sayulita can still retain its flavor of a fishing village." 
Thirty years ago, when the first adventurous American surfers trickled in, Sayulita was a poor fishing village, cut off from the rest of Mexico by jungle. (Locals still refer to anything beyond their immediate hills as "the other side.") Although the town has certainly modernized since, it retains its traditional lifestyle: residents buy fish off the beach, chicken from the woman in the square, and everything else (mops, strainers, plastic chairs) from the trucks that occasionally drive around town. Getting to the swimming beach requires a walk through the graveyard, past the tombstone somberly inscribed "Woody: Gone Surfing."
Five years ago, however, a highway was built connecting Sayulita to Puerto Vallarta, and the tourists really started arriving. Almost overnight, Sayulita became a "hidden" getaway for adventurous Americans -- mainly preretirement boomers and 20-something surfers -- who liked the absence of high-rise hotels, tacky tourist nightclubs and swim-up bars. There are also no banks, police force, post office or decent grocery store. Regular visitors, like the Jamiesons, even got involved in the local community: helping to clean up the beach and to rebuild the plaza, opening a veterinary clinic and teaching English classes.
The population of year-round American expatriates has grown to more than 100 now, in a town of 1,700, and during the winter 500 more arrive at vacation homes and stay for weeks or months. Their numbers have been increasing by 28 percent a year, according to local vacation rental companies, and that doesn't include the many surfers who stay at little inns near the beach. The jungle hills above the village, once filled only with scorpions and wild parrots, are now busy with construction crews building $500,000 five-bedroom villas with panoramic views, all intended for the "extranjero" (the polite local term for foreigner) market.
Those who came in the first wave, just a few years back, are already nostalgic for the way the town once was. Patricia and Pablo Southworth left Portland, Ore., six years ago, with their sons, Tyler and Ryan, looking specifically for a home where they might mix with the locals and avoid throngs of tourists. They opened Capitan Pablos, a multifaceted establishment where one can not only rent a surfboard, but drink a margarita, arrange a fishing or snorkeling trip and eat fresh ceviche.
Aware of their own contribution to the tourist industry, the Southworths are still astonished by how fast the town has grown. "When we got here it was a simple village of thatch-roofed houses, fishing and farming, only a few restaurants, no one in construction," Mrs. Southworth said. "There wasn't a chair to be had on the beach. There was no tourism. It was great. I wish it could have stayed that way."
Of course, Sayulita is still a long way from becoming Puerto Vallarta, where wall-to-wall hotels block the views and beaches are packed with children trying to sell knickknacks to the sunburned hordes. But developers and investors have definitely discovered Sayulita, and since 1999 real estate has been snapped up so fast that the price of land has doubled and is still rising. At real estate offices in town, you can peruse the plans for numerous upcoming "exclusive" developments of luxury houses with heated pools and room for live-in maids. And right now, to the consternation of locals who are trying to block its construction, there is the beginning of a six-story luxury condominium complex being built by a company called Villa Amor on the south end of the beach. It's hard to miss: the complex is one of the few buildings along the shoreline that isn't capped with a straw roof.
IN a faded tropical shirt and flip-flops, with carefully coifed sun-bleached hair and ruddy skin, Ron Ingram, the 51-year-old developer of the complex (and other local real estate projects over the 27 years that he has been involved here), looks more like a surfer than a real estate baron. Mr. Ingram, who divides his time between Sayulita and Southern California, dismisses the idea that his projects are somehow spoiling this little corner of paradise. 
"There is a negative sentiment that we're a huge developer, that sort of thing," he said. "But when I got to town the local people had no cars, no electricity. Now, their standard of living has improved, kids are getting better education and more opportunities, learning two or three languages."
Despite the widespread concern about development, Mr. Ingram does have a point. Local Mexicans tend to agree that the economic boom has done wonders for their living standards, which may be why so many seem little concerned about the Villa Amor complex or other developments.
Whether or not the growth so far has been good for the local economy, the urgent question at hand is how to deal with growth in the future: when should it stop? The Southworths, for their part, have tried to curb construction in the area. Two years ago, with a group of locals and expatriates, they helped hire a Mexico City lawyer to come down and examine the development taking place. That eventually led to a moratorium on building in areas north or south of town -- but not in Sayulita itself -- unless the builder had a rock-solid ecological-impact report.
"We felt strongly that someone has got to do something or this place will be ruined -- we'll end up with high-rises all along the beach, like Cancun," Mrs. Southworth said. 
But Sayulita is still largely a lawless place. Not only are there no police officers in town, there are also no mayor, city council, town assembly or anyone remotely in charge that might curb or direct development in the area. The town is ruled, at least in the loosest sense of the word, by the county government in Valle -- or, as the locals say, on "the other side."
"Everyone wants this place to stay a little jewel, but if there's no law the developers get away with it," said Mark Holt, an American who has lived in Sayulita for five years and who is the proprietor, with his Sayulita-born wife, Dora, of the Sayulita Fish Tacos restaurant. "We don't have a town planning commission, which is what we need."
While there are plans in place, promoted both by extranjeros and Mexican locals, to develop a town architectural review board, residents now communicate their concerns mostly through old-fashioned petitions, though ultimately they have no one in authority to receive them. These petitions seem to amplify the tensions between American-fueled gentrification and those who want to keep Sayulita just the way it is. While there are plenty of Mexican and expatriate locals who signed the petition to stop the building by Villa Amor, for example, there are also the expatriates who started a petition to halt the ear-splitting Saturday-night dance parties in the soccer field on the edge of town that are popular with local teenagers. One American tried to circulate a petition demanding a leash law to keep dogs from running free on the beach; some Mexican locals, in turn, circulated a petition demanding that the American be thrown out of town.
All of which has stirred resentment among locals and expatriates and vacationers but hasn't had much impact on the plans that will really accelerate Sayulita's growth. The highway that will soon be built along the coast, for example, linking Sayulita with its high-class neighbor Punta de Mita (a few miles away and home of an enormous Four Seasons resort) or the destination golf course being built just outside Sayulita or the 75-house subdivision planned on the edge of town.
In the meantime, those who keep coming and believing that they have discovered a hidden paradise futilely hope that they might be the last to arrive.
"Everyone wants to see the door closed behind them," Mrs. Southworth said. "You either like it or leave it. If it gets too crowded, we'll just find another town without so many extranjeros, and move."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
The Masters of the French Masters Were Spanish

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
WITH the arrival of the star-studded "Manet/Velazquez," now open at the Metropolitan, we might pause briefly to notice what's going on around town. Half of the great museums in Europe and across the United States suddenly seem to have been emptied out and the art shipped to New York. Never mind the bad economy, declining foreign tourism and the high costs of insurance after 9/11. The big news is that the Met and the Modern have managed loan shows like "Matisse Picasso" and "Leonardo Da Vinci: Master Draftsman." And now this, which is at least as spectacular.
 I can't remember the last time the city's large art museums simultaneously had such extravagant loan exhibitions. The world is changing. This moment may pass. We shouldn't take it for granted. 
 I begin in gratitude partly because that is the natural first response to seeing so many works by Velazquez, the greatest painter who ever lived. I like Rubens's remark, which I'm sure is apocryphal. Rubens, who considered himself the leading painter alive, went to Madrid in the 1620's and met the young Velazquez, with whom he had corresponded. "Oh," he supposedly said after seeing Velazquez's art. "I didn't know about him." 
After Manet saw Velazquez, he said he didn't know why anyone even bothered to paint. Fortunately, he also said that the sight of Velazquez's paintings gave him "enormous hope and courage," which is what great artists do for other artists; and the Met exhibition auspiciously begins with Manet's portrait of Jean-Baptiste Faure, the opera singer, in the role of Hamlet, beside Velazquez's portrait of Pablo de Valladolid, the court jester, which inspired it.
I heard unpromising reports about this show when it was in Paris. The local organizers apparently stressed too many minor compatriots to illustrate the widespread influence of Velazquez, Murillo and other Spanish painters on 19th-century French art, which is the show's thesis, a truism of art history that hardly seemed necessary to prove, anyway.
The Met and its curator, Gary Tinterow, have clearly called in every chip to make this version better. The first rooms are a virtual survey of great Spanish painting of the 17th and 18th centuries; after that comes a virtual Manet retrospective, with some Degas and Courbet thrown in for good measure; then a virtual 19th-century American overview of the most gifted portraitists influenced by Spanish painting via Manet, Degas and Courbet: Eakins, Chase, Sargent and Whistler. The level of painting is almost absurdly high throughout. Let me dispense with a few equivocations. The general theme is still not a novelty, and the scholastic excuse of tracking influence here casts Velazquez, Ribera, Zurbaran, El Greco and Goya awkwardly in the supporting role of precursors to modernism, sublime artists enrolled to buttress later talents, a skewed way to acknowledge their value, which should be self-evident.
Nor does the show, being academically diligent, avoid French second-raters who absorbed Spanish art, although they are given comparatively short shrift. All shows these days could be smaller. This one is no exception.
Finally, beautiful though the American art is, even apt at the Met, it belies the show's subtitle, "the French taste for Spanish painting," leading the exhibition down an exquisite byway, which feels slightly tacked on at the end.
Having said all that, the best art is so inspiring and Mr. Tinterow illustrates the show's main theme in such precise and fresh detail, discreetly, without pushing comparisons (in that respect it's not like "Matisse Picasso," notwithstanding the coincidental title pairings), that you would have to be churlish not to leave edified and amazed.
The first room of Spanish paintings is, by itself, one of the finest displays of old master art the city has had in years: you grasp instantly why the works of Velazquez, Ribera and Zurbaran made such an impact on artists like Courbet and Manet, which, I suppose, is the argument for bringing the best possible Spanish art here.
The effect of this influence was to turn French art toward gritty realism. Ribera's club-footed "Beggar," the essence of coarse humanity, elevated by divine painting, is an obvious model.
More curious is that an artist like Zurbaran, whose austere and profound literalness made him seem anachronistic in his own time, would seem modern to French artists in the 19th century for those same qualities. His "Saint Casilda," with its flat pattern and deep space, the saint's delicate head tilted questioningly toward us, looks almost gothic.
But this quality is what made her seem strangely worldly to the French in the 1830's and later. That is how taste works sometimes.
Mr. Tinterow writes in the show's introductory wall text that 19th-century French artists, seeing Spanish art through a modern lens, progressively shifted from "idealism to realism, from Italy to Spain, from Renaissance to Baroque, from carefully finished porcelainlike surfaces to the sketch aesthetic of Impressionism."
So the exhibition tracks an arc of increasing French absorption, starting in the 18th century, when there were few Spanish pictures in France. Velazquez was hypothetically esteemed but nowhere visible. Zurbaran and El Greco were unknown. The only painting by Zurbaran in France was misattributed to Ribera. Diderot, in his "Encyclopedie," wrote about eight schools of European painting, none of which was Spanish.
Then Napoleon invaded Spain and Spanish art was shipped in bulk to France. Delacroix as a schoolboy saw the paintings in the Louvre. Much of the art had to be returned after Napoleon was ousted. But Marshal Jean de Dieu Soult, the commander of Napoleon's French army in Seville, having seized many paintings, took them back with him to Paris and kept them. His house became the de facto Galerie Espagnole in France until King Louis-Philippe sent Baron Isidore Taylor to Spain in the 1830's to acquire pictures for an official Galerie Espagnole at the Louvre. 
The collection Taylor put together included dozens of El Grecos, Murillos, Zurbarans and Goyas. Dovetailing with a vogue for all things Spanish, it made an immense impression on artists like Courbet. Manet, who visited the gallery as a teenager, never forgot it.
At the Met, the Spanish pictures all have pedigrees linked to this history: they were seized by Napoleon, owned by Soult, purchased by Taylor for the king or viewed, one way or another, by French artists later. Louis-Philippe was dethroned in 1848 and his collection returned to him, leaving the Louvre temporarily with only about a dozen Spanish paintings. But by then, provincial French museums and various private collectors in Paris, like the Comte de Pourtales-Gorgier and Lord Hertford, had amassed Spanish collections. 
French artists now also traveled abroad to see Spanish art. Manet went to Madrid in 1865, although he had already painted Spanish pictures like "Dead Toreador" and "Monk at Prayer," which at the Met is paired with its source, Zurbaran's "St. Francis in Meditation," from the inventory of Louis-Philippe's gallery.
Zurbaran's saint obviously fulfilled theatricalizing French fantasies at the time about dark, mystical Spain. This is not a picture of Francis cheerfully singing with the birds. It's a harsh, slightly terrifying image, the ecstatically upturned eyes of the saint shrouded in a massive habit whose rough fabric Zurbaran painstakingly describes, casting hard light on a skull Francis clutches to his breast. The saint's open mouth and the skull's eye sockets are black pools, light picking out the figure from darkness that then swallows it back up.
The influence on Manet was direct: with his monk, he painted the skull and dark cloak and isolated the figure kneeling against a bare brown backdrop. But the differences are instructive: there's the black outline, flattening form, stressing pigment as independent agent; the face, sculptured in paint, illuminated by spotlight, picks out vivid pink, yellow and green, a modern palette. 
The expression is also almost sour, the eyes shut or nearly so, as if the monk, struggling to concentrate, noticed out of the corner of his eye the skull on the floor to his side the way you might glimpse a rat scurrying along the wall.
Manet's figures, though isolated like Zurbaran's, are more specifically about the here and now. His "Philosopher (Beggar in a Cloak)," with one hand extended, striding forward, seems to step straight into our space. Colors vibrate: red beret, blue jacket and brown duffle coat. Pigment dissolves flesh into freestanding brushstrokes. The head, pasty and patchwork, is like an actor's: vivid, particular, stagy, somewhat exaggerated and of this moment. The affectation is rakish.
Carried a step further a work like this could become Sargent's "Dr. Pozzi at Home," which is all style, color and immediacy.
Immediacy is also a quality of Goya's art. It is visible in the miraculous little portrait of an artist, Asensio Julia, a picture of rushing air and rustling fabric, arrested by minute detail: the sheen on his silk stockings, the touch of red paint on a brush in a bowl at Asensio's feet. You see the same arrested movement in the frozen tension of a bull and bullfighter, facing off, blood pouring from the picador's gored horse, an image Manet imitated but with intensified light and color. 
Manet's inspiration for his "Beggar" was "Aesop," by Velazquez, which, like all profound art, defies complete explanation. You see the difference here between Manet's drama and Velazquez's truth. Compared to Velazquez, Manet admitted, other painters "seem completely like fakers."
Everything in the picture is perfectly measured, the weight of the baggy eyelids, of the hand resting in the cloak, of the body turned at the hip. The figure balances on a foot turned casually on its edge. 
Velazquez discreetly orchestrates our gaze by painting a big sweeping curve that stretches from the open collar of Aesop's cloak down and across his chest to the hip and to the book he supports with a crooked finger, whose visual purpose is to turn our eye back upward into the picture. The expression on the face is unforced, unsentimental, exact and detached but at the same time engaging.
It seems to reach across the ages. The writer Ortega y Gasset said Velazquez's work "isn't art; it is life perpetuated."
I think something Lucian Freud once observed about Rembrandt describes the same effect. "You feel you are privileged," he said, because the artist "is giving you an ennobling insight into the nature of people. I don't mean he has made the people seem virtuous, but I mean it is ennobling to be told something so truthful."
Great art is always about human nature. This show is full of truths about life.

"Manet/Velazquez: The French Taste for Spanish Painting" remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through June 8.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 11, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An art review in Weekend on Friday about "Manet/Velazquez" at the Metropolitan Museum misidentified the Manet painting paired with Velazquez's portrait "The Jester Pablo de Valladolid" at the beginning of the exhibition. It is "Tragic Actor (Rouviere as Hamlet)," not "Faure in the Role of Hamlet," which is also in the show.

HEADLINE: European Central Bank Cuts Rates a Quarter Point 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 6 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank trimmed interest rates by a quarter point today, disappointing those who had hoped for a more vigorous response to the Continent's lingering economic malaise.
 In reducing the benchmark rate to 2.5 percent -- its second cut in three months -- the bank said it was reacting to persistent signs of weakness in Europe's major countries and to the war clouds gathering over Iraq, which have driven the euro up sharply against the United States dollar. 
 The bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, left the door open for further cuts, saying the uncertainty over a war and how it might reverberate in Europe made it impossible to set longer-term monetary policy.
"The consequences of a war can go in many directions," Mr. Duisenberg said at a news conference in Frankfurt. "The governing council stands ready to act decisively and in a timely manner." 
The Bank of England, which cut rates last month, chose to hold firm today, at a rate of 3.75 percent. The bank's governor, Sir Eddie George, ruffled feathers here last month when he called on the European bank to pay more attention to economic growth in setting policy. 
The Swiss central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark rate today, by a half point.
Investors, anticipating a cut for weeks, had hoped the European Central Bank would take a bolder step. Stock markets tumbled in Frankfurt and Paris, while the euro resumed its upward march versus the dollar.
"The last time they cut rates, they said it was bigger than usual because of all the uncertainty," said Elisabeth Andreae, an economist with Commerzbank. "Given the uncertainty today, they should have done the same thing again. For Germany, a bigger cut would have been helpful."
Analysts said the bank's modest cut was a compromise between opposing camps on its 18-member governing council: one that favored doing nothing until the showdown between the United States and Iraq is resolved, and one that favored cutting rates more deeply.
"You saw a public debate among council members prior to this meeting; that hasn't happened very often in the four years that we've had the E.C.B.," said Allan Saunderson, the Frankfurt-based chairman of EuroZone Advisors, a consulting firm that follows the bank.
Mr. Duisenberg, who foreshadowed a rate cut last month, is thought to have favored a reduction of half a point. He declined to discuss his personal preferences or those of other council members. 
Such discretion grows out of the bank's desire, as a young institution, to build credibility in political and financial circles. But as Europe's big economies continue to drift, the bank's united front has begun to show cracks. Critics, inside and outside, are questioning its relentless focus on inflation at a time when the biggest danger, at least in Germany, is deflation. 
"Demand is dead in the water in France and Germany," Mr. Saunderson said. "It is crazy to believe inflation can be a risk anytime soon."
New statistics showed how deep the troubles run in Germany, Europe's No. 1 economy. Unemployment rose sharply in February, to 4.7 million people. The increase of 67,000 was greater than most estimates, and reflected more than the seasonal winter downturn.
German companies remain reluctant to invest, partly because of jitters over Iraq and partly because the government has not announced long-promised changes in the nation's hidebound economy. 
The weakness extends beyond Germany. The European Commission reported today that the 12 countries in the monetary union grew an average rate of 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002. Mr. Duisenberg said he expected growth of no more than 1 percent this year.
"The speed of the rise in unemployment is pretty breathtaking, both in Germany and France," Mr. Saunderson said.
Because the bank sets monetary policy for 12 countries, with divergent rates of economic growth and inflation, its rates cannot be tailored perfectly to every country. Many economists contend that they are too high for Germany, which has little growth and almost no inflation.
Germany accounts for a third of the economic output of the euro zone, while Germany and France together account for more than half. Some critics say the bank should relax its stance to stimulate these countries, even if it risks fueling inflation in the smaller, faster-growing countries.
Others, not surprisingly, disagree.
The finance minister of Greece, Nikos Christodoulakis, welcomed the decision, saying the new rate "better reflects the economic situation." 
"It balances the euro exchange rate and takes into account the geographical uncertainties, which have increased with the prospect of war."
In Greece, where inflation is running above 3 percent, some commercial banks said they probably would ignore the rate cut, leaving their lending fees higher to reap more profits from hungry borrowers.

HEADLINE: Australia Keeps Bypassing Pitfalls of Global Economy 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

 BODY:
Not for nothing is Australia called the lucky country.
 While other industrialized countries struggle to manage any sort of economic growth, Australia is in its 12th consecutive year of expansion. 
 Sluggish exports, the worst drought on record and the cooling of what was once a hot real estate market have undoubtedly slowed growth this year, but even with all that, economists predict that Australia's economy will expand by a respectable 3 percent in 2003.
Australia has gone longer without a recession than at any time in its history, and it has exceeded even the United States' longest recorded expansion, from 1991 to 2001. 
Who deserves the credit for this remarkable streak? Is it the work of deft fiscal and monetary management, or the clairvoyance of some antipodean Alan Greenspan?
"Pure luck," said Chew Ping, associate director of sovereign ratings at Standard & Poor's, which raised Australia's foreign currency credit rating last month to AAA, the same as the United States, for the first time since 1986.
Somehow, Australia has managed to sidestep the falling pianos of the global economy. It followed the United States into and out of recession in 1990 and 1991, but since then it has avoided the contagion of the Asian currency and financial crises, the technology bust and the pall thrown over the global economy by terrorism, and it has apparently defied the gravity of its own economic cycle. 
Australia's 19 million people now enjoy a higher disposable income than residents of Britain, Germany or Japan. Unemployment is 6.1 percent, almost a 20-year low.
Perpetual prosperity does not guarantee happiness even in Australia, and there is more than a little gloom about the immediate future. Its troops are poised to join the forces of the United States if there is a war in Iraq, and its citizens are worried about more terrorist attacks after the bombing in Bali last October that killed 88 Australians. Brushfires in the drought-sered countryside have burned acreage the size of Texas, claiming at least 5 lives and 530 homes.
Accordingly, the most-watched index of consumer sentiment fell in February to its lowest point in two years, lower even than it was immediately after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
"Australians read the papers," said Nigel Stapledon, chief economist at Westpac Bank in Sydney, which sponsors the index with the Melbourne Institute.
The mood is not sunny in Australia's stock market, either. After falling 12 percent last year, the S.&P. /ASX 200 index of blue-chip stocks is down about 7.7 percent so far this year, and has been plumbing lows unseen since 1999.
But economists say Australia's stock market is more reflective of conditions abroad than at home. The country's four biggest banks, whose overseas investments have taken a beating, account for 25 percent of the index; big mining companies, which earn most of their income abroad, account for another 10 percent. 
Consumers in other countries may know Australia best for its beer, dairy and wool products, but Australia's economy relies very little on exports. Of the 30 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, only 3 are less export-dependent -- Greece, the United States and Japan. Agriculture looms large in the country's image but accounts for only about 3.5 percent of output, economists say.
As in the United States, domestic consumers are the main pillar of the economy, and Australians are still spending despite their recent pessimism. Retail sales grew 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter, seasonally adjusted. Corporate profits were up 21 percent in the third quarter, the most recent period for which figures are available, in contrast to the period in 2001.
The ripple effect from the stock market's problems, meanwhile, are less in Australia, because individual investors tended to put a smaller share of their assets in stocks than Americans did, even when the market was booming.
Australians buy real estate instead, and are facing the end of an 18-month boom, touched off when the government began giving first-time home buyers a $4,300 tax rebate as an election-year incentive. The rebate was phased out in July but the boom kept going, propelling housing prices up 17 percent in a year.
Now, though, just as housing demand is cooling, capital investment is increasing, economists say. "I think there'll be a big spike," Mr. Chew at Standard & Poor's said.
Most of the groundwork for this well-tempered economy, economists said, was laid in the 1980's and 1990's. Australia floated its currency in 1983, deregulated its financial system in 1984, sharply reduced import tariffs in 1988 and again in 1991, and scrapped a system of government-imposed wage controls in 1992. In 1996, the government gave the central bank independence to pursue an inflation target.
"This transition allowed a great deal of flexibility in adapting to the possibilities of cheap computing and cheap telecommunications," John Edwards, chief economist at HSBC Bank in Sydney, said.
As a result, productivity surged in the 1990's.
When a financial crisis scorched its trading partners in Southeast Asia in 1997 and 1998, Australia quickly found new markets in Britain, China and New Zealand. When the technology bubble burst in the United States, Australia was also spared: though it readily adopts technology, Australia has almost no technology industry of its own.
To be sure, there are factors to worry about. The recent weakness of the American dollar has spelled trouble for exporters like the mining companies whose goods trade worldwide in American dollars. But most of Australia's major trading partners have seen their currencies appreciate against the American dollar, so Australia has lost little of its competitiveness on that account.
Even the rapid run-up in energy prices, economists say, poses little risk to Australia's economy. Fuel prices are rising, but over all, Australia is a net energy exporter, rich in coal and natural gas, and may gain more than it loses from high prices.
In general, Australia has much to show for its luck. Last year, for the first time, Australians invested more in the United States than Americans invested in Australia. The government is talking about paying off the public debt. Best of all, meteorologists say rainfall is returning to normal, quenching the country's drought.
Which raises the question of why the world does not hear a lot more crowing from Down Under. "Endless self-congratulation doesn't suit our national personality," said Mr. Edwards at HSBC. Besides, he said, Australians know luck is a fickle thing: "I guess there's a fear that if we talk about it, it'll go away."

HEADLINE: Weak February for Retailers; The Weather Gets the Blame 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Snowstorms kept shoppers out of stores in February as Wal-Mart Stores posted sluggish sales and other retailers reported sharp declines or missed targets today.
 The months ahead do not look much better. Target and Sears, Roebuck forecast a lackluster March; a late Easter holiday, in April, could curb sales this month, and consumers worried about war and a sluggish economy are likely to defer big spending. 
 Wal-Mart, the No. 1 retailer, said sales at stores open at least a year rose 2.6 percent, close to the lower end of its original forecast, which called for a 2 percent to 4 percent increase.
Target, Sears, Limited Brands and J. C. Penney all posted lower sales for the month.
Goldman, Sachs said its retail composite index was unchanged in February. 
"The weather was a factor in February, as well as difficult comparisons, but right in the mix is the weakening consumer confidence," said Frank Badillo, a senior economist with Retail Forward. "It will play a factor into March and as long as uncertainty about the war lingers."
Gap Inc., parent of Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy stores, said sales rose 8 percent, below the company's expectations; it had previously said the spring shopping season was off to a slow start. Target, the second-largest discount chain behind Wal-Mart, said February sales slipped 1.4 percent; it expects March to be flat to negative, citing a later Easter.
Easter is April 20 this year, three weeks later than last year. That will probably mean that March sales will compare poorly with March 2002. 
The weakness in March sales could be recouped in April, however. "March results will likely be distorted because of the Easter shift," said Kevin Tawes, an analyst with Independence Investments. "We'll have to wait until April is over and add March's results to it to get a true sense of things."
Department stores, which have been struggling to compete with discounters, were hit particularly hard in February after Washington's Birthday weekend sales were quashed by bad weather.
Sales at department stores open at least a year were down 5.6 percent, Goldman, Sachs estimated.
The largest department store operator, Sears, said its February sales slid 9.4 percent. It forecast that sales would fall by an amount in the high-single-digit percentage range in March, its 19th consecutive month of declining sales.
Federated Department Stores, parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, said its February sales fell 6.8 percent, and J. C. Penney said its sales fell 2.1 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Dow Tumbles After Release of Report on Jobless Claims

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Discouraging news on jobless claims sent stocks lower yesterday for the third day in four. The Dow Jones industrials lost more than 100 points, falling to a five-month low.
 "The economic news of the past several weeks paints the same picture -- the economy has moved off its bottom but it's still sluggish," said Russ Koesterich, United States equity strategist at the State Street Corporation in Boston. 
 "The market is looking for corporate revenue to increase," he said, "but there's no evidence of that occurring yet." 
Uneasiness about the situation with Iraq was again an underlying cause of the market's malaise.
The Dow fell 101.61 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 7,673.99. The loss more than erasedits 70-point gain from Wednesday. The Dow is at its lowest level since Oct. 10, when it closed at 7,533.95.
The broader market also finished lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell 11.51 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,302.89. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 7.75 points, or 0.9 percent, to 822.10.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week by a seasonally adjusted 12,000, to 430,000, their highest level of the year. It was the third week that layoffs increased; analysts were expecting claims to decrease.
In a separate report, however, the department said productivity rose at a revised annual rate of 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter. That was a turnaround from the 0.2 percent rate of decline reported a month ago.
And a third report from the Commerce Department showed orders to factories rose 2.1 percent in January, the best showing in six months, and up from an increase of 0.3 percent in December.
The mixed economic news weighed on a hesitant market worried about growing tensions with Iraq and North Korea.
The United Nations remained divided yesterday over a proposed United States-backed resolution authorizing war against Iraq. Britain explored a compromise to amend the proposal and give the government of Saddam Hussein one final deadline to disarm, while President Bush scheduled a prime-time news conference yesterday to help prepare the nation for the prospect of war.
The Dow is now less than 400 points above its five-year closing low of 7,286.27, reached on Oct. 9.
Shares of retailers fell after several reported disappointing sales in February, citing war worries and the severe winter weather in the Northeast. Sears, Roebuck slid 70 cents, to $19.30, while Wal-Mart Stores fell 48 cents, to $47.40.
"There are a number of signs the U.S. consumer is becoming more selective, such as sluggish sales," said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist for CIBC World Markets. "At the same time, for the markets to focus on corporate recovery to drive investment, you need early resolution of the situation with Iraq."
Tyson Foods dropped 83 cents, to $7.70, after it lowered its second-quarter earnings outlook.
Raytheon lost $1.49, to $25.42, after it reaffirmed its 2003 financial outlook but said profits next year might fall as much as 11 percent, citing higher pension costs.
Gainers included Circuit City, which rose 5 cents, to $4.38, after it raised its fiscal fourth-quarter profit outlook.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers about 9 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was light.
Treasury bond prices retreated yesterday, breaking an eight-session streak of increases.
The benchmark 10-year note dropped 6/32, to a price of 101 27/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.65 percent from 3.63 percent on Wednesday.
The 30-year bond dropped 14/32, to 110 16/32. Its yield climbed to 4.70 percent from 4.66 percent.

HEADLINE: Lawmaker Proposes a Measure to Restrain Tuition Increases 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
Rattling universities nationwide, a Republican lawmaker responsible for shepherding higher education policy through the House has proposed penalizing those that raise tuition too quickly, possibly by denying them the aid that their students receive from the government and spend on college.
 The legislator is Representative Howard P. McKeon of California, chairman of the House subcommittee debating the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which covers student aid programs. He says he wants to curb what he calls "the unforgivable problem" of escalating college tuition. 
 "This is a frightening trend," Mr. McKeon said. "And no matter how you look at it, these phenomenal increases are hindering access to higher education." 
With state budgets squeezed, tuition increases at public universities this academic year, which generally outpaced those at private universities, often exceeded 10 percent, according to a study last month by the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education. Public university tuition was up 19 percent in North Carolina, 20 percent in Iowa, Missouri and Texas. Massachusetts topped the list, at 24 percent.
To stem the tide, Mr. McKeon has called for colleges and universities to be required to submit detailed explanations to the federal government any time their tuition and fees increase twice as fast as inflation, whose current annual rate is about 2.6 percent. Along with the explanation would be a plan outlining how the college intended to hold down tuition in the future. 
But if tuition rose for another year at twice the rate of inflation, the government would impose sanctions, perhaps by going so far as to strip the entire campus of its eligibility for student aid programs, including loans, grants and work-study.
The proposal has brought an angry response from universities, many of which say the sanctions would only end up hurting the students whom Mr. McKeon seeks to protect.
"Does anyone really believe that taking away student loans, grants and work-study programs from college students and their families in the middle of their academic careers will make college more affordable or accessible for them?" said David L. Warren, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.
Educators also complain that the proposal would put the burden entirely on the colleges and students themselves instead of placing some on state legislatures, dozens of which cut higher education spending last year, prompting tuition increases at public universities.
"Rather than choosing to address the root cause of the revenue shortfalls that have forced many institutions to cut costs, scale back programs and raise tuitions," the American Council on Education said in a statement, "this bill will instead tell the American people that there is indeed such a thing as a 'free lunch.' "
In recognition that public universities sometimes have no choice but to raise tuition when state budgets are cut, Mr. McKeon's aides say the final bill will most likely leave wiggle room in certain cases, among other things allowing the Education Department discretion over what sanctions are appropriate, and when.

HEADLINE: War Jitters Hurting Some but Helping Others in Gulf Region 

BYLINE:  By GREG MYRE 

DATELINE: CAIRO, March 6 

 BODY:
With war clouds hovering over Iraq, regional economies are driving in two different directions. Egypt's much needed tourists are staying away in record numbers. In Turkey, Jordan and Syria -- none thriving economically -- cut-rate oil imports and special trade deals with Iraq are at risk of evaporating.
 For the producer nations in the Persian Gulf, by contrast, the same war jitters have helped push oil prices to more than $33 a barrel and could produce at least a temporary windfall. 
 The oil-hungry countries to Iraq's north and west -- Turkey, Syria, Jordan and Egypt -- should all expect some level of economic pain, said Ahmed Galal, executive director of the Egyptian Center for Economic Studies in Cairo.
The oil-rich countries to Iraq's south and east stand to be net beneficiaries, at least as long as the threat of war, or an actual conflict, keeps oil prices elevated, he added.
The poorer countries are already seeking increased assistance to compensate for the costs of war. 
In Egypt the government has forecast that even a brief war could lead to $6 billion or more in losses. In a country heavily dependent on tourism, visitors are already shying away.
"Tourism is a coward," said Mamdouh Salem, secretary general of the Egyptian Hotel Association. "It flees whenever something bad happens."
Tourism plunged after the Sept. 11 attacks but staged a strong comeback last summer. This boom-and-bust cycle has been recurring since the 1991 gulf war, which also scared visitors away for an extended period. Tourism crashed again after Islamic militants massacred 58 foreign tourists in Luxor in 1997.
Commercial shipping through the Suez Canal, another major source of Egyptian revenue, is also expected to decline. In addition, about two million Egyptians work abroad, mostly in the Persian Gulf, and a war could reduce that income.
Turkey, meanwhile,has been importing Iraqi oil at below market prices outside official United Nations channels for several years, with large tanker trucks daily crossing its border with northern Iraq.
But a war in Iraq would cost the Turkish economy an estimated $25 billion to $30 billion, said David Lubin, who follows emerging markets, including Turkey, for HSBC bank in London.
The figure is close to the aid package that the United States offered Turkey in exchange for allowing American forces to enter northern Iraq from Turkey. Turkey's Parliament narrowly rejected the proposal last week, though it may reconsider.
"The economic consequences for Turkey are serious," Mr. Lubin said. "If Turkey doesn't have an aid package, they could be facing big trouble."
Syria's trade with Iraq has flourished since the two countries reduced longstanding tensions two years ago.
Syria is selling consumer products to Iraq, which in turn funnels oil to Syria at sharply reduced prices. Neither side acknowledges the oil transfer, which takes place outside the United Nations monitoring system for Iraqi oil. It is believed to reach up to 200,000 barrels a day, according to oil industry sources.
But Syria's economy is vulnerable to any disruption in those ties. Syria, which is on the United States' list of countries that sponsors international terrorism, lacks a wealthy patron that could provide an economic safety net.
Iraq was desperate for lifelines to the world after sanctions were imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and offered sweetheart oil deals to its neighbors. But if the United States ousts Saddam Hussein international sanctions would almost certainly be lifted and a new Iraqi government would be free to sell oil openly.
In the gulf, Saudi Arabia has indicated it would be willing to use its spare capacity to put additional oil on the world market if needed in a crunch, a move that would boost its revenues. Also, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are not expected to face the huge cleanup bills that saddled their economies in the wake of the 1991 conflict.
"As long as oil prices are pushed up, they shouldn't be harmed at all," Mr. Lubin said. But oil price hikes may only be temporary, the analysts said. In the 1991 war oil prices that had been below $20 a barrel doubled during the fighting but quickly reverted to previous levels after Iraqi troops were driven out of Kuwait.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders and Productivity Rise; Job Situation Is Glum 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6 

 BODY:
New orders to manufacturers rose 2.1 percent in January, the biggest monthly gain since mid-2002 on the strength of auto sales, the Commerce Department said today. Excluding transportation, orders gained 1.5 percent.
 A separate, revised report from the Labor Department today showed that the hourly output of workers outside agriculture rose 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter, a turnaround from the decline of 0.2 percent previously reported. The gain was bigger than economists expected and was taken as somewhat positive news. 
 "With productivity gains like these, it's not surprising that hiring was so weak," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pa.
For the year, nonfarm productivity advanced 4.8 percent, the biggest annual gain since 1950, the Labor Department said.
Weakness in the labor marketlingered, worsened by severe winter weather, with the number of Americans signing up for new jobless aid reaching its highest level last week since December.
Initial jobless claims rose 12,000, to a seasonally adjusted 430,000 for the week ended March 1, the highest level since December, another Labor Department report said. Some of the increase resulted from claims from workers affected by Eastern snowstorms. The four-week moving average, seen as a better gauge of labor conditions because it irons out weekly fluctuations, rose to 408,750 from 400,000, and is also now the highest since December. Economists had expected the weekly figures to edge down.
The increase in claims "underscores the fragility of labor market conditions," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisers in Columbus, Ohio, adding, "They certainly confirm the view that the economy is not creating, on balance, any new jobs at the moment."
Economists will look to tomorrow's monthly employment report for a clearer view of the job market. Employment growth outside farming is expected to be meager at best, with some economists foreseeing a decline.
Factory orders rose to a seasonally adjusted $327.11 billion in January, after a revised 0.3 percent gain in December. That was the biggest increase in orders since a 4.4 percent gain in July 2002.
Orders for durable goods, those intended to last at least three years, rose 2.9 percent in January, a smaller gain than the 3.3 percent increase reported in advance data on durable goods released last week.

HEADLINE: China Unveils Another Plan to Cut Bureaucratic Red Tape 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 6 

 BODY:
China unveiled today its third plan in the past decade to streamline its huge government bureaucracy, aiming to reduce corruption and eliminate overlapping responsibilities that contribute to waste in its economy.
 The plan, if accepted during the current session of the National People's Congress, would create independent American-style regulatory bodies to oversee banking, state-owned assets, food and drugs. 
 Unlike some previous proposals designed mainly to reduce the cost of government and cut red tape, the current proposal would redirect responsibilities for managing state-owned companies, the banking system and trade, officials said. 
One significant outcome of the plan could be to strip state companies and the ministries that support them from developing and carrying out economic policy. It would vest the state ownership of company assets in a new, consolidated agency that would try to maximize the state's financial interests but have no direct role in making policy.
Another potentially significant change would be to remove from China's central bank the responsibility of regulating state-owned banks. That would leave the central bank to set monetary policy, like the United States Federal Reserve Board, and theoretically force banks to begin cleaning up their bad loans.
Under the plan, China would also create a single body to regulate both domestic and international trade, a recognition that China's economy has become increasingly integrated with the outside world.
Previous efforts to make China's bureaucracy more efficient have had mixed results. Proposals can take years to carry out and are often watered down by competing factions.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
City's Housing Market Is Strong, Study Finds

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
Despite the contractions in the New York City region's economy, the housing market in and around the city has remained strong over the last two years, according to a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
 The study, "New York City's Economy Before and After Sept. 11," found that both builders and buyers in the metropolitan area remained ready to put their money into the brick-and-mortar certainty of housing, surpassing even the continuing firmness of the national real estate market. 
 "The fact that all of this strength occurred during a period of a cyclical downturn and in the aftermath of the terrorist attack signals that people are basically willing to make a long-term investment in and around New York City," said Jason Bram, a regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who wrote the report.
The report particularly focused on permits for the construction of new housing units and on increasing home-sale prices. 
"If you look at the 2001-2002 period, which corresponds to when the economy peaked and has since turned down -- basically contracting for the last two years -- what I found most stunning is that more housing units have been authorized in New York City than in any two-year period since the early 1970's," Mr. Bram said. "And don't forget, also in the middle of that period, you have the terrorist attack."
The city issued 18,497 permits for single-family homes and apartments in 2002, surpassing the 16,856 permits issued in 2001, the report found. The total of 35,353 permits for the two-year period, Mr. Bram said, was the highest two-year total since 1973-74, when a total of 38,160 were issued (22,417 in 1973 and 15,743 in 1974). "The only single year that's exceeded the 2002 figure in recent history was 1985," he said, "when you had 20,332 permits." 
Across the nation, the increase in housing permits issued over the last two years was the greatest recorded since 1985-86, the study said. There was a 2.5 percent increase in 2001 over the previous year, followed by a 4.8 percent rise in 2002 over 2001. In the city, by comparison, permits rose by 12 percent in 2001 and 9.7 percent last year.
The report also examined the appreciation of house prices in the New York area and nationally, using statistics gathered by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. The federal figures were based on mortgages purchased for packaging as pools of securities and resale by the federally chartered corporations Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac, which have a loan ceiling of $300,700. 
"These data likely wouldn't pick up too many transactions involving high-end mansions, because most of those wouldn't conform to the Fannie Mae-Freddie Mac loan limits," Mr. Bram said. And while they also do not include co-op and condominium transactions, they still offer an indication of market trends.
Comparing the fourth quarter of 2001 to the fourth quarter of 2002, the report found that the average price for single-family homes rose by 11.2 percent in the five boroughs, Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties combined. For all of New York State, the average price increase between the fourth quarters of 2001 and 2002 was 10.6 percent; for New Jersey, it was 11.8 percent; for Connecticut, it was 9.4 percent. Nationally, the increase was 6.9 percent.
As an indicator of housing prices in Manhattan, the study used data from the Insignia Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report, prepared by the Miller Samuel appraisal company. According to that report, the average sale price for co-ops in Manhattan, from the Battery to West 116th Street and East 96th Street, rose 0.3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2001 to the fourth quarter of 2002. For condominiums, the calculation was based on price per square foot, with the average price rising by 6.1 percent.
James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, attributed the strength of the real estate market to "a unique downturn in the post-World War II era for the region and the country."
"The historical pattern was that recessions were driven by rising interest rates, massive slowdowns in housing activity and consumer-spending reductions," Dr. Hughes said. "This time around, it is housing and consumer spending that have kept the economy afloat."
An important factor has been the 12 interest rate reductions imposed by the Federal Reserve over the last two years, with mortgage rates currently standing at 40-year lows, he said.

HEADLINE: A Dead End for Afghan Children Adrift in Pakistan 

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

DATELINE: KARACHI, Pakistan 

 BODY:
Just off a side street near one of this city's wealthiest neighborhoods is a small, well-hidden compound surrounded by an eight-foot metal fence. Inside it are mountains of trash, a handful of embittered Afghan men and a dozen young Afghan boys with dirt-caked faces, hands and clothes.
 The boys, refugees who have been abandoned or forced by their parents to work, live in the compound, collecting and sorting garbage the men sell to recycling companies. On a given day, they sift through rotting vegetables, broken glass and syringes. One boy shows symptoms of typhoid and malaria. Another has a gash on the sole of his bare foot. The stench of curdled milk, rancid meat and unwashed bodies is choking. 
 "I've collected trash all my life," said Shaheen Syed Rabbani, a short boy with thick brown hair who gave his age as 14 but looked younger. He wore gaudy but worthless jewelry -- a ring, bracelet and necklace -- that he had found in the dump. His best friend, Muhammad Khazefi, 12, resembled a walking corpse. His cheeks, neck and lips were covered in scabs and his skin was purple, the color of the ink he found in the trash and smeared over his face.
The boys are among tens of thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands, of child laborers, often refugees from Afghanistan, who toil in garbage dumps, textile factories and food markets across Pakistan. For many of them there is only one way out: madrasas, or Islamic religious schools.
Over the years, madrasas have taken in many of the children at this garbage dump -- perhaps several hundred, according to one of the adult workers -- with promises of free food, clothing, education and, most of all, escape. While the specific number may be open to debate, there is no disputing that this dump, and thousands of other squalid workplaces, are prime recruiting areas for schools that the United States has described as potential breeding grounds for Islamic militancy.
Today, an estimated 10,000 madrasas with 1 million to 1.7 million students are believed to exist across Pakistan. Roughly 40 percent of the madrasas are operated by moderate sects and act as legitimate religious charities, according to estimates by Pakistani journalists. But most of the rest, a majority of the madrasas in Pakistan, are operated by the hard-line Deobandi sect. Deobandi madrasas, the birthplace of the Taliban, often represent a different, more radical world.
At the dump, the children ward off wild dogs as they scavenge for trash and sleep on wooden platforms so rats will not bite them.
They are vague about their situations. Shaheen, for one, insists he spends a day with his family every two to three weeks. But Muhammad says they moved here together seven or eight months ago. The two boys were exuberant in describing why they want to be taken in by a madrasa. 
"We'll get free food and clothing," Shaheen explained, his eyes brightening at the prospect. "It will make us very happy." Asked about the United States, he said: "I want America to be finished. They destroyed Afghanistan. They bombed the whole country."
Pakistani officials say they are doing their best to regulate madrasas and curb the poverty that makes them so attractive. But they say they need more economic aid from the United States and other Western countries.
Half of Pakistan's 140 million people are illiterate and live below the poverty line. The country's public school system is in a shambles. Hundreds of thousands of impoverished Afghan refugees remain in Pakistan, and for many of the refugee children, madrasas are their only chance for any type of education.
Eight Afghan refugee children, including one boy who lives in the garbage dump, are the subject of a New York Times Television report titled "Terror's Children: A Pakistani Journal." The documentary, by Pakistani filmmakers Sharmeen Obaid and Muhammad Naqvi, will be shown on the DiscoveryTimes Channel on March 25.
In the garbage dump, the boys wash in a puddle next to a cracked street pipe, defecate in empty lots and are beaten if they fail to produce enough recyclables.
Other Afghan children who live in refugee camps with their families also face abuse. "A good Muslim is one who does not beat their son," said Noor Muhammad, a 12-year-old whose father forces him to work from dawn until 8:00 p.m. "And prays five times a day."
Over the last 20 years, madrasas have grown to become a de facto social safety net and powerful Islamist presence. The schools were indirectly financed by the United States during the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 1980's, and the Pakistani government condoned their growth throughout the 1990's.
Abdul Quyum, a small affable 20-year-old Afghan with a short beard and boyish face, is head teacher of a Deobandi madrasa in the Jadeed refugee camp outside of Karachi.
The madrasa's founder left the school last spring after word spread that he was wanted by Pakistani police and the F.B.I. Mr. Quyum is filling in for him. Like so many Afghan boys, he fled the fighting with the Soviets and attended a Deobandi madrasa in Pakistan. Today, he teaches students what he learned.
The young teacher, like many Deobandi students, only memorized the Koran in Arabic, a language he does not speak or understand. In an interview, he said Islam bars Muslims from living with non-Muslims. "I can't eat with you," he said, "because you are a nonbeliever."
When other Muslims told him he was wrong, that the prophet Muhammad had laid out specific rules that allow Muslims to live with nonbelievers, he said he had never heard of such a thing. Asked about a well-known story in which Muhammad refused to use violence to win converts, he said he had never heard of that either.
At the madrasa, his students reacted with a combination of fear, curiosity and fury when greeted by an American, for many the first they had ever seen.
Abdullah, a 22-year-old student who was training to be an imam, or priest, hesitated when asked if he had any message for Americans. "If I were the ruler of the world," he said, clearly hoping to impress fellow students. "I would kill them all."
At the dump, Muhammad said he would happily study in a madrasa. Asked if he would accept training to kill Americans, he nodded.
"They are very cruel to us," the 12-year-old said resolutely. "They kill our people."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Interpublic reports weak results and lowers revenue and earnings forecasts for this year.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE dismal financial outlook for the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York shows few signs of improvement based on its fourth-quarter and full-year results, which were released yesterday.
 The bad news included sharply lower profitability at its largest division, larger-than-expected declines in net income, falling revenue, more problems at a struggling motor sports unit and two additional restatements totaling $165.7 million in addition to previously disclosed restatements of $181.3 million. 
 "The results were terrible," said Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst who follows advertising stocks for West End Communications/Consulting in New York.
Even worse than the additional restatements -- after Interpublic had assured investors, analysts and employees in November that the figure of $181.3 million would be final -- top executives warned of possible additional write-downs in the current quarter along with further layoffs, and they lowered their forecasts for revenue and net income per share for 2003. 
"You think it can't get worse, and it does," said David Doft, an analyst who follows Madison Avenue for CIBC World Markets in New York.
The results, among the bleakest for a major agency company since the recession a decade ago, meant a fast end to the honeymoon -- what there was of it -- for David Bell, who completes his first week as chairman and chief executive of Interpublic today .
"These results are unacceptable," Mr. Bell said during an hourlong conference call with analysts after the results were released. "There's clearly much to be done."
The new restatements approach in size those that tremendously angered investors and analysts last year, helping drive the price of Interpublic shares to 10-year lows.
In after-hours trading, shares of Interpublic fell as much as 6.7 percent. Earlier, they closed at $8.59, down 41 cents, or 4.6 percent.
For the fourth quarter, Interpublic -- which owns agencies like Campbell Mithun; Draft Worldwide; Foote, Cone & Belding; Golin/Harris International; and Mullen -- had net income of $20.3 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with restated net income of $96.4 million, or 26 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. 
The average forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call was for net income of 18 cents a share.
For 2002, net income was $99.5 million, or 26 cents a share, in contrast to a restated net loss of $534.5 million, or $1.45 a share, in 2001.
Revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.67 billion, down 3.8 percent from $1.73 billion. Revenue for the full year was $6.2 billion, down 8.7 percent from $6.79 billion.
The restatements announced yesterday are being made in two parts. The largest is composed of pretax charges of $135.8 million, primarily noncash, mostly in the third quarter, related to asset impairments and other operating expenses at the Octagon Motor Sports division of Octagon Worldwide. That division had earlier been identified as a prime culprit for the subpar recent performance of Interpublic. The motor sports division, which operates car-racing tracks in cities like Hong Kong, is being scrutinized and may be sold or shut down.
"Wehave engaged an independent consultant to advise us on exit strategies," said Sean F. Orr, executive vice president and chief financial officer. "We could have further write-offs in this business as we exit the business, depending on the exit strategy we choose to employ."
The other part of the restatements involves miscellaneous pretax charges of $29.9 million, which date to 1997 and were unrelated to Octagon Motor Sports.
The dire nature of the results underscored what analysts on Wall Street said on Feb. 27, when Interpublic's board unexpectedly shook up top management: that the catalyst for the sudden changes was a worsening of the financial woes of Interpublic, the world's second-largest agency company, particularly at the McCann-Erickson World Group, the largest division. 
Mr. Bell, the Interpublic vice chairman, was named to succeed John J. Dooner Jr., the chairman and chief executive since January 2001. Mr. Dooner was demoted and dispatched back to lead McCann-Erickson, succeeding James R. Heekin III, who was fired.
Mr. Doft, the analyst at CIBC, said of Mr. Bell, "The question is, Can he fix it and how long will it take?"
"His focus points are the right ones," Mr. Doft said, "but at this point investors are unlikely to give him the benefit of the doubt."
The sour results are the most recent in a spate of problems at Interpublic, which works for marketers like Coca-Cola, General Motors, Samsung and Unilever.
Interpublic has already endured difficulties that include a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of accounting irregularities; two restatements of earnings dating to 1996; a suspension of the dividend; repeated misses of earnings estimates; and several downgradings of corporate debt, to one level above junk status.
Earlier, revenue estimates for 2003 were flat compared with 2002, but now, Mr. Orr said, revenue will most likely decline 1 percent to 4 percent this year.
As for net income, Mr. Orr said, earnings per share are now estimated in a range of 68 to 72 cents. That compares with a current consensus estimate of 91 cents, according to First Call.
The profitability problems at McCann-Erickson, according to Mr. Bell, are centered on services outside traditional advertising like corporate identity consulting and promotional marketing along with advertising agencies in Latin America and Japan.
During the call, he described McCann-Erickson as "now in the capable hands of the rightful person, John Dooner."
Mr. Doft said that it had been apparent "there were issues at McCann, but the extent is kind of surprising."
"McCann is the crown jewel of Interpublic," he added. "As goes McCann, so goes Interpublic."
Among the handful of what Mr. Bell called bright spots for Interpublic were a reduction of debt at year-end, to $2.6 billion from $2.9 billion; strong net new-business performance in 2002, totaling $3.2 billion in billings from advertisers like Bank of America, Novartis and Qwest Communications; and continued progress on talks to sell the NFO WorldGroup, a research unit.
The Interpublic difficulties began in August, when the agency company initially disclosed that accounting problems at the European operations of McCann-Erickson would result in a charge to earnings of $68.5 million. That was revised upward to as much as $120 million in October and again a month later to $181.3 million. 
In contrast to the downbeat results from Interpublic, some of its rivals have reported numbers that pleased Wall Street. 
Havas in Paris, the fifth-largest agency company, which coincidentally also reported yesterday, had net income of $26.3 million in 2002, in contrast to a large loss in 2001. 
The WPP Group in London, the world's biggest agency company, reported last week that its net income last year fell 67.6 percent, to $132.3 million, from $390.6 million in 2001.

The European Central Bank lowered interest rates by a quarter point, disappointing those who had hoped for a more vigorous response to the Continent's lingering economic malaise.
 In reducing the benchmark rate to 2.5 percent -- its second cut in three months -- the bank said it was reacting to persistent signs of weakness in Europe's major countries and to the war clouds gathering over Iraq, which have driven the euro up sharply against the dollar.

HEADLINE: NASA Official Says Agency Faces a Drain on Its Talent Pool 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6 

 BODY:
NASA's top official warned today that the agency faced alarming trends in retirements, competition from industry and a decline in graduates with technical skills, all of which could severely deplete the pool of skilled employees.
 Appearing before a Senate governmental affairs subcommittee, the NASA administrator, Sean O'Keefe, told lawmakers, "NASA's ability to maintain a world-class work force with the talent it needs to perform cutting-edge work is threatened." 
 Lawmakers are debating legislation that includes many of the work-force changes that NASA seeks to make its pay and benefits more competitive with industry. 
Some provisions would allow NASA to offer certain employees bonuses and salaries far higher usually allowed under government rules. In some cases, the legislation would allow one-time bonuses of up to twice an employee's salary, if that worker agreed to spend four years at NASA and the job filled a "critical need." 
At the hearing, lawmakers questioned Mr. O'Keefe about whether NASA has what it needs to oversee its huge contractor network. The agency appears to have the employees to do the job, Mr. O'Keefe said. But he added that "what scares me is that once they move on, there ain't a whole lot there behind them." 
"Our bench strength is not as deep as it could be," he said. Later, he said he did not believe that work-force problems contributed to the Columbia disaster. 
Critics of the legislation said the brain drain had been mostly caused by NASA's efforts in the last 10 years to send work to outside contractors. Much of the most innovative technology work that would attract the brightest graduates now occurs at private companies, the critics said.
Jackie Simon, director of public policy at the American Federation of Government Employees, the union for many NASA workers, said the agency should focus on rebuilding its ranks of in-house scientific and engineering employees and ending the practice of "sending all the good work out."
The bill, Ms. Simon added, leaves little for career employees. 
Congressional backers of the legislation take issue with the criticisms. Supporters of the measure have made it clear to NASA officials that the higher salaries and bonuses are primarily meant to benefit rank-and-file engineers and employees whose technical skills are in high demand in the private sector.
The bill's sponsor, Representative Sherwood Boehlert, the New York Republican who is chairman of the House Science Committee, said his legislation rejected some provisions that NASA wants. They included an "exchange program" in which industry employees would be NASA staff members while remaining on the payrolls of their corporate employers, an idea that Mr. Boehlert said raised conflict-of-interest concerns.

HEADLINE: British Manager Is Chosen To Lead Consulting Firm 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
After a selection process that many likened to the election of a new pope, McKinsey & Company announced yesterday that its partners had chosen a new leader. Ian Davis, the head of the firm's British office, will take over as managing director in July. 
 During his three-year term, Mr. Davis will guide the firm as it copes with continuing economic uncertainty and clients' reluctance to spend on costly consultants. McKinsey consultants will face increasing pressure on two fronts: from I.B.M., Accenture and other companies that have large consulting businesses with deep pockets and technological expertise, and from more traditional rivals like Bain & Company, the Boston Consulting Group and Booz Allen Hamilton. 
 How the firm responds will be closely scrutinized by its competitors and clients, many of whom say they regard McKinsey -- the training ground for prominent chief executives like Philip Purcell of Morgan Stanley and Leo Mullin of Delta Air Lines -- as a model and bellwether.
"The industry is at this point of departure, and I think McKinsey, as the leader of the industry, is at a point of departure as well," said Tom Rodenhauser, president of Consulting Information Services in Keene, N.H. "There's a lot of turmoil internally as to where McKinsey is headed."
The selection of Mr. Davis to succeed Rajat Gupta, who served as McKinsey's managing director for three three-year terms, may portend a shift in the firm's strategy. In the 1990's, Mr. Gupta oversaw a rapid expansion in the size of the firm and the reach of its offices. Some partners have worried that it may have grown too rapidly for its traditional partnership structure. Several people at the firm noted that Mr. Davis emphasized McKinsey traditions in a statement yesterday.
"To build on Rajat's accomplishments, we need to stay focused on our core mission and values, which have nourished McKinsey's success over the last seven decades," Mr. Davis said in the statement. "Our commitment to our clients and our people are at the heart of everything we do."
Consultants' credibility in general has been undermined by corporate scandals at companies they advised and by the bursting of the technology bubble. McKinsey's association with Enron, a much-celebrated client before its spectacular collapse in December 2001, "cast a little bit of doubt" on the firm, Mr. Rodenhauser said.
Corporate spending on consulting services has slowed sharply in recent years, rising barely 3 percent, to $126.6 billion in 2001, from $122.9 billion the previous year, according to Kennedy Information, which tracks the industry. McKinsey, which is privately held, had $3.3 billion in revenue last year and the same amount in 2001, Kennedy estimates, down slightly from $3.4 billion in 2000. 
As a result of tougher economic times, McKinsey has become much more selective in its hiring. It is still a highly desirable destination for business school graduates. It has also become more aggressive about advising associates to leave the firm -- a process known as "counseling out" -- in an effort to slow growth or, in some offices, to shrink, associates at the firm say. Over all, the firm employs about 7,000 consultants, down from 7,200 a year ago. 
Some McKinsey associates expressed relief that Mr. Davis was chosen because his fellow finalist in the selection process, Michael Patsalos-Fox, head of the New York office, was seen as being focused on controlling costs and aggressive about advising junior consultants to leave. 
Mr. Davis, 52, has worked at McKinsey in Britain for 23 years and has run the British office for eight years. Before joining the firm, Mr. Davis worked for seven years at Bowater, a paper products manufacturer. He is a graduate of Oxford University.
The consulting industry has been changing in recent years as large technology companies, like I.B.M., Hitachi and Fujitsu, have built up their consulting units. In turn McKinsey, like other more traditional consulting firms, has come to emphasize technology, said Jack Sweeney, an editor at Kennedy Information. 
But McKinsey is structured as a partnership rather than as a corporation with clear lines of communication, Mr. Sweeney said, and it will have to focus on how to share information effectively throughout the organization. "They need to look at the processes and update them," he said.
The increasing importance of technology may pose a problem for the firm because as the consulting industry is further divided into segments, distinguishing information technology from management consulting, for example, McKinsey will be relegated to a smaller slice, Mr. Rodenhauser said. "McKinsey becomes marginalized," he said. "They've represented the industry for a long time now, and the future of the industry is going to be something where they don't represent the industry."
If McKinsey cannot distinguish itself, it will be unable to charge its customary premium above competitors' rates, Mr. Rodenhauser said. "Maybe McKinsey will not be the consultant as we think of consultants in the future," he said. "Instead, McKinsey may be a high-level adviser, and that's all they'll do. But they'll have to be much smaller." 
Because the election process at McKinsey is elaborate and opaque, there is no way to determine the reasons partners chose Mr. Davis over Mr. Patsalos-Fox. According to a McKinsey spokesman, Michael Stewart, the selection process often takes many months because not all of the firm's 270 eligible senior partners vote in time to meet deadlines set for each round of voting. This year, Mr. Stewart said, partners voted on time, so the process took less than two months.

HEADLINE: A Welfare-to-Work Study Finds No Harm to Children 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6 

 BODY:
Poor children suffer no psychological damage when their mothers move from welfare to work, as millions of women have in recent years, a major new study says. Among adolescents in such families, the researchers say, mental health may actually have improved.
 The research, financed by the National Institutes of Health and being published on Friday in the journal Science, provides the most extensive evidence yet to answer questions that have been swirling around one of the biggest experiments in American social policy in the last half-century. The study suggests that the 1996 welfare overhaul does not pose the harm many people feared when it was passed by a Republican-controlled Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton. 
 The law established strict work requirements for welfare recipients, with tough penalties for those who flouted the rules, and set a five-year lifetime limit on payment of federal welfare benefits to any family. The law's critics predicted that it would increase poverty and misery among children. Its supporters said growing up on welfare harmed children, by fostering dependency and sapping initiative.
Bills reauthorizing the welfare program, passed by the House and pending in the Senate, would increase the work requirements, and the newly reported study could give ammunition to supporters of those more stringent provisions.
The researchers studied preschoolers and adolescents in 2,400 families in Boston, Chicago and San Antonio. They found that the mothers' transition from welfare to work did not harm the emotional development, intellectual achievement or mental health of the children.
"This study provides reassurance that mothers may leave welfare and enter the job market without harmful effects to their preschoolers or young adolescents," said Dr. Duane Alexander, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, a unit of the N.I.H.
The researchers said adolescents whose mothers had begun working reported small but "statistically significant declines in psychological distress," including symptoms of anxiety. Some adolescents also reported significant declines in delinquent behavior like the use of drugs and alcohol after their mothers left welfare.
The researchers said they had detected neither harmful nor beneficial effects on preschool children when their mothers went from welfare to work.
"The positive and negative aspects of going off welfare or getting a job may cancel each other out" in these families, said P. Lindsay Chase-Lansdale, a professor of psychology at Northwestern University, who directed the study.
When mothers of preschoolers went to work, the study found, family incomes increased, but the mothers' time with the children, 2 to 4 years old, decreased. "These two effects may have offset each other," the report said.
The researchers found a different experience among adolescents. Family income increased when their mothers went to work, but the women did not substantially reduce the time spent with the children, ages 10 to 14.
Women in the study kept diaries showing how they spent their time. When mothers of adolescents left welfare and took jobs, they cut back on their own personal, social and educational activities, so there was only a small net reduction in the hours they spent with their children.
Dr. Chase-Lansdale said the changes in the lives of the families in the study had occurred in a booming economy. In a weak economy, she said, it might have been more difficult for women to leave welfare and find jobs, and the jobs might have paid less.
One of the more remarkable findings is that when mothers went to work, their household income nearly doubled, and most of the families were lifted out of poverty. Before they went to work, their average income was 35 percent below the poverty level. After they took jobs, their income was more than 25 percent above the poverty level.
"For a family of four, that represents an increase of $10,000 a year," Dr. Chase-Lansdale said.
The researchers offered several explanations for the findings concerning the children's well-being. 
"The self-esteem of mothers of adolescents often significantly increased when those mothers went to work and often significantly decreased when they left work," the study said. Adolescents seemed to thrive when their parents had a positive self-image.
Moreover, the authors said, "adolescents are perceptive and sensitive to the pressures of poverty and economic hardship in their families," so their "anxiety levels may decrease as they see their mothers going to work each day."
Conversely, the researchers said, when mothers leave the labor force, adolescent children are more likely to display behavioral problems. "Teenagers may express their feelings of disappointment or worry about finances as depression or anger when their mothers leave employment," the study said.
The 1996 law ended a 60-year-old federal guarantee of cash assistance for the nation's poorest children and gave each state a lump sum of money, with vast discretion to run its own welfare program. The number of people on welfare plunged to five million in September 2002 from 12.2 million in 1996.
The new study does not predict whether gains from the 1996 law will endure. The researchers said they hoped to follow children in the study for 15 to 20 years.

Intel Revises Sales Outlook; Demand Eases For Its Chips

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 6 

 BODY:
Intel warned today that first-quarter sales would fall short of its highest forecast as demand declines for flash-memory chips. The company's shares dropped on the news.
 Revenue will be $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion, the company said. In January, Intel predicted $6.5 billion to $7 billion, and analysts had expected Intel to keep the high end of its range in place. 
 The chief financial officer, Andy D. Bryant, said Intel probably lost orders to rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices, after it raised prices by as much as 40 percent on flash memory used in cellphones and digital cameras. Customers want lower-priced chips as faltering economic growth, made worse by the prospect of war with Iraq, hurts their profits.
"Given the economy and the geopolitical background, it's a tough environment out there," said Jim Grossman, who helps manage about $57 billion at Thrivent Investment Management.
Intel said its gross margin, or the percentage of sales left after subtracting manufacturing costs, would be "slightly below the midpoint" of its estimate of 50 percent, plus or minus a couple of points, because of costs related to higher-than-expected inventory of memory chips.
In after-hours trading, Intel shares dropped as much as 85 cents, to $15.85 after the report. In regular trading, shares closed down 28 cents, at $16.70; they have declined 49 percent in the last year.
The company is expected to have a profit, before some costs, of 12 cents a share on sales of $6.75 billion, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. Net income was 14 cents on sales of $6.78 billion in the period last year.
Intel's flash-memory sales have declined more than it expected so far this quarter, Mr. Bryant said. "If we hadn't seen the softness in flash," he said, "we could have said everything's up a bit."
The company does not plan to lower its prices, he said. Demand for high-end chips is going to improve, so the company does not need to reduce prices to chase business in inexpensive products, he said.
"This would be the wrong time to give up," Mr. Bryant said.
Sales of microprocessors used in personal computers and servers that run Internet sites have been "slightly above" expectations, the company said.
The demand for personal computers in Asia has improved, and Intel is winning a higher percentage of its sales from more-expensive processors for laptop and server computers that run Web sites, investors have said. Dell Computer last month raised its sales forecast for this quarter.
"I don't look at what we have here and see signs of an economic recovery," Mr. Bryant said.
Intel expects a loss from investments of $100 million, less than the $125 million it forecast, because of lower impairment costs.

HEADLINE: Deal Clears Way for Los Angeles Port Project 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 6 

 BODY:
A state judge today approved a $60 million settlement that clears the way for the opening of a major development at the city's port while securing cleaner air and better surroundings for neighboring communities.
 "This settlement will create a model terminal for what a green port should look like," said Gail Ruderman Feurer, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the groups that sued the city and port for failing to assess the environmental impact of expansion there. "Many things the city has agreed to do will be done for the first time in the City of Los Angeles." 
 Under the settlement in State Superior Court, a $50 million fund will be created to reduce the impact of port operations, which generate high levels of air pollution, on the adjacent Los Angeles neighborhoods of San Pedro and Wilmington. Of that amount, $10 million is to go to reduce emissions from independently owned diesel trucks that serve the port; $20 million to efforts to reduce air pollution over four years; and $20 million to create parks and clean up and beautify areas around the port. 
In addition, $10 million was earmarked for specific changes at the China Shipping terminal, a major expansion at the port that led to the public outcry.
As part of the settlement, the city agreed to provide electric power to ships so they will not run their diesel engines, and $5 million will go to retrofitting vessels so they can use the electricity. Another $5 million will go toward replacing 16-story cranes with ones with a lower profile. The agreement also specified that cleaner alternative fuel trucks will be used at the terminal.
The settlement money will come entirely from port revenues. 
"I think it's an extremely useful first step in getting to grips with these historic impacts of the port on our community," said Noel Park, president of the San Pedro Peninsula Homeowners Coalition.
In return, the port can move forward with opening the 173-acre China Shipping terminal, which was near completion when a state appeals court panel halted construction last fall and ordered the port to conduct further environmental reviews. Under the settlement approved today, full environmental impact assessments will be done and any problems will be addressed. 
The lack of environmental assessment on the $47 million project led the Natural Resources Defense Council, along with two community groups and a statewide clean air coalition, to file suit in June 2001. Port officials argued that the creation of the terminal was covered under earlier environmental reports, and a lower court agreed. In October, though, the appellate court reversed the decision, ordering the port to halt construction while environmental issues were studied.
Ms. Feurer of the natural resources group said the settlement was "the dawning of a new era of port and community relations."
She said she intended to push for measures adopted in the agreement at ports elsewhere. "Our next stop is the Port of Long Beach," she said. "But we are currently looking at ports around the country."
People living around the Port of Los Angeles have long been concerned about high levels of air pollution that come from it and the heavy traffic congestion it generates. The San Pedro-Wilmington area has the highest concentration of diesel truck pollution in the Los Angeles Basin. In addition, a recent study by the South Coast Air Quality Management District found that residents there were exposed to some of the highest cancer risks in the region from breathing toxic pollution.
"This was a major victory for the port community because it will mean cleaner air and even cleaner water with some of the mitigation efforts that were adopted," Todd Campbell, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air, a statewide group, said.
City and harbor officials also praised the deal, saying it showed that environmental concerns and economic development could find common ground.
"The settlement expedites both the creation of jobs and the improvement of air quality," Mayor James K. Hahn said. "This agreement is a win-win for the Los Angeles economy and its environment."
With the opening of the China Shipping terminal it is expected that bigger vessels -- some four times the size of those now entering the port -- will be docking here. According to court documents, as many as 250 of the world's largest container vessels are expected to call on the terminal, with cargo being moved by as many as a million trucks a year.
Though the agreement is expected to reduce pollution, residents said much work remained to be done. "We have to be pleased, they've never done anything for us before," Mr. Park said. "We've certainly got ourselves on their radar screen. How that plays out down the road, however, remains to be seen."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 8, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the settlement of a lawsuit over the opening of a shipping terminal at the port of Los Angeles misspelled the surname of a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a plaintiff. She is Gail Ruderman Feuer, not Feurer.

HEADLINE: Tyco Shareholders Vote to Keep Headquarters in Bermuda 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
Shareholders of Tyco International defeated a motion yesterday calling on the company to move its incorporation back to the United States from Bermuda.
 The vote came during Tyco's annual meeting in Pembroke, Bermuda. Few shareholders attended the meeting, though many voted by proxy. 
 Tyco, which is trying to right itself under a new management team after its former top executives were charged with looting the company of $600 million, has pledged to become a leader in corporate governance. Shareholders voted to replace the entire board that was in place when L. Dennis Kozlowski, ran the company. 
Still, despite the fury over Tyco's past accounting practices, which included inflating earnings through financial gimmickry, shareholders approved a management proposal to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers as Tyco's auditor: 77 percent of shareholders voted in favor and 23 percent against.
Shareholders had proposed several motions aimed at better corporate governance including a motion to ban the company from using its accountant for other purposes, like consulting. All of the shareholder motions were roundly defeated except one: future severance agreements for executives must be approved by shareholders. The motion passed 58 percent to 42 percent.
The motion had stemmed from the severance agreements that Tyco agreed to pay Mr. Kozlowski, the chief executive, and Mark H. Swartz, the chief financial officer. Mr. Kozlowski would have received $135 million under Tyco's severance agreement, plus a consulting retainer of $3.4 million a year for the rest of his life. Mr. Swartz received $44 million as part of his resignation. Tyco has said it is seeking to have that money returned.
Corporate governance and proxy experts said they were surprised at the passage of the motion to have severance agreements approved by a shareholder vote. Of 20 such proposals in the last year, Arthur Crozier, co-chairman of the proxy solicitation firm Innisfree M&A, said only one other passed, at Bank of America.
Robert Wall, a lawyer at Winston & Strawn, suggested the vote was based more on emotion than on any financial benefit to shareholders. "I hope it makes stockholders feel better," he said, "but it's not going to make them any more money." 
Mr. Wall also said that requiring such a vote on severance packages could make the hiring process more difficult.
The most hotly disputed motion, though, was whether Tyco should repatriate from the tax haven of Bermuda to the United States. Shareholders, including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees lobbied vigorously for the motion, asserting that Bermuda's laws limit shareholders' rights and allow companies to skirt governance rules. The California Public Employees' Retirement System, known as Calpers, and Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises on proxy votes, also pushed for Tyco to leave Bermuda.
Tyco's management opposed the move, arguing that the new board needed time to evaluate the implications of a move. Tyco became a Bermuda-based company when it merged with ADT in 1997.
In the end, only 26 percent of shareholders voted in favor of leaving Bermuda. Appearing to represent the view of a majority of shareholders, Leon Cooperman, chairman of Omega Advisors Inc., which owns more than six million Tyco shares, wrote a letter to the Calpers chief executive, Fred Buenrostro, calling the proposal to leave Bermuda "ill advised" and possibly "ill informed." 
Mr. Cooperman said tax benefits of having headquarters in Bermuda outweighed the benefits of being based in the United States. "To finger-point now, years later and at a time of economic stress, is both inappropriate and, on the merits, unnecessary," he wrote.
Still, Edward D. Breen, Tyco's chief executive, said the company would consider leaving Bermuda in the future. "The board is committed," he said, "to looking closely at Tyco's jurisdiction of incorporation, and we will make a decision based on what is best for overall shareholder value."

Jets' Opener Set for Washington as Redskins Make Morton an Offer

BYLINE:  By DAMON HACK

 BODY:
With sharp elbows and a fistful of dollars, the Washington Redskins are raiding the shelves of the National Football League. Twice last week, they lifted players off the Jets' roster -- the unrestricted free agents Randy Thomas, a guard, and John Hall, a place-kicker -- and yesterday they made a run at the Jets' kick returner Chad Morton, a restricted free agent, offering him a five-year deal worth $8 million, including a $2.5 million signing bonus.
 The Jets have one week to match the offer and six months to consider this twist: they will open the season on Sept. 4, a Thursday night, against the Redskins at FedEx Field in Landover, Md. 
 Last season, the Giants and the San Francisco 49ers opened the season on a Thursday night at Giants Stadium.
Despite consecutive season openers in the New York area and Washington, the two places that were attacked by terrorists on Sept. 11, 2001, an N.F.L. spokesman said yesterday that the league's choice of a Redskins home game against the Jets was purely coincidental.
Still, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has been outspoken in the past about the economic impact that large events, like future Super Bowls, could have on New York and Washington. The Jets-Redskins game, like its 49ers-Giants predecessor that had a kickoff celebration in Times Square, will be preceded by several entertainment components.
Until then, the Jets and the Redskins can spar over Morton, who carried the ball only four times last season and decided to test the free-agent market largely because he wanted more opportunities to run the football, his agent, Leigh Steinberg, said yesterday.
"We have seven days to address the offer and we will make a decision at the appropriate time," said Jets General Manager Terry Bradway, whose team would receive a fifth-round pick from the Redskins as compensation if it doesn't match the offer.
In college, at Southern California, Morton's position coach was Hue Jackson, who is now the Redskins' running backs coach. Morton's head coach at Southern Cal was Paul Hackett, the Jets' offensive coordinator.
Jackson, Coach Steve Spurrier and the Redskins' owner, Daniel M. Snyder, have all called Morton's telephone number in recent days, Steinberg said.
"Fundamentally, Chad returned kicks and that's all he did," Steinberg said of Morton's season in 2002, "and what he's been looking for is a more expansive role."
Bradway reiterated that Morton's role would expand with the Jets, but he deferred to Coach Herman Edwards and Hackett on describing exactly how it might grow.
"Now, Chad does have a history, even when he was in New Orleans, of catching the ball out of the backfield," Bradway said. "He is capable of doing that."

HEADLINE: War on Iraq: The Clock Is Ticking 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 It is difficult to see how William Safire can glorify the possible war in Iraq as giving "freedom a chance" (column, March 6). 
 Far more likely outcomes are increased terrorism in the United States and abroad; a devastated educational system and economy, thanks to a war that goes on for years and costs billions of dollars; not to mention diminished civil liberties and a loss of respect in the world community.
Exactly how are we supposed to rebuild Iraqi society when our own will have suffered so much?

HEADLINE: A Costlier Commute 

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has decided to raise the subway fare -- a nickel almost 100 years ago -- to $2 in May. Bus fares will increase by the same amount. Commuter rail fares will jump by 25 percent, and drivers will pay 50 cents more at most tunnels and bridges. These are difficult economic times, and even though the M.T.A. and senior politicians have not been entirely forthcoming, the increases appear necessary on the basis of what is known of the agency's shaky finances. 
 After yesterday's long meeting, the transit authority offered some cushioning for riders with discount cards and promised insurance for lost cards at a modest fee. And instead of closing 177 token booths, as originally proposed, fewer than 62 part-time token booths will be shut down, even as tokens will be phased out. 
 Those useful adjustments to the fare proposals released last year show that the authority leadership has listened to some of the public outcry. But even these improvements on the authority's original plans do not excuse the M.T.A. or Gov. George Pataki, who controls the agency. They failed to prepare the public adequately for these increases or to give a credible accounting of the agency's true financial state.
Mr. Pataki studiously avoided any hint that fare increases were imminent when running for re-election last year. But within weeks after the election, the M.T.A. revealed a $2.8 billion shortfall in revenue over the next two years, and warned that it needed to increase fares or decrease service. Commuters had good reason to feel taken by surprise.
Some transit authority members acknowledged that they had done a poor job of explaining their financial predicament. State Comptroller Alan Hevesi may be able to help. He has been examining the finances of the authority and will report soon. Had the M.T.A. waited for it, this detailed accounting might have strengthened its case and made the fare increases more palatable.

HEADLINE: Labor and Health Care Leaders Go on TV With a Message for Albany: Don't Cut Here 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 6 

 BODY:
On Monday, labor and civic groups, state employees and teachers broadcast a television advertisement attacking Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget cuts. Yesterday, health and hospital leaders followed suit, taking to the airwaves with a moody 30-second spot of their own.
 If this were a western movie, and the Capitol the O.K. Corral, some of those labor and civic leaders might be seen as characters sliding off a split-rail fence, looking for a confrontation with the sheriff and his deputies. 
 But the very people brandishing the advertising weapons are some of the governor's recent allies, including Dennis Rivera and Randi Weingarten, who just months ago abandoned their traditional Democratic roots to help Mr. Pataki campaign as a social liberal and win a third term in November. The stakes for taxpayers are high. 
"It is a pretty serious situation," Jennifer Cunningham, a spokeswoman for the union that Mr. Rivera heads, 1199/S.E.I.U., said of the state's worsening budget plight.
Members of the unions and social service providers said the public relations campaign, costing several million dollars, was escalating as concerns grow over the governor's plan for more than $1 billion in Medicaid cuts and a $1.24 billion reduction in state aid to public schools. The cuts have been proposed to help close a combined $11.5 billion shortfall in the state's $90.8 billion budget.
The sponsors said the campaign is to raise public awareness and lay groundwork for alternatives. One of the ads, paid for by a coalition known as New Yorkers for Fiscal Fairness, is calling for changes to corporate tax laws that would close some tax shelters. They also want to increase the tax rate for the state's wealthiest people. Supporters said the measures would raise nearly $5 billion in new revenues.
In addition, there have been mass mailings, lobbying of lawmakers and a canvassing of residents throughout New York, union officials said. Hundreds of teachers are set to rally here Tuesday, and a protest by health care workers is planned for April 1, the budget deadline. More ads might follow, on television and radio.
Mr. Pataki has encouraged brisk debate over the spending plan he presented on Jan. 29, said Lisa Dewald Stoll, his chief spokeswoman.
"But he is determined to lead New York out of this fiscal crisis," Ms. Stoll said. "The governor has made tough choices to ensure job growth and a strong economy so that New York can continue to build on his record investments in education, health care and the environment and the future."
As for the revenue-raising proposals being pushed by some labor leaders, Ms. Stoll said that no one should underestimate the governor's resistance to tax increases.
"We know that there will always be some who advocate for massive job-killing taxes to address the fiscal challenges," she said. "But as history has made clear, that would damage our economy, cost us thousands of jobs and hurt hard-working families across the state."
Union leaders said the ads were not directed at the governor, but at all lawmakers. The ad by the Fiscal Fairness group -- a coalition including the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O., the Communications Workers of America, the Civil Service Employees Union, the Public Employees Federation and the New York State United Teachers -- does not invoke Mr. Pataki's name, but asks viewers to "call Albany."
"There is a day-to-day relationship with the governor we maintain," said Denis M. Hughes, the president of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. "And we still have the same level of respect, only with a difference of opinion on these issues."
Many lawmakers said it was too soon to gauge whether the ads represented a redrawing of old alliances, with Mr. Pataki, big business and fiscal conservatives on one side and Democrats and labor forces on the other. However, the language of the ads is similar to what Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, has used to attack Mr. Pataki's budget.
"I think these people have learned a hard lesson," Mr. Silver said. "They were used. And they are smarting and they are embarrassed in their membership."
Among those most vociferously fighting Mr. Pataki's cuts to Medicaid is Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, who is behind the ad that features slow-motion film of a mother racing to an emergency room with her child in her arms, only to find it closed. Hospitals are already facing closure, and Mr. Raske said the proposed cuts would endanger more of them at a time when they need $1.2 billion in the next two years to sufficiently prepare for possible terrorist attacks.
If the cuts stand, many said, it could signal a seismic shift in the relations between labor and the governor.
"The relationships have not broken," said Alan B. Lubin, the executive vice president of New York State United Teachers. "If this budget were to become a reality, they certainly could break because we think the governor has made the wrong choices."

HEADLINE: FILM IN REVIEW; 
'Roaring Across The Horizon'

BYLINE:  By DAVE KEHR 

 BODY:

'Journey to The Western Xia Empire'

Directed by Lu Wei
In Mandarin, with English subtitles
Not rated, 110 minutes
 Filmgoers who've missed hearing Mao Zedong's poetry quoted in reverent tones will want to make a beeline to "Roaring Across the Horizon," a relatively new Chinese film (it's from 1999) that revives the spirit of the People's Republic's propaganda of the 1960's. Directed by Chen Guoxing, with a genuinely Spielbergian gloss and facility, "Roaring" depicts China's race to develop atomic weapons in the late 1950's and thus hurl a thunderbolt of defiance at the capitalist forces identified throughout as "the American bullies." 
 Where many, if not most, of the Chinese films shown in the United States in the last few years have been unauthorized, independent productions made outside the government system, this comes from the officially sanctioned side of the cultural divide. It's fascinating, and a bit frightening, to see how little the party line has changed, even as China has been thoroughly transformed economically.
As intellectualsand peasants unite under the glorious leadership of the Great Helmsman to lead the motherland into a radiant future, "Roaring" is a thinly disguised lecture on class solidarity that ends with a crowd chanting "Long live Chairman Mao" as Aaron Copland's "Fanfare for the Common Man" swells up on the soundtrack.
"Roaring Across the Horizon" is part of a series of films organized by China Century Entertainment that will be shown across the country this weekend under the sponsorship of The New York Times as part of its Arts & Leisure Weekend program. (In New York, it will be shown at the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street at Avenue A, East Village.)
"Journey to the Western Xia Empire" (1997), which will also be shown at Two Boots this weekend, enjoys the liberty of being a period film, and its politics are more muted. Directed and written by Lu Wei, with Chen Kaige (director of "Farewell, My Concubine") credited as "art adviser," the film tells of a band of soldiers sent out by the Xia emperor to collect a "blood tax" -- that is, male babies who can be raised in the emperor's service -- from a remote village.
The landscape photography is magnificent, and strongly reminiscent of Mr. Chen's breakthrough 1984 film, "Yellow Earth." But its stereotypical characters, melodramatic plotting and audience-pleasing close-ups of adorable children all suggest the profound limitations of filmmaking by committee, whether that committee meets in Beijing or Burbank.

NIEHUSS, MARVIN LEMMON

 BODY:
 NIEHUSS-Marvin Lemmon. Educator, dies at 100. Professor Marvin L. Niehuss, who had a distinguished career as a teacher and administrator at the University of Michigan, died on Monday in Ithaca, New York. 
He was 100 years old. Upon his retirement from Michigan in 1973, the Regents of the University noted that his "commitment and service to the University have been rarely matched" and that "few men in the history of the University have come to know it so well or have done more to help shape its destiny". Professor Niehuss' fifty year association with the University began as a student in 1920. In the 1930's he taught economics and law and during World War II was the Director of Emergency Training where he coordinated all Pentagon programs on the Michigan campus. After the war, he joined the University administration where he remained for twenty-five years. He initially served as Vice President with responsibility for appropriations from the Michigan legislature, and in the 1950's he was Dean of Faculties, overseeing the academic life of the University. In 1962, he was appointed Executive Vice President and later resumed teaching at the law school in 1968. Professor Niehuss was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and graduated high school from Greenville Military Academy, Greenville, Mississippi. He is survived by his children, John and Margaret (Louis) Munchmeyer, by his stepchildren, Katharine Kapp, Susan Burgess, and Roy Burgess and by four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
