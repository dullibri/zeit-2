HEADLINE: Latin States Shun U.S. Plan To Watch Over Democracy

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8 

 BODY:
In a sharp setback for the Bush administration's Latin America policy, the Organization of American States rejected a United States plan on Tuesday to create a committee to monitor the exercise of democracy in the hemisphere.
 Instead, the organization agreed, at a meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on a declaration that attaches equal or greater emphasis to attacking poverty because of what it calls ''the interdependent relationship of democracy and social and economic development.'' 
 The organization, which represents 34 states of the Western Hemisphere, voted to approve the resolution at midnight on Tuesday, but the language was not completed until Wednesday by staff members who lingered after the formal meeting. 
 The United States professed to be satisfied with the final resolution, even though it bears little resemblance to the proposal the State Department introduced last week. The resolution does not include the element that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice insisted it must have, a committee that would investigate troubled democracies.
 On Sunday, en route to the organization's meeting of foreign ministers, Ms. Rice responded to a reporter's question about the growing opposition to the United States plan, by asking how the organization could be effective without a ''mechanism that can help at times of crisis?''
 Still, on Wednesday afternoon, Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said that ''we believe that the declaration and its contents will help'' Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza ''and the organization carry out their important work.'' 
 ''We believe this is an excellent result,'' he said. 
 Several Latin American diplomats at the meeting said one reason they opposed the United States plan was that they thought it was aimed at Venezuela. The United States has been at odds with the populist government of President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela for several years, saying it is slowly eroding the nation's democratic freedoms.
 Last week, the Panamanian delegation to the Organization of American States offered a resolution similar to Washington's, but it did not gain any support.
 ''I think people misunderstand and thought it was about Venezuela,'' Aristides Royo, the Panamanian ambassador to the organization, said by way of explanation.
 During the three-day meeting, Venezuelan officials lobbied heavily against the United States proposal, to a sympathetic audience. 
 Foreign ministers and ambassadors also opposed the plan, Mr. Insulza said, because they feared it was a proposal for ''some sort of democratic police force.''
 The original American proposal said governments that do not govern in a democratic way ''must be held accountable'' by the organization and directed the council ''to develop a process, as appropriate,'' to ''make recommendations'' on ''how the permanent council should address threats to democracy in a timely fashion.''
 The final declaration says the secretary general will ''devise proposals for timely, effective, balanced, gradual initiatives for cooperation, as appropriate, in addressing situations that might affect the workings of the political process of democratic institutions or the legitimate exercise of power'' while respecting ''the principle of nonintervention and the right of self-determination.''
 Ms. Rice repeatedly called on the organization to allow citizens groups with concerns about their country to testify. The American proposal set out a mechanism for that. But Mr. Insulza said ''some governments don't want civil societies to feel they are the real representatives of their countries, when they are the ones that have been elected.''
 The final resolution says only that the organization should ''consider, in cooperation with governments, in an ongoing manner,'' the ''contributions of civil society.''

HEADLINE: Share Prices Stagnate Ahead of Greenspan Talk

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Shares erased their gains for a second day amid concern that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, may indicate tomorrow that interest rates need to rise further to contain inflation. 
 Anticipation of Mr. Greenspan's testimony to Congress overshadowed Texas Instruments' higher profit forecast, which helped to lift technology stocks. Energy shares like Exxon Mobil led the retreat as oil prices had their biggest loss in three weeks. 
 ''The interest rate picture is still not clear,'' said Patrick Connors, a trader at the Greenwich Prime Trading Group in Stamford, Conn., which manages accounts for about 40 hedge funds. ''You can also make the plain-vanilla argument the market has rallied a bit.''
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.59 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,194.67, after earlier rising as much as 0.4 percent. The benchmark has climbed 5 percent from its 2005 low on April 20.
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 6.21 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,476.86. The Nasdaq slipped 6.98 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,060.18.
 Eight stocks fell for every five that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.3 billion shares changed hands, 14 percent fewer than the three-month average.
 Mr. Greenspan, who is scheduled to testify about the economy and monetary policy, may say inflation remains a threat. The president of the Fed in Atlanta, Jack Guynn, said yesterday that labor costs were rising in some sectors, dashing optimism the central bank may signal an end to its plan to lift interest rates.
 The Fed has raised its benchmark rate eight consecutive times since last June, curbing the economy. Growth in the United States will slow to 3.4 percent in 2005, from 3.9 percent last year, a White House report said, down a tenth of a percentage point from its December forecast. Policy makers meet next on June 29.
 Energy shares were among the best performers as oil prices climbed to $55 a barrel in the first hour of trading in New York. Then the stocks erased gains as crude futures retreated, closing down 2.3 percent at $52.54, the biggest drop since May 18.
 Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, fell 72 cents, to $56.73. Occidental Petroleum lost 8 cents, to $73.70.
 Texas Instruments, whose semiconductors run more than half the cellphones sold last year, gained 62 cents, to $27.90. Second-quarter earnings will be 27 cents to 30 cents a share as consumers buy new phones that surf the Internet, the company said. Texas Instruments had predicted profit of 25 cents to 29 cents.
 ''I am surprised that the market is not getting a little bit of a lift here,'' said Wayne S. Reisner, president of Carret Asset Management, which oversees $1.6 billion in assets. ''The problem is that you get a little bit of momentum and then it dies off.''
 Investors may also have been reluctant to bid up shares before Intel updates its second-quarter forecast tomorrow, Mr. Reisner said. 
 Intel rose 24 cents, to $27.10. The company, the top maker of computer chips, may say sales this quarter will reach $9.2 billion, the top of its forecast range, Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Michael Masdea wrote in a note.
 General Motors, which said Tuesday that it planned to cut 25,000 jobs, added $1.29, to $32.02, for the biggest gain in the Dow average. The billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian said he was unable to buy all 28 million shares he sought in a tender offer for $31 each. That may prompt him to raise his bid, a J.P. Morgan analyst, Himanshu A. Patel, wrote in a note.
 In the bond market yesterday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 10/32, to 101 16/32, with the yield below 4 percent for another day. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.93 percent, from 3.90 percent.
 Here are the results from yesterday's auction of five-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 99.637
High Yield: 3.705

HEADLINE: Dancing With the Dictator

BYLINE: By Jasper Becker. 
Jasper Becker is the author of ''Rogue Regime: , Kim Jong Il and the Looming Threat of North Korea.''

DATELINE: Beijing 

 BODY:
THERE are hopes that President Bush's meeting tomorrow with President Roh Moo Hyun of South Korea, coming on the heels of the latest North Korean overture on restarting nuclear-weapons negotiations, may lead to a breakthrough. However, anyone who expects the South to help us put pressure on the North hasn't been paying much attention to what has happened between the two countries over the last five years. 
 Since South Korea's president at the time, Kim Dae Jung, met with North Korea's Kim Jong Il in 2000 (and pocketed a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts), Seoul has gone to remarkable lengths to gain the North's trust. Unsurprisingly, the only real changes under this Sunshine Policy have occurred in South Korea. And efforts by President Roh, who was elected in 2002, to engage Kim Jong Il have led him to plunge his own nation into North Korea's world of lies. 
 For example, Seoul no longer sees any evidence of North Korea's crimes: the government tries to keep South Korean newscasts from showing a smuggled tape of the public execution of ''criminals'' by the North that has been broadcast in Japan and elsewhere; reports that China is shipping refugees back to North Korea are denied by the Roh government; the North's testing of chemical weapons on live prisoners goes largely unmentioned; and even Pyongyang's apparent preparations for nuclear weapons tests are played down. 
 South Korea, a member of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, has abstained for the last three years from voting to condemn the North for its abuses. The South's latest national defense white paper even indicates that Seoul no longer considers the North to be its ''main enemy'' -- which implies that the presence of American forces on the peninsula is no longer necessary. 
 Because Seoul chooses to regard the North as a friendly neighbor, it no longer wants to help North Koreans fleeing the regime -- even though its Constitution declares that these refugees have the legal right to become citizens of South Korea. There have been press reports that Seoul has been pressuring China to prevent North Korean escapees from seeking asylum in South Korea's embassy and consulates in China (there are at least 100,000 North Koreans hiding in China).
 Last year, when 468 North Korean refugees who had taken refuge in Vietnam were flown into South Korea, Seoul's minister in charge of reunification declared that ''we disapprove of mass defections'' and promised there would not be another large-scale movement of refugees. In December, the ministry cut the ''resettlement'' grant program for escaped Northerners by two-thirds and announced that henceforth there would be far greater scrutiny of asylum-seekers (on the questionable grounds that these refugees might be spies).
 President Roh has defended this approach by more or less throwing up his hands. He refuses to give even moral support to dissidents in the North, claiming that Kim Jong Il would ruthlessly crush any protests. For Mr. Roh, there is no chance his ''partner for peace'' will fall from power; in fact, he makes clear that he would not wish the regime to crumble any time soon. 
 So, what has President Roh received for all this appeasement? The South still has to keep paying in hard cash for any political or economic contacts to take place -- it even has to bribe the North to take part in tae kwon do competitions. No reunions among families who have been divided since the armistice of 1953 have taken place in the last year; the previous rounds of reunions received a lot of positive news media coverage around the world but consisted of only brief encounters involving a small number of elderly people wanting to meet loved ones before they die. And, of course, the entire world has to put up with Pyongyang's nuclear shell game. 
 Many of those pushing the Sunshine Policy came of age while trying to force South Korea's postwar dictators to step down; they believe that the North can follow their model, in which economic gains paved the way for democracy. But forcing North Koreans to remain under Kim Jong Il's rule and hoping that he will make gradual reforms is unlikely to bear fruit. 
 North Korea undertook some economic changes in 2002, but they actually left the people worse off. A United Nations World Food Program report last month noted that the market price of rice in North Korea has nearly tripled and that of maize has quadrupled in the last year. And of course it is the government, with its monopoly on commodities, that reaps the profits from high prices. 
 Kim Jong Il has conned the South's big businesses as well as its government, luring them in with offers of exclusive concessions. For example, in 2000 the automaker Hyundai gave the North $500 million in exchange for a promise that it would be awarded all the major civil engineering projects Pyongyang would undertake after it received an influx of foreign aid. Hyundai has yet to realize any profit from the deal and its chairman, who faced criminal charges stemming from his dealings with the North, killed himself in 2003.
 WHY does Seoul pay so dearly to prop up the criminal regime? It has claimed that if North Korea were to collapse, it would cost $1.7 trillion to rebuild it, a sum that would cripple the South's treasury. But this figure seems preposterous. Given its population of about 23 million people, the North would need an emergency influx of only about $1 billion a year to pay for food, medicines and fuel until it got back on its feet. South Korea, with its trillion-dollar gross domestic product, could easily afford this. 
 Nor is Seoul necessarily correct to assume that the collapse of the North would lead to an exodus of desperate people to the South. After ridding themselves of the criminal regime, wouldn't those in the North be just as likely to stay in their homes than to flee south as paupers? The huge need for capital investment in the North would probably create an economic boom, just as it has done in China over the last 25 years. With Mr. Kim gone, South Korean conglomerates and international agencies like the World Bank would be eager to invest in new power stations and factories. Unification is more likely to provide a boost to the South Korean economy than to damage it. 
 But beyond the economic factors, we must consider the moral ones. South Korea is seeking to keep a tyrant in power against the wishes of his own people. At 63, Kim Jong Il has spent a lifetime in a paranoid and claustrophobic dictatorship. If he were going to become a reformer, we would surely know it by now. And even if against all odds he undertook reforms, he is still personally responsible for a manmade famine that has killed 3 million people over the last decade. Would Pol Pot have been given a second chance if he had vowed to open Cambodia's markets? 
 Rather than coddling Kim Jong Il and paying him nuclear blackmail, we should be working to arraign him before an international criminal tribunal, just as we did with the murdering leaders of Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Yes, it is highly unlikely we would ever get him before such a court, but simply making the symbolic effort might get leaders in China, Japan, South Korea and the West to envision just how attractive a post-Kim era would be for everyone.

HEADLINE: Makeup of Jackson Jury Seems to Favor Prosecution

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and JONATHAN D. GLATER

DATELINE: SANTA MARIA, Calif., June 8 

 BODY:
The jurors who have been weighing Michael Jackson's fate since Friday can hardly be described as peers of a global celebrity who lives in a world of fantasy and has made and spent hundreds of millions of dollars over a 40-year music career.
 But these 12 men and women, who range in age from 20 to 79, do represent a fairly typical cross-section of the community in which Mr. Jackson resides. Among them are a retired school counselor, a horse trainer, a 79-year-old retiree who likes to watch ''Jeopardy!,'' a fan of the conservative television commentator Bill O'Reilly, a young mother of two who lives with her unemployed boyfriend, and a young man who uses a wheelchair and who once visited Mr. Jackson's Neverland estate. 
 There is no way to know, of course, what is happening inside the jury room, and the jurors have asked for little guidance from the judge as they continue their deliberations. The jury left the courthouse on Wednesday without reaching a verdict after their third full day of deliberations.
 But jury consultants and some lawyers who have followed the trial, while reluctant to predict a verdict, said that there appeared to be more jurors who would typically be considered friendly to the prosecution. 
 The jury consists of eight women and four men, eight people who are parents and four who are not, eight who are over 40 years old and four who are not. All but two have taken at least some college classes, and some have advanced degrees. Seven described themselves as white, three as Hispanic, one as Asian, and one declined to state a racial or ethnic group. There are no African-Americans on the jury, but one black man sat through the trial as an alternate.
 Stephen J. Paterson, a jury consultant from Los Angeles, said that the jurors over all appeared to reflect the politically and culturally conservative area around Santa Maria, in northern Santa Barbara County. 
 ''I would guess that by and large this is a fairly bright jury, given where this case is being tried and the occupations and education,'' said Mr. Paterson, president and chief executive of Vinson & Company, a trial consulting firm. ''If I were to give an edge to anybody, I would give it to the prosecution, simply because they have a circumstantial case that requires jurors to connect the dots.''
 It is difficult to predict what it may mean that so many jurors are parents -- they could view Mr. Jackson as a predator, but they might be more skeptical of the case against him, Mr. Paterson said.
 ''On the one hand, they may be more sympathetic to the prosecution's position, but on the other hand they might say to themselves, 'I would never put my kid in the position that this woman put her kid in,''' he said, referring to the mother of Mr. Jackson's accuser. 
 The case against Mr. Jackson hinges in large degree on whether jurors believe his accuser, now 15, who said that Mr. Jackson molested him on several occasions more than two years ago. Defense lawyers attacked the boy's credibility, and said that his mother was money-hungry and had put him up to the accusations.
 One juror, the retired high school guidance counselor, said during jury selection that he believed that some children ''might lie a little bit if it's in their interest.'' He also said that he believed that children could be coached to lie by their parents.
 David Tunno, a trial consultant in Ventura, Calif., reviewed information on the individual jurors. He focused immediately on juror No. 6, who according to her juror questionnaire is a 22-year-old physical therapist who lives with her unemployed boyfriend and has taken some college classes, as most likely to favor the defense's case.
 ''A young, uneducated female, uneducated boyfriend, little bit of a Neverland connection there,'' Mr. Tunno said, referring to an item on the questionnaire that suggested she knew people who either had met Mr. Jackson or had visited his ranch.
 On the other hand, juror No. 1, a 62-year-old civil engineer, struck Mr. Tunno as a prosecution juror. People in technical professions, with a scientific background, ''tend to believe the police more,'' he said. ''They're very mainstream establishment-type people. They would be more able to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to what's really important in the case.''
 But Mr. Tunno cautioned against making too many predictions, saying the case involves a celebrity about whom people may have complicated feelings and preconceptions. ''A lot of the information that you use to profile someone gets thrown out,'' he said, ''because this is a screwy case.''

HEADLINE: College and Our Economy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 The ''Class Matters'' series and Thomas L. Friedman's columns about the ''flat'' world illustrate an increasingly clear fact: the life chances of our people and the viability of our economy now depend on widespread, successful participation in higher education, with no compromise on quality.
 At a minimum, this is what it will take. Higher education needs to increase productivity, focus more on improving teaching and learning, and focus less on competing for a bigger market share of bright students.
 Educators and policy makers must get more serious about accountability, but employ it for self-discipline, not finger-pointing. Students must take more rigorous, demanding courses in high school, and state and federal policy makers must face up to the fact that more money is required, especially for student aid and early outreach programs to working-class students.

HEADLINE: Europe's Latest Economic Scapegoat: The Euro

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: PARIS, June 8 

 BODY:
Is the euro in danger of dying before it reaches its seventh birthday?
 A suggestion by Italian cabinet ministers that the country hold a referendum on withdrawing from the common currency drew denunciations from much of Europe, as finance ministers met in Luxembourg this week. But the fact that they were discussing the issue at all highlighted the notion that Europe's common currency is taking part of the blame for the Continent's economic woes.
 Few, if any, think the euro will stop being the legal currency of much of Europe. But after French and Dutch voters stunned the political establishment by rejecting the proposed European constitution, those opposed to other European institutions have been emboldened. 
 ''It is just inconceivable that a country could envisage dropping out of the euro,'' said Jean-Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg premier and current president of the European Union. Hans Eichel, the German finance minister, said the very idea of a country withdrawing was ''nonsense,'' and Pedro Solbes, the Spanish economy minister, called the common currency ''irreversible.'' 
 The row was started when two Italian cabinet ministers from the Northern League, which is tenuously allied with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, suggested a referendum on returning to the lira. Mr. Berlusconi did not endorse the idea, but neither did he denounce it. For the last year, he has said the blame for many of Italy's economic woes lies with the European Central Bank, for keeping interest rates too high and for allowing the euro to gain against the dollar.
 Nostalgia for national currencies has risen in the last year as European unemployment has remained stubbornly high and growth has trailed that of the United States and Asia. A poll taken late last month by the Forsa organization for Stern magazine found 56 percent of Germans preferred to return to the mark. The magazine said the margin of error was three percentage points.
 On one level, the euro has been a great success. Travel among the 12 countries that use it is far easier, and companies in those countries can contract with others knowing there is no currency risk involved. The euro was officially created at the beginning of 1999, but actual euro coins and bills did not become legal currency until the beginning of 2002.
 But economic integration of the euro zone has not come as rapidly as some had hoped and that has created stresses. ''You cannot succeed over any length of time with one monetary policy and 12 fiscal policies,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG Inc. 
 Europe tried to finesse that fact with an agreement that no government using the euro would allow its budget deficit to exceed more than 3 percent of gross domestic product, but in fact a number of countries have exceeded that limit. Rather than levy fines, as was envisioned, the response thus far has been to weaken the rule while encouraging countries to do better.
 To the extent that Europe does pursue excessively easy fiscal policies, the response would probably be a weakening of the currency, as has happened in recent weeks. That has aroused concern in Europe even though some, including Mr. Berlusconi, have been loudly calling for a weaker euro for many months.
 When the euro was being designed, some economists forecast that European countries would be forced to liberalize their economies because devaluation within the euro zone would be impossible. In that context, liberalization refers to making an economy more flexible, with workers easier to hire and fire. Most European governments have tried to follow that prescription in one way or another, but anger from voters and unions has forced retreats, and in some countries liberalization has become very unpopular.
 Before the euro was cast in stone, Italy periodically allowed its currency to depreciate against the German mark. Such devaluations were often turbulent, and were accompanied by pledges that it would not happen again. But they served to allow the Italian economy to regain competitiveness with other European economies where inflation was lower and productivity growth greater. Since the euro was introduced, those trends have continued, but devaluation is out of the question. Italy is now in recession.
 Blaming Europe for national problems has happened in countries besides Italy and pressure has been growing on the European Central Bank to lower its short-term interest rate, now at 2 percent. Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the central bank, has backed away from statements ruling out a rate cut, though he has not endorsed one.
 Lower interest rates might help stimulate European economies, and a lower euro could help exporters, but neither would address issues of Italy's competitive position with other parts of Europe. Its position has also been hurt because some of its traditional industries, like textiles, have been damaged by Chinese competition.
 It is not clear how Italy, or any other country in the euro, could withdraw if it wished to do so. The Maastricht Treaty that established the currency has no withdrawal provision.
 If a country were to insist on withdrawing, presumably it could. But there would be the risk of higher interest rates and a greater reluctance of foreigners to invest. There would also be issues of whether debts contracted in euros could be converted to national currencies that might then depreciate against the euro.
 For now, it is unlikely that talk of countries getting out of the euro will advance very far. But the talk highlights that the financial unification of Europe is a work in progress, one that has not advanced as rapidly as its advocates expected.
 ''We are proceeding too slowly,'' Mr. Trichet said this week in Beijing, where he was attending a conference of central bankers, ''but we are proceeding with unifying the market.''

HEADLINE: U.N. Reports Say Poverty Causes Deeper Worry South of Sahara

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
With the richest nations scheduled to address the problems of the poorest at a summit meeting in July, the United Nations released two reports yesterday that sound an alarm about deteriorating conditions in sub-Saharan Africa and call for increased aid and debt relief.
 A report on the so-called Millennium Development Goals details rising numbers of grindingly poor and hungry people in Africa. 
 The other report, a statistical analysis from the United Nations Development Program, projects that 28 million African children will die needlessly over the coming decade if the continent continues on its current path, falling short of an international goal to reduce the mortality rates of children under age 5 by two-thirds by 2015. 
 Experts at the United Nations Development Program said their projections ''reflect current trends, not destiny.''
 Secretary General Kofi Annan praised the European Union yesterday for its recent commitment to almost double aid in five years and pointedly added at a news conference, ''I look to all donors to follow their example.''
 The United States has declined to make a similar commitment. Administration officials say they have already tripled aid to Africa since President Bush took office and contend that a more gradual buildup of assistance will give African countries time to develop the capacity to spend the money well.
 Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who is advocating a doubling of aid by 2010, has put Africa's plight at the top of the agenda for the Group of 8 major industrial nations, whose leaders are to meet July 6-8 in Gleneagles, Scotland.
 While agreeing with American officials that Africa must confront corruption, Mr. Blair, the European Union, the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, contend that more African nations are ready to spend much more money productively.
 Each report assesses the human costs of failing to achieve goals that the world's heads of state unanimously endorsed five years ago to reduce poverty, hunger, child mortality and illiteracy.
 ''The Gleneagles G-8 Summit in July 2005 provides a critical opportunity to prevent the potential human development costs identified in this report from becoming actual costs,'' says the United Nations Development Program's report, from the agency's Human Development Report Office.
 It forecasts that 5.1 million African children will die in 2015. That is more than the 4.8 million who now die each year and 3 million more than if the goal were met. 
 The report on the Millennium Development Goals says almost half of all deaths among children under 5 occur in sub-Saharan Africa, while globally half the 11 million annual child deaths are the result of five diseases: pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, measles and AIDS. 
 ''Most of these lives could be saved by expanding low-cost prevention and treatment measures,'' the report says.
 Even as poverty deepens in Africa, with stagnating agriculture and the staggering toll of AIDS, the world as a whole is likely to meet the goal of halving extreme poverty, largely because of progress in India, China and other Asian nations, the report says.

HEADLINE: A No-Frills Finals That the Purists Can Appreciate

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

DATELINE: San Antonio 

 BODY:
BEHOLD, a series about basketball.
 An N.B.A. finals that features two fundamentally sound, feud-free, egalitarian, egos-in-check teams with leading men who don't dominate their casts as much as they support them.
 A finals that matches a hard-hat union from the industrial heartland defending its championship and, in a larger sense, American-born honor against the internationally flavored blend of Tim Duncan from the U.S. Virgin Islands, Manu Ginobili from Argentina and Tony Parker from France.
 But can a league that has conditioned its audience by blurring the line between pop culture and sport really flourish presenting opera without soap? 
 ''True basketball enthusiasts, who know how the game should be played, I think they will love it,'' guard Lindsey Hunter said before the indefatigable Ginobili drew first blood, scoring 22 of his 26 points in the second half and powering the Spurs to an series-launching victory, 84-69, last night at the SBC Center. ''Other people that want, you know, the star-studded, all the underlying stories and all that, they probably won't be too intrigued.''
 In other words, all celebrity-seeking sycophants, who wouldn't know a back door from a drop step, be forewarned: for the next couple of weeks, the topic of discussion will be nuts and bolts, not LeBron. 
 Where have all the primary shoe pitchmen gone? Home to watch on television, lest they swell the ranks of couch-potato Americans who are expected to pass on the series or just pass out. Once again, the finals are on a Sunday-Tuesday-Thursday rotation, leaving the audience in the Eastern part of the United States with pretty much the same choice as Europe: go to work or school the next day with bags under the eyes, or just bag it. 
 Too bad, for no matter how few points the Pistons and the Spurs eventually score, no one will be able to accuse them of not earning their millions -- a point worth considering as it has become clear that the glitzy, fawn-over-me formula championed in recent years by the commissioner and chief choreographer David Stern has worn woefully thin.
 Across the board, N.B.A. television ratings this spring have taken a plunge, along with merchandising sales. Bloomberg News recently reported that fan focus groups operated on behalf of the league by Matthew Dowd, a key strategist in President Bush's re-election campaign, indicate a significant disconnect.
 The melee at the Palace of Auburn Hills in November obviously didn't help, but could this also be a byproduct of longstanding attempts to camouflage what many saw as a diminished product with promotional gimmickry? Is it possible that the N.B.A. has been too busy focusing on upscale demographics and is now suffering the effects for neglecting and even pricing out its core fans? 
 On the eve of the series, Rasheed Wallace concurred with Hunter that it wasn't going to be eye candy for the beautiful people, and he included the corporate executives in the home office. ''I think that's what they're worried about,'' Wallace said. ''Here in this series, there's no real stars; there's team unity.'' 
 Wallace has had his share of objectionable outbursts but that wasn't one of them. At long last, somebody has spoke out for the fan who has never needed or wanted pregame explosions of fire and shrieking public-address announcers, who has never gone to an N.B.A. arena hoping for a faux hip-hop experience, a staged equivalent of Woody Allen directing ''Boyz n the Hood.'' 
 All real fans ask for is a good, intense game to the season's last drop, and let's remember it's been 11 years since the N.B.A. finals have gone seven. For much of the last decade, June has essentially been a coronation of a Michael Jordan, a Shaquille O'Neil. After a rusty start last night that put the Spurs into a 17-4 hole, they dominated Detroit in the second half, but it's one game at home, nothing more. Count on the Pistons, resilient and fierce, to come back Sunday, ready for Round 2.
 In their march through the West, the adaptable Spurs at times played like an offensive machine. This is different, though. This is the No. 1-ranked defensive team in the league, San Antonio, against No. 2, Detroit. All baskets will be earned, the way Ginobili sliced through the Pistons' meat-grinder interior.
 He began the season coming off the gold-medal stand in Athens and now is three victories away from a second N.B.A. title. Explain why a knowledgeable basketball fan would pine for Kobe Bryant or Shaq while watching Ginobili's imported overdrive make the Pistons look like a tired old model from General Motors, or while watching the beautifully skilled Duncan carry the Spurs from the low post early on.
 I'm guessing the smart fan will take this series, will recognize the great rotational defense both teams play, appreciate the persistence of the Spurs' Bruce Bowen chasing after Richard Hamilton last night as if Hamilton had stolen his wallet.
 ''It's going to be a war, a long series,'' Hamilton promised after shooting 7 for 21.
 With the Jordan bubble having burst, the best thing the N.B.A. can do for itself is come to grips with economic fluctuations, with market realities. This is a league that needs to build another foundation of credibility, promote the game first for the fan who can applaud the Pistons and the Spurs for the way they play it. The way they are likely to continue playing it for another five or six games.

HEADLINE: Baja or Bust (or Both)

BYLINE: By DAN HALPERN

 BODY:
THE choppers come in first. That's how you know something big is coming. Two, three, four helicopters carrying race officials and film crews tracking the leaders of the race, they pop up suddenly over a bluff, swinging in crazily like huge drunken dragonflies. The crowd knows this and starts to jabber, a tense ripple of collective excitement and nerves. Small boys wearing T-shirts that say things like ''Tu mama me excita,'' 10- or 11-year-olds who have been drinking beer all morning, dash back and forth across the dirt course. Then you see the dust.
 The dust in the distance is like a tiny concentrated tornado, and it moves very, very fast over the cracked brown landscape, closer and closer toward the crowd. When the dust gets very close, it disappears for a moment, hidden by a hill. And then you hear the great roaring of the engine. 
 The first truck crests the hill at 50 miles an hour or more and flies up in the air, a monstrous bull shark of a machine that is any number of steps removed on the evolutionary chain from its original form as a Ford F-150 or Chevrolet CK1500. When it hits, it fishtails down the narrow, uneven dirt course, bouncing down over rocks and holes, and then the engine revs hard and it's through the little plateau and already up the next hill toward you, taking a full right-angle turn at the top of the incline without seeming to brake at all, two wheels off the ground. Some of the spectators and photographers play an immensely stupid, immensely thrilling matador game with the machine, standing almost exactly on the point of the turn; there are no fences, barricades or officials to stop them.
 This is the Baja 500, the famed off-road race that begins and ends in Ensenada, Mexico, some 70 miles south into Baja California from Tijuana and the United States border. The kids and the cameramen can feel the rush of air as the big shark thunders past them with just inches to spare. The two wheels on the left side hang over the far embankment for just an instant, and then the driver has it righted, and he accelerates with a huge roar up the little straightaway and past the crowd. As soon as the rear wheels pass, the dust hits, a huge cloud of brown blindness that covers everything. It's almost like a magic trick: by the time it clears and you can see anything at all, the truck is gone.
 LAST weekend, hundreds of racers flooded Baja for a couple of days of bad craziness that was established long before marketing executives saw the commercial possibilities of extreme sports. Its sister race, the Baja 1000, whose course stretches from Ensenada to La Paz near the southern tip of the peninsula, runs in November and is the more famous event, but the 500 is often called the tougher race to finish.
 Last weekend's race -- officially the Tecate Score International Baja 500 -- featured 24 professional and 5 amateur classes, from nimble 126-c.c. motorbikes to 800-horsepower marquee-class ''trophy-trucks,'' from jacked-up VW Baja Bugs to two-seater custom desert cars that looked straight out of some post-apocalyptic vehicular anarchy. Most of the drivers came down the coast from El Norte, crossing the border from San Diego to Tijuana and continuing to Ensenada along Mexico Highway 1, a gorgeous toll road that rolls along the Pacific past surfing beaches and vineyards.
 On Friday, the racers lined up in the tourist section of Ensenada, near the ocean. The race teams pushed the vehicles around a few blocks in the center of town in a daylong parade that culminated in vehicle inspections. The crowds were enormous: race organizers estimated that at least 150,000 people watched the weekend's events, and the Ensenada schools are closed every year so that students can go out to look at the cars.
 It was a hot, whirring scrum of inebriated, rapturous humanity, with lots of heavy machinery on display, pneumatic marvels created by wizards with specialties in mad automotive science. Mexican rock bands blasted the area with slightly addled versions of Southern rock from 10-foot speakers; sponsors like Tecate and Coca-Cola sent troupes of young women, outfitted in tight red and green uniforms that barely qualified as clothing, to every event. 
 The race began at 6 a.m. on Saturday. The motorcycles went first, then the all-terrain vehicles, then the mammoth trophy-trucks, then the cars and smaller trucks. At the first wash -- a dry streambed -- 45,000 fans screamed as the vehicles hurtled by. 
 The course for the race led east out of Ensenada toward the town of Ojos Negros, then south, then west again to the coast, through Tres Hermanos and Erendira, and then east again past Valle de Trinidad, all the way through mountains, desert and plain, through sand and dirt and rock and water, until it returned to Ojos Negros and the final leg back to Ensenada -- 419 miles in all (not quite the advertised 500), meant to be run within a time limit of 17 hours.
 Much of the local population adores the racers -- many of the competitors described experiences like getting a flat and finding 15 villagers rushing up to work on the tire before the racer had even unbuckled. But anything can happen along the way. Johnny Campbell, 34, a five-time Baja motorcycle champion from San Clemente, Calif., said that he once turned a corner to find himself being held up by three bandits with guns, standing in the middle of the course.
 And there are others who simply like the idea of contributing to the mayhem. Racers have often been defeated by booby traps set up for maximum damage: telephone poles half-buried across the course and hidden by brush and dirt, or deep ditches in the course, dug the night before the race, filled with pools of water and camouflaged with grass and straw. Last weekend, one racer was overheard describing how he had just taken the hood off his car to make a repair when a spectator hit him on the head with a rock. By the time he figured out what was happening, the hood was gone. 
 Nevertheless, racing the 500 is a somewhat less depraved prospect than it once was. In the early days, the course wasn't even marked -- you just had to get from checkpoint to checkpoint any way you could. Now, things are much tighter.
 The trophy-trucks are $500,000 to $1 million vehicles, and sponsors like BF Goodrich and Red Bull help defray the huge costs of things the top racers need, like professional pit crews, transportation and insurance. Last year, Mark Miller, 42, of Carefree, Ariz., and Ryan Arciero, 30, of Foothill Ranch, Calif., had their trophy-truck outfitted so it could be refueled by another vehicle without having to stop. This year they had a camera and a monitor in the cab that allowed them to see through dust and pick up the heat of other vehicles at night.
 IT'S not just lone lunacy, but big business. Sal Fish, the president of Score International, who has planned and run the race since 1974, estimated that it adds $10 million a year to the Ensenada economy. 
 Parts of the course run on regular highways that are open to regular traffic, but the racers are required to stay below 60 miles an hour on these sections. Some admit that in the past they ignored this rule completely when they could, but this year, vehicles were outfitted with a device that allowed officials to see how fast the racers were going at every point in the race. Speeders on the highway sections are penalized or disqualified, and this year three 20-minute penalties were doled out to violators. 
 Still, the race is far from civilized. Anyone can take part; for all the million-dollar trophy-trucks, there are also $10,000 cars built by amateurs. But it's not exactly for the faint of heart. Drivers have hit cattle and driven off cliffs -- you need to know what you're doing. 
 ''There are spectators everywhere,'' said Ivan Stewart, a 17-time Baja 500 champion who won his first title in 1974. ''And when it gets late in the afternoon it gets even more dangerous. Because by then they've been drinking all day. You can't expect them to get out of the way any more.'' 
 By nightfall Saturday, spectators had begun stealing course markers, and drivers were hopelessly off route. ''I couldn't get through the dust -- I couldn't see anything,'' said Mike Halliday, 43, of Riverside, Calif., who drove a Jimco-VW, its large exposed wheels designed for the desert course. ''We missed a turn and hit a guide wire or something, I have no idea. I started going the wrong way, but luckily a local said, 'Follow me,' and took me back to the course. I was so lost I had no idea where I was.''
 The top motorcycles and trophy-trucks took about nine hours to finish, pulling into the finish line inside the Ensenada baseball stadium in the late afternoon. But other finishers were crossing the line until around 6 a.m. on Sunday. They arrived covered in mud, ripped up, missing fenders and headlights, the roofs of their truck cabs cracked in half from having rolled over once, twice, even three times. One truck's entire left side was gone. ''We lost reverse around Mile 170,'' one driver said, ''and the brakes were gone 30 miles later.'' Still, he finished. 
 But some vehicle classes had no winners because they had no finishers. The racers hit rocks and hills and one another; they had flat tires and rolled their vehicles and drove into ditches; they watched their vehicles splinter and break and die. 
 Sunday, the results were posted, trophies handed out and girlfriends and Jesus and pit crews thanked. Robby Gordon, the Nascar driver and team owner, who started his career in off-road racing, took the overall four-wheel-vehicle title; he had already left for a Nascar event. 
 Of the 345 vehicles that started the race last Saturday, 180 finished. It was a light year for injuries: a broken shoulder here, a lacerated leg there. Dead vehicles at the bottom of a huge hill in the southwestern part of the course caused an enormous traffic pileup. ''We were there for an hour,'' said Bruce Anderson, 49, a Baja Bug driver from Riverside, Calif. ''There were rollovers and broke vehicles and no way to pass.''
 ''There's something about Baja,'' said Judy Smith, 72, a motorsports journalist and a former off-road racer herself. ''Something happens to people here. Something happens, and after that they can never stay away.'' 

The Off-Road Life

Drive Your Own Desert Racer
 THE next big race in Baja California is the Baja 1000, Nov. 17 to 20 this year. It will start in Ensenada and finish some 40 hours later. 
 Some companies provide tours in which you can drive a version of the course with vehicles they provide (not in the race itself). Wide Open Baja offers four-day off-road tours in open-wheeled desert racers around Ensenada and Cabo San Lucas, as well as a seven-day tour of the entire peninsula. The Ensenada tour is $3,595; Cabo, $4,395; and the peninsula, $7,495. More information is at www.wideopenbaja.com, (949)635-2292. 
 A number of companies offer off-road motorcycle tours that cover racecourse terrain. The Chris Haines Motorcycle Adventure Company (www.bajaoffroadtours.com, 949-218-9941) gives four- , five- and seven-day Baja tours that range from $1,950 to $4,500. 
 Tim Morton's Baja Bound (run by the man who won the 250-class motorcycle division on Saturday; www.bajaboundmoto.com, 888-664-2252), leads motorcycle tours over racing terrain. A three-day tour starts at $1,100. 
 Anyone can drive in the 1000 for the entry fee, $850. The form is on the race Web site: www.score-international.com/baja1000.

HEADLINE: Beef Demand Seen in Peril As Prices Rise

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, June 9 

 BODY:
Agriculture officials made a case on Thursday for reopening the border with Canada to live cattle, saying that high beef prices were starting to drive consumers away from beef to pork and chicken.
 The prices for choice-grade beef averaged $4.20 a pound this spring, up from the previous high of $4.13 a pound in the fall of 2004, said Keith Collins, the chief economist for the United States Agriculture Department. Some restaurants have indicated that customers are cutting back on beef, he said, and pork and chicken producers are ramping up their production. 
 While demand for beef remains robust, ''we are right at the point where some consumers are going to walk away from beef,'' said Mr. Collins, speaking at a roundtable discussion of the American-Canadian cattle border, which has been closed to cattle since May 2003, when bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow disease, was found in Canada.
 Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns said the one-day event was intended to educate consumers about the economic problems caused by the border closure. Mr. Johanns' effort to reopen the border in March were stopped by a cattle group that won an injunction in a Montana federal district court, citing lingering concerns about the safety of Canadian cattle. 
 The situation is unlikely to change until a federal appeals court in San Francisco reviews the case on July 13. A trial has been scheduled for July 27 in Billings, Mon., where the injunction was issued.
 After closing the border in May 2003, the United States resumed imports of packaged beef from Canada in October of that year. After a dairy cow in Washington State was found to have mad cow in December 2003, 53 countries banned American beef. 
 The closure has cost the American beef industry about $4 billion a year. The United States has recovered about a third of its beef exports, but Japan, which had accounted for nearly half, continues to refuse beef.
 Bill Bullard, the chief executive of Ranchers-Cattlemen's Action Legal Fund, the cattle group that won the injunction, disputed Mr. Collins' assessment of cattle prices. He said that high beef prices could not be attributed to the border closure alone because higher imports of packaged beef from Canada have offset the loss of live cattle.
 And higher imports of cattle from Mexico to the United States have reduced the total cattle lost to only 1 million; the United States has 95 million cattle in its herd. 
 ''This is not a crisis situation,'' Mr. Bullard said. 
 But Mr. Collins said uncertainty over the Canadian border was contributing to a ''kind of euphoria in bidding up cattle prices'' that had fed into the high retail prices. 
 Mr. Johanns said he hoped a resumption of normal trade with Canada would stabilize the market and lead prices down gradually. He said he was concerned that the border closure was hurting packing plants, some of which rely on Canadian cattle. The closure has contributed to the loss of 6,100 jobs, including some 200 from a plant in Gering, Neb., that announced on Thursday that it was closing in part because of the ban on Canadian cattle.

HEADLINE: Report Describes Immigrants As Younger and More Diverse

BYLINE: By JOHN FILES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9 

 BODY:
New Census Bureau figures released on Thursday show that the immigrant population in the United States is becoming younger, a shift likely to foster more tolerance for diversity and perhaps accelerate assimilation, demographers and immigration experts say.
 The figures show that immigration trends are forming a unique generational divide: those immigrants over 40 are largely white, while those under 40 are increasingly Hispanic, Asian and from other minority groups. 
 ''The older, white-dominated society is thinning out into the past,'' William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, said. ''It is being replaced by the broad diversity of a younger generation.'' 
 Mr. Frey added: ''We will become a more tolerant society as these young people move toward adulthood and a blurring occurs of the sharp racial distinctions of the previous decades.''
 The increase in younger immigrants is particularly noticeable among the nation's largest minority group, Hispanics, half of whom are under age 27. One of every five children under age 18 in the United States is Hispanic, the census figures show.
 Hispanics accounted for about half of the overall population growth of 2.9 million people from 2003 to 2004, according to the census report. One of every seven people in the United States is Hispanic, a record number that experts say will keep increasing because of continued immigration and a birth rate that outpaces that of non-Hispanic blacks and whites.
 The Hispanic growth rate of 3.6 percent in the period looked at was more than three times the 1 percent rate for the total population. (The rate was 3.4 percent for Asians, 1.9 percent for Pacific Islanders, 1.2 percent for American Indians, 1.1 percent for blacks and 0.3 percent for whites.)
 The Census Bureau said that in July 2004, there were 41.3 million Hispanics out of a national population of nearly 294 million. 
 Political scientists and immigration experts debate whether Hispanics will achieve the success of the Greeks, Italians and other Europeans of the last century who were often assimilated after two or three generations. 
 Hispanic immigrants generally enter the country with a low level of education and take up low-paying jobs, and often struggle economically. 
 But Rodolfo O. de la Garza, a political science professor at Columbia University, said he was encouraged by the census figures, saying that the growing Hispanic population reflected a ''powerful cultural transformation.''
 Mr. de la Garza said most of the immigrants who arrived in the United States were part of a working population of relatively young people. As their children begin to attend school and learn English, he said, they will become part of a blended culture that is ''influencing and being influenced more openly'' by mainstream American mores and attitudes.
 Mr. de la Garza, who is 60, said that when he was young the idea of a Mexican-American riding the waves was ridiculous. ''Now there are Chicano surfers,'' he said. ''It is indicative of cultural incorporation. ''
 The relatively youthful immigrants will also likely lead to a geographic expansion beyond traditionally ethnic areas around the country, Mr. de la Garza said.
 ''The Mexicans are never going to all get out of California and the Latins are not all going to leave Florida,'' he said. ''But there probably will be more movement. With success and education, there is naturally more mobility.''
 Jeffrey S. Passel, a demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center here, said that since 2000 Hispanic births had outnumbered Hispanic immigrants. 
 ''It is the beginning of this process,'' Mr. Passel said. ''A large share of Hispanic immigrants have been here a short time. The concept of what it means to be Hispanic in America will change as the population matures, and a greater percentage of American-born Hispanics increases.''
 Mr. Passel and Mr. Frey, of Brookings, both said the changing dynamic of the immigrant population in the United States would help it prosper in a global economy.
 While Japan and some European countries have taken restrictive stances toward immigration and endangered their own productivity as a result, they said, the United States will benefit from a work force that is evolving into a more diverse group.

PERSON: Arthur Dunkel

HEADLINE: Arthur Dunkel, Trade Diplomat, Dies at 72

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Arthur Dunkel, a self-effacing Swiss diplomat who shepherded negotiators from five continents through more than seven years of contentious talks that led to freer trade and the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1995, died Wednesday in Geneva. He was 72.
 His death followed a long illness, according to a news release from the trade group's headquarters in Geneva. 
 Mr. Dunkel had been director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for two years when a group of trade ministers met in Geneva in 1982 to discuss reducing trade barriers in the pact, which was then 34 years old. Their talks stalled over whether the changes should include agriculture, but efforts by Mr. Dunkel and others to liberalize and update trade rules to respond to growing tensions between developed and developing nations finally led in 1986 to the start of the most comprehensive trade negotiations in history, at Punte del Este, Uruguay.
 ''He went out of his way to give developing countries a voice,'' said Dr. Jagdish Bhagwati, a Columbia University economist who served as Mr. Dunkel's adviser from 1991 to 1993.
 The GATT talks were known as the Uruguay Round although negotiators never returned to that country. In addition to tackling bitter disputes over subsidies to agriculture and textile industries in the developed countries, they ranged over topics previously outside of GATT, like intellectual property rights and trade in services. More than 120 nations were involved by the time the final agreement was signed in Marrakesh, Morocco, in April 1994.
 The signing came nine months after Mr. Dunkel resigned as director general, but the basis of the agreement was a 500-page document he wrote late in 1991, when the negotiations seemed hopelessly deadlocked. Known as the Dunkel Draft, it laid the groundwork for creating the World Trade Organization as a successor to GATT and set the general terms on which most of the points of contention were settled.
 ''He would never have called it the Dunkel Draft because he was too modest,'' said Clayton Yeutter, the United States trade representative when the Uruguay Round began. ''But when things were in such disarray that it looked as if nobody could pull it together, he put together a text that was exceptionally well balanced. He could discern what people could really rally around.''
 Just as important, Mr. Yeutter said, Mr. Dunkel's experience in international trade and personal relationships with crucial figures around the world allowed him to understand each nation's negotiating limits. He was fluent in five languages. 
 Arthur Dunkel was born Aug. 22, 1932. Reports disagree on whether he was born in Schaffhouse, Switzerland, or Lisbon, Portugal. Mr. Dunkel told The New York Times in a 1990 interview that his father was a textile designer who moved the family to Portugal in the 1930's to escape a recession in Switzerland.
 Mr. Dunkel graduated from the University of Lausanne with a degree in economic and commercial services in 1956 and immediately joined a recently created Swiss government office dealing with foreign trade. He rose through a succession of jobs to become Switzerland's top trade official before becoming head of GATT in 1980.
 After retiring from GATT in 1993, he founded a business as a trade consultant, served on the board of Nestle and taught at the University of Geneva and the University of Fribourg in Switzerland.

HEADLINE: Losing Our Country

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Baby boomers like me grew up in a relatively equal society. In the 1960's America was a place in which very few people were extremely wealthy, many blue-collar workers earned wages that placed them comfortably in the middle class, and working families could expect steadily rising living standards and a reasonable degree of economic security.
 But as The Times's series on class in America reminds us, that was another country. The middle-class society I grew up in no longer exists. 
 Working families have seen little if any progress over the past 30 years. Adjusted for inflation, the income of the median family doubled between 1947 and 1973. But it rose only 22 percent from 1973 to 2003, and much of that gain was the result of wives' entering the paid labor force or working longer hours, not rising wages. 
 Meanwhile, economic security is a thing of the past: year-to-year fluctuations in the incomes of working families are far larger than they were a generation ago. All it takes is a bit of bad luck in employment or health to plunge a family that seems solidly middle-class into poverty. 
 But the wealthy have done very well indeed. Since 1973 the average income of the top 1 percent of Americans has doubled, and the income of the top 0.1 percent has tripled.
 Why is this happening? I'll have more to say on that another day, but for now let me just point out that middle-class America didn't emerge by accident. It was created by what has been called the Great Compression of incomes that took place during World War II, and sustained for a generation by social norms that favored equality, strong labor unions and progressive taxation. Since the 1970's, all of those sustaining forces have lost their power. 
 Since 1980 in particular, U.S. government policies have consistently favored the wealthy at the expense of working families -- and under the current administration, that favoritism has become extreme and relentless. From tax cuts that favor the rich to bankruptcy ''reform'' that punishes the unlucky, almost every domestic policy seems intended to accelerate our march back to the robber baron era.
 It's not a pretty picture -- which is why right-wing partisans try so hard to discredit anyone who tries to explain to the public what's going on.
 These partisans rely in part on obfuscation: shaping, slicing and selectively presenting data in an attempt to mislead. For example, it's a plain fact that the Bush tax cuts heavily favor the rich, especially those who derive most of their income from inherited wealth. Yet this year's Economic Report of the President, in a bravura demonstration of how to lie with statistics, claimed that the cuts ''increased the overall progressivity of the federal tax system.''
 The partisans also rely in part on scare tactics, insisting that any attempt to limit inequality would undermine economic incentives and reduce all of us to shared misery. That claim ignores the fact of U.S. economic success after World War II. It also ignores the lesson we should have learned from recent corporate scandals: sometimes the prospect of great wealth for those who succeed provides an incentive not for high performance, but for fraud. 
 Above all, the partisans engage in name-calling. To suggest that sustaining programs like Social Security, which protects working Americans from economic risk, should have priority over tax cuts for the rich is to practice ''class warfare.'' To show concern over the growing inequality is to engage in the ''politics of envy.''
 But the real reasons to worry about the explosion of inequality since the 1970's have nothing to do with envy. The fact is that working families aren't sharing in the economy's growth, and face growing economic insecurity. And there's good reason to believe that a society in which most people can reasonably be considered middle class is a better society -- and more likely to be a functioning democracy -- than one in which there are great extremes of wealth and poverty. 
 Reversing the rise in inequality and economic insecurity won't be easy: the middle-class society we have lost emerged only after the country was shaken by depression and war. But we can make a start by calling attention to the politicians who systematically make things worse in catering to their contributors. Never mind that straw man, the politics of envy. Let's try to do something about the politics of greed.

HEADLINE: Different Towns, Same Name, Together in New Jersey

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 9 

 BODY:
Newarks of the world, unite. And they did.
 It all started in 1987, when Newark was mired in crime and synonymous with urban blight, and its mayor, Sharpe James, heard a report that offended him.
A place called Newark, Calif., was considering changing its name, and Mayor James was stung by the possibility that the town of 44,000 on the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay was trying to distance itself from his gritty industrial city of 245,000 people. 
 The name-change proposal turned out to be part of a straw poll, conducted by the local newspaper, that had never been seriously considered by local officials. But it prompted phone calls between Mr. James and the mayor of the California town, David W. Smith, and before long Mr. James was on a plane to California to participate in the local ''Newark Days'' celebration. 
 From that came a search for other Newarks around the world: 27 in the United States alone that are or once were called Newark, as well as Newarks in Australia, Canada, South Africa. And, of course, there is the inspiration for all Newarks, Newark-on-Trent in East Nottinghamshire on the fringes of Sherwood Forest in England.
 And that led to a gathering of representatives of the various Newarks every two years, held -- where else? -- in places called Newark. The event, which has taken place eight times, allows people from other places called Newark to tour local sites, sample local entertainment and food, and generally plumb the significance, serendipity or synchronicity of their common name.
 This year, the celebration is in the Newark in New Jersey. And so, since Thursday, farmers, cattle ranchers, small-town merchants, Silicon Valley types and a British councilor or two have streamed into the city, ready to take on the town. 
 They will be able to visit a new exhibit at the Newark Public Library that examines the history of all the Newarks. And, most important to Mayor James, they will get to see how far his city has come since it first was host of the event in 1989, with the addition of its New Jersey Performing Arts Center, its minor league baseball stadium, its new town house communities and its riverfront development.
 ''We live with a stigma, and it is a tragedy,'' said Mayor James, recalling his city's reputation. ''And the only way you can break down misconceptions is to sit down and find common ground. My experience is that whenever we do that, we always win them over.''
 While an impulse toward self-promotion may have been at the heart of the gathering in the beginning, it has evolved into something more like a family reunion, said Mayor Smith, by telephone, as he waited to board a plane heading east. 
 ''It's now like a bunch of cousins, and I'm just looking forward to seeing my cousins,'' he said.
 ''I marvel at the diversity of the people from all the Newarks,'' Mayor Smith said. And yet they have a lot in common. ''We revel in our Newarkness -- whatever that is,'' he said with a laugh.
 Ami Neiberger-Miller, communications director for the nonprofit group Sister Cities International, said that the coming together of the Newarks was unique.
 ''We work with more than 2,400 community partnerships in 127 countries, and it is unusual to have a sister-city partnership built around names,'' she said. The only similar gathering she could recall was a one-time get-together of people from the 19 Beauforts in the world.
 The Newark Museum exhibit put together by Charles Cumming, who heads the library's New Jersey section, tells of many Newarks that have come and gone. An 1880's silver mining town in Nevada is now populated mostly by tumbleweed. Virtually all that remains of a lively town of the same era that grew up around a rail stop in Queensland, Australia, west of Brisbane, are a dusty road and signs warning of kangaroos crossing.
 Iowa is now Newark-less, but it has had four of them, mostly post offices spread out across the state's flat expanse and memorialized in a 1930 copy of ''Abandoned Towns, Villages and Post Offices of Iowa.''
 Today, in Michigan, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Illinois and Texas, the Newarks are farm or cattle towns, dominated by silos and church steeples, and a bit in awe of its bigger New Jersey relative.
 Margaret Glover, a council member and farmer from Newark, Mo., (population 100) remembered her first sighting of Mayor James, with his entourage.
 ''I turned to my husband and said that we didn't belong there,'' she said. ''But after a while, we didn't feel outclassed or like little frogs in a big pond.'' She said she brags to those back home that she is the only person in town who has been hugged by ''a big city mayor.''
 Newark, Ga., close to the Florida Panhandle, was once variously called Lambville and Beulah, but changed its name to Newark in the early 1900's when the Atlantic Coastline Railroad built a station there. That was in the hope that the association with a larger city might attract investors -- a not-uncommon move in that state, where other towns changed their names to Boston, Cleveland, Baltimore and Washington, Mr. Cummings said.
 The name Newark dates to 12th-century England, when Newark Castle was built near the confluence of the Trent and Devon rivers. Like New Jersey's Newark would become, it was a transportation hub, located on the old Roman Fosse Way and the Great North Road to Scotland. 
 The word itself, according Rupert Vinnicombe, the librarian of East Nottinghamshire, probably is a corruption of the phrase ''new works'' referring to fortifications that were the scene in 1645 of a two-year siege of King Charles I by forces loyal to the English Parliament and Oliver Cromwell.
 Newark, N.J., founded in 1665, and other colonial-era settlements like Newark, Md., Newark, Del., and three Newarks in upstate New York trace their name to the medieval Anglo-Saxon town in England, while many of the other Newarks claim only an indirect connection. 
 Newark, Ohio, was founded in the 1700's by a Burnet family from New Jersey. Residents of that town in turn carried the name westward as they settled in Indiana, Illinois, Kansas and Missouri. Such disparate places as Newark, W.Va., and Newark, Neb., came by their names through settlers from New Jersey. But Mr. Cummings said the origins of Newarks in Arkansas, Wisconsin, Michigan, South Dakota, Tennessee have long since been forgotten.
 In the United States, the pronunciation of the name differs, with some of the towns using a pronunciation of new-ARK, with emphasis on the last syllable, which many people, like Mrs. Glover of Missouri, speculate may be a biblical reference.
 Roger Ness, who stepped down last month after serving 20 years as mayor of Newark, Ill., missed the last gathering in the New Jersey Newark, but has made most of the others. He was planning to attend this year's gathering and looking forward to making his first visit to New York City, one of the features of the New Jersey event. 
 His town of 1,000 people raised $2,500 to commission a woodcarver to create a long, mahogany relief of his town's streetscape especially for the exhibit at the public library here. ''I think we're all really the same, but just on a different scale,'' Mr. Ness said. ''As for Newark, N.J., I think its image was tarnished some 20 years ago, but it's a lot better now.''
 Of course the racial, ethnic and economic balkanization of urban America seems strange to people like Mrs. Glover, who said that if you sought to separate yourself from others in her Missouri town ''you would be standing in a field alone.''
 ''But,'' she said, ''from the mayor of Newark on down the line, I have met people who are so human, so easy to get along with, just plain folks.''


CORRECTION-DATE: June 14, 2005

 CORRECTION:
Because of editing errors, an article on Friday about a gathering of representatives from the various Newarks around the world, held this year in New Jersey, referred incorrectly at one point in some copies to the mayor of Newark, N.J., and at another point misidentified the location of an exhibition. As noted elsewhere in the article, the mayor is Mr. James, not Mr. Sharpe; the exhibition is at the Newark Public Library, not the Newark Museum.

HEADLINE: Do China And U.S. Face Same Woes?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
TRADITIONAL large employers -- the very foundations of the economy -- are in trouble. They have debts they may not be able to pay, and are having great difficulty making any money. So they continue to borrow and look to the government for help.
 The government could just let them fail, saying that those who cannot make the grade in the new era of globalization should make way for those who can. But there are costs to such a strategy, over and above the fact that those companies have friends in high places. 
 Millions of people rely on the companies for more than jobs. They have promised to provide the most basic of needs, including health care and old-age pensions. If they are allowed to fail, the costs could be large.
 So it is today in China -- and in the United States. It is remarkable that two major economies have followed such very different paths to get to such similar problems.
 In China, the problem lies in the old state-owned industries. Communist China gave those companies all the social responsibilities that governments have in the West, and gave them the right to borrow what they needed at state-owned banks. Now post-Communist (in reality if not in name) China must deal with the residue. It hesitates to close those money-losing operations, and papers over the problems by forcing the banks to keep making loans. 
 In the United States, the problems are with pensions and health care costs, both of them traditionally paid by employers. General Motors, having announced plans to cut employment by 25,000 workers, is trying to get unions to let it cut benefits, but what it really wants is to shift some of what it calls ''legacy costs'' -- pension and health benefits for retired workers -- to the government.
 THE government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is deeply in the red, having insured far too many pension benefits for premiums that are far too low. The law has all kinds of strange provisions, as the Government Accountability Office detailed in a report to Congress this week, that lets companies with underfunded pensions hide that fact from workers until it is too late.
 The obvious solution is to let the guaranty corporation charge higher premiums and force companies to do a better job of funding their pension promises. The Bush administration has proposed such a bill, but many businesses object. It is likely that a watered-down bill will let companies put off dealing with the problem in hopes something will turn up. Sort of like China's method of dealing with some of its state-owned enterprises.
 Some of the companies most affected are also having trouble competing with Chinese companies, and are pushing for action to make China revalue its currency. China might be more willing if it did not fear the impact of such a move on its banks, and if it did not think it might need the money it is piling up to restructure the state-owned enterprises and provide for their workers.
 The problem of rising health care costs raises issues of American competitiveness as companies struggle to meet an obligation met by governments in other countries. 
 To make matters worse, Americans pay much more for their health care, in part because they pay high prescription drug costs that offset pharmaceutical companies' research costs. Most other countries impose price controls on drugs, thereby getting what amounts to a subsidy from the companies paying the health care bills in America.
 There are many differences between the problems faced by China and America, of course, but perhaps one stands out. China is accumulating money that could be used to meet those obligations, while the United States is going deeper into debt.

'THE PARIS LETTER' Opens Sunday. A repressed Wall Street investment banker (is there any other kind?) has a long, hard fall in Jon Robin Baitz's new drama, which spans four decades (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300.

'KICKER' Opens Monday. The entertainment journalist Robert Simonson's comic drama is about the disillusionment of an entertainment journalist (1:45). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)868-4444.

'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' Opens Tuesday. Procrastinators around the world despise Alan Ayckbourn, the English writer whose 67th play receives its New York premiere. A bittersweet comedy about six lonely Londoners trying to connect (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200.

'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' Opens Wednesday. Is it a comic tragedy or a tragic comedy? Renew that old debate at Tom Donaghy's new adaptation of Chekhov's last play (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200.

'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' Opens Thursday. Staceyann Chin, an original cast member of ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam,'' tells her story in this autobiographical solo show (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100.

'DRUMSTRUCK' Opens Thursday. The gimmick of this new spin on ''Stomp,'' which includes 11 percussionists from West and South Africa, is that every audience member plays his or her own drum during the show. David Warren directs (1:25). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.

'PEOPLE ARE LIVING THERE' Opens Thursday. Millie's lover runs off with a younger woman on her 50th birthday in this 1969 drama, a rare early Athol Fugard play not about apartheid.

'MY SWEETHEART'S THE MAN IN THE MOON' Previews start Wednesday. Opens June 19. Don't touch Harry K. Thaw's wife. Stanford White learned that the hard way, and this play with music documents how the architect was murdered and the subsequent media circus (2:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212)868-4444.

Broadway

'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Though its opening odd-couple-on-a-dance-floor skit shows promising charm, this evening of three sketches from the first lady of neurotic comedy, Elaine May, mostly feels terminally torpid in the way that overworked and familiar material often does, even from comic geniuses. Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and onstage alter ego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.(Ben Brantley)

'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' (Tony Award, Best Musical Revival 2005) Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising souffle of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)

'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)

* 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:45)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)

'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary, sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)

'THE ARGUMENT' Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of the post-9/11 play ''Omnium Gatherum,'' aims to personalize another hot-button issue here, but it's not likely that any serious thought, old or new, is going to be provoked by this whiny debate between two uninteresting types about the ever-sensitive topic of abortion. He wants the baby; she doesn't. It is hard to care (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)353-0303.(Isherwood)

'FLIGHT: THE RISE AND FALL OF CHARLES LINDBERGH' Garth Wingfield's droning bio-play transforms Charles Lindbergh's journey from tickertape hero to disgraced Nazi sympathizer into a sort of talking newspaper, minus op-ed pages, lively writing and the weather report. With Gregg Edelman playing the everyman pilot turned celebrity, and Brian D'Arcy James on hand to personify a series of slimy reporters (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)

* 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)

'MISS JULIE' Anders Cato directs a new adaptation by Craig Lucas. Marin Hinkle, as Miss Julie, and Reg Rogers, as her father's uppity valet Jean, spar and flirt, humiliate each other and humble themselves as expected, in the traditional kitchen, with the designated disastrous results. Chances are you won't believe a word of it (1:35). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)

* 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'RAIN' Wild, witty, wet and altogether winning. Those words sum up Rain, the new Cirque Eloize show that is ending the season at the New Victory Theater with a figurative and literal splash. This Quebec-based troupe, which opened the New Victory in December 1995, combines high circus arts and ingratiating self-mockery with nostalgic costumes, eclectic music and song, evocative lighting and creative choreography in two hours of fun calculated to please children and adults alike (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)

'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs. Goldsmith's 1773 comedy mocks the snobbery of the London upper class, while piling on the slapstick, mistaken identities and farce (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Genzlinger)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100. ( Van Gelder)

'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Slight but pithy, this humorous revue of 18 songs with lyrics by Mark Campbell and music by 18 different composers takes a sardonic and explicit look at gay life in New York: ''Sex with an actor. What was I thinking?'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)

'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Presnyakovbrothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)

* 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)

'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters and affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.(Anita Gates)

Off Off Broadway

'DISCONNECT' Plant four witty, intellectually stimulating people around a dinner table and you might have an engaging play. Plant four uninsightful, insipid people around a dinner table and you have ''Disconnect,'' a new work by Rob Ackerman that lets some self-absorbed 30-somethings whine for two hours about lost friends and parental beatings of long ago (1:45). The Working Theater, at the East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.(Genzlinger)

'FLAT' This happily crass send-up of a BBC family drama is perfectly pitched for fans nostalgic for the self-parodying vulgarity of the sit-com ''Married With Children.'' Twelve episodes, quick scenes, stock characters and an opening montage sequence with a jingle that will lodge itself in your cranium, like it or not (1:00). Part of the Moral Values Festival. Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212)868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)

'MARATHON 2005, SERIES B' The second installment in this annual festival of short plays, which includes lively sketches by David Mamet and David Lindsay-Abaire, allows theatergoers the pleasure of hearing famous voices practicing scales, as it were, and of discovering that no matter what key they're singing in, they still sound like themselves (1:45). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101. (Brantley)

'RICHARD AND ANNE' That idiot Shakespeare had it all wrong, according to ''Richard and Anne,'' an unknown script by Maxwell Anderson that is being energetically brought to light by the young actors of Mirror Repertory's training program. Tired of being maligned in productions of ''Richard III,'' the real Richard, no hunched back evident, comes back from the grave to set things straight (2:15). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street, Manhattan, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)

'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)

'WORK: A MADCAP TRAGI-PARODY OF CORPORATE AMERICA' Unless you've been living in a cave, Charlotte Meehan's play ''Work: A Madcap Tragi-Parody of Corporate America,'' should sound familiar, starting with its title. But when real life tops fiction, what's left to say? Not much, in this case. And that's the problem (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)226-2407.(Andrea Stevens)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)

'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)

'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Gates)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)

Last Chance

'BFE' Julia Cho's insightful drama about the agonies and comforts of isolation centers on a 14-year-old Asian-American girl (Olivia Oguma) who feels she isn't beautiful. The main characters force themselves to reach out to others, but all fail in some essential way (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday.(Gates)

'CAPTAIN LOUIE' The York Theater is serving a charming, child-size slice of Broadway with Captain Louie, a one-hour musical based on the 1978 picture book ''The Trip'' by Ezra Jack Keats. A talented young cast performs music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, an Oscar and Grammy winner whose credits include ''Pocahontas,'' ''The Prince of Egypt'' and the current Broadway hit ''Wicked'' (1:00). The York Theater Company at the Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday.(Miriam Horn)

'DAY IN THE LIFE OF ORDINARY PEOPLE' Talent and passion are overcome by banality in the first musical by the Broadway actor Josh Walden, who wrote the music, book and lyrics, choreographed the show, and directed. While the music and dance show occasional flair, the same cannot be said of the lyrics or book, a cliched exhuming of the secrets behind 1950's facades (1:00). Flamboyan Theater, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4080, closing tomorrow. (Horn)

* 'HOWIE THE ROOKIE' Mark O'Rowe's blood-and-guts-filled comic yarn, which features two baroque monologues climaxing in sudden, irresistible bursts of mayhem, tells a gangland story set in working-class Dublin. Despite being overproduced, the play packs a wallop (1:50). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. ( Zinoman)

'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

'MARATHON 2005, SERIES A' A long, too often dreary evening of plays by a pair of Tony winners, John Guare and Warren Leight, and a pair of actress-playwrights, Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros and Leslie Lyles. Ms. Gersten-Vassilaros's contribution, ''The Airport Play,'' is the briefest and, perhaps not coincidentally, the best of the bunch (2:15). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101, closing tomorrow.(Isherwood)

'700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

'TABLOID CALIGULA' Three excellent performances set off Darren Murphy's dark comedy, about a London thug hooked on Alexander the Great, in which the author has a lot of fun with language and the art of storytelling (1:30). Part of the Brits Off Broadway festival at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. ( Stevens)

'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (Not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali) A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (A.O. Scott)

'BROTHERS' (R, 113 minutes, in Danish) This gripping psychological drama is Susanne Bier's second film to examine events worthy of Greek tragedy through a contemporary therapeutic lens; wartime trauma and sibling rivalry collide. (Stephen Holden)

* 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In the contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug-of-war between two cliques, one left-wing and bohemian, the other right-wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured, and entertaining.(Holden)

'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)

* 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)

* 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Manohla Dargis)

* 'THE HOLY GIRL' (Not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)

'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)

* 'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) A film about a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)

'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese) This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)

'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)

'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)

* 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French) A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)

'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott)

'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)

* 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)

'THE NINTH DAY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in German) A somber, thought-provoking moral thriller, in which a Roman Catholic priest from Luxembourg, temporarily released from Dachau, finds his conscience tested when the Nazis try to co-opt him. Interesting ideas, insufficiently dramatized. (Scott)

'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)

'PALINDROMES' (Not rated, 100 minutes) The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)

'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes) This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)

* 'ROCK SCHOOL' (R, 93 minutes) Don Argott's alternately hilarious and alarming documentary centers on the titular founder of the Paul Green School of Rock Music and a handful of tender tots who yearn for a future filled with squealing electric guitars, battered drum kits and fully cranked amps. (Dargis)

'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes) It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)

'SAVING FACE' (R, 91 minutes) The amiable romantic comedy examines the lives of three generations of Chinese-Americans living in New York exudes a palpable love for its characters but ends up betraying its hard-headedness with instant, feel-good solutions to their problems. (Holden)

'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes) Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame that the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)

'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Dana Stevens)

* 'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)

'WALK ON WATER' (Not rated, 104 minutes) The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Stevens)

* 'THE WHITE DIAMOND' (No rating, 90 minutes) Werner Herzog, in the jungles of Guyana, observes a small airship and its crew. This documentary is a record of his impressions and discoveries, and an essay on the complexities of nature in its wild and human varieties. It is an unassuming film, but nonetheless full of scenes and images that can only be described as sublime. (Scott)

'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (Not rated, 45 minutes) A choppy tour of South African flora and fauna. Kids will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful by this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity. (Ned Martel)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: mytimes.com/music.

ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI, THE LILYS (Sunday and Monday) With their hip choral flourishes, kicky grooves and pep-rally shouts, the quirky collective Architecture in Helsinki makes happy baroque pop. Sunday's bill includes the Lilys, whose mercurial Kurt Heasley exuded charisma as both an early-90's shoegazer and later, an Anglophile retro-rocker. Sunday at 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $8 in advance, $10 at the door. Monday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $10. (Laura Sinagra)

THE BAD PLUS (Thursday) This piano-driven power trio's adventurous spirit straddles the boundaries of jazz and rock, and their exuberant forays are way more fun than their cover of Nirvana's ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' would suggest. The players, native Midwesterners all, throw themselves into live shows with prairie-fire earnestness. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $15, $20 at the door.(Sinagra)

ASHA BHOSLE (Tomorrow) In countless Bollywood musicals over the last 50 years, the sweet, high voice of the heroine is dubbed by Asha Bhosle, one of India's most celebrated playback singers. In this ''unplugged show,'' she'll be singing a small fraction of her hits with acoustic instruments, sharing the arena stage with Kumar Sanu and Sudesh Bhosle, who is not related to her. 8 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631)888-9000, $32 to $147. (Jon Pareles)

BLOC PARTY (Tuesday and Wednesday) Many bands steal sounds from the danceable punk of the early 80's, but few do it with the enthusiasm of this British group. It's become a sensation with local fans and for good reason. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600. $20 (sold out) (Sinagra)

CAMPBELL BROTHERS (Monday) The Campbell Brothers are part of the sacred steel tradition of the House of God Dominion church. It turns the steel guitar into a swooping, wailing lead instrument in gospel songs. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $15, $17 at the door. (Pareles)

SLAID CLEAVES (Tomorrow) This singer-songwriter writes thoughtful tunes about characters with pawn-shop wedding rings and cars that burn oil, trying to pull out of downward spirals. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)239-6200; $20. (Pareles)

KIMYA DAWSON (Tuesday) Ms. Dawson's band the Moldy Peaches' adorable dirty-kid rambles created an indie splash in 2001, but this former youth counselor endures on her own as a comedian and poet of geek love and underdog resilience. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103; $8. (Sinagra)

THE DEARS (Tomorrow) This Montreal indie rock band plays lush, urgent guitar songs about panicked slacker dismay over encroaching technology and the loss of an individuality. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15 (sold out).(Sinagra)

GENO DELAFOSE & FRENCH ROCKIN' BOOGIE (Tonight) Geno Delafose, the son of the zydeco accordionist John Delafose, holds on to the traditions of an older generation, pumping waltzes and two-steps on his button accordion. Like Clifton Chenier, he also dips deeply into the blues and rhythm-and-blues but keeps the music's old bayou flavor. 8 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155; $22. (Pareles)

THE GO BETWEENS (Tonight and Tomorrow) Blessed with two stellar songwriters -- the brooding Robert Forster and sublime Grant McLennan -- this Australian band recorded some of the best neo-romantic art pop of the 1980's. Since the duo's 2002 reunion, the disparity in their temperaments has resulted in a more discernable oscillation between light and dark sentiments in the music. Tonight at 10:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $16, $18 at the door (sold out). Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236; $15, $17 at the door.(Sinagra)

ARLO GUTHRIE (Wednesday) Forty years after releasing ''Alice's Restaurant,'' the folk music scion Arlo Guthrie will perform his populist story-album in its entirety at the Hudson River Festival. You assume that he'll also sling some trademark banter between tunes. 7 p.m., Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City, Lower Manhattan, (212)528-2733, free. (Sinagra)

IRON AND WINE (Thursday) The modern rustic Sam Beame takes a whispery, almost Chet Baker-like approach to folk vocals. Sung atop delicately plucked guitar, his lyrics speak to the sensitive male's concerns about intimacy and mortality. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village (212)353-1600; $18, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)

RICKIE LEE JONES (Wednesday) Ms. Jones's Southwestern hippie roots give her urban-bohemian jazz leanings a willful whimsy. This outdoor set will cull from both the swooping reveries and ersatz street-corner jive of her 1970's releases as well as the best of her later albums. 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; $3 suggested donation. (Sinagra)

JUDAS PRIEST, QUEENSRYCHE (Tonight) Rob Halford has brought his menacing baritone and dog-whistle howl back to the seminal late-70's British heavy-metal band that famously tried to carry on without him. Attempts at leather-clad relevance include an ode to the Loch Ness monster, but live they'll please the crowd with growler favorites. 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Garden State Parkway, (732)335-0400, $20 to $49.50. (Sinagra)

CHAKA KHAN (Saturday) In the 2002 Funk Brothers documentary ''Standing in the Shadows of Motown,'' R&B luminaries reverentially jammed with the still-rocking house band, but Ms. Khan pushed past safe territory with her explosive rendition of ''What's Goin' On.'' Recently, she's been roughing up jazz standards and making funk with Prince. 7 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212)307-7171; $37 to $57.(Sinagra)

LAURIE LEWIS, TOM ROZUM (Tomorrow) The master fiddler and singer Laurie Lewis shares the bill with her fellow Grant Street band member Rozum. The two play bluegrass in the style of Bill Monroe. 7:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155; $20, $23 at the door. (Sinagra)

BRIAN MCKNIGHT, NEW EDITION, GERALD LEVERT (Tonight) The R&B crooner Brian McKnight returns with new songs about the romantic quandaries of a rich, newly divorced man. The reunion of 80's boy band New Edition, without Bobby Brown, is reportedly every bit the guilty pleasure it should be, featuring not only mega hits like ''Mr. Telephone Man,'' but also the best of members' spin off groups (Bell Biv DeVoe's ''Poison'') and solo projects (Ralph Tresvant's ''Sensitivity,'' Johnny Gill's ''My My My''). Their impassioned contemporary Gerald LeVert opens. 7 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741, $49.50 to $95.50. (Sinagra)

AIMEE MANN (Tonight) Ms. Mann's great new concept album about two addict lovers in the 70's who meet at the Virginia fairgrounds and light out for the territory features the astute, sad lyrics and low-key but enduring melodic hooks for which this singer-songwriter is known. 6:45 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800; $35. (Sinagra)

* OLIVER MTUKUDZI (Tonight) Like too many African stars, this Zimbabwean singer and nimble guitarist is often presented as a purveyor of ''words of wisdom,'' to quote the liner notes to his new album, ''Nhava'' (Heads Up). Luckily, his music isn't nearly so heavy-handed: expect a gorgeous night of gentle but restless polyrhythmic grooves. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824; $30 to $35.(Kelefa Sanneh)

THE NATIONAL (Wednesday and Thursday) These Ohio natives play a kind of countryfied indie rock that underplays its hand enough to seem modest. But even if the frontman Matt Berninger's self-deprecating relationship woes recall those of the Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo, his renderings have yet to make his gripes as interesting. 10:30 and 11:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $12.(Sinagra)

MESHELL NDEGEOCELLO (Wednesday and Thursday through June 18) Uncompromising in her aesthetic, the neo-soul singer and bassist Ndegeocello continues to present various views of the female and black experience, often proposing a poly-gendered idyll of throwback grooves and pungent ganja smoke. 9 p.m. and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; $40 (Sinagra)

OTEP (Tonight) Reminiscent of ''The Exorcist,'' the growl of this band's female singer and namesake Otep is a truly soul-shuddering sound. It's too bad the band's music, which takes the arty rap-rock route instead of straight death metal, doesn't have the same convincing pummel. 6 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $17. (Sinagra)

GRAHAM PARKER (Tomorrow) Emerging from England just before the arrival of punk-rock, Graham Parker used the sturdy structures of soul and 1960's rock, spitting out angry, articulate songs that chafed against dishonesties large and small. These days, he's less furious and more cranky, but he's still holding the world around him to high standards. 7 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $20, $22 at the door. (Pareles)

ANN PEEBLES (Thursday) This gutsy Memphis soul diva's profile rose among the MTV crowd when her eerie, sultry 1973 hit ''I Can't Stand the Rain'' was sampled in 1997 by Missy Elliot. Ms. Peebles performs outdoors as part of the BAM R&B Festival. Noon, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, Downtown Brooklyn, free. (Sinagra)

JOHN PRINE (Wednesday) An American original, Prine is among Cole Porter with pop's greatest rhymers and with Bob Dylan among its most articulate sidelong storytellers. The administration of George Bush II has given this committed Lefty newfound fire. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824, $37 to $47. (Sinagra)

THE RAVEONETTES (Tomorrow) Clearing away the garage noise of their debut album, this Danish duo now strives for pure 60's pop. Its new album incorporates rock history from girl groups to surf rock to punk, as well as historic rock, with cameos by Ronnie Spector, Suicide's Martin Rev and the Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker. 6 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $20. (Sinagra)

REBIRTH BRASS BAND (Tonight) The Rebirth Brass Band, a New Orleans institution since the 1980's, updates the traditional strutting rhythms and continuous improvisation of New Orleans parades with an infusion of funk. It doesn't need microphones, amplifiers or anything but breath and rhythm to make a crowd jump. 10:30 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144; $17, $20 at the door. (Pareles)

SLOAN (Monday and Tuesday) This Canadian power pop trio has soldiered along dutifully for 15 years, and as its recent singles compilations suggest, the group's knack with heroic hooks and wry lyrics is undeniable, despite lack of commercial success. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $20. (Sinagra)

SOUNDS OF DETROIT: THE SPINNERS, THE TEMPTATIONS, MARTHA REEVES AND THE VANDELLAS (Tonight) Their names may have outlasted their original lineups, but classics like ''My Girl,'' ''Rubbberband Man'' and ''Heatwave'' are classics in any iteration. 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-7171; $25 to $90. (Sinagra)

SANTANA, LOS LONELY BOYS (Tuesday) Carlos Santana has been a ''rock-en-espagnol'' progenitor and fusion guitar heavyweight for decades , but one of the most remarkable incarnations has been his recent one as lite-rock collaborator and impresario. Los Lonely Boys couldn't have existed without him. 7 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Garden State Parkway, Exit 116, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400; $20 to $75. (Sinagra)

THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS, RALPH'S WORLD (Tomorrow) The whip-smart wits of the novelty pop band They Might Be Giants have lately taken a run at recording children's albums. They play during the day here for an all-ages crowd. Another musician making indie rock for the kids of indie-rock fans is Ralph's World. 6 p.m., South Street Seaport, South and Fulton Streets, Lower Manhattan, free. (Sinagra)

* BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs.

* EARTHA KITT (Tuesdays through Saturdays) The godmother of golddiggers, still glamorous as ever at 78, remains in full command of a voice that can tear into a song with a ravenous ferocity, and the personality to go with it. Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan; (212)744-1600, through July 2. At 8:45, with an additional show on Saturdays at 10:45 p.m. Cover: $85 Tuesdays through Thursdays, $95 Fridays and Saturdays; no minimum. (Holden)

Jazz

Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)

GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)

* JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterfully composed landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)

MET: 'MAX ERNST,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.)(Holland Cotter)

MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)

* MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)

STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: CHRIS OFILI: 'AFRO-MUSES,' through July 3. More than 100 delirious watercolors by this familiar British artist, warm-up exercises for his daily routine. They depict imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, in African garb, and in deep, swimmy colors -- portraits as modest and charming as the work that made Mr. Ofili famous is outsize and occasionally over the top. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Kimmelman)

* STUDIO MUSEUM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art or music that this country has produced. (See above.) (Smith)

WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with, scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approach and sensibility. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)

WHITNEY AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, the artist's ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)

Galleries: Uptown

HUBERTUS GOJOWCZYK: 'THE BOOK AS OBJECT' If Joseph Cornell had been a librarian, he might have produced sculptures like the fantastically altered books that this Polish artist creates. Glass eyes stare out from the pages of one old tome; the corner of another morphs into a waxy brain. Achim Moeller, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through June 24. (Johnson)

Galleries: 57th Street

DIANA MICHENER: 'DOGS, FIRES, ME' The photographs here, largely achieved by devices like blurring, montage, double exposure and extreme distortion, are supposedly evocative of poetic concepts, but they are for the most part stagey and pretentious, like scenes from a bad Surrealist movie. Swans, fires, puppets and Ms. Michener's nude body accompanied by a dog are some of the images, but seen through her lens they are quite yawn-provoking. Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street (212)759-8964, through June 22. (Glueck)

EMILY NELLIGAN AND MARVIN BILECK: 'CRANBERRY ISLAND, DRAWINGS AND PRINTS' Using only charcoal and eraser on ordinary letter paper, Emily Nelligan has for more than 50 years focused on a tiny part of Maine called Great Cranberry Island, one of several specks off the coast near Mount Desert. Restricting her palette to reticent blacks, whites and grays, she conveys the spirit, changes and constancies of a pure, unsullied wilderness. Marvin Bileck, her husband, has concentrated on the island's factual here-and-nowness, rendering piled-up rocks, tangles of trees, deep woods and their tweakings by nature in meticulous drawings and etchings. She's a wizard at mood, he's a master of specifics. Alexandre Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212)755-2828, through June 17. (Glueck)

THOMAS SCHUTTE: 'ONE MAN HOUSES' Models of small, modernistic houses meant to be built full-size by collectors, who buy them and furniture made from hollow-core doors, reflect on design and consumerism but with less formal interest and conceptual wit than do the works of Andrea Zittel or Jorge Pardo. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212)977-7160, through July 2. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

BENJAMIN BUTLER: 'FOREST'S EDGE' Abstracted landscapes made with a brusquely sensuous touch in finely tuned colors toy with conventions of early Modernism to visually exciting effect. Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212) 279-9219, through June 18. (Johnson)

SOPHIE CALLE: 'EXQUISITE PAIN' Ms. Calle's complicated, two-part installation telling the story of the painful end of a love affair in words and pictures is absorbing but her programmatic intellectualism muffles the emotional dimension. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212)255-1105, through June 25. (Johnson)

CHAN CHAO: 'ECHO' Tension between the clinical and the voyeuristic animates high-definition portraits of attractive nude woman by a photographer known for portraits of young Burmese rebel soldiers. Yancy Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, through July 2. (Johnson)

* GREGORY CREWDSON: BENEATH THE ROSES Narrative and theatrical craft have overtaken art and visual form in these dreary mural-size color photographs, which are so freighted with props, contrivances and omens, and so monotonously joyless that their sense of foreboding turns into parody. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street (212)206-6100 through June 18. (Smith)

JASPER JOHNS: CATENARY Paintings and drawings less mandarin in their personal iconography only by comparison with the clotted art of the 1980's and 90's. There is a series of stupendously beautiful prints. The redeeming through line is touch, whose eloquence nearly salvages the works from their own oppressive claustrophobia. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)243-0200, through June 25. (Kimmelman)

RINKO KAWAUCHI : AILA AND THE EYES, THE EARS In her second New York show this young Japanese photographer is showing large pale close-ups of natural phenomenon -- fish eggs, dead chickens, a hatching bird -- reminding us with oddly visionary effects that life's big themes are in the details. Cohan and Leslie, 138 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 206-8711, through June 18. (Smith)

* NEO RAUCH In his familiar and fashionable vein, mixing Pop, Surrealism, Socialist Realism and a stew of 19th-century sources, these latest paintings are more tours de force of labor and oddball design, chilly and sophisticated. The work is operating at a level where the air is thin and cold. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, (212)727-2070, through June 18. (Kimmelman)

'SCULPTURE' This judicious small selection of three-dimensional works includes a rustic dream house by Vito Acconci; videos showing through an antique Asian iron gate by Nam June Paik; big, smooth white birds by Hiraki Sawa; and an amazing, life-size stainless steel tree by Roxy Paine. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through June 25. (Johnson)

JEFF SONHOUSE: 'THE PANOPTIC CON' As sharp visually as they are politically, Mr. Sonhouse's compact, finely painted Pop-Surrealist portraits depict masked African American men in colorful tuxedos with hair made of real matches, steel wool and other materials. In some, subjects are shown twice, mug shot style: face-forward and in profile. These slyly incendiary works probe the mystique of the mythic scary-sexy black dude. Kustera Tilton, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, through June 18. (Johnson)

STURTEVANT: 'PUSH AND SHOVE' The artist known for copying works by Warhol, Johns and other contemporary artists presents a darkly elegant installation of fake Duchamps, including a ceiling of 1,200 scrotumlike coal bags, a urinal, two bottle racks and a snow shovel. Perry Rubenstein, 527 West 23rd Street and 526 West 24th Street, (212)627-8000, through June 18. (Johnson)

HIROSHI SUGIMOTO Photographs of antique mathematical and mechanical models, evoking Brancusi, Arp and Man Ray, turning their subjects into big-screen cinematic presences, curvaceous and potent. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, (212)627-1018, through June 25. (Kimmelman)

HIROSHI SUGITO AND ROSILINE LUDUVICO The Japan-based Mr. Sugito and the Germany-based Ms. Luduvico bring compatible sensibilities to this dual show. Painted with wispy delicacy, her small pictures of people in the woods conjure sweet, sad moods. His most imposing painting, a large luminous field of patchy green punctuated by little butterflies, projects a vigorously sensuousness fantasy of pastoral bliss. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, (212)243-3335, through June 18. (Johnson)

TIP TOLAND: 'CYCLE OF LIFE' Comically humane and technically impressive painted clay sculptures by this West Coast ceramicist include a life-size, nude, octogenarian lady in a sexy, standing pose and twin, gray-haired women realized with remarkable realism from the waist up performing a whistling duet. Nancy Margolis, 523 West 25th Street, (212)242-3013, through June 30. (Johnson)

KARIN WEINER: 'FRONTIERA' A camp site of cardboard logs, stuffed fabric stones and a rag rug around a television set; suspended stuffed clouds like ornate patchwork mattresses; a mound of stuffed antlers; and collages of countless flowers comprise this industriously zany artist's second solo. ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212)229-1088, through July 29. (Johnson)

JEAN CLAUDE WOUTERS: 'PORTRAITS & NUDES -- SPIRIT' Through a process of re-photographing his prints, this French artist creates large, black-and-white photographs that are so pale it may take a second to see the ghostly image of a nude torso or, more hauntingly, the larger than life face that seems to gaze at us from an ethereal realm. Meyerowitz, 120 Eleventh Avenue, at 20th Street, (212)414-2770, through June 18. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

* MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)

* 'ALBERTO CASADO: TODO CLANDESTINO, TODO POPULAR,' This young artist uses a technique involving painting on glass and aluminum foil to create shimmering, faux-kitsch works about politics, religion and ordinary life in Cuba. Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-0473, through June 25.(Johnson)

CORNELIA FOSS Graceful, mature, modest paintings full of light and a subtle geometry: views of the beaches and salt marshes on Long Island and of Central Park. DFN Gallery,176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, through June 18. (Kimmelman)

MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, who have meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith)

'GLASS, SERIOUSLY' This fine selection of artworks in glass, picked by the independent curator Lilly Wei, includes teardrops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained-glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson)

* JULIO GONZALEZ This small but illuminating, 43-piece exhibition surveys the career of a sculptor who, late in life, taught Picasso how to work with metal and then went on in the 1930's to create playful, Cubist-style, welded iron assemblages that transformed modern sculpture. Instituto Cervantes, 211 East 49th Street, Turtle Bay, (212)308-7720, through June 18. (Johnson)

JACQUELINE HUMPHRIES Gestural abstractions made with fluorescent paint, lighted by black lights, campy and eloquent. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212)995-1785, through June 18. (Kimmelman)

MAKE IT NOW: NEW SCULPTURE IN NEW YORK This survey of work by nearly 30 young and youngish artists is overly cautious but nonetheless gives an interesting account of the diffuse field of sculpture (which includes photography, video, ceramics and painting in this case); tracks the current cross-fertilization between assemblage and appropriation art and offers enough glimmers of new talent to be worth a visit. Sculpture Center, 41-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718)361-1750, through July 31. (Smith)

MALCOM MORLEY: THE ART OF PAINTING After 30 years, Malcolm Morley returns to the Photo Realist painting style he helped found in the mid 1960's, further exploring the tensions between reality, the art of painting and the act of looking and demonstrating that fidelity, taken far enough, turns into something else. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)999-7337, through June 25. (Smith)

Last Chance

ANTHONY CARO Four tabletop pieces from the 1970's and 80's, masterly exercises in balletic form and balance in rusting steel, by this reigning British standard-bearer of modernist abstract sculpture. They are elegant and a serious pleasure. Mitchell-Inness & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, closing tomorrow.(Kimmelman)

TOM PHILLIPS The New York debut of a polymath British artist, well into his 60's, whose small, mosaiclike collages reconfigure the narrative, and the pages, of a Victorian novel while doing something new with cut-up comic books. Flowers, 1000 Madison, near 78th Street, (212)212 430-1700, closing tomorrow. (Smith)

* AURIE RAMIREZ A remarkable self-taught artist creates a candy-colored but complex universe (in watercolor) of androgynous, dark-haired beauties who usually wear frock coats and pinstriped pants. Her first show anywhere dovetails nicely with smaller debuts of the bristling cannibalizations of texts, images and found materials by Peter Gallo and the collage drawings of an artist known only as Carter. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)924-4212, closing tomorrow. (Smith)

* RICHARD WATHEN A young British artist plugs some 21st-century energy into 18th-century portraiture, painting with a matte, flat delicacy that gives familiar poses a new-born freshness, and not only when clothing is subtracted. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, closing on Thursday. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Two Lives, One Death

BYLINE: By LEE JENKINS

 BODY:
The athletic director at Samuel J. Tilden High School keeps the newspaper clippings of Willie Randolph on one side of his office and the funeral program of Tafare Berryman on the other.
 Theirs are two faces of a central Brooklyn high school whose students and teachers had planned to spend the summer cheering for Randolph, a former student who now manages the Mets. Instead, the school is mourning the 22-year-old Berryman, a lesser-known alumnus who made no less an impact.
 Berryman had been Tilden's prom king and basketball star, a 6-foot-6 honor student who graduated when he was 17 and won college scholarship offers as much for his math grades as for his moves in the post. He chose the C.W. Post campus of Long Island University, where he was a basketball player and a librarian with a dean's list grade-point average. 
 On the morning of April 3, one month before Berryman was to graduate from C.W. Post with a degree in business administration and two days after he had interviewed for a job on Wall Street, he was killed in a drive-by shooting outside a nightclub on Long Island. The next afternoon, Randolph managed his first game in the major leagues.
 In just a few hours, Tilden, a central Brooklyn high school, received a brutal reminder of the vastly different directions promise can go. Two of Tilden's favorite sons, Berryman and Randolph, are talked about in nearly identical terms on the school's campus, but Berryman graduated 30 years after Randolph and became a casualty of his time. 
 ''Willie does everything right, and he gets out,'' said Rock Eisenberg, the Tilden athletic director. ''Tafare does everything right, and he perishes. Maybe if it were 30 years ago, it would have just been a fight.''
 Last week, the Mets invited Berryman's family to attend an upcoming game, though Randolph had not heard of him. Berryman's mother accepted the invitation though she did not know that Randolph had attended her son's high school. It was further proof of the distance between them.
 Randolph and Berryman's mother are expected to meet for the first time tonight at Shea Stadium.
 At Tilden High, the school's name sign is missing a letter, replaced by a bullet hole. Teachers often talk about the chaos outside, but within Tilden's walls, the classrooms are clean and the hallways are quiet. On a recent afternoon, students were staying late for extra tutoring, cheering for one another at an awards banquet or gathering beneath a sign that reads: ''In life there are no makeup exams. Choose carefully.''
 One student skipped out the door carrying a Mets backpack. Another ran out to the baseball field wearing a Mets jersey. Omar Thompson, a Tilden sophomore and the brother of Tafare Berryman, walked down East 58th Street to his house a half-block from school. ''Being this close,'' Thompson said, ''I always have to be on time.''
 Dawn Thompson, Berryman's mother, sat on the front porch wearing a C.W. Post T-shirt. In the center of the living room, she had stacked Berryman's trophies side by side. Sofas were lined with photographs and jerseys. Coffee tables were covered with cards, diplomas and papers for which he received an A. Out back was the Ford Explorer that was to be Berryman's graduation gift. ''I guess we're going to have to sell it,'' Thompson said.
 She is torn between grief and confusion, devastated that her son is gone and baffled as to the circumstances surrounding his death. She said that he was afraid of nightclubs, that he always spent weekend nights with his parents, that his only traffic ticket came when his car slid halfway through a crosswalk during a snowfall.
 ''He couldn't fight, he didn't party, he was really kind of a coward,'' Dawn Thompson said. ''He was scared of everything on the streets. That's why I can't understand how he got caught up in something like this.''
 She slipped on the jacket that he bought for his job interviews. She reads the card he got her for Valentine's Day: ''You keep me from doing anything stupid,'' it says. She shows off the letter he wrote to his colleagues at Rogers Memorial Library: ''I can say I have a common goal with the staff at the library, which is to serve the educational, cultural and intellectual needs of the community near and far.''
 On April 1, a Friday night, Berryman told his mother and his stepfather that he had go to the C.W. Post campus to work on his resume. The next night, Berryman went to C.W. Post's annual fashion show and then to a party with friends at the La Mansion nightclub in Island Park. 
 According to Detective Lt. Kevin Smith, the public information officer for the Nassau County Police Department, the group from C.W. Post tried to leave the club because some of the other patrons had made them uncomfortable. When they were followed to the parking lot across the street, a fight broke out, and C.W. Post point guard Aaron Daly-Firth was stabbed.
 Daly-Firth tried to drive Berryman from the scene, but because of the blood from his wound, they decided to stop and switch places. As Berryman shifted to the driver's side, a car pulled up, and two shots rang out.
 ''All of our accounts say that Berryman was a good kid who had no record and lost his life over something stupid,'' Smith said. ''Sometimes you walk into a bar and there are people who don't like how you look and they pick on you. Our impression is that Berryman walked into the wrong place and wanted to get out.''
 Five C.W. Post basketball players and one assistant coach carried the coffin at Pinelawn Memorial Park. 
 A C.W. Post professor donated $2,800 for the funeral. A C.W. Post student who was the prom queen at Tilden the year Berryman was king raised $5,000. Some athletes forfeited their meal money on road trips to contribute.
 ''He wasn't one of our stars, but he was one of those people we need in society,'' C.W. Post Coach Tom Galeazzi said. ''He would have done an awful lot of good for everyone.''
 Berryman had been at C.W. Post for only one year, having transferred from Niagara when he wanted more playing time and then from Southampton when he learned that it would be closing. Two weeks before he died, he went back to Tilden to see his former teachers. Mike Carvalhal, an economics teacher and a dean, remembered thinking, ''If all the kids were like him, wouldn't it be wonderful?''
 Debra Sylvester, the assistant principal at Tilden, estimates that she has seen more than 20,000 students walk through the halls. She ranks Berryman among her five favorites. ''I still expect that face to come around the corner and drop on my shoulder and start talking about some trouble he's having with some girl,'' Sylvester said.
 Knowing that Dawn Thompson did not have life insurance for her son, Sylvester helped print funeral programs and arrange limousines. Last week, Thompson proudly displayed the only bill she still owes from the funeral: $1,301 for the headstone. 
 The emotional burden has been much more difficult to bear. When Thompson accepted her son's diploma at the C.W. Post commencement ceremony -- which happened to fall on Mother's Day -- she fainted on the stage. Her husband, Eddie Thompson, said that he took her to an emergency room last month because of severe headaches and high blood pressure. 
 Meanwhile, the Thompsons are trying to find counseling for their two younger sons.
 Thompson is tired of checking on the status of the investigation into the shooting. She says that she continues to receive the same response from detectives: ''Ma'am, we don't have any good news.'' Smith said the investigation was proceeding but that no arrest had been made.
 Berryman told his mother shortly before his death that despite his Wall Street ambitions, he wanted someday to become a Nassau County police officer. Desperate to see the crime solved, Thompson put up a $2,000 reward for information, but friends scoffed because the sum was not larger. 
 She even approached State Assemblyman Nick Perry, the representative for her district, and he agreed to accompany her to a June 17 meeting with the Nassau County executive, Tom Suozzi.
 ''This young man was murdered in a situation where there were a lot of people present, and for no one to have come forward is unbelievable,'' Perry said.
 No matter what comes of the meeting, Perry's staff is hoping to arrange a memorial basketball tournament at Tilden this summer. Eisenberg and other athletic department employees are making a banner for the gym. And half a block away, Dawn Thompson sits on her porch, still wishing her son will come home for the weekend and go with her to the Mets game.

HEADLINE: Vote United City; Budget Splits It Again

BYLINE: By LISA A. BACON

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va., June 7 

 BODY:
Less than six months after his swearing-in as the first popularly elected mayor here in more than 50 years, former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder is finding that his honeymoon with the state capital is fading fast. 
 Mr. Wilder became a symbol of a unity in a city long known for its racial divide when he was elected in November by a landslide, with support from blacks and whites, Republicans and Democrats, professionals and blue-collar workers. 
 Now a bitter budget debate with the City Council is splitting the city again, not along racial lines, but between Mr. Wilder and some of the people who helped elect him. Unless one side gives in, the budget question may have to be settled in court. 
 Mr. Wilder, who in 1990 became the nation's first elected African-American governor, began his term as mayor with strong support from residents and the nonpartisan Council, which has five blacks and four whites. 
 Before the budget debate erupted, the Council discussed raising the mayor's salary 20 percent, making his pay higher than those of mayors of larger cities like Atlanta and Baltimore.
 The division stems in part from the strong early support. Shortly after his inauguration, Mr. Wilder argued for increased powers, including greater control over the budget and school board. The Council and the Virginia General Assembly agreed to extend the powers, with the stipulation that a two-thirds vote of the Council could override the mayor. 
 In redrafting the Council's proposed budget last month, Mr. Wilder cut millions of dollars for schools, business and economic development groups, charities, and the coordination of services for the homeless.
 In one slash of a pen, he underscored his promise to rid government of cronyism by eliminating financing for a proposed performing arts center whose board includes some of his most influential supporters. 
 ''I had hoped he would be on our side, but since he's not, it's hard to say I'm happy,'' said James E. Ukrop, a board member and one of the white businessmen who helped Mr. Wilder become mayor. ''Maybe he knew this was going to come down to negotiations between him and City Council. Maybe it's all positioning.''
 At a special meeting on May 31, the Council passed its budget, restoring many of Mr. Wilder's cuts and eliminating other items like a new nine-member security detail to protect the mayor and plans for his new office in City Hall.
 Neither version included the mayor's proposed pay raise. 
 Mr. Wilder declared that budget illegal, because the vote was not taken at a regular meeting, as the city charter requires. Siding with the Council, the city attorney ruled the vote legal. Mr. Wilder said last week that his administration would not enforce the budget.
 Each side insists that its spending plan is the final version. Because the provision to give the mayor veto power and the Council the power to override it does not go into effect until July 1, no rule is in place to settle the conflict.
 Vice Mayor G. Manoli Loupassi, still a Wilder supporter but from the other side of the budget debate, said the Council was considering taking the case to Circuit Court or the State Supreme Court. 
 ''I'm not going to discuss strategies,'' Mr. Loupassi said. ''But if there's a will, there's a way. I believe there's a will.''
 Mr. Wilder was more confident that the budget would be settled before reaching the courts and that each side would be satisfied.
 ''I would hope that we will come to an agreement,'' he said. ''I will be surprised if we don't.''
 Regardless of the outcome, Mr. Ukrop said, Richmond, the former Confederate capital, has made strides since Mr. Wilder took office. 
 ''When was the last time you heard anything racial?'' Mr. Ukrop asked. ''Race has not been a part of this decision. To me, that's progress.''

 BODY:
The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 21,000 last week, the biggest decline in seven weeks, the government reported Thursday. 
 The Labor Department said 330,000 newly laid-off workers filed benefit claims last week after a surge of 27,000 new claims the previous week, which had been the biggest one-week jump since early 2004.
 Labor Department analysts attributed the improvement to fewer layoffs in the auto industry and a shortened workweek because of the Memorial Day holiday, which gave unemployed workers one less day to file claims. 
 The four-week moving average for claims, which smoothes out weekly volatility, also showed improvement last week, falling to 331,750, from 334,500 the previous week.

HEADLINE: Beyond Brakes, Amtrak's Woes Hit the Cafe Car

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD; Janon Fisher contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9 

 BODY:
Riders on Amtrak may think that the $3.25 hot dog and the $1.50 bag of chips in the cafe car are no bargain. Neither does Amtrak. It is spending just over $2 for each dollar of food it sells on its trains, according to auditors.
 But the financially beleaguered railroad said at a Congressional hearing on Thursday that while it could lose less, it has little hope of breaking even there. 
 Expenses for labor and food run about $83 million more than the food service brings in, according to the railroad's inspector general. That sum, twice Amtrak's food and beverage revenues, is without the cost of maintaining the dining cars on long-distance trains and the cafe cars used on short-haul routes like the Northeast Corridor; if those expenses are included, the losses come to about $130 million. 
 The railroad did report some good news on Thursday about another expensive problem, saying it had a tentative theory about why brakes had cracked on the Acela Express trains and how to fix them and have them running by July. Improving the food problem might take longer.
 Some Bush administration officials have suggested that Amtrak should eliminate the food service. The railroad cut hot food last week in the first-class Metroliner cars, and on July 1, it will not serve any food on trains through Albany.
 But some food service is essential, said William L. Crosbie, the senior vice president for operations, who testified Thursday before the railroad subcommittee of the House Transportation Committee. 
 ''Food and beverage is a key part of what the customer is paying for,'' Mr. Crosbie said. ''It's part of the amenities you need to offer when a customer wants to travel on our service.'' 
 During Mr. Crosbie's appearance, Representative John L. Mica, Republican of Florida and a persistent critic of Amtrak, tried to illustrate the food-service problem by putting a trash can on his desk, pulling out a pile of $1 bills and counting them out, dropping two out of every three into the trash.
 But the ranking Democrat, Corinne Brown of Florida, whose district is near Mr. Mica's, said, ''It may actually make some sense for Amtrak to incur some losses on food and beverage service to attract more business.'' She said the railroad's losses came to about $6 per passenger, which she said was less than what major airlines spent on food.
 Ms. Brown said that last weekend her mother, a diabetic, took an Amtrak train and was pleased to find that she could buy a meal on board. 
 Amtrak's biggest problem, according to a report by its inspector general, Fred E. Weiderhold Jr., is its labor cost, about three and a half times the average for restaurants. Amtrak's work force is unionized and receives health and other benefits, which is not the norm in restaurants. In addition, the study found, Amtrak spends about two and a half times as much as restaurants to supply its trains. Amtrak said one reason was the need to store the food and then move it on and off trains.
 That raised a question from the subcommittee chairman, Steven C. LaTourette, Republican of Ohio. While acknowledging that it was hard to compare the economics of Amtrak food service to restaurants. he did question why Amtrak pays more for food and drinks. ''A box of apples should cost what a box of apples costs, aside from the transport to the train,'' he said. 
 In 1999, in an effort to save money, Amtrak laid off its commissary workers and hired a private contractor to buy and stock the food and put it on trains. Auditors from Amtrak and the Government Accountability Office, as well as Mr. Crosbie, agreed that the contract, which expires soon, is flawed because it gives the contractor no incentive to reduce costs.
 Mr. Crosbie said it was being renegotiated. 
 The inspector general, Mr. Weiderhold, said Amtrak could be selling more food. In Pennsylvania Station in New York, he said, many passengers stopped first at stores like Starbucks to ''get their coffee and get their snacks and their bagel, before they settle into their seats.''
 ''Under some models, that is a business the company might want to go after,'' he said. ''I think that's a missed opportunity, one of the things the company has to consider in fixing the problem at hand.''
 In the cafe car of a Metroliner in Washington on Thursday afternoon, the employee behind the counter, who would give only her first name, Pat, gave a different view. ''There's always people buying,'' said Pat, who said she had worked in the cars for 20 years. ''I think they wait, to come from the station, and they will come right here in line.''
 ''It definitely sells,'' she said.
 Amtrak food draws mixed reviews from customers. In Penn Station in New York on Thursday afternoon, Terry Ward, a restaurateur from Pennington, N.J., said: ''Get rid of the food. I don't go on Amtrak for food. Keep the alcohol and lose the food.''
 On the other hand, Naama Laufer, of New York, said she looked forward to the Hebrew National hot dogs. She did not like the price, though. ''I can make 12 hot dogs at home for $3.50,'' she said.
 Also at the hearing Thursday, Mr. LaTourette asked Mr. Crosbie about the Acela trains, which were taken out of service on April 14 after cracks were discovered in the brakes. The trains will start returning by July, he said, with a simple solution that involves rotating one piece of metal a quarter-turn.
 A top priority will be restoring service between New York and Boston, according to Mr. Crosbie. He said that Amtrak and the company that built the brakes have tentatively concluded that the cracks in the spokes that connect the brake disks to the axles were caused by a previously unknown phenomenon, called ''bending out of plane,'' instead of the usual ''bending in plane.'' Mr. Crosbie said that meant the disk was wobbling slightly from side to side when the brakes were applied, like a warped phonograph record. 
 He said Amtrak and a German company called Knorr-Bremse, which supplied the brakes, would replace the disks with a new part, and they would be frequently inspected.
 ''There's a lot of physics going on here,'' he told reporters after his testimony. Each axle has three brake disks, and the problem seems most severe on the middle one. 
 Mr. Crosbie said he was unsure what the replacement would cost, but that the price was small, compared with the $5 million a month being lost on the service reductions. 
 While it investigated the brake problem, Amtrak has substituted older Metroliner trains for all its Acela trains between New York and Washington, but has sharply cut back service on the northern half of its Northeast corridor.


GRAPHIC: Chart: ''Root of the Brake Problem''Amtrak now believes the cracks in its Acela Express brakes were caused by a slight wobbling in the brake disks.On Acela trains, calipers squeeze together to grab the brake disk, which is attached to the axle. This in turn slows down the train.The spokes are designed to handle the stress along the axis of rotation when the calipers are applied to slow the outside of the disk. This is known as bending in plane.Bending out of plane occurs when the disk is wobbling slightly from side to side, twisting the spokes.Diagram of the Acela express brakes highlighting the following:BRAKE DISKAXLEDIRECTION OF STRAINCALIPERSSPOKES WHERE WERE CRACKS FOUNDNote: Diagram is schematic.

HEADLINE: Lilly to Pay $690 Million In Drug Suits

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
Eli Lilly & Company said last night that it had agreed to pay $690 million to settle about 8,000 lawsuits filed by people who claimed they developed diabetes and other diseases after taking Zyprexa, a medication for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder that is Lilly's biggest-selling drug.
 The settlement will cover 75 percent of all the Zyprexa-related suits against Lilly in the United States, according to the company, which said it would continue to defend the other cases. After lawyers' fees and costs, which will probably total more than $250 million, the average plaintiff will receive about $50,000 in the settlement. The settlement covers both state and federal cases. 
 Zyprexa will remain on the market, the company said. Sales of Zyprexa fell 8 percent in the United States last year, mainly because of concerns that the drug causes weight gain and increases the risk of diabetes.
 Because the cases are being settled individually, rather than collectively as part of a class action, the settlement does not require judicial approval, according to Christopher Seeger, a lawyer whose firm represents 900 plaintiffs. But Mr. Seeger said he expected that Jack Weinstein, the federal district court judge in New York who is overseeing the federal cases, would examine the settlement for fairness. 
 The settlement is reasonable, Mr. Seeger said. Because diabetes is common in schizophrenics, plaintiffs might have had difficulty proving Zyprexa was responsible, he said. And many schizophrenics are unemployed, so they can claim only limited economic damages.
 Sidney Taurel, Lilly's chief executive, said in a statement that the company had decided to settle the cases in part because the suits ''interfered with the process of physicians making treatment decisions.'' 
 Some doctors have been reluctant to prescribe Zyprexa because they feared they would be sued, Mr. Seeger said. As part of the settlement, the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss claims against doctors and other health care workers named as co-defendants. In addition, Lilly will require that the lawyers not disclose the documents they received from the company during the pretrial discovery process, Mr. Seeger said.
 ''It was very important and material to Lilly that these documents not be made public,'' he said. Zyprexa was introduced in 1996 and had worldwide sales of $4.4 billion last year, including $2.4 billion in the United States. It is the best-selling of a class of drugs called atypical antipsychotics, used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. 
 Many psychiatrists say that Zyprexa is the most effective of all the new drugs. But in September 2003, after a study that linked atypical antipsychotics to diabetes, the Food and Drug Administration required Lilly and other drug makers to change the drugs' labels to warn prominently about the risk that the drugs caused the disease.
 The Zyprexa suits contended that from 1996 to 2003, Lilly did not adequately disclose the drug's risks.
 The settlement does not prevent the lawyers involved in the cases from bringing additional suits. But Mr. Seeger said he did not expect a second wave of suits, because the label change protects Lilly from people who claim they developed diabetes from taking the drug after 2003.
 Lilly said it would take a pretax charge of at least $700 million this quarter to cover the settlement and other unrelated product liability cases. The charge will essentially wipe out Lilly's profits for the quarter, according to analysts' estimates. Mr. Seeger said his firm would encourage its clients to set up ''special needs trusts'' with the money they received. The trusts would require that clients spend their settlements on necessities like rent. But plaintiffs have the final decision, he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. AND BRITAIN AGREE ON RELIEF TO POOR NATIONS

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER and RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9 

 BODY:
The United States and Britain have reached an agreement on how the billions of dollars that the world's poorest nations owe to international lenders can be erased, removing the last impediment to an accord long sought by the richest nations, a senior official involved in the negotiations said Thursday.
 Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and his British counterpart, Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, will present their proposal to a meeting of the finance ministers of seven of the Group of 8 industrial nations on Friday in London, the official said. 
 The plan would free 18 countries, most of which are in Africa, from any obligation to repay the estimated $16.7 billion they owe the international lenders, said the official, who requested anonymity because a formal announcement of the agreement had not been made. The debts will be written off by the lenders in an effort to allow the debtor countries to start fresh, get their books in order and eventually be able to borrow again for economic development, health, education and social programs, rather than simply to repay existing loans. 
 Mr. Bush had signaled his willingness to go along with writing off the debts in principle, but the United States and Britain had very different approaches to how such a plan would work. The compromise they worked out in negotiations in Washington and London over the past several days gave the White House much of what it wanted, but also handed Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain a timely political lift four weeks before a scheduled summit meeting of leaders of the Group of 8 nations, of which Mr. Blair is the current chairman.
 ''Yes, we have reached an agreement spelling out what President Bush and the prime minister outlined the other day in Washington,'' said the official, referring to talks this week between the leaders. 
 The agreement on debt cancellation is likely to be the only big issue at the coming Group of 8 summit meeting in Scotland on which the United States is in full accord with the other major industrial nations. The Group of 8 includes, in addition to the United States and Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia. 
 The White House has also rebuffed Mr. Blair's efforts to persuade the United States to move closer to the position of the other industrial nations on how to fight global warming.
 Mr. Bush also has resisted calls by Mr. Blair for a doubling of direct governmental aid to Africa, saying the United States has already tripled aid to African countries in recent years and will provide more as those nations show they can use it effectively. And the administration has rejected the British proposal for creation of a new international body that would raise money for Africa by borrowing against pledges of future aid.
 The debt relief negotiations had been bogged down for months over which of two possible methods should be used to eliminate the debt. One approach, favored by Britain, was for the rich nations to take over responsibility for repaying the debts. The second method, favored by the United States, was for the loans to be written off entirely by the lenders. 
 In the end, Britain agreed to the American approach with a promise from the United States to provide additional money to the lenders to make up for the assets they were writing off.
 The second issue was whether to sell some of the International Monetary Fund's gold reserves to help pay off the loans owed to the fund. The United States objected to any gold sales, saying it would drive down the price of gold on the open market, hurting, among others, American gold producers. The compromise was to draw, in part, on the proceeds earned by the monetary fund from sales of gold in the 1990's, according to the official.
 In theory, the deal would free the 18 countries from making $1 billion in interest payments each year to the World Bank, the I.M.F. and other international lenders like the African Development Bank. In practice, they had not been making the payments, leaving them mired in debt and unable to fully engage in the global economy.
 Eventually the program can be extended to at least nine other countries with others sure to press for similar treatment. 
 The 18 countries eligible for debt relief are: Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. 
 Canceling the debt of third-world nations has been a rallying cry for activists for years, and Mr. Blair's government has been pressing for an agreement. Groups that had been seeking to build public pressure on aiding poor nations hailed the agreement, and used the occasion to seek even more aid to the third world. 
 ''President Bush and Prime Minister Blair made great progress and Gordon Brown and John Snow agreed on an excellent proposal for debt cancellation for many of the poorest countries,'' said Jamie Drummond, of DATA, a lobbying group founded by Bono. 
 ''It is no substitute for an overall plan on aid and trade at the G-8 summit, but this degree of cooperation should make a historic breakthrough more likely,'' Mr. Drummond said.
 All of the countries eligible for debt relief have had to show that they have acted to improve governing, reduce corruption and pursue what the international lenders consider sound economic policies.
 If the administration's position on the specifics of how to help the poorest nations is at odds with those its main allies, it agrees with them on the goal. Mr. Bush has pledged to channel more aid to developing nations that show they are working to establish stable, democratic governments with good economic policies. 
 On Monday, he is scheduled to meet at the White House with the leaders of five African countries that held elections last year. They are President Festus Mogae of Botswana, President John Kufour of Ghana, President Armando Guebuza of Mozambique, President Hifikepunye Pohamba of Namibia, and President Mamadou Tandja of Niger. 
 Mr. Bush has emphasized his view that free trade and private investment are more powerful tools for economic growth than government aid. Two of his senior aides are in Africa this week, studying health and economic development programs.
 Paul Wolfowitz, the former deputy defense secretary who is the new president of the World Bank, said on Thursday that he would tell the finance ministers meeting in London that all the pieces are in place for helping Africa this year. 
 ''My message will be I think that it really is important to find increased resources to give Africa so it can turn the corner now,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Says Fed's Work Not Yet Done

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned Thursday that the American economy faces significant ''imbalances'' and made it clear that he was not yet finished with ratcheting up interest rates.
 In testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Mr. Greenspan said the economy was on a ''reasonably firm footing'' but expressed concern about the ''negligible'' rate of personal savings, the huge trade deficit and growing evidence of risky speculation in the housing market.
 Mr. Greenspan dodged questions about his plans for interest rates, but his emphasis on the relatively strong economy and on ''imbalances'' left little doubt that he was more worried about cooling off inflationary pressures than about choking off economic growth. 
 The Fed chairman repeated the central bank's previous statements about raising short-term rates at a ''measured'' pace, which virtually guaranteed that the Fed would raise them by another quarter-point on June 30 and probably follow with additional rate increases in the fall.
 The Fed has raised the federal funds rate on overnight loans eight times in the last year -- to 3 percent from 1 percent -- and some investors have been predicting that it might pause when the rate hit 3.5 percent.
 But Mr. Greenspan and most other Fed officials have given no hint that they were close to the end of the process.
 A big reason is the baffling behavior of bond investors, who have pushed down interest rates on long-term Treasury bonds and actually reduced rates for homebuyers and corporate borrowers.
 Mr. Greenspan said the unexpected decline in long-term interest rates was ''unprecedented'' and was even more dramatic on close scrutiny.
 The clear implication was that the Federal Reserve has, if anything, more reason than before to keep raising short-term rates. 
 ''It's a profoundly important phenomenon and really quite different than one would expect,'' Mr. Greenspan said, adding that mortgage rates were ''lower than they would ordinarily be'' after a year of trying to ratchet up borrowing costs.
 ''As bond yields stay low, that puts more pressure on the Fed to keep going,'' said William C. Dudley, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs. 
 A striking part of Mr. Greenspan's testimony was his increased emphasis on the growing foreign indebtedness of the United States, its low savings rate and the slowing growth of productivity. 
 Until recently, he and other top Fed officials have persistently played down the significance of the huge trade deficit, which hit a record of $617 billion last year and still appears to be climbing. Likewise, Mr. Greenspan had until a few weeks ago rebuffed a growing chorus of analysts who warned about a housing bubble and rising household debt.
 But on Thursday, Mr. Greenspan began his testimony by highlighting major ''imbalances,'' led by the nation's current account deficit and the almost nonexistent rate of personal savings. 
 ''Our household savings rate remains negligible,'' he said. And though he again played down the danger of a nationwide bubble in housing, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that ''speculative activity may have had a greater role in the recent price increases.''
 He also expressed concern about the ''dramatic increase'' in interest-only loans and other ''exotic'' mortgages that allow people to borrow much more than with traditional fixed-rate loans.
 In a signal of his intentions about interest rates, the Fed chairman expressed little worry about a plunge in housing prices. Even if prices did decline, they would ''not have substantial macroeconomic implications,'' he said.
 Put another way, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to stop raising rates because it is worried about a crisis in real estate.
 At the same time, Mr. Greenspan reiterated concern about inflationary pressures. Even though wages have climbed slowly and the underlying pace of inflation is contained, he said, productivity is climbing at half its pace in 2003 and the cost of labor for a given unit of production is rising.
 With only seven months before his term as a Fed governor expires at the end of January, Mr. Greenspan appears focused on getting monetary policy back to normal after propping up the economy with low interest rates for more than three years.
 Many analysts contend that Mr. Greenspan's decision to slash interest rates in 2001, after technology stocks collapsed, contributed to the housing boom and other ''imbalances'' that he is now trying to correct. 
 But Mr. Greenspan said Thursday he had no regrets.
 ''As best we can tell, things have turned out reasonably as we had expected,'' he told lawmakers. ''I think that given the same facts under the same conditions, we would have made the same -- we would have implemented the same policy.''

HEADLINE: Mortgage Rates Defy Fed and Delight Consumers

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
For the last year, the Federal Reserve has been conducting a relentless campaign to raise interest rates. In that same year, the rates that matter the most to many people -- mortgage rates -- have drifted back down, returning to near 30-year lows.
 Low mortgage rates have lifted the nation's long housing boom to a new level, creating jobs and wealth but also worries that some local markets have turned into bubbles. Mortgage refinancing has also taken off again, injecting cash into households at a time when incomes are growing no faster than inflation for most workers. 
 ''It's been fantastic,'' said Ed Schreyer, a 38-year-old executive in Cincinnati who has refinanced his mortgage seven times since buying his home in 2001 and refinanced the mortgage on a Colorado vacation home twice since buying it in 2003. ''It's more cash in my pocket and less money going out the door.''
 Testifying before Congress yesterday, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, called the current situation ''clearly without recent precedent.'' Even as the Fed has lifted its benchmark short-term rate eight times since last summer in an effort to choke off inflation, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has fallen to 5.61 percent, from 6.3 percent, according to BankRate.com. Mortgage rates are now slightly higher than they were in 2003, when they were the lowest in at least three decades.
 In effect, the bond market -- where long-term interest rates, including those for mortgages, are set -- is stimulating the economy while the Fed is trying to stabilize it. 
 In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan warned that the economy faces significant imbalances and made it clear the Fed is not finished ratcheting up interest rates. [Page C1.] 
 The list of reasons for the falling rates is both long and controversial, taking in everything from the aging of the population to the economic growth of China. Economists generally argue that investor psychology also plays some hard-to-define role and that rates will soon rise. But they have been making the same prediction for the last year. 
 ''Since I've been in the business in the mid-1980's, this is the biggest disconnect between the bond market and the economy I've ever seen -- easily,'' said Ethan S. Harris, the chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers and a former Fed staff member. ''You've got almost the exact opposite response in the bond market from the normal response.''
 Although they have vexed policy makers and economists, falling long-term rates have benefited Americans across the economic spectrum.
 Bernard Post recently locked in a low mortgage rate for the next 30 years on a house in East Hampton, N.Y., so he would not have to worry if rates finally did start rising. ''Essentially what I'm doing is buying some certainty in an uncertain world,'' said Mr. Post, 62, a lawyer in Manhattan.
 Calvin S. Jackson, a 53-year-old college math teacher in Atlanta, decided he would start looking to buy his first house even though home prices have been rising. 
 ''The current market makes it very, very encouraging to borrow money, to take a chance and buy a home,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''This is the time to move.''
 In the past, a two-point increase in the Fed's benchmark rate has typically led to a one-point rise in long-term bond rates. Simple logic suggests that when the cost of borrowing money for a year goes up, as it has, so should the cost of a 30-year loan. 
 The Fed, after keeping its benchmark rate unusually low in the wake of the 2001 recession, began raising it almost a year ago as inflation picked up. At about 3 percent, annual inflation remains lower than it has been for most of the last generation, but it has begun pinching incomes and Fed officials are concerned it might accelerate. 
 Low interest rates, which encourage people to borrow and spend money, spur demand for goods and tend to push up their prices.
 Since last June, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate, which sets the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 3 percent, from 1 percent. Other consumer interest rates, like those on credit cards and car loans, have increased during the last year, but only slightly. 
 ''It's a conundrum,'' Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist of the National City Corporation, a major mortgage lender based in Cleveland, said borrowing a word from Mr. Greenspan to describe the growing gap between long-term and short-term rates.
 ''It's in defiance of economic fundamentals.''
 Speaking by satellite on Monday to a monetary conference in Beijing, Mr. Greenspan named four widely cited causes for the mystery, but he cast doubt on each one. The most obvious explanation is that investors simply think the economy is weaker than Fed officials do. That would cause people to bid up the prices of bonds, which are a conservative investment; bond prices and interest rates always move in opposite directions.
 But if the decline in rates were all about the economy, pieces of good economic news would halt it, even temporarily. That has not happened, Mr. Greenspan said.
 He also questioned the widely held belief that foreign banks have kept rates low by buying United States Treasury bonds. Those purchases help keep foreign currencies inexpensive relative to the dollar and allow other countries to continue exporting cellphones, cars and other goods to the United States.
 Mr. Greenspan argued that the effect of these purchases on interest rates had been only ''modest,'' though. Long-term rates in other countries, where foreign banks have not been such active buyers, have also dropped, he said.
 Two other factors-- the fall in inflation caused by globalization and the buying of long-term bonds by pension funds trying to shore up their finances as baby boomers approach retirement -- are helping keep rates low. But they do not explain the pattern of the last year, Mr. Greenspan said.
 ''World demographic trends are hardly news,'' he said.
 The most similar period to the last year might be the late 1980's, when the Fed was raising its benchmark but mortgage rates stayed roughly flat, even dipping somewhat in late 1988. But rates were far higher then than they are now, making investors confident the Fed would soon take back its rate increases, which it did.
 Today, the Fed seems unlikely to lower its rate anytime soon. 
 That has caused some mortgage bankers to urge homeowners to grab a 5 percent or 6 percent mortgage while they still can. ''I think people have one more moment to lock in a low rate,'' said Ellen Bitton, chief executive of Park Avenue Mortgage, which has offices in New York and Palm Beach, Fla.
 That might end up being great advice. It is also very similar to what bankers were saying a year ago.

HEADLINE: China Weighs Modest Currency Change

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, June 9 

 BODY:
China's political leadership is actively considering breaking the 11-year link between the dollar and China's currency, the yuan, and tying its value instead to a group of currencies, current and former senior Chinese officials said in interviews. The proposal being weighed at almost daily meetings of the Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo would use a so-called basket of currencies to set the yuan's value. The yuan would move up and down in currency markets in relation to the average values of the dollar, yen, euro and possibly other currencies like the British pound.
 But the initial value of the yuan under the new system could, in dollar terms, be very close to its current value of 8.277 to the dollar. The Standing Committee's members, the nine most powerful men in China, are wary of letting the yuan rise sharply in value at the same time it is linked to the basket of currencies, the current and former officials said. 
 Linking the yuan to a basket of currencies, and not just the dollar, would make it a little more flexible and less susceptible to the swoops and swoons of the dollar in recent years. If the dollar fell against the euro, yen and any other currencies in the basket, the yuan's value would creep up in dollar terms. If the dollar rose, as it has for much of the last month, then the yuan might fall in dollar terms, making Chinese exports even cheaper in the United States than they already are.
 The Bush administration and many members of Congress have urged China to let its currency appreciate and are unlikely to be satisfied with a policy shift that effectively leaves it at its current value for the time being.
 Finance ministers from the Group of 8 -- seven leading industrial nations as well as Russia -- are to meet in London on Friday and Saturday. They are expected to issue a statement, possibly with greater urgency than at previous meetings, encouraging China to allow greater flexibility in the yuan.
 If the Beijing authorities were to push up the yuan's value, making Chinese goods more expensive in the United States and American goods cheaper in China, economic theory suggests that this would cause the American trade deficit with China to narrow somewhat.
 The Politburo's Standing Committee -- which includes President Hu Jintao, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and seven other top officials -- has made no decision yet on when or whether to act, and may decide soon or wait as long as next year, the officials said. But the deliberations have taken on a pressing quality, with the Standing Committee meeting almost every day last week to review currency policy. Senior economic officials have been told to be on hand for consultations at any moment.
 In a telling instance, Yang Weizhe, the mother of Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the Chinese central bank, died at 6:30 a.m. on May 31, but Mr. Zhou was still required to attend a Standing Committee meeting on the currency an hour and a half later.
 The yuan has been linked to the dollar since 1994. After starting at a rate of 8.7 to the dollar then and gradually appreciating for nearly four years, the yuan was locked in at 8.277 to the dollar in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis and has been there ever since. Officials have allowed it to vary by only one-hundredth of 1 percent from that level above or below. Wider variations have occurred for only a few minutes or, on April 29, for 20 minutes.
 Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned at a conference on Monday that other low-wage countries might export more to the United States even if an appreciation of the yuan priced Chinese goods out of the American market.
 ''It certainly is not going to be a major impact'' on the overall trade deficit, Mr. Greenspan said.
 Some economists in China have been calling for combining a shift to a basket of currencies with an immediate appreciation of 3 percent to 5 percent in the yuan, which would make imports cheaper and help control inflation. But it is not clear how much attention this idea is receiving in what has become an essentially political decision by China's leaders.
 The leadership has been deeply concerned that the yuan not rise far enough to make Chinese goods uncompetitive overseas. China's economy needs to grow at least 7 percent a year just to create jobs for all the former peasants now pouring into the cities, and exports have been the main engine of growth and job creation. China's textile and apparel industry now employs 19 million people, mostly low-wage seamstresses, compared with fewer than 50,000 in the United States, and Chinese apparel executives said in interviews that even an appreciation of 5 percent could cause some jobs to move to lower-wage countries, like Vietnam.
 A stronger yuan could not only cause some factories to lay off workers, but also make imported food even cheaper. This would depress prices for rice and other staples grown on Chinese farms, potentially sending more peasants into the cities even as urban unemployment rises.
 Well-connected advisers in Hong Kong to the Chinese government agreed with the current and former officials that the next move by the leadership was likely to be a link to a basket of currencies, though they were unsure when this might occur.
 Victor Fung, a Hong Kong tycoon who is chairman of one of the world's largest garment companies and heads the territory's airport authority, said, ''They recognize the need to go away from a peg and move toward a basket.'' 
 Mr. Fung said each currency's percentage in the basket should match the percentage of China's trade conducted in that currency, an approach favored by many economists. He also said that China should reveal the relative weightings of the currencies in the basket.
 But other advisers said Chinese officials were leaning strongly toward switching to a basket without disclosing the currency weightings. Singapore has long done this with its dollar.
 Such an approach would allow China's leaders more discretion in pushing the value of the currency up or down. But it could also open China to accusations from the United States and Europe that it is secretly manipulating the yuan to gain a commercial advantage for its exports.
 The current and former Chinese officials said the Standing Committee was conducting a very detailed review, and did not provide the currency weightings under discussion. The officials said that some in the leadership were well aware of the benefits of making the weightings clear and public.
 Also uncertain is whether Chinese officials would peg the yuan tightly to the basket, allowing it to vary only a tiny fraction of a percent, or whether a wider band might be tolerated.
 Any move by China is likely to be greeted with great attention by world financial markets. Of particular interest will be whether China continues to buy dollar-denominated assets at a brisk pace after a shift to a basket of currencies; a slowing of Chinese purchases could hurt not only the dollar's value but also American stock and bond prices.
 China's foreign exchange reserves increased by $200 billion last year and $49 billion in the first quarter of 2005, to $659 billion on March 31. Chinese officials have gone to great lengths to conceal how they allocate their reserves among currencies, by using accounts in London and elsewhere, but bankers say a substantial portion of the reserves is in dollars.

PERSON: Yvette D. Clarke

HEADLINE: Time for a Bathroom Break, With No Waiting

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
THE councilwoman, or council member, as she refers to herself, seems a bit cranky and a lot rushed after putting in overtime on a hot afternoon at City Hall, where the Council grappled, ad infinitum, with a speaker-instigated rebuff of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's solid waste disposal plan. Gifford Miller, the Council speaker and mayoral hopeful, set the daily agenda back three hours with his maneuverings. Politics as aggravation.
 Waiting around is not Yvette D. Clarke's forte. Ms. Clarke, who also refers to herself as ''the sister from Flatbush,'' gave Mr. Miller an itsy-bitsy scolding before departing City Hall and isn't much in a mood now for toilet talk: her role in cutting the waiting time for women at public toilets. Naturally, she relents: ''potty parity,'' as it's called, is good public policy, particularly when more than half of one's constituents are female. 
''But I don't want it to be, like, my mantra,'' she says, depositing herself inside her office at 250 Broadway -- the same one her mother, Una S.T. Clarke, occupied until term limits interfered and yielded the Council's first mother-daughter succession. Ms. Clarke requisitioned an office with a bridge view, but no dice: She inherited Mom's view of Murray Street after she was elected in 2001 and re-elected in 2003. A few boxes of her mother's paperwork still sit in a corner. 
 As for Ms. Clarke's personal touches, the idiosyncratic ones are disappearing fast. An aide, concerned about propriety, is ripping a collage of toilet-centric newspaper clips and cartoons from the doorway before a photographer can zero in; a headline that says, simply, ''The Next Speaker,'' vanishes, too. As if having a sense of humor along with political ambition -- she ran and lost in 2004 but will try again in 2006 for Shirley Chisholm's old Congressional seat in the 11th District, which overlaps her current district in central Brooklyn -- is something to hide. But aides will be aides. Ms. Clarke is used to it: Her parents were a tad overprotective, too. Still are, come to think of it. They live on the same Brooklyn block as she does, and even own the house she lives in. 
 Anyhow, there's not a shred of evidence here, humorous or otherwise, that Ms. Clarke, 40, is chief sponsor of the freshly adopted Women's Restroom Equity Bill, legislation that zoomed through the Council unanimously last month and garnered an uncommonly swift, cooperative thumbs-up from Mr. Bloomberg on Monday. 
 ''To me, this bill goes beyond toilet significance,'' she says. ''It goes all the way to the issue of gender equality, and quality of life.'' Though she received a small amount of hateful e-mail messages that accused her of being a ''Fem-Nazi,'' the general reaction to the bill has been positive locally and internationally.
 Warming to the theme, she poses by the hallway restroom before settling down in her office beneath three flags from her collection. She notes she has no complaints with the workplace facilities; with 16 councilwomen, there are ample toilets, a perk of working in a male-dominated profession. Maybe the only perk: Ms. Clarke says she has been around enough male-dominated power plays to notice ''a certain level of entitlement around decision-making, a from-the-top-down process that isn't good public policy and isn't about building consensus.'' 
 Take this week's West Side stadium debacle, for example. ''I hate to say it, but stadium, schmadium! It was a public, and expensive, clash of the titans. I just wish a fraction of the money spent on advertising was put into our schools and neighborhoods.''
 SO why were the men in city government supportive of the women's restroom bill? Sheer enlightenment? 
 ''No, it's because men have to wait for women when women wait on line to use restrooms,'' she says, adjusting the lacy camisole under her linen suit. Ms. Clarke, who is single, focuses on female empowerment issues with the same fervor her mother brought to empowering those she called ''people of color'' in government. Anything or anyone degrading to women gets her attention, including the rapper Eminem, who earned a City Council denunciation in 2003 for this noxious lyric: ''Black girls are dumb.'' 
 She came up with the idea of requiring arenas, theaters and nightclubs to supply a two-to-one, female-to-male restroom facilities ratio after a vexing 2003 shopping excursion to the Gateway Mall in East New York. She waited in line at the cashier, then waited in line at the ladies' room, then had her ''eureka moment.'' Turns out, it was contagious.
 ''This was a no-brainer issue and one of those eureka moments for everyone, including the administration,'' she says. ''Also, it was one of those embarrassing eureka moments. What took us so long? In New York City, where we pride ourselves on our edginess, there are many ways where we're stuck in a time warp.'' Quality-of-life legislation is her target: A living will and health proxy bill, a prisoner discharge protocol that offers job and rehab options, a parking-near-driveways prohibition to enhance visibility on city streets. 
 Ms. Clarke grew up in Brooklyn, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants. Her mother was an early-education specialist before becoming the city's first Jamaican-born councilwoman, and her father is an architect for the Port Authority. She wanted to become a pediatrician but switched gears to business and economic development at Oberlin College and did a Congressional internship in 1983. She was the director of business development for the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation for five years before entering politics, a career she does not intend to leave any time soon. ''I'm in the zone,'' she says.

HEADLINE: Upbeat Talk by Greenspan Gives Share Prices a Lift

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks rebounded yesterday as bullish Congressional testimony from Alan Greenspan and anticipation of a strong midquarter update from Intel brightened Wall Street's mood and overshadowed a surge in oil prices. 
 Mr. Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told lawmakers the economy seemed to be on ''reasonably firm footing,'' with inflation under control. His generally positive assessment supports the view that the Fed, which has raised interest rates eight times over the last year, will probably continue raising rates at a gradual pace. 
 Fed policy makers are widely expected to raise the federal funds rate another quarter-point to 3.25 percent at their next meeting, on June 29-30. 
 ''Once everyone sifted through all the comments, the realization was that he hasn't changed his thoughts about the economy,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at S.W. Bach & Company in New York. ''He doesn't think the economy is ready to fall off a cliff, and that's basically a strong fundamental for the stock market.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.16, or 0.25 percent, to 10,503.02. 
 The broader gauges also closed higher. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 6.26, or 0.5 percent, at 1,200.93. The Nasdaq composite index added 16.73, or 0.8 percent, to 2,076.91. 
 Mr. Greenspan's remarks had some analysts speculating that the Fed would probably continue raising short-term rates through the third quarter, perhaps to 4 percent. With the rate cycle's end in sight, stock investors can look forward to more stability, said Hans F. Olsen, chief investment officer at Bingham Legg Advisers, a private wealth management firm in Boston. 
 ''The interest rate increase regime is coming to a close, and that is an unambiguous positive development for equities,'' he said. ''I think that sets us up for a good second half.'' 
 Intel raised its second-quarter revenue forecast on better-than-expected demand for its notebook computer chips, a sign that the semiconductor industry is gaining strength after a downturn last year. The forecast was released after the close of trading.
 Research in Motion, the maker of the popular BlackBerry hand-held device, slid 5 percent, or $3.89, to $73.55, after it said it had reached an impasse in completing the settlement of a patent dispute. 
 Computer Associates International rose a penny, to $27.01, after it said it had agreed to acquire Niku, a software provider, for $350 million. Niku rose 25 percent, or $4.16, to $20.66. 
 Navistar International, a maker of trucks and specialty vehicles, rose 85 cents, to $33.06, after its second-quarter profit increased 2 percent from last year; it also raised its outlook for the full year. 
 The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller-company stocks, was up 5.76, or 0.93 percent, at 626.23. 
 Bonds were moderately lower, however. The yield on the 10-year note rose to 3.95 percent from 3.93 percent late Wednesday. The price, which moves inversely to the yield, fell 4/32, to 101 14/32.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year Treasury notes.

HEADLINE: Bolivia Installs New Leader With Very Long 'To Do' List

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, June 10 

 BODY:
Bolivia's new president, Eduardo Rodriguez, began his first day in office on Friday pledging to convene early elections while working with Congress to address the demands of angry citizens for the nationalization of the energy sector and the drafting of a new constitution to give the Indian majority more rights.
 Mr. Rodriguez, 49, was the unassuming, little-known president of the Supreme Court until late Thursday, when Congress chose him to replace President Carlos Mesa, who resigned after failing to quell potent nationwide protests. A Harvard-educated administrator with no political affiliation, Mr. Rodriguez, the third in line for the presidency, was seen as the best choice to defuse the furious uprisings that have paralyzed Bolivia for three weeks. 
 On Friday, some protest leaders vowed to press on. ''We're not lifting any of the pressure tactics,'' Jaime Solares, executive secretary of the largest labor confederation, said in comments quoted by La Prensa. 
 Still, Evo Morales, the country's most influential indigenous spokesman and leader of the Movement Toward Socialism, said Mr. Rodriguez would be given time to act. ''His election is easing the tensions and we are going to accept a truce,'' Mr. Morales told reporters.
 Calm did, in fact, return to much of Bolivia, an Andean country of nine million. Fuel remained scarce, but protesters began lifting roadblocks that had isolated six cities. Shops and offices reopened, and many of the 14,000 troops deployed in recent days returned to barracks.
 Mr. Rodriguez, whose appointment was so sudden that he was not presented with the traditional tricolor presidential sash during his swearing in, stressed that new elections must be held, not only for president but for members of Congress. The political class in Bolivia is reviled by the opposition as corrupt and beholden to special interests.
 ''One of my attributions, a capacity I have, is to convene an electoral process that would transform and renew citizen representation so this Congress can become more democratic, more just and more fair,'' Mr. Rodriguez said near midnight on Thursday, shortly after being sworn in.
 But he will not have an easy time in a country that is divided between Indians in the western highlands who want more say on economic policy and a ruling elite in the eastern lowlands. His is just a caretaker government, yet many Bolivians are clamoring for far-reaching changes in the political system.
 ''He's an honest man, but he has a task you wouldn't wish on your enemies,'' said Eduardo A. Gamarra, the Bolivian-born head of Latin American studies at Florida International University in Miami. ''He's a worker, and his character is more of someone wanting to do things for the long term, while his task here is very short term.''
 Indeed, Mr. Rodriguez has quietly toiled on years-long projects, like reforms of the judicial and electoral systems and modernization of the Foreign Ministry. ''He is a man who never sought the limelight,'' said Mr. Gamarra, who has known Mr. Rodriguez for 15 years.
 Now, he will be at the center of attention as Bolivians wait and watch to see if Mr. Rodriguez can persuade Congress to convene elections in which many of its members would stand to lose their seats.
 ''That is a big challenge, to achieve accords with Congress for what would basically be the self-dissolution of the Congress,'' said Alvaro Garcia, a political analyst in La Paz. The new president will also be under pressure to convene a citizen assembly leading to the drafting of a new constitution and a referendum that would give Bolivia's far-flung regions more autonomy. And he also faces the task of placating Bolivians who want the state to squeeze foreign energy companies, even to the point of expropriating installations.
 Mr. Rodriguez stressed that many of the changes Bolivians want most must be fashioned with Congress. Political analysts question whether the lawmakers will cooperate.
 ''He's a temporary president and a prisoner of the forces of Parliament,'' Mr. Garcia said. ''He does not even have political experience, the capacity to influence Parliament or the enthusiasm of the social movements.''

HEADLINE: Government Is Checking Possible Case Of Mad Cow

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
An American beef cow has tested positive for mad cow disease and additional tests will have to be done at a British laboratory to confirm the results, Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns said yesterday. 
 The meat of the animal that tested positive did not get into the nation's food or animal feed chain, Mr. Johanns said. ''There is no risk whatsoever,'' he told reporters in a hastily organized conference call Friday night. 
 If the British lab confirms the positive test result, it would be the nation's second confirmed case of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The first confirmed case was found in December 2003 in Washington State in a dairy cow that had been fed in Canada. 
 A confirmed case of the disease would be a blow for the Agriculture Department, which has been struggling to reopen the border to live cattle from Canada and win back export markets in Japan and Korea. After the discovery in 2003, 53 countries banned American cattle. Since then, about one-third of exports have resumed. But Japan, which accounted for nearly half of the nation's beef exports before 2003, has not lifted its ban, despite agreeing to do so last fall. 
 Beef has soared to record prices in American grocery stores, and meatpackers have struggled from the lack of Canadian cattle they normally count on. 
 The positive test result came one day after Mr. Johanns held a roundtable discussion in Minneapolis with beef cattle producers and other beef officials. There, he pressed the message that the American beef supply was safe and that the border closure was wreaking economic havoc on the $7.5 billion American beef and cattle industry. The industry has lost more than $4 billion a year since the case of disease was discovered. 
 After the discovery in Washington, cattle prices in the United States fell by about 16 percent, and consumer surveys at the time suggested that domestic beef demand could fall by as much as 15 percent. But prices recovered in early 2004 and American demand for beef has been robust, contributing to record high prices this spring.
 The border with Canada has been closed since May 2003, when the disease was discovered in a cow in Alberta. Since then two other confirmed cases have been found in Canada, and more testing procedures have been put in place there. 
 The Agriculture Department tried to reopen the border in March to animals that were 30 months or younger, but was stopped after a cattlemen's group suing to keep out Canadian imports won an injunction from a federal judge in Montana. The judge, Richard F. Cebull of Federal District Court, was sharply critical of the Agriculture Department's assurances that measures were in place to assure the safety of the beef coming from Canada. 
 A federal appeals court in San Francisco is scheduled to hold a hearing on the injunction on July 13, and a trial is set for July 27 in Judge Cebull's courtroom.
 Mr. Johanns said on Friday night that he was not concerned that there would be a drop in consumer confidence as a result of the test. ''This is a situation where we do not have a human health risk,'' he said. And he said that the positive test would not affect trade discussions with Japan, South Korea and Canada. 
 ''I don't anticipate problems with our trading partners,'' Mr. Johanns said. ''They'll want to know what the issues are and what we have done. We want to assure them, and to assure the public, that what we are doing here is transparent.''
 The beef cow, which was nine years old and could not stand, was first tested last November and passed three initial tests. Then the Agriculture Department's inspector general, in reviewing the department's mad cow testing program, requested that the cow and two other previously suspect animals be tested again with a different technology that is used in Europe. The one cow tested positive on Friday.
 Agriculture Department officials said they did not yet know which state the cow came from. 
 A sample of the animal's brain tissue will be sent to a laboratory in Weybridge, England, and results should be available in a few days, a spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Grisly Effect Of One Drug: 'Meth Mouth'

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Gretchen Ruethling contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
From the moment on Thursday when the young man sat down in Dr. Richard Stein's dental chair in southwestern Kansas and opened his mouth, Dr. Stein was certain he recognized the enemy. This had to be the work, he concluded, of methamphetamine, a drug that is leaving its mark, especially in the rural regions of the Midwest and the South, on families, crime rates, economies, legislatures -- and teeth.
 Quite distinct from the oral damage done by other drugs, sugar and smoking, methamphetamine seems to be taking a unique, and horrific, toll inside its users' mouths. In short stretches of time, sometimes just months, a perfectly healthy set of teeth can turn a grayish-brown, twist and begin to fall out, and take on a peculiar texture less like that of hard enamel and more like that of a piece of ripened fruit.
 The condition, known to some as meth mouth, has been studied little in dentistry's academic circles and is unknown to many dentists, whose patients are increasingly focused on cosmetic issues: the bleaching and perfect veneers of television's makeover shows. But other dentists, especially those in the open, empty swaths of land where methamphetamine is being manufactured in homemade laboratories, say they are seeing a growing number of such cases. 
 These are the same towns, in some cases, that have wrestled in recent years with shortages of dentists. They are places where dentists have struggled to sell their practices as populations shrink; where new dentists have been reluctant to settle, out of fear that they will not get enough business to make ends meet; and where political leaders have offered financial incentives to lure young dentists to town. For good or ill, meth mouth is creating more business.
 East of Dr. Stein's Dodge City office, in Independence, Kan., Dr. Cynthia E. Sherwood said she too had seen such patients lately, including a woman whose teeth had been transformed into ''little black stubs'' too painful to brush and who wound up losing all her top teeth and six of her lower ones. Among similar patients Dr. Charles Tatlock has seen in his New Mexico office, he said, was one who, though only 17, needed dentures to replace his suddenly decayed teeth.
 And in Tennessee, Dr. Daniel D. Roberts gave up his ordinary practice not long ago to handle a growing workload at 10 jails across the state, nearly a third of whose prisoners, he estimates, have ravaged teeth owing to methamphetamine.
 ''This is the worst thing to come along in a long time,'' Dr. Roberts said the other day. ''At this point, I'm digging for roots. That's how I make my living.''
 Some dentists have their own hypotheses about precisely what causes the condition.
 Dr. John W. Shaner, an associate professor at the Creighton University Medical Center School of Dentistry, in Omaha, said he believed that a combination of factors tied to the use of methamphetamine led to such enormous damage.
 The drug itself, a synthetic stimulant that can be manufactured just about anywhere, causes dry mouth, Dr. Shaner said, and that in turn allows decay to start, since saliva is unavailable to help control bacteria in the mouth. The drug also tends to leave users thirsty and craving a constant supply of soda pop and other sugary drinks, which spur the decay; Mountain Dew, he said, has become the preferred drink of methamphetamine users. At the same time, the drug's highly addictive nature causes many users simply to stop doing what is needed to take care of themselves, including the brushing of teeth.
 Other dentists said they suspected that the caustic ingredients of the drug -- whether smoked, injected, snorted or eaten -- contributed to the damage, which tends to start near the gums and wander to the edges of teeth. Among ingredients that can be used to make meth are red phosphorus found in the strips on boxes of matches and lithium from car batteries.
 There are also dentists who point to methamphetamine users' tendency to grind and clench their teeth nervously, aggravating the frighteningly twisted and tangled look of meth mouth.
 If the man sitting in Dr. Stein's Kansas office on Thursday, who readily admitted having used methamphetamine, gets all the work done that he needs -- X-rays, fillings and crowns, and implants for the teeth now missing from his mouth -- he will require many visits, and the bill could run to as much as $7,000.
 Most dentists, though, say this is hardly the growth industry any of them would wish for. The patients are grim, their teeth grimmer. Many of these young people, the dentists say, may end up with no teeth at all but with dentures, which some in dentistry had come to believe would soon be mostly relics of the past, even for the elderly, in an age of water fluoridation and other technology.
 ''The real market for dentistry is in saving teeth, in helping people have dental health,'' said Dr. Stein, 57. ''But I've seen a lot. I'm not a drug counselor, and I'm long past lecturing, but this is a sorry situation.''
 Dr. Shaner said meth mouth might be little recognized in many places -- even as the drug has spread from one coast to the other and from rural areas into cities -- because methamphetamine is a problem that has had a chance to sink in longer in places like Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri and because the effects to teeth are often most obvious in pockets like prison populations. He said he hoped to present information on the topic at a conference of the American Dental Association next year.
 With the exception of a few formal studies, including one now beginning in New Mexico, meth mouth has so far been less a topic of academic analysis in the dental profession than a matter for casual phone conversations and e-mail exchanges between dentists in small places.
 ''The truth is, very little is known yet,'' said Dr. Stephen Wagner, who specializes in dentures and implants in his private practice and who in coming months will be studying 20 afflicted patients with Dr. Tatlock, an assistant professor at the University of New Mexico. ''What I can tell you is what I have seen: It looks like someone has taken a hammer to these teeth and shattered them.''
 One of the strangest truths of the condition, dentists said, is that despite the truly grisly look, many patients do not report suffering from as much pain as one would expect. Or at least, these dentists said, they do not report such pain while still using methamphetamine.
 Though the condition has begun turning up in private practices, particularly in cases of emergency care and among recovering addicts, it is far more prevalent in the dental offices of the nation's jails and prisons.
 Local sheriffs in Midwestern and Southern counties have complained of soaring dental costs in their jails. In North Dakota, more dentures have been needed in the state penitentiary in the last few years, a development that officials attribute at least in part to methamphetamine. In North Carolina, dental workers in the Department of Correction learned about meth mouth during a training session this month; starting in July, new prisoners there will be screened for signs of dental problems connected to the drug. 
 In Minnesota's state corrections system, meanwhile, dentists' workloads are so full of gruesome methamphetamine-related matters that they are strained to get to other, less urgent cases: the routine cleanings and fillings of years past.
 ''All of our time is getting eaten up,'' said Dr. Stephen Boesch, a dentist who works at a Minnesota prison and who said he had begun to see the problem in a juvenile corrections center as well. ''We're seeing this week in and week out.''
 Some dentists said they would never ask their patients about drug use; that is not their place, they said. Others said they would ask, but could not force the issue.
 ''That's the thing: you can't beat a confession from someone,'' said Dr. Eric Curtis, who shares a practice with his father in Safford, Ariz., and began seeing meth mouth four years ago.
 ''I suspect that many dentists are out there seeing this but don't know what they're seeing,'' said Dr. Curtis, a spokesman for the Academy of General Dentistry. ''And most of them aren't going to know for sure.''
 The new business, he said, is actually a gloomy one for dentists in rural places like Safford. 
 ''What dentists really make the money on is the happy stuff: the low-impact work with beautiful results,'' he said. ''Nobody is happy when you pull a bunch of teeth and put in dentures.''

HEADLINE: Racing Industry Faces A Watershed Moment

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
While Belmont Park celebrates its 100th season as the epicenter of New York horse racing today with its signature race, the $1 million Belmont Stakes, the association that has run the track for the past 50 years is trying to prove to federal authorities that it has reformed and to convince state officials it should remain in business.
 Federal monitors have overseen the operations of the New York Racing Association as part of a plea agreement for its role in a 2003 tax-evasion scandal involving several mutuel clerks. As early as August, they will issue a report to the United States attorney's office on whether the association has implemented anti-corruption measures and good business practices. 
 If so, the charges will be dropped against the association, which has already paid a $3 million fine. 
 By the end of the year, however, Gov. George E. Pataki is expected to appoint a nine-member committee to devise a process to put Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga Race Course out to bid when the association's franchise on the tracks expires after 2007. Last January, in his budget proposal, the governor indicated that the government was tired of scandals and mismanagement and expected a starting bid of at least $250 million, with annual payments of perhaps tens of millions more.
 ''The tracks are public assets, and the governor wants to ensure the next franchise holder, whoever it is, runs them in the proud tradition of racing in New York, and in the best interest of the industry, its owners, and the people of New York State,'' said Todd Alhart, a spokesman for the governor.
 With 4,500 video lottery terminals to be in place at Aqueduct by the summer of 2006, New York's racing franchise is expected to attract numerous bids from well-heeled racetrack operators, casino companies, private equity firms and perhaps even technology companies. It already handles more than $2.7 billion annually in horse-racing bets.
 New York Racing Association officials intend to be among those bidders and have been exploring several models they hope can entice the state government to enter into a private-public partnership. They are also willing to take a harder line, if necessary, by entering into what could be long and costly litigation over who owns the land on which the three tracks stand. 
 The association maintains that it possesses the deeds to the three properties and has paid more than $422 million in state property taxes since 1955, when it was established as a nonprofit corporation to run the tracks under a state franchise.
 ''We bought the tracks and have the deeds, and it would be an interesting case to see if the legislature can take away private property,'' said C. Steven Duncker, the association's co-chairman. ''But our primary focus has been changing this organization and running it the way the state would want it run.'' To that end, the association has replaced top management and implemented a business culture to reverse the $20 million it lost in 2003. For the first time, for example, the association sold a presenting sponsorship, to Argent Mortgage, for this year's Belmont Stakes.
 It also negotiated a five-year network television deal with ABC/ESPN that begins in 2006 and will give it 40 percent more money than its existing deal with NBC. The association's efforts to generate revenue will be felt by Belmont Stakes patrons today -- ticket prices more than doubled for the least expensive ticket, to $20 from $9, while the top reserved seat increased to $300 from $150.
 Still, critics of the racing association are legion, ranging from Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general, and Alan Hevesi, the state comptroller, to Frank Stronach, a rival racetrack operator who has said his Magna Entertainment company would aggressively pursue the franchise.
 Before the racetracks can be put up for bid, however, there is a growing consensus that the state's racing laws need to be changed if a vibrant New York horse industry is to be sustained. The Friends of New York Racing, a nonprofit advocacy group, recently released an economic impact study that found the state's thoroughbred racing industry accounted for $1.3 billion and provided 16,900 jobs and that the horse-racing industry as a whole encompassed more than 152,000 people, including owners, service providers, employees and volunteers.
 ''If you bid on the New York Racing Association right now, you would be competing for the right to lose $10 million a year,'' said Tim Smith, the president of the Friends of New York Racing. ''Because all it is now is a set of rights granted by the state that has resulted in financial losses and mounting debt. I think a bipartisan consensus is growing that we need to pass reform legislation first and then put the franchise out to bid.''
 Last month at a joint hearing of the New York Senate and Assembly committees on racing and wagering, Bennett Liebman, coordinator of the Racing and Wagering Law Program at Albany Law School, testified that the amount of money bet on horse racing in New York, when adjusted for inflation, was 30 percent of what it was 30 years ago, when the state's races were not available by simulcast across the nation, off-track betting facilities barely existed and multibet wagers were rare.
 ''You have a law that absolutely nobody understands,'' Liebman said. ''It really is unworkable because it's not been given a lot of attention over the years. Year after year, people add on at the last minute to already bad laws.''
 While Liebman attempts to write a more effective law from scratch, the Friends of New York Racing is trying to come up with a new business model for operating the state's racetracks. Smith said the plan would focus on a public-private partnership. 
 Over the next 18 months, the current racing association, as well as numerous outside entities, will be watching their research and lobbying lawmakers for the right to run the racing franchise from 2008 and beyond.
 ''There's a once-in-the-generation opportunity to accomplish something that will update and improve racing in New York,'' Smith said. ''The state has the ability to rethink its whole approach, keep jobs and generate more revenue for New York.''

HEADLINE: Pension-Shortfall Study Finds Winners and Losers

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
If the Bush administration's proposal to shore up the pension system were already in place, some large companies would have to double or triple the amounts they are putting into their pension funds this year but other companies would not have to contribute anything, a new analysis of corporate pension data found.
 The study is coming out as the debate about pension fund changes in general and the administration's approach in particular is heating up. Business groups have been warning that the administration's plan would put undue pressure on companies that offer pensions, forcing some to divert needed cash from their business operations and prompting others to stop offering pensions. Members of Congress began to discuss a possible pension overhaul this week. 
 Policy makers say the pension system needs to be repaired to prevent more big pension failures like the $10 billion one at United Airlines and an eventual taxpayer bailout of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. But some companies and labor unions are concerned about remedies that would themselves be harmful.
 The study, by David Zion of Credit Suisse First Boston who has made a specialty of analyzing the pension data that companies disclose in their annual financial statements, found that some companies would, indeed, be hard-pressed if the administration's proposal were already law. But he also found that many others would not feel a thing. Companies that would have to more than double their expected pension contributions this year include General Motors, Delta Air Lines, Xerox, Cigna and I.B.M., according to Mr. Zion's analysis. 
 Representatives of some of the companies, including G.M. and Xerox, questioned the study's validity, saying that their pension funds were fully funded according to the current rules. A Delta spokeswoman said the study reinforced Delta's position that the airline would soon be in serious financial trouble if it did not get some relief from its pension obligations.
 But another sizable group of companies would owe nothing to their pension plans for 2005, even though they have told investors that they intend to put hundreds of millions of dollars into their plans this year. Those companies will get a tax deduction for the contributions. 
 They include Verizon Communications, which has said it will contribute $870 million this year; United Parcel Service, which said it would contribute $730 million; Merck, which said it would contribute $415 million; and General Electric, which said it would contribute $340 million. 
 Pension numbers have come under scrutiny as policy makers cope with the record-size failure of United Airlines' pension plans and the possibility that it could set off a chain reaction in the airline industry, eventually swamping the pension guarantor.
 Government officials reviewing United's plans have noted that the airline performed calculations -- all in compliance with the law -- that made its pension plans look robust when their true economic condition was worsening rapidly. On the basis of its measurements, United did not make any cash contributions to the plans for several years. That, too, was legal, despite a requirement that companies set aside enough money to pay all the pensions they promise.
 Since the federal pension rules permit all companies to do the same type of calculations United did, there are fears that many companies may have weak pension plans. The true condition of the plans would not be apparent because the companies are generating enough cash to pay all their immediate obligations. Only if they declared bankruptcy, as United has, would the hidden insolvencies become apparent.
 Mr. Zion set out to learn how much cash companies would have to put into their pension plans right away if the Bush administration's proposal were law. 
 The pension numbers in corporate financial statements, calculated according to rules issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, are often criticized as opaque and misleading. But Mr. Zion found that even in that thicket of numbers, he could find a few that would serve as meaningful proxies for the ones the administration wants companies to base their pension contributions on. The useful numbers were in the footnotes, he said.
 Currently, companies base their pension contributions on an entirely different set of numbers, calculated according to rules in the Internal Revenue Code and kept on file at the Labor Department. These are the rules that Congress and the Bush administration plan to amend. The calculations for the financial statements would be unchanged. 
 Mr. Zion said the numbers he selected from the footnotes were useful because they were not ''smoothed'' -- that is, they were not revised by the companies' actuarial consultants to eliminate volatility. Smoothing is a widely established practice that companies prize because it keeps activity in the pension fund from showing up suddenly in financial statements. At the moment, smoothing is coming under fire, however, because it can distort a pension fund's appearance and sometimes make corporate profits look greater or less than they really are.
 Once he found unsmoothed numbers, Mr. Zion was able to determine whether each pension fund had enough on hand to make good on the value of the benefits the workers and retirees had earned so far. He was also able to apply the rules the Bush administration has proposed for calculating contributions on that basis. He assumed that companies would be required to use cash. 
 Mr. Zion said it was impossible to calculate the effect of one important feature of the administration proposal: the extra pension contributions companies would have to pay if the three major ratings agencies had cut their creditworthiness to less than investment grade. Currently, all companies base their pension contributions on the same calculations. So, if Congress enacted the full administration proposal, companies like Georgia-Pacific, Maytag, and the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, would have to pay even larger contributions than Mr. Zion's study showed.
 G.M., whose credit was recently cut to less than investment grade by two of the three main bond rating agencies, would be narrowly spared. 
 Because of the way companies report their data, Mr. Zion also had to apply the administration's proposal to companies' pension obligations to their foreign workers who are not covered by the pension law.

HEADLINE: One Nation, With Niches For All

BYLINE: By STACY SCHIFF. 
Stacy Schiff, the author of ''A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France, and the Birth of America'' and a Pulitzer Prize winner, is a guest columnist for two weeks.; E-mail: schiff@nytimes.com; Maureen Dowd is on book leave.

 BODY:
E.B. White claimed he knew his wife was the girl for him when she referred to dental floss as ''tooth twine.'' I take his point. I also tried to buy ''tooth twine'' recently. By any name, that is an exercise in frustration, or affluence-induced A.D.D., or option overload. If there is plain old standard issue dental floss out there, it is on the shelf with the all-purpose running shoes and the unadulterated, adjectiveless cup of coffee. 
 In taking cluster analysis and its classifications to the logical extreme, are we not building a superfinicky society? Five minutes in any Starbucks line will answer that one. We used to be one nation, undivided, under three networks, three car companies and two brands of toothpaste for all. Today we are the mass niche nation. This is a country in which 40 percent of the eligible population doesn't vote, but can be expected to maneuver its way through a sprawl of options every time it heads out for tooth twine. Increasingly the brick-and-mortar world resembles the virtual one: an infinite landscape of microscopic subcategories, in which one loses oneself, twice. 
 A friend in Seattle -- I'll call him Mitch, because that is his name -- reports a full-scale identity crisis in the toothpaste aisle. There he stood, two coupons in hand. Was he ready to become a rejuvenating-effects, tartar-protection kind of guy, or was he wed to the fight against tobacco stains? And to think it all used to boil down to squeezing from the bottom.
 The transformative power is dizzying. The pressure is on; the paralysis sets in. It's like a torture session with a demonic optometrist. If A is better than B, and 2 is better than 3, is A better than 2? How to choose among tartar-control and whitening and breath-enhancing? And moreover -- this is America -- why should we have to? I want it all. Darwinistically speaking, shouldn't ''whitening'' have automatically ceded to ''extra whitening'' anyway? 
 As an American Dental Association spokesman, Dr. Richard Price, admits, the proliferation is out of control. ''You should not need a Ph.D. to go through a dental aisle,'' he says. He points to a healthy economy, and to the marketing wizards who realized that while cavities had no future, a multitude of other niches remained to be filled. ''If you build it they will come,'' Dr. Price says, which is precariously close to something on which P.T. Barnum once banked. There's a niche born every minute, too.
 It turns out that there are some good excuses for the toothpaste aisle, an aging population and the advent of the electric toothbrush among them. It's also true that E.B. White's pharmacy was not supersized. The options have expanded to fit longer shelves, fatter wallets, bigger homes. Both our refrigerators and our expectations are outsized. This is manifest destiny meets ''American Idol.'' The only thing that has not expanded proportionately is my brain capacity. 
 Hasn't Procter & Gamble heard about the dumbing down of America? To say nothing of the fact that we have simultaneously managed to boil the political discourse down to red states vs. blue states. 
 Is there a name for what I'm experiencing? Of course there is, replies John Quelch, the Harvard Business School consumer marketing guru, who began laughing as soon as he heard the words ''toothpaste aisle.'' He was quick to diagnose ''analysis paralysis at the point of sale.'' Paco Underhill, perhaps our most diligent student of the science of shopping, terms it the ''confusion index.'' And yes, it's growing. As are the fractures among us.
 Mr. Quelch offers only one survival strategy: ''Walk on by.'' After all, he says, ''It wouldn't happen if we didn't buy it.'' The manufacturers of toothpaste are not exactly worrying about our tuning out. It's a free market. Furthermore, Mr. Quelch adds, ''it's rather difficult to compute all the sales that never happen because of analysis paralysis.''
 You can't please all of the people all of the time, but you can sell a segment of them something at least that often. The market won't rest until it has located that last stalwart who isn't budging until he hears about cough-suppressing, posture-correcting, wrinkle-reducing, memory-enhancing, antioxidant dental floss. On the other hand, when he meets someone who shares that passion, he can be certain he has found precisely the girl for him.

HEADLINE: Designing a New Taxicab (But Keeping It Yellow)

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
With all due respect to the Ford Crown Victoria, a group of architects, designers and urban planners say the classic New York City taxicab is in dire need of a makeover.
 With measured support from city officials, including the chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, a nonprofit group called the Design Trust for Public Space plans to ''define the ideal taxi and taxi system of the future.'' 
The group seeks to move well beyond basic innovations of recent decades, like air-conditioning and more legroom. It wants to reimagine the taxicab as a unique element of the urban landscape, and more than a reconfigured passenger sedan. 
 At a workshop on May 24, designers, architects, city officials and representatives of taxi owners and drivers sketched out an array of ideas.
 The taxis themselves could include sunroofs, child car seats, sliding doors, wider entrances for wheelchair users and front-passenger seats that face the rear of the car. 
 Certain curbs and lanes could be designated for the exclusive use of cabs. Taxi stands could be built outside Manhattan, along with ''convenience stations'' with amenities for drivers. 
 Even the traditional mode of hailing a cab -- hand in air, legs akimbo -- is being rethought. One idea under discussion is a system to allow hailing a taxicab with a cellphone.
 The wide-ranging ideas will be presented for the first time on Thursday afternoon at a public workshop at the Parsons School of Design, which is helping to organize the effort.
 Among the 58 participants in the ''Designing the Taxi'' work group, perhaps the only common point of agreement is a sense that the Ford Crown Victoria is boring, if functional. The workmanlike sedan makes up about 93 percent of the New York City taxicab fleet. 
 The fleet, which totals 12,760 cabs, also includes several models of minivans, of which the Toyota Siena (865 vehicles), the Honda Odyssey (127) and the Isuzu Oasis (85) are the three most common. 
 The Ford Explorer, a sport utility vehicle, accounts for 16 cabs. (The last Checker cab was retired in 1999.)
 ''In a perfect world, the taxi would be a purpose-built vehicle, designed to be a taxi, just as a post-office vehicle is designed to deliver mail,'' said Deborah Marton, the executive director of the Design Trust. 
 ''If you were to design a taxi to its Platonic essence, it would not be the Crown Victoria. It serves its purpose, but it's been pushed to the limit of its efficacy as a taxi vehicle.'' 
 Ms. Marton, who is a lawyer and a landscape architect, acknowledged that for economic reasons, any redesign of the taxi might well involve a reconfiguration of existing passenger vehicles on the market. 
 In the past, taxi-medallion owners have fiercely resisted any proposal to bring the distinctive London-style cab -- which is spacious, distinctive and far more expensive than the Crown Victoria -- to New York.
 ''Our goal here is to keep the taxi as democratic as possible,'' Ms. Marton said. ''We don't want it to become the London version of the New York taxi.'' 
 Matthew W. Daus, the chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, has given cautious support to the effort, assigning his first deputy commissioner, Andrew Salkin, to be part of the six-member steering committee that is overseeing the project.
 ''This is a good exercise to get the perspectives of consumers and passengers, and also of architects and designers who are not involved in the day-to-day business of cabs,'' Mr. Daus said in an interview. While he was not ready to endorse any specific proposal, he said of the taxi, ''It's an icon, a recognizable part of the public space.'' 
 The genesis of the new effort stretches back to a controversial Museum of Modern Art exhibition, ''The Taxi Project: Realistic Solutions for Today,'' that was open from June 17 to Sept. 6, 1976. 
 That exhibition was financed by the United States Department of Transportation, after all the major American automakers declined to participate. It drew critical acclaim but had virtually no impact on the industry.
 ''The average New York taxi is a combination of dilapidation, filth, inefficiency and acute Rube Goldbergian discomforts designed to torture, humiliate and frustrate, for a price,'' Ada Louise Huxtable, the architecture critic of The New York Times, wrote in her review. 
 Paul Goldberger, the dean of Parsons, said in an interview that he attended and vividly remembered the 1976 show.
 ''It was a wonderful and ambitious thing with some really neat vehicles that were created, but it had almost no meaning, because it was designers talking to other designers about design,'' he said. ''There was no buy-in from the taxi industry, from the American manufacturers or from the city regulators who control the taxi industry. Drivers even picketed that exhibition.'' 
 Mr. Goldberger, a former architecture critic for The Times, said his school was supporting the new effort in part because of the strong bid to include taxi owners and drivers. 
 He described the current state of cabs as ''really awful,'' adding, ''What we do is take cars, and not even particularly good cars at that, paint them yellow and put a meter in them.''
 The current effort was financed with a $25,000 grant from the Lily Auchincloss Foundation, which tries to improve the quality of life in New York City, with support from Parsons and from Deborah Berke & Partners, an architectural firm. 
 Mr. Daus, the top taxicab regulator, said he looked forward to the unveiling of the proposals and would be open to almost every idea.
 ''The color of the cabs is off limits, as far as I'm concerned,'' he said. ''There's such a history with yellow. 
 ''If you took the yellow off the cab, I don't think it would be a cab anymore.''

HEADLINE: Bail Denied to Californian in Terror Case

BYLINE: By CAROLYN MARSHALL

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, June 10 

 BODY:
A federal judge denied bail on Friday to an American man of Pakistani descent who is under investigation by federal law enforcement officials for possible terrorist connections with Al Qaeda.
 The federal magistrate judge, Peter A. Nowinski, denied release based on the possible flight risk of the man, Hamid Hayat, 22, who was arrested along with his father this week after the authorities said he lied about attending what they believed was a Pakistani training camp affiliated with Al Qaeda.
 ''The charges are very serious,'' Judge Nowinski said during a brief hearing in Federal District Court in Sacramento. ''Considering all the circumstances, there is a motive to flee and certainly the means to flee.'' 
 Mr. Hayat and his father, Umer Hayat, 47, both residents of the farming town of Lodi, about 40 miles south of Sacramento, were arrested Tuesday and charged with lying to federal investigators about a Pakistani camp that the son may have attended during a trip his father may have helped to finance. The father remains in jail.
 The F.B.I. also filed an affidavit in federal court Tuesday that said Hamid Hayat told investigators that he had been trained ''on how to kill Americans'' at the Pakistani camp. The document also indicated that Mr. Hayat received weapons training and ''photos of various high-ranking United States political figures, including President Bush, would be pasted on their targets.''
 During the hearing Friday, Mr. Hayat -- slender, bearded and wearing an orange jumpsuit and shackled at the waist -- said nothing as his lawyer argued that the defendant was neither a flight risk nor even in possession of a passport, which she said he had voluntarily turned over to the authorities.
 After the hearing, Mr. Hayat's lawyer, Wazhma Mojaddidi, said, ''Of course, I'm disappointed.'' 
 Ms. Mojaddidi said she believed her client to be innocent.
 ''I've met with my client a number of times, and I find him to be a warm, gentle kind person,'' she said. 
 She added that Mr. Hayat ''is extremely devastated'' by the charges and arrest.
 The assistant United States attorney, R. Steven Lapham, declined to answer questions except to say the defendants would go through the system at the same time unless the defense asked for separate hearings.
 Both men will appear in federal court again June 21, when their lawyers believe there will be a grand jury indictment.
 During the bail hearing, Mr. Lapham described the defendant as an unemployable man with a sixth-grade education who has strong ties to Pakistan and had traveled there five to seven times recently. He said that Mr. Hayat recently married a woman in Pakistan and that the family was building a house there, all factors that led him to argue that the defendant was a flight risk.
 ''He has no significant ties to this community and could easily return to Pakistan,'' Mr. Lapham said. He told the court that the last time Mr. Hayat was there, ''he learned to kill Americans.''
 Three other men also have been detained in connection with the case, including two imams, or religious clerics, affiliated with two Pakistani mosques in Lodi, which has a large Muslim community. The F.B.I. said it has been investigating certain members of the Muslim community there for three years, gathering evidence in connection with the case.
 The lawyer for the older Mr. Hayat, Johnny L. Griffin III, suggested after the bail hearing Friday that the government had issued trumped-up charges, noting, ''We believe they have been painted as engaging in terrorist conduct.''
 Mr. Griffin said there have been no criminal charges regarding any terrorist connections or activity.
 ''They are only charged with one thing,'' Mr. Griffin said, ''and that one thing is making a false statement to the government.''
 Since the arrests Tuesday, federal authorities have come under harsh questioning over discrepancies in the affidavit filed in court and a copy of an early version of the affidavit that was released to news organizations. The unofficial version had references to terrorist threats to local shopping centers and hospitals in Lodi. The official copy had no such information.
 Mr. Lapham said Friday that affidavits often went through several revisions before filing.
 ''An individual at the Department of Justice just made a mistake,'' he said. 
 John Cauthen, a special agent in Sacramento with the F.B.I., said the earlier affidavit was edited for accuracy and relevance. ''One would have inferred that there was a specific threat,'' he said, adding, ''that just wasn't the case.''

HEADLINE: The Circus Maximus Syndrome

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
If you love cities, this is a week to rejoice. Now that the stadium planned for New York's West Side is dead, no one can fantasize anymore about the Olympics coming to New York.
 If the city had gotten the 2012 Games, its leaders would have basked for seven years in Olympic photo opportunities, and mayors across America would have watched enviously. They would have succumbed further to what I think of as the Circus Maximus syndrome. 
 The victims of this urban-planning syndrome believe, like some Roman emperors, that a leader's prime civic responsibility is to build entertainment palaces for the masses. American mayors haven't yet built anything quite like the Circus Maximus, where a quarter of a million Romans watched chariot races, but their combined output makes it look puny.
 They've endowed downtowns with stadiums, arenas, theaters, concert halls, museums and aquariums. They imagine drawing hordes of out-of-towners to the new convention center, and when the visitors don't materialize, the mayors' solution is to build an even bigger convention center with a subsidized hotel next door.
 The mayors hire consultants to project grand economic benefits from their projects, but these dreams virtually never come true. The only realistic way to justify one of these public projects is by considering the noneconomic benefits. 
 You have to ask if the project performs a core function identified by Joel Kotkin in his new book, ''The City,'' a global history of urbanity starting with Ur. He finds that successful cities have always done three things, two of which are straightforward: protecting the lives of inhabitants and providing a congenial home for a commercial marketplace.
 The third function is the creation of ''sacred space'' that gives people a sense of identity with the city. In Ur, it was the shrine of the moon god, Nanna, a 70-foot-high ziggurat towering over the Mesopotamian plain. In Athens, it was the Parthenon. In Venice, it was the Basilica of San Marco.
 ''In New York, it's Central Park and Fifth Avenue,'' Mr. Kotkin said. ''In Chicago, it's the lakefront. In Los Angeles, it's the Hollywood sign and the sight of the hills ringing the city. It can be a signature building or a distinctive neighborhood -- something iconic that makes the city special and binds people together.''
 Given the fervor of some cities for their sports teams, you could argue that a few stadiums qualify as sacred spaces worthy of subsidy, like the Packers' home in Green Bay. While Camden Yards has been a net economic loss for Baltimore, costing the average household about $15 per year, according to economists at Johns Hopkins, most city residents would probably say that's worth paying to keep the Orioles in town.
 But does anyone think that New Yorkers will have an identity crisis if the Jets and the Olympics don't come to Manhattan's West Side? The proposed stadium would have been a generic hulk like most other new arenas and convention centers, sitting empty most of the time and preventing the surrounding area from becoming the kind of space that urbanites really revere: a neighborhood with homes and businesses and street life.
 Those neighborhoods are hurt by grand public buildings that take up valuable real estate and must be paid for with higher taxes, which drive businesses and the middle class to the suburbs. Older cities have made comebacks the past decade by getting back to that core function of protecting people's lives, but most still haven't figured out how to restore their commercial marketplaces.
 Instead, their leaders build projects whose economic benefits go to the Circus Maximus industrial complex: real estate developers, construction workers, bond traders, owners of hotels and sports teams. Aside from the thanks of these groups, politicians also get a pleasant distraction from their mundane duties.
 It's more fun to pose next to a model of a model of a new stadium than a new water main. Announcing plans for the Olympics gets better coverage than announcing plans for bridge repairs. If you want immediate gratification, there is nothing like a circus, as a moralist named Salvian observed in the fifth century. 
 By then Rome bore certain resemblances to a lot of American cities. While emperors were investing in monuments, commerce and manufacturing suffered. The population declined along with the port, the roads, the bridges and the water system, but the circuses went on. ''The Roman people,'' Salvian wrote, ''are dying and laughing.''

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Widened in April; Exports and Imports Set Records

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10 

 BODY:
The trade deficit widened in April to $57 billion as exports and imports both set records, the Commerce Department said Friday.
 The trade gap expanded 6.3 percent from $53.6 billion in March, a figure the Commerce Department lowered from a previous $55 billion.''The trade numbers are a little more moderate; the rate of deterioration is slowing,'' said Dana Johnson, chief economist with Comerica Bank in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''That's good news for the economy. It's being less of a drag.'' 
 The deficit, however, remained on track to surpass last year's record $618 billion. The gap for the first four months of the year was 22 percent wider than in the 2004 period.
 Surging oil prices helped push overall imports up 4.1 percent from March, to $163.4 billion, the largest monthly increase since November 2002. Imports from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries were a record $9.8 billion. 
 Exports rose 3 percent, to $106.4 billion, aided by increases in civilian aircraft and other capital goods. Shipments to China and Central and South America set records at $3.4 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively.
 The politically sensitive trade gap with China widened 14 percent in April, to $14.7 billion.
 Imports of clothing and textiles from China jumped 11.1 percent in April after falling more than 20 percent in March. That helped increase overall imports from China, to $18.1 billion, up 11.8 percent from March. 
 China's shipments of clothing and other textile products totaled $7.42 billion for the first four months of 2005, up 51.7 percent from the period last year. The surge -- after the end of a global quota system on Jan. 1 -- has led the Bush administration to impose emergency import curbs on some Chinese clothing products.
 A second government report showed that import prices fell 1.3 percent last month, much more steeply than expected. That suggests even less inflation pressure from trade than analysts have thought.
 It was the first decline since December, as prices for petroleum and industrial supply imports dropped sharply. Stripping out the impact of a 6.5 percent plunge in petroleum import prices, the cost for imported goods slipped 0.3 percent, the Labor Department said.

HEADLINE: Turks, Nervous About European Prospects, Turn to U.S.

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: IZMIT, Turkey, June 10 

 BODY:
Zeynel Erdem, a leading Turkish businessman, came to Izmit, a seaside industrial town, to give 400 of his prominent peers a message.
 ''Don't count on the European Union,'' he told the crowd after a chicken dinner in a hotel ballroom here. ''Look to the U.S.; they're our real friends.''
 That view is spreading in Turkey, a sprawling land of 70 million people who have yearned for decades to become a part of Europe. With the European Union in political disarray after the French and Dutch rejected a European constitution, and with opposition to Turkish membership gaining ground in Europe, many Turks are beginning to wonder whether their European dreams are worth the effort. They are reassessing instead their relationship with the United States, a relationship that has suffered since the start of the Iraq war. 
 Turkey's stated goal is still to join the European Union, but the shift in sentiment signals a deepening ambivalence toward the vaunted vision of shared sovereignty. 
 Just as French and Dutch voters expressed dismay at the increasing European-level control over their lives and worried aloud about immigrants diluting their nations, many Turks are now questioning whether their country should see its future as part of Europe. 
 Of course, few Turks have bought into the American program for reshaping the Middle East, and relations with the United States lost their pre-eminence during the Iraq war, which Turkey opposed. Turkey's focus shifted to Europe.
 But that is beginning to change. Prime Minister Recip Tayyip Erdogan's fence-mending trip to Washington this week played well here. He even won some support from Washington in ending the economic and political isolation of Turkish Cypriots. 
 In an interview at The New York Times on Friday, Mr. Erdogan demurred on the question of a shift away from Europe. ''The E.U. and the U.S. are not mutually exclusive for Turkey,'' he said.
 European Union leaders agreed in December to begin membership negotiations with Turkey on Oct. 3, and the country has done a great deal to make that happen. It has put a new penal code into effect and agreed to sign a protocol extending its customs union to all the newest members, including the Greek-dominated Republic of Cyprus, which Turkey does not recognize.
 Yet despite all that, the prospects for Turkey's membership look gloomier than ever. Turkey will have a larger population than any member country by the time it completes its membership process -- a projected 80 million -- and will probably still be far poorer. More troubling to many Europeans is that Turkish membership would create a powerful Muslim presence and push Europe's eastern borders out to Syria, Iraq and Iran.
 Some European politicians have started talking openly about offering a ''privileged partnership'' instead of full membership, something roundly rejected here. The idea, first suggested publicly three years ago by the former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, has most recently been taken up by German's Christian Democrats, whose leader, Angela Merkel, is expected to run against Chancellor Gerhard Schroder in September. Ms. Merkel's party has stated unequivocally that it will try to block Turkey's membership if it comes to power.
 Hanging in the background is the pledge last year by President Jacques Chirac of France to submit Turkish membership to a national referendum. After last month's rejection of the constitution, few believe such a referendum would pass.
 Many Turks say they are getting fed up with meeting Europe's manifold demands without some guarantee that they will become a part of Europe in the end.
 ''Europe is playing a dangerous game with Turkey,'' said Can Paker, chairman of the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation. ''It's giving a stronger hand and more motivation to people who want the status quo to prevail.''
 It is also fueling Turkish nationalist sentiment, which was stirred last month when the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Turkey must give the Kurdish separatist Abdullah Ocalan a new trial. 
 Some Turks are beginning to imagine a day when Turkey does not need Europe at all, particularly because it gets so much support from the United States.
 Turkey's economic output surged nearly 10 percent last year and is expected to grow as much as 6 percent this year. The current 10 percent inflation rate is the lowest in more than 30 years. Foreign investment from the West, slow because of Turkey's chronic corruption, has picked up. 
 Pekin Baran, a Turkish shipping tycoon, believes that negotiations with Europe will start in October, as planned, but that ''it will be a very, very nasty ride.'' Under the negotiating rules laid out in December, all 25 members have to agree on every point. That gives Cyprus or any other country hostile to Turkish membership effective veto power.
 ''The pity is that we are convinced that Turkey could have contributed to the future of Europe much more than she could reasonably have expected to get in exchange,'' said Mr. Baran, from his office overlooking the glittering Bosporus, which separates Europe from Asia, where the bulk of Turkey lies. He nonetheless maintains that Turkey should press ahead for full membership, in part because the negotiation process itself is valuable in driving political and economic changes.
 While there is still strong support for membership, polls have recorded a decline in national enthusiasm to 63 percent before the French referendum in May from more than 70 percent a year ago. 
 Hansjorg Kretschmer, the European Union's point man in Turkey, warns that without better understanding on both sides, Turkish attitudes could turn quickly. 
 ''Strong support based on ignorance is not good because it can collapse very quickly,'' he said before meeting Tuesday with representatives of nongovernmental organizations in Trabzon, on the Black Sea. ''The key element is that Turkey does its homework and completes the necessary political and other reforms. No one will say no to a Turkey which has become a liberal democracy in the European understanding.''
 Prime Minister Erdogan, in his Times interview on Friday, said he believed Turks' enthusiasm for membership in the European Union would remain high.
 ''If you look at the polls, support for the E.U. may have gone down just a little bit, but it is still at 60 percent,'' he said. ''In fact, in the last couple of weeks the situation in France and the Netherlands may have had a negative effect that brought down the numbers, but when the time arrives to begin the negotiations in the fall, I think that these numbers will start climbing up again in support of membership.'' 
 Saban Disli, deputy chairman for foreign affairs in the ruling Justice and Development Party, said Europe should not try to project a decision of 10 years from now by looking at Turkey today. ''Who knows?'' he said, ''Maybe in 10 years' time, it will be Turkey who holds a referendum to see if Turks still want to become a part of the E.U.''

HEADLINE: Selling Out on Security

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Reliable Voices for Reform'' (editorial, ''An Insecure Nation'' series, June 9):
 It's telling that an administration that won re-election by playing on the American people's fears about national security has not lifted a finger to improve the situation.
 Faced with a disastrous domestic record on the economy, the environment, education, health care and Social Security reform, and a foreign policy record that included an unnecessary war and anti-American sentiment worldwide, even from our closest traditional allies, the president distracted voters with false promises and dire warnings about Democratic weakness on defense.
 If the people who elected him are now surprised to discover that our national security is up for sale to the highest-bidding lobbyist, they shouldn't be. Why should this area of public interest be different from anything else?

HEADLINE: The Politics of Greed: No Sacrifice Needed

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Why is it not obvious to the great majority of the electorate (the disappearing middle class and the lower class, which is losing any opportunity to enter the middle class) that the Bush administration's policies are adverse to their financial interests? 
 Why do the news media not speak out clearly and often, as Paul Krugman does, and explain the disastrous financial impact of Bushonomics? 
 In the long run, it will also become obvious to Americans in the higher tax brackets that this administration's economic and tax policies don't benefit them, either.
 On both economic and moral grounds, Americans should be outraged about what is happening to our country. It is incredible that we continue to vote not only against our economic interests, but also contrary to our apparent religious convictions, as well.

HEADLINE: Poor Little Rich Country

BYLINE: By William Powers. 
William Powers is the author of ''Blue Clay People'' and a forthcoming book on Bolivia, ''A Natural Nation.''

DATELINE: Samaipata, Bolivia 

 BODY:
MY taxi is stuck behind Indian roadblocks. Three hundred farmers, many of them Quechua in colorful ponchos, just took control of the only highway near this small town in central Bolivia, right below a jaguar-shaped Inca temple. I can escape neither east to the sweltering boomtown of Santa Cruz nor west toward the windswept Andean capital, La Paz, where tens of thousands of Aymara Indians are on the march. I get through, but only after abandoning my taxi and making my way on foot. 
 For three weeks, the country has been paralyzed by blockades and protests; a few days after my experience at the roadblock, the uprising forced the president, Carlos Mesa, to resign. The protesters want to nationalize Bolivia's vast natural gas reserves, South America's second largest; BP has quintupled its estimate of Bolivia's proven reserves to 29 trillion cubic feet, worth a whopping $250 billion. The Indians are in a showdown with the International Monetary Fund and companies like British Gas, Repsol of Spain and Brazil's Petrobras that have already invested billions of dollars in exploration and extraction. 
 Many are calling the remarkable past five years in Bolivia a war against globalization. In a limited way, they're right. McDonald's closed its outlets here, unable to lure Bolivians away from their saice and saltenas. Demonstrators in bowler hats forced out Bechtel and Suez water privatizers; blocked an income tax urged by the mighty I.M.F.; and ousted President Mesa's predecessor, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozado, who spoke Spanish with a heavy American accent, over his plan to export Bolivian gas to California through Chile.
 But this is not about walling off a Wal-Mart-free utopia; it's more of a struggle over who has power here. An American Indian majority is standing up to the light-skinned, European elite and its corruption-fueled relationships with the world. 
 You might say that Bolivia has colonized itself. When the Spanish Empire closed shop here in 1825, the Europeans who stayed on didn't seem to notice -- and still don't. Even within Latin America, the region with the greatest wealth inequality in the world according to the World Bank, Bolivia is considered one of the most corrupt, per Transparency International's annual index of political dishonesty. It's also divided along a razor-sharp racial edge. 
 Highland and Amazon peoples compose almost two-thirds of Bolivia's population, the highest proportion of Indians in the hemisphere. (It's as if the United States had 160 million Apaches, Hopis and Iroquois.) And while native people are no longer forcibly sprayed with DDT for bugs and are today allowed into town squares, Bolivian apartheid -- a ''pigmentocracy of power'' -- continues. 
 I've been here for three years as an aid official, and exclusion is part of life. Indians are barred from swimming pools at some clubs, for example; they are still ''peones'' on eastern haciendas little touched by land reform. In La Paz, I was walking through the fashionable South Zone beside an Aymaran woman, Fatima, when another Bolivian viciously pushed her off the sidewalk. She wasn't shocked by the sentiment, but she was amazed that the man had been willing to touch her. Meanwhile, Bolivia's energy-rich eastern states are agitating for ''autonomy'' in a thinly disguised effort to deprive the poor Indian west of oil and gas revenues.
 What is to be done to prevent a collapse in Bolivia? The answer, of course, must begin with Bolivians themselves. Elites here must recognize that the country's dark-skinned social movements are stronger than any political party or president and will not go away. Any lasting solution must shift real power to Bolivia's poor majority. 
 We'll see a lot of political maneuvering in the coming days. Some of the roadblocks have been dismantled in the wake of Mr. Mesa's ouster and the installation of a new interim president, Eduardo Rodriguez, the former head of the Supreme Court. But sustained stability depends on movement toward more equality, not just cosmetic changes, starting with speedy national elections and a constituent assembly with the full power to rewrite the Constitution and decide who benefits from Bolivia's petroleum. 
 Solving the crisis, however, depends not just on ending exclusion, but also on how the rest of the world relates to Bolivia, South America's poorest country, particularly through economic policy. 
 The United States and the international community have a vital role. In a speech this week, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was right to acknowledge Bolivia's democratic deficit. 
 But beyond lip service we must accept that democracy means, well, letting people decide what to do with their own resources. Existing contracts with foreign oil companies were signed by corrupt Bolivian leaders, without the approval of Congress. Even if nationalizing petroleum may be a growth-zapping bad idea, we need to let Bolivians themselves decide.
 Moreover, our own ideas for this region are not always so fabulous. Bolivia was the testing ground for the I.M.F.'s ''shock therapy'' liberalization in 1985. This stringent recipe has made millions for oilmen and industrial soy farmers here (neither sector creates much employment) but has not reduced inequality; 20 years later, Bolivia's income levels are stagnant or worse, and half the population lives on less than $2 a day.
 BESIDES taking a respectful hands off, the world should contribute one vital thing toward a more democratic society that embraces Indians: debt relief to the reforming government. Bolivia's debt load has risen to 82 percent of gross domestic product, sucking up a mind-boggling 40 percent of fiscal expenditures. This is a recipe for more poverty and turmoil. 
 Meanwhile, the Indians, distrusting Mr. Rodriguez's promise to call elections and talk to proponents of nationalization, are keeping some of the roadblocks in place, a tactic that costs millions of dollars in lost commerce, hurting the Indians themselves most of all. But as one Quechua told me as he crossed his arms in front of trucks here in Samaipata, vaguely evoking Tiananmen Square: ''Our cultures have been blocked for 500 years. This is our only voice.''

HEADLINE: Searching For a Reason To Buy Google

BYLINE: By Conrad De Aenlle

 BODY:
IN this souped-up, high-tech world, everything happens faster, even forgetting.
 Usually a generation passes before investors stung in a mania make the same mistake again, but anyone looking at a chart of Google's stock price might think that its shareholders don't have that kind of time. Five years after the tech bubble came and went, the search engine operator has bounded from about $180 a share in April to nearly $300.
 So is it different this time, or are investors partying like it's 1999? 
 Its supporters point out that Google is no concept stock. Unlike pre-millennial Internet darlings, Google makes money. But parallels with the late 1990's should make investors wonder whether there is more room above today's price than below it.
 ''On a risk-reward basis, how much upside do you want to be betting on?'' asked Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at Janco Partners in Denver. His answer amounts to not much, but when it comes to Google the business, not Google the investment, he joins in the acclaim.
 The run-up in the stock reminds him of the Internet bubble. ''Where it is different and better,'' he said, ''is that Google is profitable.''
 Its earnings grow at a sensationally fast clip (they more than tripled last year) and it has very high profit margins (nearly 30 cents of each dollar of revenue last year percolated down to the bottom line).
 The California company is the dominant provider of ''paid search'' services, the key word being ''paid.'' By aligning the display of advertisements with the search criteria entered by users of its Web site, it commands premium rates. Google is also an innovator, perpetually building on its technology and brand.
 ''It's a big, open-ended growth story,'' said Jerry Jordan, a fund manager at Hellman, Jordan, a Boston money manager. He described Google as ''one of our largest positions.''
 What separates admirers of Google's stock from skeptics is its price. Based on its close of $282.50 a share, it trades at 88.3 times earnings in the most recent four quarters. But Mr. Jordan estimates that Google will earn $6 this year and $8 to $10 next year. He comes up with a multiple in the 30's, saying this justifies a forecast of $400 for the stock.
 This contrivance -- make prodigious growth estimates far enough into the future to generate a less yikes!-inducing valuation -- became popular during the bubble. Forecasts are just that, and in the case of Google they have been soaring as analysts outdo one another in unceasingly rosy hues. Mr. Jordan's estimates are not off the charts. Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley, the doyenne of Internet analysts, predicts $5.20 in earnings this year. Douglas Anmuth at Lehman Brothers forecasts $5.47, and Benjamin Schachter at UBS ups the ante further, to $5.66.
 Forecasting good fortune seems a safe bet, given Google's margins, but here is where another late 90's phenomenon makes a return engagement: investors are betting on stability -- technological, commercial, economic --in a field where change is constant. As the bubble inflated, investors grossly underestimated the ability of other companies to come along and compete with the companies they invested in. Could the same thing happen to Google?
 ''Tech-wise, barriers to entry are a lot lower than people think,'' Mr. Pyykkonen warned. If Microsoft decided to challenge Google in paid search, he said, it could ''do it now and do it bigger than anyone expected,'' eroding Google's margins.
 Then there's the bolt from the blue that can render forecasts obsolete. Users of Google's new Desktop Search service will surrender information about what's in their computers. What if a precocious high school kid hacks into the system?
 ''The privacy issue could hit'' the company, Mr. Pyykkonen said, adding that ''advertisers are aware of it'' and might not want to risk becoming associated with a perceived threat. As for the stock, he said, ''If you don't own it, I wouldn't buy it.'' He prefers Yahoo and a small paid search company called ValueClick.
 He advised shareholders to stay put, but cautioned that they could take a hit when Standard & Poor's decides -- either way -- whether to include Google in its 500-stock index. Anticipation of its inclusion accounts for much of the recent rise, he said. ''There's no new information'' to explain the stock's advance, Mr. Pyykkonen said. ''It's a classic momentum stock priced for perfection.''
 Is it a price worth paying? Sure, if it really is different this time.

HEADLINE: Odd Alliance Brings About Debt Relief

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10 

 BODY:
It took them more than five years and required the star power of Hollywood names like Brad Pitt and leading evangelicals like Pat Robertson.
 But the potent campaign built by Granola Belt charities, flamboyant rock musicians and movie celebrities, number-crunching economists, conservative and liberal religious groups -- not to mention the Dalai Lama -- finally helped persuade the world's wealthiest nations to forgive the debt of some of the world's poorest. The British and American proposal goes before the industrialized countries meeting this weekend.
 It is a story reminiscent of the global campaign to abolish land mines, only this is just the first chapter. 
 Half a dozen commissions and reports have already called for the elimination of the more than $40 billion in debt that has hobbled the world's poorest countries for decades. Experts agreed that the money would never be paid back and that simply keeping up with interest payments was forcing countries to charge fees for elementary schools and health care at the most rudimentary clinics.
 But policy makers from Washington to Berlin hesitated, torn between memories of corrupt governments that misspent and pocketed much of the aid themselves and contemporary fears that debt relief was just the opening salvo in a campaign that would require far more money than some wanted to spend.
 They were right. But in the end it did not matter. The dam broke as the campaign grew in numbers -- about 150 million people at the last count -- and in sophistication. Led by Bono, the Irish rock star, the African debt-relief campaign made enough strategic alliances, especially with conservative groups and within the Bush White House, that some success proved inevitable.
 Bono applauded Mr. Bush one minute, then chastised Paul Martin, the Canadian prime minister, for failing to pledge more money for global poverty reduction. And lately the flashy stars leading the way have adopted a political sophistication that would have been abhorred by their predecessors in the antiwar movement of the 1960's and 70's.
 In a video, which is also broadcast as an advertisement on national television, Penelope Cruz, Jamie Foxx and other celebrities join Mr. Pitt and Mr. Robertson in asking Americans to demand that the government give 1 percent of the national budget to reduce poverty.
 That works out to about $25 billion. There will be live rock concerts around the globe for the summit meeting of leaders of the Group of 8 nations, not violent protests, and sophisticated pitches for the aid.
 ''Give credit where credit is due,'' said Max Lawson, the debt expert for Oxfam, the charity that has been one of the movement's leaders. ''The Bush administration has increased its aid budget, but it has to do much, much more.''
 Neither the Bush administration nor the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, which has pushed the hardest for debt relief among the leaders of the rich industrial powers, has ceded the moral high ground to their critics. Mr. Bush said this week that poor countries trying to improve their governments ''shouldn't be burdened by mountains of debt,'' making it clear that corrupt and incompetent countries were ineligible.
 If those standards had been applied when governments granted some of the original loans, the poor nations of Africa, Latin America and Asia would not be in such a mess, according to Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist who led a United Nations-sponsored report on poverty, and helps the movement with its economic statistics.
 During the 1970's and 1980's, the United States, France and other rich Western countries lent billions of dollars to corrupt governments whose only qualification was their opposition to communism. Some of those regimes disappeared but the loans remained, many with flexible interest rates tied to the ups and downs of the global financial marketplace.
 The costs shot up and a downward spiral began. Countries had to borrow just to make their interest payments. Many of the loans from the World Bank were used to cover those interest payments but they came with conditions, often including cutting budgets. Soon children in the poorest African nations were forced to pay fees to attend public schools and families lost free coverage at rudimentary health clinics.
 When the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund began to slowly reduce the debts of some of the 18 countries now scheduled to receive full debt forgiveness, those programs were the first to be reinstated. Tanzania spent its $3 billion in debt relief to eliminate its education fees and an additional 1.6 million enrolled in its elementary schools.
 ''This is a recognition at the very minimum that the debt burden has impeded economic growth -- has strangled many of these countries -- and I would like to believe it is a recognition by the advanced industrial nations of a degree of culpability for much of the overall debt,'' said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a former chief economist at the World Bank.
 The World Bank disputes much of the criticism, especially since Paul A. Wolfowitz, its new president, has made helping Africa his top priority.
 ''We don't get kudos for helping reform courts, beginning debt relief and financial systems but we get knocked about the head for just about every negative aspect of globalization,'' said Damian Milverton, the spokesman at the World Bank.
 Rich nations are right to consider this week's negotiations to wipe out debt only the first episode in an unfolding story. This stage will last through the G-8 summit of the seven industrial nations, plus Russia, at Gleneagles, Scotland, next month.
 The second big push will be in September when the United Nations holds a global summit meeting in New York and the United States will be under special pressure.
 ''Debt is only a small part of the total needed,'' Mr. Sachs said. ''The most consequential element is development assistance and the White House isn't doing what is needed.''
 The last stop will be Hong Kong where the World Trade Organization meets in December to try to change rules to aid poor countries. ''This is a pitch for the poor we've never seen before,'' Mr. Lawson said. ''It's quite exciting and it just might work.''

HEADLINE: A Program to Fight Malaria In Africa Draws Questions

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
Though its budget for fighting malaria has risen since 1998 to $90 million from $14 million, the United States' foreign aid agency is spending 95 percent of the money on consultants and less than 5 percent on mosquito nets, drugs and insecticide spraying to fight the disease.
 The spending priorities have touched off an intense debate between the agency, the United States Agency for International Development and its critics, who include two of the Senate's most conservative Republicans. 
 The agency says it has decided to concentrate on offering technical advice while others buy goods. But critics accuse it of wasting its growing budget. 
 ''We are spending most of our money on consultants and on meetings and not on getting actual care out in the field,'' said Senator Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican who has introduced a bill to force the agency to spend half of its malaria budget on treatment. 
 The critics also accuse the agency of concealing how it spends antimalaria money. The list of contractors on its Web site has not been updated for four years, and Mr. Brownback said the agency gave him ''vague descriptions and math that doesn't add up.'' He is demanding an audit by the Government Accountability Office.
 Another senator, Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, has publicly suggested that the agency's malaria budget be given to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Geneva-based fund to which the United States has donated more than $1 billion.
 Michael Miller, the aid agency's deputy assistant administrator for global health, could not give a detailed account of its malaria spending, but he told a Senate subcommittee on May 12 that much of the agency's technical advice had been helping foreign countries qualify for grants from the Global Fund. 
 Dr. Richard Feachem, the fund's executive director, agreed that such technical advice was often useful because the group has no field officers in the 130 countries where it makes grants. But he declined to comment on how much the Agency for International Development needed to spend providing it.
 Mr. Miller said many poor countries know little about fighting malaria. Judging his agency by the goods it buys, he said, ''is like judging an army based on the number of bullets it has -- you have to have skills and training and know the battlefield.''
 The agency's spending patterns were brought to the senators' attention by Roger Bate and Benjamin Schwab, experts on third-world health at the American Enterprise Institute, and Amir Attaran, a professor of law and world health at the University of Ottawa.
 Giving advice without aid amounts to ''back-seat driving,'' Dr. Attaran said in an interview, contrasting the spending patterns on malaria to those on famine aid, for which the United States ships many tons of food.
 Some of the agency's past advice has drawn sharp criticism from other malaria experts. Three years ago, as many African nations and global health charities were asking for money for a new malaria drug, artemisinin, the agency opposed them, saying cheaper, older drugs were still useful. Last year, after the Global Fund made artemisinin the backbone of its malaria programs, the aid agency endorsed it.
 In his testimony before the subcommittee, Dr. Attaran cited an example of what he considered wastefulness: NetMark, a $65 million, seven-year program for ''social marketing'' of mosquito nets in Africa. 
 Instead of giving away goods that prevent disease, like mosquito nets, condoms or rehydrating salts, social marketers buy advertising, conduct public education campaigns and create brands, hoping to promote the goods at low prices in the commercial marketplace. The social marketers maintain that poor people value goods more when they pay for them instead of getting them free, and that small entrepreneurs can benefit from the sales.
 Critics say this means that aid goes only to the ''richest of the poor'' in cities that advertising reaches, not to rural villagers who bear the greatest malaria burden.
 NetMark is overseen by a regular contractor for the Agency for International Development, the Academy for Educational Development, a nonprofit corporation with an annual income of $225 million and 1,200 employees, most of them in Washington. 
 Mr. Miller said the NetMark program accounted for roughly 10 percent of his agency's spending for malaria, but is ''not our only net program.''
 Mary Maguire, a spokeswoman for the academy, said 15 million people in four African countries were sleeping under nets because of NetMark campaigns, though she acknowledged that 5.8 million of those nets were supplied by ''NetMark partners,'' several textile and chemical companies. ''We don't sell nets,'' she said. ''We have promotional campaigns to educate people about mosquitoes and brand malaria control. We build networks.'' 
 David McGuire, the NetMark project manager, said that the program had spent less than $30 million of the $65 million since 1999, and that 50 percent of the money was spent in Africa on advertising, local workers and matching grants to net wholesalers.
 Mr. McGuire said he had no proof that malaria deaths had gone down anywhere NetMark operated ''because we have no funding to do epidemiological research.'' But the project surveys households to see how many use bed nets and which brands they recognize, he said, ''and when we got into this in 1999, there were zero commercial insecticide-treated nets on the market in Africa, and now there are at least 15 brands in the countries where we work, and even pirate brands from China.'' 
 ''None of that would have happened without Usaid,'' he added.
 The International Red Cross, another major donor in poor countries, takes a different approach: it gives free nets directly to new and expectant mothers, because infants and pregnant women have the highest risk of dying of malaria.
 But Mr. McGuire said ''free'' nets often end up being sold by government health workers or channeled to better-off families with political connections. Also, he said, giveaways bankrupt small shop owners that sell nets. ''The winds change and funding comes and goes,'' he added. ''We wanted to make something that lasts longer than the donations.''
 Dr. Attaran said he was ''a little shocked'' to learn that NetMark did not give nets directly to people who need them. 
 ''Do we really want to spend $65 million on advertising?'' he said, suggesting that he thought it would make more sense to appeal to multinational companies ''like Coca-Cola, who do a lot of advertising in Africa,'' to ''give it to us pro bono.''
 Intensive net giveaway programs are safer than social marketing, he said. Studies show, he said, that when only a few beds in a village have insecticide-treated nets, the repelled mosquitoes simply bite other villagers.

HEADLINE: Little Bang From Bullish Comments by Fed Chairman

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said this week that the economy was on a ''reasonably firm footing'' and argued that even a decline in housing prices would not have a substantial impact on the economy.
 But the stock market did not get much of a boost when Mr. Greenspan testified before Congress on Thursday. The market's three main gauges were little changed yesterday, leaving the market with minimal gains for the week. 
 The price of crude oil did not help. Although oil for July delivery fell 2.7 percent, to $53.54 a barrel, it did not break below $50, which would have helped lift stocks.
 The week's results would have been worse without the rallies yesterday in General Motors and the Ford Motor Company after reports that the auto workers' union had agreed to negotiate with G.M. on some reductions in health benefits. 
 G.M. provided half of the gain for the week in the Dow Jones industrial average, and G.M. and Ford together accounted for almost 15 percent of the week's gain in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
 Mr. Greenspan may have managed, however, to convince some investors that the central bank will be raising interest rates longer than expected, dashing recent speculation that the Fed may stop its monetary tightening by this fall.
 Combined with his positive talk about the economy, this message appeared to be enough to send the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note back over 4 percent for the first time this month. The yield on the 10-year note rose yesterday to 4.05 percent, from 3.95 percent on Thursday. A week ago, the yield had fallen as low as 3.80 percent in intraday trading.
 The Fed chairman also seemed to have an effect on the dollar with his signal that the central bank will keep pushing its short-term interest rate benchmark higher.
 The dollar had been falling against the euro since the report last Friday of unexpectedly weak job creation in May. It rallied a little on Thursday and jumped to a nine-month high yesterday after the government reported that the trade deficit for April grew less than forecast and that exports were strong. With the euro valued at $1.2117 in afternoon trading yesterday, the dollar was up 1 percent for the week. 
 The performance of the stock market raises the question of whether Mr. Greenspan's comments, which should have been good for equities, were undermined by his worries about what he called ''imbalances'' in the American economy.
 For weeks, there has been a tug of war over the economic outlook. While investors have seemed reassured that inflation is contained, some have been arguing that growth is slowing while others have more confidence in the economy. So far, it does not appear that Mr. Greenspan has settled the argument.
 ''Greenspan came down solidly on the side of the stock market,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at Johnson Illington Advisors, adding that Mr. Greenspan's contention that the overall economy would not suffer substantially from a drop in housing prices was reassuring.
 As for the imbalances in the economy -- including an overheating housing market, near-record oil prices and a growing current account deficit -- Mr. Johnson's interpretation is that the Fed chairman is ''saying the economy can muddle through.''
 But, he said, ''the markets are not as sure as he is.'' 
 ''I don't buy everything Alan Greenspan says and investors don't either.''
 One sign that investors may need more convincing on the durability of economic growth was the decline in Intel's stock yesterday. After the market closed Thursday, Intel raised its revenue forecast for the second quarter to $9.1 billion to $9.3 billion, higher than Wall Street estimates. But in trading yesterday the stock fell 72 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $26.98. 
 Next week could be a crucial test for stocks and bonds as a flood of data gives current readings on inflation and economic growth.
 Among the indicators for May are the Producer Price Index for finished goods, the Consumer Price Index, retail sales, industrial production, housing starts and the Fed's own reading on economic activity based on anecdotal reports from around the nation. There will also be a report on the size of the current-account deficit for the first quarter.
 For the week, the S.&P. 500 inched up 2.09 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,198.11, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 8.43 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,063.00. The Dow rose 51.66 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,512.63.
 Yesterday, the S.&P. 500 slipped 2.82 points, or 0.2 percent; the Nasdaq fell 13.91 points, or 0.7 percent; and the Dow industrials rose 9.61 points, or 0.1 percent. G.M.'s stock jumped 8.5 percent, to $34.51, while Ford was up 3.1 percent, to $10.33. 
 Among the best performers for the week, in addition to G.M., were ADC Telecom, up 16.5 percent, and Navistar International, up 12.9 percent. Among the worst were Sears Holdings, down 11.1 percent, and Delta Air Lines, off 8.1 percent.
 The best-performing sectors of the S.&P. 500 were energy, up 2.4 percent, and utilities, up 1 percent. The worst performer was information technology, down 0.7 percent, followed by health care, off 0.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Starting Off By Doing Right On Options

BYLINE: By JOSEPH NOCERA

 BODY:

To: Representative Christopher Cox
From: The new guy
Re: Your first big decision

Dear Congressman Cox:
 First of all, congratulations. Being nominated to be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission is a huge honor -- and a big responsibility. You'll no doubt face some tough questions at your confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, but everybody knows you're a shoo-in. Even your political opponents talk about your intelligence, your savvy and your understanding of important policy issues that affect business.
 It is a fool's errand to predict how someone is going to perform in a new job. Just think about your predecessor, William H. Donaldson. Did President Bush expect Mr. Donaldson, who had worked most of his life on Wall Street, to be such a zealous regulator when he nominated him in December 2002? Not likely.
 You're being described as the anti-Donaldson, a pro-business California Republican who is widely expected to pare many of his initiatives. But you've said things in the past that should give comfort to the investors you will be sworn to protect, like the importance of imposing the ''toughest criminal penalties'' on those who would undermine our markets.
 Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, says that he's convinced you will set an agenda ''that is in the best interests of the American shareholder.'' I hope he's right.
 You're going to have a bushel-full of important issues to deal with right away. Companies have been complaining about the burden of complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the ethics law passed by Congress in the wake of the Enron scandal. Lightly regulated hedge funds want you to reverse the new rule that will force them to register with the S.E.C. starting next year. But the first issue you're going to face -- and one that has the potential to set the tone for your chairmanship -- is the expensing of stock options.
 As you well know, after a 20-year struggle, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting rules, finally ruled last December that stock options, which many companies use as a form of compensation, must be treated as a normal business expense. That means that an estimate of their future value must be calculated at the time the options are issued, and then put on the income statement, which of course will reduce a company's reported profits, in some cases substantially. To fail to do so is simply not honest accounting.
 MANY technology companies, which rely most heavily on options -- and fiercely oppose expensing them -- would see big hits to their bottom line. According to Pat McConnell, the accounting analyst at Bear, Stearns, earnings at Cisco Systems would have been 24 percent lower last year had it expensed options, for instance. 
 The new rule goes into effect next week. But because the S.E.C. has told companies that they don't have to start expensing options until their next fiscal year, most still have another six months to comply. (Cisco is not so lucky; because its fiscal year begins in July, it will have to do so immediately.) That means there is plenty of time for you to line up the two Republican commissioners and have the rule delayed -- or worse.
 I'm pleading with you this morning: Don't do it.
 Why am I worried about this? Let's start with your track record. To be perfectly blunt about it, you've been on the wrong side of this issue your entire Congressional career. In 1994, you were part of the shameful effort in Congress that forced F.A.S.B. and the S.E.C. to back away from an expensing rule. Last year, you were co-sponsor of a bill that would have effectively gutted options expensing. That bill failed to become law mainly because Senator Shelby refused to hold a hearing on it after it passed the House. He told his fellow senators he would fight any effort to attach it to another bill. Just a few months ago, you added your name to yet another bill sought by the technology industry, this one calling for a delay in options expensing until an economic impact statement could be completed. An economic impact statement? Please.
 The tech industry -- and you -- have long argued that stock options are critical to innovation. Talented employees work incredibly hard, for low pay, at start-ups because they know if the company succeeds, there will be a big payoff once their stock options are ''in the money.'' You once wrote that expensing stock options would ''punish businesses that offer their employees incentives to excel.'' 
 The critics of expensing argue that if options are expensed, companies will stop handing them out so freely, especially to the rank and file. Indeed, they say, it's already happening.
 Nobody likes to be accused of stifling innovation, though one wonders how companies like I.B.M. attracted and motivated talent in the days before stock options were widespread. Still that argument sidesteps a fundamental truth: stock options are an expense, and to ignore that is to deny financial reality. 
 ''It is an expense of real economic significance,'' said Robert C. Merton, the Harvard economist and Nobel laureate. ''And it is a fundamental principle that you have to value it at the time you issue it.'' Options are a form of compensation -- and every other form of compensation has to be expensed. So why should stock options be exempt? Even ''out of the money'' options have a value -- if they didn't, they wouldn't be much of a motivator, and employees wouldn't want them.
 The question of how to value them is trickier, because at the time options are granted, it is impossible to know precisely what they will be worth when they vest years later. But economists have come up with ways to take different probabilities and give them a weighted average. The most famous way is the so-called Black-Scholes formula, which options traders have used for years to value complex derivatives and other traded options. 
 Critics have long argued, however, that using Black-Scholes to value stock options would, as you once put it, ''make income statements as speculative as the restricted stock options themselves.''
 There are two answers to that objection. First, there may well be a more precise way to value stock options. I hope you spend some time as S.E.C. chairman exploring better ways to do it. Second, while Black-Scholes may not be perfect, it's not that bad. ''Making difficult estimates is something that happens in accounting all the time,'' Professor Merton said. ''Depreciation for software and plant equipment. Pension benefits. Real estate appraisals. For all kinds of accounting reasons, precise evaluation is not easy. But nobody says that therefore we shouldn't estimate it. They only say that about stock options.''
 There is a final reason you should let the expensing rule stand. If you delay the start date or tell companies they can ignore it, you will damage F.A.S.B. In doing so, you will also be harming anyone who invests in American companies.
 True, the S.E.C. has final authority on whether a F.A.S.B. standard should be followed. But the agency has almost never taken steps to overturn a rule; rather, its role has been to set the guidelines that companies must follow in meeting a new standard. F.A.S.B. is far from perfect; it's worth recalling that many of the Enron shenanigans followed the letter (though hardly the spirit) of F.A.S.B. accounting rules. But its essential mission is to make rules that reflect the economic reality of companies. To upend a rule -- even one you don't agree with -- would send a message that in your commission, political concerns have a higher priority than the integrity of accounting standards.
 This, indeed, is the principle Senator Shelby has been upholding all these years, in preventing an anti-expensing bill from becoming law. ''We shouldn't politically interfere with the work of F.A.S.B. and the S.E.C.,'' he said.
 He told me that you and he had talked a few days ago, and that he came away from that discussion confident that you weren't going to try to delay or impede the new expensing rule. ''You have to remember this,'' he said. ''When you become the chairman of the S.E.C., you have to leave a lot of your advocacy at the door.'' He added that you were too smart not to realize that.
 Senator Shelby sounds like a pretty smart guy himself. On this issue at least, you would be well served to listen to him.

HEADLINE: Court Case Gives Rare Look at Tax Shelter Clients

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
Promoters of tax shelters zealously guard the names of their wealthy clients. But in mounting an unusual court challenge against an Internal Revenue Service ruling that branded a certain tax shelter abusive and illegal, a promoter of the shelter has had to provide a rare glimpse of the investors who bought into it. 
 The list of those investors, disclosed in filings in federal court in San Francisco, reads like a who's who of rich Americans, including Edward S. Lampert, the hedge fund billionaire and chairman of Sears Holdings; Paul and Maurice Marciano, the founders and co-chairmen of the Guess clothing company; Gary C. Wendt, the former General Electric and Conseco executive; and Bill Simon Jr., who ran for governor of California in 2002. 
 The investors are clients of Presidio, a firm that sold the tax shelters to allow investors to shield billions of dollars in income and that has gone to court to defend those shelters. Presidio, which worked with the accounting firm KPMG and which maintains that the tax shelter is legal, is seeking to force the I.R.S. to disclose the internal deliberations and legal reasoning behind its decision to ban the tax shelter. 
 The I.R.S. is normally prohibited from identifying individual taxpayers, unless it sues them in federal court. But the judge in this case, Vaughn R. Walker, required Presidio to identify those who bought tax shelters from it. 
 Yesterday, Judge Walker denied Presidio's motion to depose I.R.S. officials, saying the request was not properly written, but he said the firm could refile its request, which it said it intended to do. 
 The I.R.S. and the Justice Department oppose Presidio's efforts, fearing that disclosure could provide ammunition to tax shelter promoters, as well as jeopardize major criminal investigations into the promoters, including KPMG.
 The case will be watched closely because it could affect the campaign the I.R.S. has been waging against what it calls abusive tax shelters. The I.R.S. has successfully forced law firms and others to disclose to it -- though not publicly -- the names of the wealthy investors who bought a variety of abusive shelters. The aggressive moves by the I.R.S. have enabled it to collect billions of dollars in back taxes and penalties from those who used them.
 According to calculations from other numbers in the court documents, Presidio arranged 69 partnerships for its wealthy clients, which shielded income totaling as much as $2.4 billion from taxes.
 The tax shelter in question is known informally as Son of Boss, or sales option bond strategy. It uses complex partnership structures to produce artificial losses to offset capital gains.
 The Justice Department, in court filings, calls these tax shelters ''a sham.'' The I.R.S., which has never considered the shelter valid for deductions, declared it illegal in September 2000. The agency said yesterday that more than 1,200 investors in the shelters had come forward under an unusual settlement offer and paid more than $3.7 billion in back taxes, interest and penalties.
 Presidio, a financial services and advisory firm based mainly in San Francisco and Houston, has been under scrutiny in the government's clampdown on abusive shelters. It is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Manhattan, which is also looking at the possible role of KPMG in tax shelter abuses. 
 Both KPMG and the law firm now known as Sidley Austin Brown & Wood provided legal opinions to investors blessing the tax shelters.
 Presidio has said that it is cooperating with other government investigations of its tax shelter work. It is a defendant, along with KPMG and several prominent law firms, in at least a dozen civil lawsuits filed by disgruntled tax shelter investors.
 None of those challenges have stopped Presidio from testing how the tax code's ambiguities and complexity stand up in a federal court.
 It filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the I.R.S. in October and in March after the agency told it that its role in 1999 in creating, setting up and selling these shelters to dozens of investors had put it afoul of the tax code.
 Steven Bauer, a lawyer for Presidio, said Thursday, ''We're asking a court of law to rule whether the tax results were appropriate under the law as it existed at the time. '' 
 He asserted that the shelters sold by Presidio were different from the Son of Boss shelters, in that the Presidio shelter, known as blips, ''has economic substance'' regarding the foreign currency bets that the firm made through Deutsche Bank and that produced losses for investors. The I.R.S., however, considers the two types of tax shelters essentially the same.
 The I.R.S. declined yesterday to comment on specific litigation, but said that an additional 700 investors in Son of Boss shelters chose not to settle with the agency. The I.R.S. said that the 1,200 who settled and the 700 who did not represented all known investors in Son of Boss shelters.
 Barbara M. Flom, a tax lawyer with the firm of Goldberg, Kohn, Bell, Black, Rosenbloom & Moritz in Chicago, called Presidio's lawsuit ''an unprecedented attack.'' She said she thought it was unlikely to succeed in court.
 Through the Justice Department, the I.R.S. demanded that Presidio pay more than $2.3 million in taxes it owed on its minuscule stakes in partnerships set up to help clients avoid taxes. Presidio paid a fraction of that, then sued the I.R.S., asserting that the shelters were in fact valid for tax deductions. 
 Other big-name investors who bought the tax shelters through Presidio include Lodwrick Cook, a founder of Global Crossing; Joseph P. Nacchio, the former chief executive of Qwest Communications International; David Saperstein of Los Angeles, a prominent investor in the Westwood One radio network; and J. Paul Reddam, the founder of Ditech, a mortgage lender with billboards up and down the East Coast.
 Presidio originally listed Philip F. Anschutz, the founder of Qwest Communications, as an investor in the shelter, but yesterday filed a legal document saying that he was not an investor.
 None of the individual investors are plaintiffs in the Presidio complaints. Two Presidio units, Presidio Growth and Presidio Resources, as well as the investment entities set up by Presidio for each investor, are suing the government. Some of the investors may not even know that Presidio has disclosed their names.
 Still, at least 50 of the investors named in the Presidio list participated in the I.R.S.'s settlement program, according to court papers, although the papers do not detail who did so and who instead chose to test the government's resolve.
 The I.R.S. in part defines an abusive tax shelter as any transaction whose "significant purpose" is avoidance of federal income tax. While it has intensified efforts to root out promoters of questionable tax shelters and aggressively go after the investors in them, it has also suffered some legal defeats in corporate tax shelter cases, like those against Black & Decker and General Electric. The highly complex world of tax shelters is full of arcane economic and legal reasoning that is difficult to analyze.
 Most of the investors named in the Presidio case did not return calls for comment. Mr. Reddam and Mr. Nacchio could not be located for comment.
 Mr. Simon, asked about the case, replied, ''Honestly, I don't know what you're talking about.''

HEADLINE: Worries for Workers Who Build Cars or Plan on Collecting Pensions

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
SEVERAL stalwarts of American industry -- General Motors, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines -- took it on the chin this week as they reckoned with years of poor decision making and some worrying global trends. 
 For good measure, Citigroup, the nation's biggest financial institution, reported that one of its units had become the latest company to have misplaced personal data on its customers -- 3.9 million customers, in this case -- that could be used to commit fraud.

BIG, BUT ENOUGH? -- General Motors, battling flagging sales, said it would shed 25,000 factory jobs and close some factories by the end of 2008. After the cuts, G.M. will have about 125,000 employees in North America -- 86,000 of them hourly factory workers. That is down almost 80 percent from its peak in the late 1970's, when G.M. had half of the domestic auto market. It now has 22 percent.
 The United Automobile Workers union greeted the plan coolly, saying G.M. should increase sales, not ax factories. Analysts said the plan might be too cautious because the cuts would come from attrition, not layoffs, and no faster than the company has shed jobs in recent years, without making a profit.
 G.M., which lost $1.1 billion in the first quarter, says the cost of providing health insurance to its current and former employees and their families absorbs $1,500 of the price of every car it sells.
 G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, did not say which factories he planned to shut, but speculation focused on an 86-year-old plant in Janesville, Wis., and a 57-year-old site in Doraville, Ga.

BIG AND GROWING -- Pension programs at Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines are so underfunded that the companies told a Senate hearing that they would be forced into bankruptcy if required to make the plans solvent. Airline executives were asking Congress for permission to postpone payments, a request met skeptically by senators who noted that separate pension plans for executives are often fully funded and protected from bankruptcy.
 The pension problems of the airlines are particularly acute, but hardly unique. David M. Walker, the comptroller general, offered data that suggested that many companies had misrepresented the condition of their pension funds, and were contributing inadequate sums of money as a result. The 1,100 pensions in worst shape, he said, were $353.7 billion short of what they need to meet their promises to workers.
 Congress is expected to rewrite a 30-year-old law that was enacted to protect the integrity of private pension plans. The focus would be on adopting stricter rules on financial accounting and disclosure.

CAN'T BEAT THEM? -- Worried about the ability of its notebooks to match the performance of Windows-based machines, Apple Computer said it would abandon I.B.M. microprocessors and start putting Intel chips in its signature Macintosh computers. The move is a significant shift for Apple, which could not get I.B.M. to build a faster processor that would work in a notebook. It will have little effect on I.B.M., which is focusing more on software and services.
 The challenge for Apple is to persuade software developers to adapt their programs to run on the new chips. An earlier change in chip suppliers, to I.B.M. from Motorola, coincided with a sharp drop in market share for Apple.

DATA SPILL DU JOUR -- CitiFinancial, the consumer finance unit of Citigroup, said it had become the latest company to have exposed its customers to the danger of identity theft when a box of computer tapes with private data on 3.9 million people was lost in transit to a credit reporting agency. The box of tapes, which were not encrypted, was sent on May 2 via United Parcel Service but on May 20 the credit agency said it had never arrived.
 CitiFinancial said it would send letters to all clients whose data was lost, warning them that thieves could use their information -- including names, addresses and Social Security numbers -- to fraudulently obtain credit cards or loans. It will offer to pay for 90 days of credit-monitoring service.

FAINT PRAISE DEPARTMENT -- In testimony to Congress, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the economy was on ''reasonably firm footing,'' but warned of many things to worry about. These included home prices that have reached ''unsustainable levels'' in some areas, anemic household savings, sharply higher oil prices and a record trade deficit.
 Still, Mr. Greenspan said the economy continued to grow and the unemployment rate was dropping.
 He added that the Federal Reserve would continue to raise rates ''at a pace that is likely to be measured.'' So far, that has meant regular quarter-point increases. The Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is next scheduled to meet on June 29 and 30.

HEADLINE: Catholic Church's Costs Pass $1 Billion in Abuse Cases

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Sexual abuse by priests has cost the Roman Catholic Church in the United States more than $1 billion, a figure almost certain to rise by millions of dollars because of hundreds of still unsettled claims.
 Tallies by American bishops and an Associated Press review of known settlements put the price tag so far at more than $1 billion.
 The money was used by dioceses to pay settlements with victims, legal fees, counseling and other expenses since 1950, The A.P. found. 
 At least $378 million has been spent in just the past three years, when the crisis erupted in the Boston archdiocese and spread nationwide. 
 The Rev. Thomas Doyle, who left a promising career with the church to help represent victims, warned the bishops in 1985 that abuse costs could eventually exceed $1 billion.
 ''Nobody believed us,'' said Father Doyle, a canon lawyer. ''I remember one archbishop telling me, 'My feeling about this, Tom, is no one's ever going to sue the Catholic Church.'''
 Asked about the dollar amount, a spokesman for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Monsignor Francis Maniscalco, said church leaders believed the payouts ''should be just to all sides.'' He said that victims deserved compensation, but that the church also must have enough money to continue serving parishioners.
 The bishops are set to meet in Chicago this week to review a plan for protecting children.
 The exact financial effect on the church is hard to determine because each diocese owns property separately and settles cases on its own. Insurance policies cover some costs, but policies differ from diocese to diocese. And in many places, the coverage has run out.
 Many dioceses already had financial problems because of rising labor costs, maintenance for old churches and other expenses, said Charles Zech, an economics professor at Villanova University who studies church finances.
 The church, however, avoided a feared widespread boycott by donors, Dr. Zech said. The number of donors has fallen in the past few years, but the amount contributed over all has held steady, he said.
 Still, some of the damage is plainly visible.
 The Boston archdiocese and several others have agreed to sell property to cover their multimillion-dollar settlements. Three dioceses -- Portland, Ore.; Tucson; and Spokane, Wash. -- have filed for bankruptcy, and more are expected to follow.
 The billion-dollar cost does not come close to other major legal settlements in recent years. The tobacco industry, for example, has agreed to hundreds of billions of dollars in payouts.
 The A.P. calculated the total price from settlement announcements by dioceses and from reports commissioned by the nation's bishops, including a study by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice of claims from 1950 to 2002. Victims' groups say the church reports have underestimated the total.
 Among religious groups confronting abuse, the Catholic Church is the only one to release settlement figures spanning decades. But experts say the church has paid more to victims than any other denomination. Researchers commissioned by the bishops found more than 11,500 abuse claims against priests since 1950.
 There is disagreement over whether the church is being forced to pay too much for its failures. 
 Barbara Blaine, founder of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, said that most recent agreements had been reached before trial -- a sign, she said, that bishops know the true scope of the wrongdoing and are trying to minimize the cost.
 ''That the settlements could go that high shows us the seriousness of the harm and the cover-up,'' Ms. Blaine said.
 But defense lawyers say public opinion has moved so far against the church that the bishops have little choice. Several states extended the statutes of limitation for suing over the abuse; California abolished the time restriction for one year, leading to hundreds of new claims that have yet to be resolved.
 Patrick Schiltz, a lawyer who has defended many dioceses in abuse cases, agreed that bishops had a moral obligation to pay victims but said the size of the settlements was ''getting out of hand.''
 A $120 million compensation fund announced last week by the Diocese of Covington, Ky., is the biggest settlement so far. And last December, the Diocese of Orange, Calif., agreed to pay $100 million to 87 victims. 
 ''It's because of the media coverage,'' said Mr. Schiltz, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis. ''The thumb is heavily on the scale against the church.''
 Mr. Schiltz said he disagreed with Catholics who contend that many of the newer claims are fake. But he said weaker cases that once would have been thrown out of court were probably succeeding.

HEADLINE: When the Euro Is Off, Trips From U.S. Are On 

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH and ARIANE BERNARD

 BODY:
Europe-bound Americans finally have a reason to appreciate Gallic grumpiness: the resounding ''non'' that French voters delivered in the May 29 referendum on the European Union's constitution has helped shave several centimes off the value of the euro, making the Continent slightly more affordable than it was a few months ago.
 On June 1, the day Dutch voters followed the French with their own rejection of the constitution, the euro reached an eight-month low, trading at $1.2160. Still, the euro remains strong, particularly compared with five years ago, when it traded at almost an equal value to the dollar. Since then, it has gained over 40 percent. 
Though a cafe and croissant at the corner bar-tabac costs about 30 cents less now than it did in December, and a European vacation may be hundreds of dollars cheaper, few economists expect a more precipitous decline in the euro soon. Some theorize that the setback for European integration could eventually weaken the monetary union's Stability and Growth Pact, which tethers the Continent's euro-based economies together, and eventually send the euro into a sustained decline. But they say that most of the short-term damage to the currency has already been done.
 ''There's lots of noise about exchange rates, but the trend of the dollar shaping up in comparison to the euro is not new,'' said Evariste Lefeuvre, an economist at Ixis CIB. He said that while the rejection in the referendum has helped a bit, the euro's slip against the dollar this year has more to do with European economic weakness and rising U.S. interest rates than it does with uncertainty over Europe's political future. 
 Jean-Claude Lesourd, president of the Paris Tourism Office, said vacationers have already started responding to the euro's slide, which began in late December. ''It is too early to know if this drop in the euro is going to continue,'' he said, ''but the tourists from outside the euro zone, which is to say the U.S., Japan, Asia-Australia, who had deserted us over the past few years, have been coming back since the first quarter.'' Tourist arrivals from the United States were up nearly 18 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period of 2004. CRAIG S. SMITH and ARIANE BERNARD

HEADLINE: Interhostel, a Program for Seniors, Ended After 25 Years 

BYLINE: By FAYE RAPOPORT

 BODY:
The University of New Hampshire decided unexpectedly last month to discontinue running Interhostel, a popular educational travel program for people over 50 and families, according to university officials. Interhostel has arranged group trips since 1980. 
The university will also drop its family programs offered through Familyhostel.
 Bruce Mallory, provost and executive vice president at the university, said bookings plummeted for at least a year after Sept. 11, affecting the financial stability of the program. ''We tried to sustain it for as long as we could until it turned the corner,'' Dr. Mallory said. ''This was not a happy decision, but one driven by economic and mission decisions about what's core to the university.'' He added that the program does not have a direct benefit to students and faculty.
Interhostel trips booked through November 2005 will run as planned, according to Jennifer Robertson, Interhostel's assistant director. Anyone who registered for a nonconfirmed trip after that date will receive a full refund.
 Interhostel has served 25,000 travelers over the years, with up to 150 trips a year in about 20 countries, Ms. Robertson said. Its goal was to continue educational opportunities for older adults through travel, and to promote cross-cultural awareness. 
 One alternative for seniors seeking educational travel is the nonprofit travel organization Elderhostel (www.elderhostel.org), not related to the Interhostel or Familyhostel programs, which offers programs for those 55 and over. James Moses, Elderhostel's president, said that about 8,000 domestic and international programs were planned this year, with an average of 35 participants.
 Also available through Elderhostel is a new Road Scholar program (www.roadscholar.org) for younger travelers (ages 21 and over). FAYE RAPOPORT

HEADLINE: A Success Story That's Hard to Duplicate

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON

 BODY:
The case of a welfare mother of six pulling herself into the ranks of the middle class is rare enough to compel experts on class and poverty to zero in on a single question: What would it take to create more Angela Whitikers?
 ''It shows the importance of work and marriage,'' said Sara S. McLanahan, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton who specializes in family and poverty. ''She found a good man and a good job. The thinking now is, it takes both to move out of poverty.'' 
 Walter Allen, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles, whose areas of specialization include stratification and inequality, said: ''She reflects a Horatio Alger kind of American dream story. The great news is that her efforts and initiative were rewarded. She got herself credentialed. The bad news is how challenging and how difficult it is to replicate her path.''
 The reason is that upward mobility requires what sociologists describe as the twin pillars of success: human capital and social capital. Human capital is a person's education, job credentials and employability. Social capital usually means emotional support and encouragement from a reliable stakeholder in one's life, an asset commonly associated with marriage that is itself a form of wealth.
 Often, single mothers have neither, as was the case with Ms. Whitiker. In fact, as a mother with six children by five fathers -- a situation sociologists call multiple partner fertility -- she faced more obstacles than most. 
 ''The things going against this woman were phenomenal,'' Professor McLanahan said. ''Women who have children with other men are the least likely to find a mate.'' 
 In the current political climate, conservatives extol marriage as the solution to many of society's ills, while liberals argue that it alone cannot compensate for the effects of imperiled neighborhoods and failing schools. In fact, the research suggests that marriage may indeed be crucial to mobility out of poverty, but that it is not always enough.
 Of the small number of poor single mothers who marry, 56 percent are lifted out of poverty, according to a 2002 study conducted by Signe-Mary McKernan and Caroline Ratcliffe for the Urban Institute. Getting a job is more common, and 39 percent of poor people who are hired rise out of poverty, as against 35 percent who get at least a two-year college degree. 
 Because of high rates of joblessness and incarceration among black men, marriage is not a viable option for many poor single mothers. Only 1.4 percent of them marry in any given year, the Urban Institute study found.
 ''Why do we feel that promoting marriage will solve the problem when there are so few marriageable men?'' asked William Julius Wilson, professor of sociology and social policy at Harvard. ''We need to find ways to duplicate the kinds of support that come from an encouraging partner.'' 
 Professor Wilson says the government should increase its support for low-income women who want to go to college. ''The more education these women receive, the more money they will make,'' he said. ''They will be in different social settings and be exposed to more marriageable men.''
 ''The liberals and the conservatives are both right in a sense,'' Professor McLanahan said. ''A good relationship is part of the story. But it can't be any relationship. It can't be any man. This case underscores that it must be a healthy relationship. The liberals are wrong because they're too dismissive of marriage, even though they want it for themselves. Everyone wants a strong helping hand. This woman represents the best of both ideals.''
 Still, the ups and downs of Ms. Whitiker's middle-class existence show that the transition out of poverty is not an easy one. ''As well off as her economic situation is, her success is precarious,'' Professor Allen said. ''This is a reminder that you can be middle class but in a very unstable situation.''
 For most of the country's history, race was a fairly clear class marker -- black usually meant poor, and white middle class or better. Only in the second half of the 20th century, with the dismantling of legal barriers to opportunity, did the lines begin to blur. Still, race continues to shape the experience of being middle class, sociologists say.
 First, blacks tend to be first-generation middle class, as in Ms. Whitiker's case, which means they have fewer resources to draw upon as they navigate the middle-class world. 
 Second, there is the issue of wealth. ''Not only do blacks earn less on average than whites, but the differences in wealth and race are staggering,'' Professor Allen said. ''Their status depends on current earnings, not accumulated wealth that provides a safety net. They don't come from families that could save and acquire property or teach them how things work in society, the mores and cultural capital.
 ''These things have not been as available to blacks as to whites. It translates into whether your family could buy that $23,000 home decades ago that is now worth $2 million or $3 million. Blacks weren't allowed to buy those $23,000 homes. Blacks fall at least a rung below their white counterparts because of the wealth factor alone.''
 There are other pressures as well, Professor Wilson said. ''Whites with the same educational attainment have better schooling and are able to get better jobs,'' he said. ''Blacks are much more likely to live near poor segregated areas. They are much less insulated from crime and other manifestations of social disarray that grow from racial exclusion.''
 In the end, everyone profits when people like Angela Whitiker succeed, the experts said. ''She is an object lesson,'' Professor Allen said. ''If you want to see this kind of success, you have to provide opportunity for a highly motivated woman to recover from her past mistakes. Ultimately, society benefits. Her younger children won't be a burden on society. And the next generation will do even better.''

HEADLINE: After the Death of the Disco, Land Rover Is Ready to Rock

BYLINE: By DAN CARNEY

DATELINE: LANHAM, Md. 

 BODY:
MOVIEGOERS are sitting through repeated viewings of the final ''Star Wars'' installment, trying to fathom their hero's unfathomable transformation from Anakin Skywalker, handsome good guy, into Darth Vader, disfigured villain. At Land Rover, an equally extreme mutation has occurred in the other direction: the coarse and disagreeable Discovery has evolved into a gracefully refined new vehicle, the LR3.
 The Disco made sense mainly for hard-core off-roaders. As spry as a goat in the mountains and as hardy as a camel in the desert, it was often beastly in civilized surroundings. All the while, it treated its occupants with the delicacy of a police van, inflicting punishment even before charges were leveled or a verdict was rendered.
 And the Discovery's abysmal reliability scores -- confirmed over years of surveys by Consumer Reports and J.D. Power & Associates -- brought to mind another film. In ''The Gods Must Be Crazy,'' the protagonist struggles to counter his Land Rover's faulty parking brake as he tries to open a gate without losing his truck. 
 Any character that comes over from the Dark Side needs a new name and a new look to confirm its conversion to civility. Casting off the Discovery's armored helmet -- its functional high-box design -- the LR3 emerges as one of the sharpest-looking S.U.V.'s on or off the road. A box it remains, but it is a classier box. While it bears a distinct resemblance to the more expensive Range Rover, it is not an outright clone, lacking the gill slits in the front fenders, for instance. If the Disco dressed in khakis, the LR3 wears a pressed Armani suit. 
 The Discovery did not simply fall short in quality, it was saddled with old technology, including a V-8 engine that dated from a General Motors design of the 1960's. But Land Rover, which in 2001 found new a foster parent in Ford after a brief stay in the house of BMW, has benefited from huge investments in its engineering, design and manufacturing facilities, some of which predated World War II. Land Rover insists that the LR3's quality will reflect these improved operations.
 That remains to be seen, but I can say that the fit and finish of my test truck seemed excellent. The only flaw I noted was a persistent buzz when the stereo was cranked up.
 With so many changes, perhaps the new name was in order. But here's the thing: people who owned Discoverys liked them, and people who were unfamiliar with them didn't know much about their shortcomings. So the Disco didn't carry the strong negative associations of say, the late, unlamented Chevy Cavalier (recently replaced by a new car with a new name, the Cobalt).
 The LR3 will still carry the Discovery name elsewhere in the world. For Americans, the new designation hardly seems an improvement. Why not leave those generic, meaningless alphanumerics for robots like C-3PO and R2-D2? Give us adventurous names that evoke Luke Skywalker's X-34 landspeeder zooming over the desert.
 The LR3 will zoom, too, thanks to its 300-horsepower Jaguar-derived V-8 (which is itself related to the engines in the Lincoln LS and Ford Thunderbird) and six-speed automatic transmission. That power will cost you at the pump, though; the LR3's economy rating of 14 m.p.g. in the city, and 18 on the highway, is typical for an S.U.V. like this, but thirsty by any measure. 
 The 4.4-liter engine is enlarged slightly from its Jaguar specification, and it has special oil and water pumps designed to operate at extreme angles. The water-resistant air intake breathes through a vent in the right front fender. Ostensibly, the LR3 can ford water up to that level.
 The technical showcase of the LR3 is its Terrain Response System, an ingenious means of adapting the various electronic systems to suit driving conditions. A knob on the console lets the driver select normal highway driving; slick surfaces like snow or ice; deep mud; sand; or rock-crawling. Each selection adjusts the height of the air suspension, the operation of the locking differentials (center and rear); the traction control and the transmission's shift points. 
 If you've unexpectedly encountered a challenge in an off-road vehicle, and found yourself puzzling over whether to lock one or more differentials or make other adjustments, you will appreciate the LR3's user-friendly setup. 
 What's more, the system is idiot-proof, overriding the setting for, say, sand, if you forget to turn back the dial before pulling onto the highway.
 The air suspension contributes to the LR3's ability to be all things to all people by providing a truly comfortable highway ride while permitting good off-road performance. The only noticeable downside was the system's tendency to make embarrassing flatulent noises after parking.
 I spent a day at Land Rover's off-road course here, which offered plenty of opportunities to get into trouble -- traversing muddy ruts, climbing giant rocks and fording ponds -- but despite my best efforts I never had to use the optional winch. 
 Creeping off ledges and down rocky dropoffs offered a glimpse of a future when cars may drive themselves. The Hill Descent Control limits the LR3's speed as it descends, so I lifted my size 12 boot from the brake pedal and just drove off the ledge, trusting the LR3 to do its thing. Which it did -- applying the brakes and traction control to maintain a slow, steady crawl.
 Removing yourself from the controls as you drive off a precipice requires a leap of faith, quite literally, but this time I had the reassurance of Jim Swett, a Land Rover instructor and off-road expert who came along for the ride. Mr. Swett also provided a tip for improved traction when churning through deep mud: shake the steering wheel back and forth as quickly as possible, he said, to try to shake out some of the mud packed in the tire treads.
 Real off-road tires are self-cleaning, and they would have worked much better on the off-road course. The test model's highway-oriented tires are better suited to conquering the suburban streets that LR3's will patrol in the hands of most owners. 
 Land Rover offers its owners opportunities, for a fee, to test their vehicles and their own skills at off-road schools around the country. A big benefit of these schools is that they provide the vehicles, so you won't spend the next week cleaning muck out of your own.
 For its $53,245 sticker price (the base version is $44,995), the LR3 test car had a cabin as comfortable and attractive as the underpinnings were capable. The look is in keeping with the old-world image of British vehicles, with luxurious wood and leather trim; even the vinyl looks soft and expensive.
 A sunroof over the front seats, plus fixed skylights over the second and optional third rows, give the interior an open feel that contrasts with the cavelike sensation of many three-row vehicles.
 The LR3's independent rear suspension not only works well off-road, it permits an unexpected amount of third-row legroom. This, combined with that seat's own climate control vents, reading lights, cup holders, audio controls and headphone jacks, make the rear fairly accommodating. The second-row seats flip easily forward, supported by gas struts, for access. Everyone gets the limo treatment in the LR3.
 When in use, the third-row seat does consume most of the cargo space, so the LR3 is an either-or vehicle -- accepting either a full complement of passengers or a full load of cargo, but not both at the same time. 
 Among the nice details are third-row headrests that slide down low when not in use, making it easier to see out the rear window when backing up. For better visibility you can fold the seat entirely, which opens up the view out of the irregularly shaped rear window. 
 That window flips up while the rest of the rear folds down like a tailgate. A conventional upward-lifting hatch would be more convenient, since it could be opened with a single action rather than requiring that the window be raised first.
 I had one aggravation with the interior: the window switches are so far forward on the door that they are inconvenient even for drivers with orangutan arms. 
 There are lots of reasons to consider an LR3, though for the way most Americans drive, a vehicle with such off-road prowess amounts to extreme overkill. Face it: lots of Land Rovers are sold on image alone.
 The company's rough-and-ready reputation was cemented in the United States by decades of exposure by the Crocodile Hunter's spiritual predecessors, Marlin Perkins and Jim Fowler, on ''Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.'' Each week Americans would watch as Mr. Fowler ventured out to wrestle a wild beast, aided only by his trusty Land Rover. (Perkins always narrated the encounters from a safe distance.) 
 Hey, if the Land Rover could keep Jim out of harm's way week in and week out, it must be good.
 Even if the Disco turned out to be not so great once it was domesticated into a luxury vehicle, it cleared a path for an LR3 that looks to be more hero than villain. As fans of Star Wars know, the offspring can turn out much better than their forebears.

HEADLINE: For a Forgotten Arena, an Unexpected Star Turn 

BYLINE: By JEFF VANDAM

 BODY:
On the evening of June 13, 1935, millions of ears across the nation concentrated on the unlikely corner of 45th Street and Northern Boulevard in Long Island City, Queens. It was there that Jim Braddock, aka the Bulldog of Bergen, challenged the fearsome Max Baer for the world heavyweight boxing championship.
 The site was the Madison Square Garden Bowl, a 72,000-seat outdoor wooden arena that is featured prominently in ''Cinderella Man,'' the new film starring Russell Crowe as Braddock and Paul Giamatti as his manager, Joe Gould. Built by the owners of Madison Square Garden in 1932 as a summer stage for important bouts, the Bowl attracted big- and small-timers alike to a section of Queens rarely known for glamour. 
''It was huge, tremendous,'' Mike Silver, a New York boxing historian, said of the place. ''Instead of the Polo Grounds or Yankee Stadium, they figured they'd have an arena.''
 In the film, Braddock enters the bowl on fight night to a hush of silence from the crowd. ''God almighty,'' Gould intones as he gazes up at thousands of fans in crumpled hats. Before the action begins, a lone microphone descends dramatically from a square of blinding lights high above the ring.
 During its short lifetime, the arena was known derogatively as the Jinx Bowl, as no titleholder ever won there. ''It became known as a graveyard for champions,'' said David Margolick, author of the forthcoming book ''Beyond Glory: Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling, and a World on the Brink.''
 At the end of the 30's, the bowl was torn down, as the management found it more economical to continue renting ballparks as fight sites. In the mid-40's, the Army Postal Concentration Center occupied the site, but it, too, eventually met the wrecking ball. 
 Today, the section of Northern Boulevard where the bowl stood is home to a dauntingly large collection of car dealerships. Despite the summer heat rising fiercely from the pavement of the storage lots, the fighters who once clashed there surely produced the most sweat and tears that stretch of Queens has ever seen.

HEADLINE: When It Comes to Cash, Sooner Looks a Lot Like Later

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
THE good news for people with a stash of ready cash is that short-term interest rates have climbed to almost four times their paltry year-ago levels of less than 1 percent. 
 The bad news is that this gain has not produced all of the usual long-term benefits for savers.
 Rates on money market funds, certificates of deposit and other cashlike instruments have risen sharply. But financial history suggests that by now, long-term rates should have risen as well, allowing investors to lock in respectable, low-risk returns for a decade or more. 
 In fact, long-term rates not only have failed to rise, but they have actually declined, prompting much consternation. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has repeatedly expressed his puzzlement at this phenomenon, which he calls ''without recent precedent.''
 Normally, the yield curve -- the economist's term for the graphic spectrum of interest rates arrayed over time -- slopes upward, as investors demand higher returns for longer periods to compensate for taking on more risk. These days, however, the increase in short rates engineered by the Federal Reserve has combined with the decline in long rates to render the curve nearly flat.
 For most people, an oxymoronic flat curve means keeping your money in the most liquid forms.
 ''I don't think it makes a lot of sense for individual investors to buy longer-term bonds under most scenarios, or even intermediate-term bonds, with rates being so low,'' said Scott D. Horsburgh, president of Seger-Elvekrog Inc., a financial planner in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. ''I just don't think it's worth the risk that if long rates do rise, they get burned'' as lower-rate bonds lose value.
 Mr. Horsburgh says he thinks that one or possibly two years should be about the limit for fixed-income investments today. That view is shared by many planners and other specialists, who differ as to which short-term vehicles they like best.
 Jamie Milne, owner of Milne Financial Planning in Barre, Vt., observed that until fairly recently it didn't much matter where you did your rate shopping, ''because they were all lousy.''
 Now, however, Mr. Milne said it's worth looking around, and he is partial to time deposits at banks, which carry federal insurance. ''I'm inclined to use C.D.'s now,'' he said. Such investments now earn an average 3.34 percent for one year and 4.03 percent for five years, according to Bankrate.com.
 Other popular choices are money market mutual funds and, for some of the best deals with no restrictions, banks' online savings accounts. The highest-paying bank accounts have kept a rate advantage over the highest-yielding money market funds, but that gap has shrunk.
 That is because money funds, which, on average, regained their historical yield advantage over bank money market accounts late last summer, follow Fed actions closely. 
 ''The Fed still has more to do,'' contended Robert T. Parry, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and now a consultant. Noting that the central bank has raised its short-term interest rate target to 3 percent from a low of 1 percent, Mr. Parry said, ''I'd be very surprised if rates weren't 3 1/2 to 3 3/4 percent by year-end.''
 IF so, that means money market rates are almost certain to move higher.
 ''Even 2 1/2 percent yield still isn't really impressing investors,'' said Peter G. Crane, vice president and managing editor of iMoneyNet, a tabulator of money fund data in Westborough, Mass. But he added that a 3 percent rate for money market funds, a psychologically important round number, is on the horizon with the Fed's next policy meeting at the end of the month.
 ''With that late June Fed hike, if it does come, the very largest retail money funds -- Fidelity Cash Reserves, Vanguard Prime -- that will push them to 3 percent,'' Mr. Crane predicted. At that point, money funds would be competitive with ING Direct's Orange savings account, which he called the market bellwether, now at 3 percent, and with EmigrantDirect.com's AmericanDream savings account, now paying 3.25 percent.
 Tax-free money funds are especially attractive now, Mr. Crane added, with the most generous of them returning more than 4 1/4 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis to a top-bracket taxpayer. Yields have ''remained just tantalizingly high,'' he said, even for middle-bracket taxpayers. ''I can't understand why they haven't been knocked down,'' he said. 
 Another vehicle for those who hunger for more yield on cash reserves is ultrashort bond funds -- and on June 1, Fidelity Investments made its version less costly. In fact, it cut the expense ratio of all 12 of its taxable, investment-grade bond funds to 0.45 percent from a range of 0.50 to 0.65 percent.
 ''I think these are good, too,'' said Mr. Horsburgh of ultrashort funds, though he noted that the fees eat into returns and that investors can even lose money in them.
 ''The downside of the ultrashort bond funds is that there's no final maturity,'' he said. ''So if interest rates rise you could see a very low return'' as shrinkage of principal offsets interest income.
 A 20-page Fidelity white paper on bonds, available on its Web site, www.fidelity.com, holds that bonds have historically beaten cash -- at only modest risk for bonds of short maturities. During the 1990's, short-maturity bonds returned 7.3 percent a year, on average, Fidelity found, compared with 5.6 percent for cash equivalents.
 ''Eighty percent of the time investors were rewarded for holding short-term bonds instead of cash over a one-year period,'' according to the paper's authors, George A. Fischer and Shawn M. Verbout. This ''indicates the relatively modest increase in risk of holding a fully diversified portfolio of short-term bonds as a substitute for cash.''
 At this stage, investors with liquid reserves are indeed fortunate, as rates continue to rebound. ''Cash is almost four times as attractive as it was a year ago,'' Mr. Crane observed. When it appears that the Fed is finished with its credit tightening, he added, it would be time to nail down the prevailing levels for the longer term.
 ''But if we're in the situation where munis are yielding 3 percent and the 10-year Treasury is yielding 3 1/2 percent, then why bother locking in because the differential is just not worth the risk. You want to get paid to extend your maturities.''

HEADLINE: Shaping China's Future Power

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN. 
Roger Cohen writes the Globalist column for The International Herald Tribune.

 BODY:
THE second term of the Bush administration has been marked by an effort to repair some damage of the first by reaching out to allies, listening to them, and attempting cooperative action from Iran to Kosovo. 
 This approach has reflected the realism born in Iraq, an undertaking so costly in terms of American standing and credibility in the world that it has complicated, and may render impracticable, any further exercise of pre-emptive action in the war on terror. 
 The shift in policy, never avowed, has also reflected the arrival at the highest echelons of the State Department of officials whose convictions are internationalist, including Robert Zoellick as deputy secretary of state and Nicholas Burns as under secretary for political affairs. 
 These are people who believe, as the National Security Strategy published in September 2002 put it, that: ''There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends in Canada and Europe.'' 
 But it is less apparent that such ideas have had an impact on the Pentagon, where Donald H. Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, continues to be distinguished by a style often perceived as blunt and confrontational.
 Certainly this was the case with his criticism this month of China for spending too much on its military budget and not moving fast enough toward ''more open and representative government.'' Why, Mr. Rumsfeld asked of China, ''these continuing large and expanding arms purchases? Why these continuing robust deployments?'' 
 One answer might be that China is determined to deter Taiwan from declaring independence, an act that it has said will lead to war. But the deeper answer is that China has embarked on a long-term project of emerging by the middle of this century as a full-fledged superpower. 
 In pursuit of that ambition, it has only to look to Washington to see that one characteristic of any such power is its ability to project force. The United States accounts for upward of 45 percent of global military spending, with an annual budget fast approaching $500 billion. The number dwarfs that of any other state, including China, whose military budget is murky but thought to lie in the range of $50 billion to $90 billion. 
 Given China's size, economic dynamism and evident self-belief, it seems unlikely that it can be dissuaded from the notion that its 21st-century future involves a great-power destiny. The question then becomes: How best to shape this process in the American interest? Through knuckle-rapping in the Rumsfeld style? Or through engagement? Or, if both, in what respective doses? 
 I called Yu Xintian, a professor at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, to see what her reaction was to the Rumsfeld comments. ''China's peaceful rise is the will of the Chinese people,'' she said. ''We do not want to take a road to confront the United States. We are not the Soviet Union, and it is time that our American friends changed their cold-war mentality.'' The Chinese foreign ministry was blunter, dismissing Mr. Rumsfeld's statement as ''totally groundless'' and claiming that China did not have the ability ''to drastically increase its military buildup.'' 
 The word ''drastically'' is interesting. It suggests that China is indeed building up its military at what it views as a less-than-drastic pace. That could be construed as inevitable in a country of such ambition with such a large share of the world's population. Or, as Max Boot, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations suggested, and as Mr. Rumsfeld seems to believe, it might be viewed as a dangerous trend to be countered.
 ''There is good China-bashing and bad China-bashing,'' Mr. Boot said. ''The bad bashing centers on complaints about Chinese goods flooding our market. The fact is, their success shows a lack of competitiveness in our economy. But the Rumsfeld comments are good bashing, because China's rapid arms buildup is dangerous in a region with some of the instability of pre-1914 Europe.''
 BUT why, I asked, should the United States spend massively on arms and China refrain? 
 ''Because we guarantee the security of the world, protect our allies, keep critical sea lanes open and lead the war on terror,'' he said. ''China, by contrast, seems to be threatening an invasion of Taiwan and could ignite an arms race that takes Japan, South Korea and Taiwan nuclear.'' 
 But why should China accept the Asian status quo, with American forces guaranteeing regional security? Why should it not embrace its own Monroe Doctrine and seek dominance in its hemisphere? ''Because the Pax Americana in Asia, as in Europe, has been conducive to a half-century of growth, peace and prosperity,'' Mr. Boot said. ''Things might be different if China were democratic. But for now a line must be drawn: An attack on Taiwan is an attack on all democratic states in the region.''
 Interesting arguments -- and broadly consistent with that national security doctrine of 2002, which says: ''Our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military buildup in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the United States.''
 But the current climate, heavily influenced by Iraq, is one of global sensitivity to any trace of American bullying. France is not the only country that would not be unhappy to see a power emerge one day to equal America's might. The only such country on the horizon is China.
 In an Asia where the balance of power -- and the peace -- is fragile, Mr. Rumsfeld wanted to warn of the dangers of China's ambition. But because a lot of people are tired of being told, or feeling they are being told, what to do by the United States, it appears that speeches like his may backfire. They tend to reinforce precisely the overbearing image the State Department now seems intent on dispelling.

HEADLINE: Possible Case of Mad Cow Disease Stirs Trade Concerns

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 11 

 BODY:
The Agriculture Department said Saturday that it would conduct further tests on an animal suspected of having mad cow disease before confirming the results, which if positive would indicate the second case of the disease to be found in a cow in the United States in the past two years.
 Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns confirmed late Friday that an older animal had tested positive for the brain-wasting disease, sparking fears that foreign countries would shun American beef again, at a time Mr. Johanns is making a strong push to reassure export markets that the nation's beef is safe.
 Officials from the Agriculture Department said Saturday that a series of tests would be carried out on the cow's brain tissue at a department laboratory in Ames, Iowa, and at an internationally known facility in Weybridge, Britain, to determine if the animal is infected with mad cow disease, clinically known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The tests could take up to two weeks, Reuters reported a department spokesman saying. 
 So far, the department has revealed few details about the origin of the cow. A spokesman said Friday that the animal was first tested in November, and that initial results were inconclusive. Another test was applied, and results were negative. 
 Then the Agriculture Department's inspector general, in reviewing the department's mad cow testing program, requested that the cow, along with two other previously suspect animals, be tested again using a different technology, known as ''Western blot,'' that is used in Europe and Japan. The cow tested positive on Friday.
 Uncertainty about the same cow has caused beef prices to dip before, said Bill Bullard, chief executive of R-Calf U.S.A., a cattle group that has been critical of the department's mad cow testing program. 
 After the department announced that tests on the animal in November were inconclusive, cattle prices fell $70 per head on animals costing about $1,000, resulting in $126 million in losses to the cattle industry over a three-week period, Mr. Bullard said.
 ''This uncertainty causes volatility in the marketplace that is detrimental to U.S. cattle producers,'' Mr. Bullard said. ''We need to get to the bottom of this quickly.''
 Confirmation that the animal had mad cow would make it more difficult for Mr. Johanns to reopen the border to live cattle from Canada, which he has said is a top priority. The United States closed the border after mad cow disease was discovered in a Canadian cow in May 2003. Two additional cases were confirmed in Canada last year.
 Mr. Johanns tried to reopen the border in March to cattle younger than 30 months old. But Mr. Bullard's group won an injunction from Judge Richard F. Cebull of Federal District Court to keep it closed. A hearing on the injunction is scheduled for July 13 in federal appeals court in San Francisco, and a July 27 trial is set for Judge Cebull's courtroom in Billings, Mont.
 Mr. Bullard said the uncertainty around the latest potential mad cow case ''reinforces the need to strengthen, not relax, the current protection measures.''
 While Europe has struggled with mad cow disease, a fatal neurological ailment with no known cure, the United States and Canada have found fewer than a handful of cases. Since 1986, about 180,000 cases of the disease have been found worldwide, mostly in Europe. Last year, Britain found 343 cases and 535 cases were discovered across the rest of the world.
 The only confirmed case of mad cow in the United States -- found in December 2003 in a Washington State dairy cow that was born in Alberta -- dealt a huge blow to the nation's $90 billion beef industry. Within days of the discovery, 53 countries banned American beef. The industry has estimated it has lost more than $4 billion a year since then. About one-third of exports have resumed, but Japan, which represented nearly half of the exports, and South Korea, another top market, have continued to shun American beef.
 After the 2003 discovery, cattle prices fell by about 16 percent and consumer surveys suggested that domestic beef demand could fall by as much as 15 percent. But America's love affair with beef has prevailed thus far: prices recovered in early 2004 and demand for beef has been robust, contributing to record high prices this spring.
 Critics of the Agriculture Department's testing program have said that the department needs to strengthen its rules for cattle feed. Cattle in the United States are still being fed blood meal, poultry feces and plate waste from restaurants. And while high-risk tissues such as spinal cords are required to be removed from animals over 30 months old that are slaughtered for the human food supply, some scientists have recommended completely removing those items from the animal food chain, including from food for poultry, hogs and even pets.

HEADLINE: Finding a Surprising Welcome: A Different Face of Syria

BYLINE: By LEE SMITH

 BODY:
OPERATING just outside the ''axis of evil,'' Damascus may seem an unlikely tourist destination for Americans right now -- with the Bush administration's accusing Syria of supporting the insurgency in Iraq and the State Department's listing the country as a state sponsor of terrorism. But on a trip there in January, wandering the Christian Quarter of the Old City after a late evening out with friends, I found that my main concern was the same as it is when I am in Manhattan at 4 a.m. -- trying to find a cab home.
 The allure of Damascus shouldn't be that hard to comprehend. It is, after all, one of the cornerstones of world civilization. It was on the Damascus road that Saul became Paul and shaped the young Jewish sect that came to be known as Christianity. It was here that the mighty seventh-century Arab empire of the Umayyads made its home base and extended its control of the Middle East. Moreover, Damascus is a real travel bargain now(a meal for two at most of the city's best restaurants, including a bottle of excellent Lebanese wine, runs about $40), with outstanding shopping, terrific dining and historic sites that have determined the shape of the world, past and present. 
Maybe it is because of their country's current pariah status in the international community that ordinary Syrians seem especially eager to entertain tourists these days -- even, or especially, Americans. At one nightclub in the Old City, I spoke with a bartender who, once he found out I was from the United States, was eager to engage in a conversation about American politics. I was sure he wanted to reproach me for the United States Middle East policy. ''No, not foreign policy,'' he quickly explained. ''My cousin has a barbershop in Jersey City. How do you think the Bush administration's tax cuts are going to affect small-business men like him?'' he asked. 
 My visit began in the late afternoon with a cab ride up the mountain behind the city, Jebel Qassioun, to watch the lights come on. According to tradition, it was here that the prophet Muhammad likened Damascus to paradise. He could never have imagined the 60's-era Soviet-style architecture that dominates so much of the city today. 
 But the Old City is something else. Fortified by the ruins of a Roman citadel that has been rebuilt repeatedly throughout the ages, it is one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world. Here are most of the main historic sites of Damascus -- such as the Umayyad Mosque, one of Islamic architecture's undisputed glories, and Azem Palace, built as the residence of an 18th-century Ottoman governor. 
 Damascus is famous throughout the Middle East for its goods, and along the Old City's narrow alleys, some dating back to antiquity, you can find the best shopping. One friend who had been there before warned me about the folly of letting a shopkeeper guess what I wanted to buy. ''This will instantly triple the price,'' he said. 
 Unfortunately the advice was difficult to follow. In the Hamidiyeh Souk, next to the Umayyad Mosque, dozens of small shops and stalls sell first-rate Oriental handicrafts, pearl-inlaid woodwork, textiles (silk in particular), jewelry, gold, silver and copper metalwork, and what Western travelers to the Middle East especially prize -- rugs and carpets. Ahmad al-Nakhl, (963-11) 541-3038, specializes in Syrian rugs made in the largely Kurdish northern part of the country. The 20-something expert has a shop right behind the Umayyad Mosque, at Jeron Gate. Expect to come away with a bargain (a gorgeous handmade 60-year-old kilim in the Kurds' favored orange will run you about $100) -- and an earful from this English-speaking capitalist entrepreneur who still extols the virtues of Syrian socialism. 
 Something of a food scene is developing in the Christian Quarter of the Old City, where a free-market overhaul of the real-estate laws has allowed enterprising entrepreneurs to convert some of the area's beautiful, formerly unloved, old houses into restaurants. Syrian cuisine, with its excellent local produce and livestock, has tended to stick to Levantine basics -- meze like hummus and tabbouleh; sausages and kebabs -- but some of the newer entrants are developing an Arab-Euro fusion. 
 I walked into Al Dar, (963-11) 542-3232, near the Assieh School, at 10 p.m., and it was still humming with excitement -- couples, families, the foreign diplomatic community and the rest of the smart set. The owner, Soleiman Farkouh, was a pioneer in the neighborhood and also a longtime North American resident. It took Mr. Farkouh three years to build his multilevel palace, complete with fountain and an orange tree reaching to the roof. Al Dar's choice cuts and French sauces go well with the full selection of Lebanese wines and arak, an anise-flavored liquor that Kurds tend to drink with their meze.
 Elissar, Sharia ad-Dawamneh, (963-11) 542-4300, right off Bab Touma, is a perennial favorite of both locals and tourists. A large and cavernous edifice with a number of dining rooms, the restaurant is always crowded, so be sure to make a reservation. The much smaller, and darker, Arabesque, nearby on Sharia al-Kineesa, (963-11) 543-3999, is an excellent spot for romance.
 While all the city's major hotels serve alcohol, the bar scene in Damascus, like most predominantly Muslim cities, is fairly limited, and concentrated mostly in the Christian Quarter. Marmar, Sharia Dawamneh, (963-11) 544-6425, is very popular, but I preferred Masaya, Medhat Basha, (963-11) 541-9200, where a few young pony-tailed Syrian hipsters and their dates danced past 5 a.m. to every Carlos Santana song ever written.
 Since the Ottomans introduced the narghile, or water pipe, to the Arab world some hundreds of years ago, puffing away the hours on a pipe has been one of the favorite pastimes of men throughout the region. If you're looking for a good game of backgammon and want to catch the latest bulletin from Al Jazeera, you can find these places by the score, which, alas, are not especially comfortable for women -- foreign or Syrian. However, there are a number of cafes in the Old City -- Jupiter Cafe and Restaurant on Bab Touma Square, (963-11) 543-1110, and Galerie Abdal, Sharia Shaweesh, (963-11) 544-5794 -- where you can stop to get your bearings, drink a cup of strong coffee and then lose yourself in a haze of apple-scented smoke.

FIRST-RATE HOTELS, $1 TAXIS AND $40 MEALS

HOW TO GET THERE
 There were no direct flights between the United States and Damascus even before the White House executive order in May 2004 that imposed economic sanctions and barred aircraft owned or controlled by the Syrian government to enter or leave the United States. But all the major European carriers -- including Air France, KLM, Lufthansa and British Airways -- fly from their hubs to Damascus. 
 A visa is required for Americans entering Syria. It can be obtained from the Embassy of Syria, 2215 Wyoming Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20008; (202) 232-6313, ext. 106; www.syrianembassy.us; the fee is $100.
 Check the State Department's travel Web site, travel.state.gov, for the Consular Information Sheet on Syria and updated public announcements and advisories regarding travel in the Middle East. 

HOW TO GET AROUND
 Taxis, most of them with rear-window decal portraits of the Hafez family's leading men, are omnipresent and very cheap. A ride from one end of the city to the other costs the equivalent of a dollar. Be aware that many taxis won't try to navigate the narrow streets of the Old City (and as a pedestrian forced to dive into narrow doorways, I can tell you that you'll wish that none of them did). So ask for a convenient landmark near your final destination, like the Citadel or, on the other side, Bab Touma. 

WHERE TO STAY
 One thing Damascus does not lack is luxury hotels, with a new Four Seasons scheduled to open this year or early next. 
 Right now, Le Meridien, Sharia Shoukri al-Quwatli, (963-11) 373-8730, www.damascus.lemeridien.com, with 375 rooms starting at $140 plus 11 percent tax, and the 116-room Semiramis, Sharia Shoukri al-Quwatli, (963-11) 221-3813, www.semiramis-hotel.com, with rates starting at $120 plus tax, are the major international hotels. 
 The Cham Palace, Sharia Maysaloun, (963-11) 223-2300, www.chamhotels.com, is the crown jewel of the national chain. While the rooms are small, the restaurants just passable and the bar features a Russian violin and piano duo reprising American pop from the 70's, the Cham Palace's lobby and atrium is simply extraordinary. An Oriental fantasy with plants hanging from the upper floors, and a large central fountain surrounded by plush cushioned chairs, couches and exquisitely detailed woodwork, it's also a meeting place for the city's elite, from Baath party higher-ups to famous actors. Double rooms start at $240, plus tax. 
 Damascus now also has a boutique hotel in the Old City, Beit Al Mamlouka, opposite the Bakri baths, Bab Touma, (963-11) 543 0445; www.almamlouka.com. A refurbished 17th-century villa, the hotel has eight rooms and a remodeled Damascene courtyard with fountain, orange trees and marble mosaics. Doubles start at $130; suites from $235; with breakfast.

BYLINE: By Christopher de Bellaigue. 
Christopher de Bellaigue is the author of ''In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs: A Memoir of Iran.''

 BODY:

ISTANBUL
Memories and the City.
By Orhan Pamuk.
Translated by Maureen Freely.
Illustrated. 384 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95.
 NEAR the end of ''Istanbul,'' a dissolute and errant architecture student called Orhan Pamuk sits in the family apartment with his mother -- his father is out with his mistress and his older brother, Sevket, is studying in the United States -- while she lays out with appalling precision how his passion, which is to paint, will lead him either to the bottle or to the asylum. ''Everyone knows that van Gogh and Gauguin were cracked,'' she says, and goes on: ''You'll be plagued by complexes, anxieties and resentments till the day you die.'' Seized by guilt but revolted by the bourgeois life his well-born mother has mapped out for him, Pamuk steps out into Istanbul's ''consoling streets,'' but not before experiencing a dramatic conversion. In a parting shot to his mother -- and also to the reader, for these are the book's final words -- he says: ''I don't want to be an artist. . . . I'm going to be a writer.'' 
 To judge by the spasms of self-abasement that Pamuk records here -- ''I belong to the living dead,'' he writes in a late chapter, ''I am a corpse that still breathes, a wretch condemned to walk streets and pavements that can only remind me of my filth and my defeat'' -- the old lady had a point. Pamuk is not a sunny memoirist, but neither is he a sunny novelist. In this memoir of his youth, as in the six novels he has set in the city, Istanbul bears only a fleeting resemblance to the smiling and vibrant place many Westerners know from vacationing there. Pamuk's hometown is rarely consoling; it is more often troubled and malicious, its voice muffled and its colors muted by snowfalls that happen more often in the author's imagination than in real life. ''From a very young age I suspected there was more to my world than I could see,'' Pamuk writes, and so it goes. Far from a conventional appreciation of the city's natural and architectural splendors, ''Istanbul'' tells of an invisible melancholy and the way it acts on an imaginative young man, aggrieving him but pricking his creativity. 
 As a Turk, a painter and -- eventually -- a writer, the journey Pamuk depicts in ''Istanbul'' lies between what many outsiders, in his sardonic observation, ''like to call East and West,'' but which he terms past and present. The past is represented by the Ottoman Empire, a vast many-limbed polyglot whose heart once beat in Istanbul, its dazzling capital. But the empire no longer exists, and its surviving memorials -- the imperial mansions and expanses of woodland, the marble fountains and clapboard waterside villas -- are being devoured by developers, fire and neglect. The present is the Turkish Republic, Ataturk's secular, Western-oriented, homogenizing nation state, which has its seat in a big Anatolian village. Istanbul is no longer a city of consequence, let alone a world capital. It is an insular little place sinking in its own ruins, ''so poor and confused that it can never again dream of rising to its former heights of wealth, power and culture.''
 Pamuk is himself a product of the Ataturk revolution. Born in 1952 into a quarrelsome, irreligious family, surrounded by ''positivist men who loved mathematics,'' he grew up, as he tells us, in a family-owned apartment building in the upmarket Nisantasi district, free to read Freud and Sartre and Faulkner, drink alcohol and have a love affair (beautifully evoked in Maureen Freely's fine translation) with a schoolgirl. As a young painter, he saw his city through the pictorial and written accounts left by visiting Europeans, and also through four republic-era Turkish writers who have been, ''at one point in their lives, dazzled by the brilliance of Western (and particularly French) art and literature.'' Naturally, the reader pauses to reflect on Pamuk's own debt to the West -- on the architectonic precision of his novels, on their assured leaps from Proustian introspection to a narrative sorcery that recalls Borges and Garcia Marquez. If, as Pamuk writes, ''there is no Ottoman painting that can easily accommodate our visual tastes,'' it is because ''we'' have been schooled to see things in a different, Western way. He is drawn to the 18th-century painter Antoine-Ignace Melling because Melling ''saw the city like an Istanbullu but painted it like a cleareyed Westerner.'' 
 Ka, the protagonist of ''Snow,'' Pamuk's most recent novel (and his first to be set outside Istanbul), feels a Turkish secularist's distaste for religion, but suffers too from an aching spiritual emptiness. Pamuk's achievement in ''Istanbul'' is to show the human damage done by Ataturk's revolution without succumbing to the benighted nostalgia of many Turkish Islamists. He is appalled that many secular Turks (including, presumably, Pamuk himself) must ''grapple with the most basic questions of existence -- love, compassion, religion, the meaning of life, jealousy, hatred -- in trembling confusion and painful solitude'' but he offers no solution. Mapping his own complexities, he turns to the streets of his hometown, to the ''last traces of a great culture and a great civilization that we were unfit or unprepared to inherit, in our frenzy to turn Istanbul into a pale, poor, second-class imitation of a Western city.'' One of Pamuk's qualities is his constant striving to be worthy of that inheritance; all his novels, and particularly ''My Name Is Red,'' testify to the author's self-education in the Persian and Islamic origins of Ottoman culture -- an education that had no place in the progressive curriculum of his private high school.
 For many secular Turks, that word ''imitation'' has a disagreeable resonance. Naturally, they bridle at suggestions that their pursuit of a European identity is mimicry. Pamuk is an exception, a secular Turk who has too much integrity to seek authenticity in so contrived a national mission -- which he finds exemplified in his parents' house, where the piano is untouched and the porcelain is for show and the Art Nouveau screen has nothing to hide. Again, he turns for meaning to Istanbul's decrepit outlying neighborhoods, and to the photographer Ara Guler, whose images illustrate Istanbul and who shares Pamuk's fascination with decay and snow. Above all, Pamuk identifies with his four ''lonely, melancholic'' Turkish writers, who use European tools to evoke a peculiarly Turkish sense of loss.
 ''Istanbul'' is full of byways that lead the reader into Pamuk's fiction -- sometimes with a jolting literalness. The quarrels between young Orhan and Sevket mirror the rivalry of two siblings, also called Orhan and Sevket, in ''My Name Is Red.'' In ''Istanbul,'' the young Pamuk recalls reading that Flaubert once imagined writing a novel about a Westerner and an Easterner who ''come to resemble each other, finally changing places''; this happens to be the plot of Pamuk's ''White Castle.'' But it is ''Black Book,'' the story of a quest that begins (and ends) in a family-owned apartment building in Nisantasi, that flickers most vividly across the pages of ''Istanbul.'' There is so much of Pamuk in the novel's solitary flaneur, Galip, and also in Galip's missing cousin, Jelal -- a collector, like Pamuk, of semihistorical trivia about Istanbul and forgotten curiosities of Turkish history.
 ''Istanbul'' stops when Pamuk is still a young man. A sequel would reflect subsequent changes. As Turkey puts its economic house in order and edges closer to European Union membership, parts of Istanbul are acquiring gentrified airs. Three formerly down-at-the-heels streets in Pamuk's beloved Beyoglu district were recently transformed into a sort of Disneyfied ''French Quarter,'' with security guards, chic boutiques and outside tables where rich Turks can nibble Camembert and lip-sync to the Brassens soundtrack. It would be nice to hear what Pamuk thinks of that.

HEADLINE: Finance Chiefs Cancel Debt of 18 Nations

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, June 11 

 BODY:
The world's wealthiest nations formally agreed Saturday to cancel at least $40 billion of debt owed to international agencies by the world's poorest lands, most of them in Africa. 
 After late-night talks in London, the finance ministers of the Group of 8 industrialized nations announced that the deal, long in negotiation, had been intended to avoid damaging the ability of international lenders like the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund to continue helping other poor countries. 
 ''This is a historic moment,'' said John W. Snow, the United States Treasury secretary, one of the participants. ''A real milestone has been reached.'' 
 The deal on Saturday was expected to ease the 18 poorest countries' annual debt burden by $1.5 billion. They are Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. All must take anticorruption measures. 
 Gordon Brown, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, asked at the news conference whether debt relief was also conditional on good government practices by the recipients, said part of the deal was for poor countries to use the money they saved on debt servicing for health, education or the relief of poverty.
 The agreement came after months of negotiations in which the United States had been pressing the other Group of 8 countries -- Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia -- to agree that the solution to poor countries' indebtedness was to cancel their debt burden completely rather than seek simply to ease it by taking over interest repayments.
 ''It is my hope today that this reform will conclusively end the destabilizing lend-and-forgive approach to development assistance in low-income countries,'' Mr. Snow said. In the future, he said, ''grants would be used to ensure that countries do not quickly reaccumulate unsustainable debts.'' 
 The agreement, which followed talks in Washington this week between President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, was struck less than four weeks before the Group of 8 leaders hold a summit meeting at Gleneagles, Scotland. Mr. Blair is the current chairman of the Group of 8 and has placed the relief of African poverty along with global warming at the head of an ambitious agenda.
 Advocacy groups and charities have pressed for a deal on debt relief for years and some welcomed the agreement on Saturday, saying it cleared the way for a broader announcement on combating African poverty at Gleneagles. 
 ''We want a comprehensive breakthrough on more, better development assistance as well as trade reform at Gleneagles and with debt mostly taken care of we can keep up the pressure for a large package,'' said Seth Amgott, a spokesman for a coalition of American charities and advocacy groups called ONE.
 Some other groups noted that 44 more countries were still burdened by debt to international lenders. Britain is also pressing for a doubling of international aid to Africa, but it is not clear whether that goal will be reached before the Gleneagles summit meeting.
 Significantly, a statement by the Group of 8 finance ministers did not formally exclude other initiatives to fight poverty, including a tax on airline tickets proposed by France and Germany and a British proposal to raise money for poverty relief on international financial markets. 
 Both of those ideas are opposed by the United States, but their inclusion seemed to be part of a trade-off to secure agreement on the cancellation of debt. Asked about American opposition to an aviation tax on Saturday, Mr. Snow said, ''Our position is the same.''
 Mr. Brown said Group of 8 countries had agreed to compensate the World Bank and the African Development Bank in particular for forfeiting interest payments on poor countries' debt, so those groups would have the income to make new loans to other countries. ''We could not contemplate a situation,'' he said, where debt cancellation for some poor countries was made at the expense of other poor countries.
 The United States agreed to pay up to $1.75 billion in compensation to international lenders over the next 10 years, while Britain agreed to pay up to $960 million. Other Group of 8 countries made their own, undisclosed pledges; more pledges are expected from other members of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund this year. 
 Mr. Brown said the agreement on Saturday would immediately affect some $40 billion in debt, including servicing costs. But the amount it will actually cost the Group of 8 to compensate the international lenders is $16.7 billion -- a calculation based on the payments the international lenders would have expected to receive from 18 debt countries between now and 2015, the officials said. 
 Over all, international lenders are owed some $55.6 billion, Mr. Brown said. The finance ministers said Group of 8 members would compensate the World Bank and the African Development Bank for their losses. But the International Monetary Fund would be able to use ''existing resources'' of its own to cancel the $6 billion it is owed by poor countries. Mr. Snow said this would require ''no use of gold'' -- rebutting proposals by Mr. Brown for the I.M.F. to sell or revalue gold reserves to finance debt cancellation.

HEADLINE: At These Camps, Everybody Is a Star (if Only for a Day)

BYLINE: By BARRY REHFELD

 BODY:
IN February, a week after Queen Elizabeth appointed him a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, the rock superstar Roger Daltrey bounded to the front of the stage at the House of Blues in Los Angeles and let it rip in front of a cheering crowd.
 ''I got a feeling inside,'' he sang.
 ''Can't explain,'' the guitarist Kamesh Nagarajan harmonized behind him. 
 Kamesh who? No, it wasn't the Who, the legendary band started by Mr. Daltrey and Peter Townshend that is rolling into its fifth decade. But Mr. Nagarajan, 36, a financial consultant from Rochester, was getting in some pretty good licks on his acoustical guitar alongside six other amateur rockers backing Mr. Daltrey on ''I Can't Explain,'' a 1965 hit by the Who. 
 Out of his day attire of Hickey Freeman suits and into black leather pants, lavender shirt and shades, he finished with a Townshend-style jump split in front of campers' friends and relatives. It was all part of the grand finale of the annual Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp. 
 For five days, 80 campers of varying musical talents paid $7,999 each to hang out with rock stars like Nils Lofgren, Dickey Betts, Jon Anderson and Elliot Easton, and to be coached by them for a battle of the bands. The Psychedelic Burrs, which included Mr. Nagarajan, didn't win the 10-group competition, but that didn't seem to matter.
 ''We all grow up with heroes and never get to share a moment with them,'' said Mr. Nagarajan, who has played guitar for years but never got closer to a stage than an open mike in college. ''But I got to live out my fantasy.'' 
 Fantasy camps are hardly new. The model for many of them -- ''Field of Dreams'' gatherings of baseball fans and their aging idols -- goes back more than two decades. But the camps have grown into a $1 billion industry that goes far beyond sports. The boom has been fueled by the spread of reality television, on which almost anyone can become a star, and by the interest of more celebrities in taking part. 
 Among them are the sports celebrities Wayne Gretzky, Phil Esposito, Chris Evert and Rick Barry, as well as the poker champion Howard Lederer, the jazz guitarist Gene Bertoncini and members of the United States women's national soccer team.
 ''I thought it would be great to get back on the ice again and maybe make some money,'' Mr. Esposito said of his hockey fantasy camp, held in March in Tampa, Fla. ''I missed the kibitzing. I felt like I was in the N.H.L. again. It was a lot of laughs.''
 Some camps may lack star power but offer other attractions. ''Jaws'' fantasies can be lived out at a number of places, where campers in underwater steel cages watch great white sharks feed up close. Fantasy fans can also drive race cars, and fly planes and engage in mock dogfights. 
 Fantasy camps are so popular that even those who may inspire them go to them. Joe Montana, Mario Andretti and Morgan Freeman, for example, have all zeroed in on the enemy at 12 o'clock high in prop planes with co-pilots provided by Air Combat USA, based in Fullerton, Calif. 
 ''There's a romantic notion about fighting, and famous people are just as likely to have it as anyone,'' says Jim Neubauer, a former Navy combat pilot who works for the company. He takes care of takeoffs and landings for the fighter-pilots-for-a-day, and, with his hands on an overriding set of controls that can take over if necessary, lets them fly the planes and ''shoot'' specially designed laser guns. Participants aim at light receptors on other planes; hitting the target registers electronically in the cockpit. 
 At $995 and up, the cost of the shootout is toward the low end for fantasy camps. Although a quick turn in a race car can go for $99, a four-figure bill is common for camps that last several days, and big names command big prices. Ms. Evert's camp charges $7,200 for three days in Boca Raton, Fla.; Mr. Gretzky's camp charged $9,999 for its most recent event, with five days in Los Angeles. If campers want to be like Mike -- as in Michael Jordan -- they pay $15,000 for four days in Las Vegas in August. 
 For that kind of expense, which could cover several children for a whole summer at an ordinary camp, adults are promised the stars -- and more. At the Michael Jordan Senior Flight School, campers meet a changing cast of basketball celebrities, like Charles Barkley and Bill Walton; play basketball for four days under the tutelage of N.B.A. coaches; spend time with Mr. Jordan -- perhaps for dinner or golf -- and get photographs and videos of their experiences. 
 NOT surprisingly, the camps draw from a rather narrow economic bracket. Most clients tend to be prosperous middle-aged men, typically lawyers, doctors and financial executives. (A notable exception is the women's soccer camp, where no men are allowed.) 
 ''There's a lot of disposable income,'' says Larry Marino, who started running baseball camps and has added the Gretzky, Esposito and women's soccer camps. ''There are just so many watches you can buy. A lot of men and, now, women are getting the camps as gifts from their spouses.''
 And many campers have attended more than once. John W. Rogers Jr., 47, chairman and chief executive of Ariel Capital Management, based in Chicago, went to the Jordan camp four times. Two years ago, he did what no camper had ever done: he beat Mr. Jordan in a one-on-one three-basket game. Every second was preserved on tape, including trash talk from the comedian Damon Wayans, who asked Mr. Jordan how it felt to be ''humiliated'' at his own camp. (Mr. Jordan shot only from the outside against his older, much smaller opponent.) 
 Colin Brownlie, an Ontario businessman who grew up playing hockey not far from where a young Wayne Gretzky was doing the same, had a different but just as sweet moment of glory. At the Gretzky camp, Mr. Brownlie caught him with a pass, and Mr. Gretzky hammered home the score -- then flicked the puck to Mr. Brownlie.
 ''Nice pass,'' Mr. Gretzky said. 
 As for the amateur rockers, none are about to give up their day jobs. But they will be seen by many people on television this fall. A Learning Channel program about the camp will feature highlights like the battle of the bands; it will also show Mr. Nagarajan proposing to his unsuspecting fiancee onstage, with Mr. Daltrey alongside. 
 For many people, the chance to work with a great pro is a camp's only attraction. Richie Spees, an Ottawa psychiatrist who attends jazz camps featuring Mr. Bertoncini, says the events make him a better musician. ''It's a stretch to play with him,'' he said. ''I look at it as a benchmark for me.''
 Still, there may be a time to move on. At the Jordan camp, Mr. Rogers quit a winner; he said he would not return because he found the event exhausting. And a camp director said Mr. Jordan would not be playing basketball anymore at his camp (though he once said that of his N.B.A. career, too, only to return). But it may be the members of one amateur rock group at the House of Blues who best recognize the limits of fantasies: The name they chose for their group was Viagra Falls.

 IN the past four years the United States has paid heavily for two major intelligence failures. Before the 9/11 attacks, accurate warnings of the threat posed by Al Qaeda were not acted upon. Conversely, before the invasion of Iraq, inaccurate assessments about Saddam Hussein's military capabilities were acted upon. The world would be a different place today if the earlier intelligence had been heeded and the later intelligence ignored. And thousands of Americans might still be alive. 
 Slightly fewer than 3,000 people lost their lives as a result of the 9/11 attacks, though not all were American citizens. The latest official figures put the number of American military fatalities in Iraq since the invasion at about 1,650, though not all have been caused by hostile action. Each premature death is of course a tragedy. But compare those figures with the casualties arising from another, far more disastrous intelligence failure, and you suddenly see how little the United States has suffered for its mistakes. For in this case, the dead could be counted in millions, if not tens of millions. 
 In the early hours of June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany unleashed Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. By July 9 the German forces west of Minsk had already captured more than 287,000 prisoners. By the end of August, the total number of Soviet captives stood at 872,000. Accurate death tolls are unavailable, but must have been comparably high, since the Luftwaffe bombed cities like Minsk to rubble and thought nothing of mowing down columns of refugees. By the time the German advance slowed, the Soviet Union had lost roughly half its industrial and agricultural capacity. This was one of the greatest military disasters in history. Yet the losses might have been significantly lower if accurate intelligence about Hitler's intentions had been heeded. 
 If, after the war, the Soviet Union had somehow been capable of producing an official inquiry into the catastrophe of 6/22 -- comparable in its mandate to the 9/11 commission here -- its report might have read a little like David E. Murphy's ''What Stalin Knew.'' The former chief of Soviet operations at C.I.A. headquarters, Murphy brings to his subject both knowledge of Russian history and an insider's grasp of how intelligence is gathered, analyzed and used -- or not. 
 He has, however, enjoyed much less access to classified information than did the 9/11 commission. Although able to draw on recently published collections of documents from the Soviet archives, notably the two-volume collection 1941 god (''The Year 1941''), he has enjoyed direct access to just one archive, the Russian State Military Archive. He was refused access to documents in the Central Archive of the Foreign Intelligence Service, even those that had already appeared in 1941 god. The Central Archive of the Defense Ministry declined even to answer his questions. The relaxation of official secrecy that was such a welcome feature of the presidency of Boris Yeltsin has been reversed by Yeltsin's successor, Vladimir Putin. Perhaps that is not surprising, given Putin's evident desire to revive the old myths about ''the Great Patriotic War.'' 
 Historians have long known that Soviet agents supplied highly prescient intelligence about Operation Barbarossa in the months before the German invasion. Six years ago, the Israeli scholar Gabriel Gorodetsky published ''Grand Delusion: Stalin and the German Invasion of Russia,'' an outstanding book on the subject, drawing on, among other things, hitherto neglected Balkan archives. Murphy provides additional, copious detail. 
 As early as May 1939 Stalin was sent a six-page document outlining ''The Future Plans of Aggression by Fascist Germany,'' based on a German briefing obtained by Soviet spies in Warsaw. In December 1940 the Soviet agent Rudolf von Scheliha (code-named Ariets) reported that Hitler planned to declare war on the Soviet Union in March 1941. By Feb. 28, 1941, the same agent provided a provisional launching date of May 20. This intelligence was corroborated by sources in Bucharest, Budapest, Sofia and Rome, to say nothing of the information provided by the famous spy Richard Sorge (code-named Ramsay) in Tokyo. On April 17 a Prague informant predicted a German invasion in the second half of June. The precise date and time of the invasion were revealed by a reliable source in Berlin fully three days before the Germans attacked.
 All of this Stalin ignored. Typically, he scrawled on the bottom of the Prague report: ''English provocation! Investigate!'' On May 19, Sorge predicted that 150 divisions were being readied by the Germans for an invasion of the Soviet Union. Stalin retorted with an expletive. 
 The result was that literally nothing was done to prepare for the German assault. Soviet planes were not camouflaged. Troops were not in defensive positions; indeed they were ordered not to occupy such positions, for fear of provoking the Germans. Worse, Stalin responded to the gathering storm with yet another purge of suspected threats to his own authority. In June 1941, on the eve of the tempest, around 300 senior service personnel were arrested, among them no fewer than 22 who had been awarded the highest Soviet military decoration. 
 Two things stand out in Murphy's account. The first is the extent to which the Soviet spy network in Europe continued to deliver first-rate intelligence, despite Stalin's best efforts to purge it out of existence. It was not just the British establishment the Soviets managed to penetrate; there were agents in the German economics ministry, air ministry and foreign ministry, not to mention the American Embassy in Moscow. 
 The second point is that Germany relied not on secrecy to conceal the preparations for Barbarossa but on disinformation, assuring the Soviets that their troops were being massed on the Soviet borders to keep them clear of British air raids, that dozens of German planes were violating Soviet airspace merely because their pilots were inexperienced and that talk of a German invasion plan was a cynical British smear designed to provoke a Nazi-Soviet war.
 Can Stalin, scarcely renowned for his credulity, really have believed these brazen lies? Historians have long sought better explanations for the lamentable Soviet response to the German assault. In 1990 a Soviet defector writing under the name Viktor Suvorov published ''Icebreaker,'' which claimed that Stalin had failed to anticipate the invasion because he himself was planning a pre-emptive war against Germany. Suvorov's (wholly circumstantial) evidence was the destruction of defensive assets along the Soviet western frontier in 1940 and early 1941. On this basis, Suvorov sought to portray Operation Barbarossa as a defensive measure by the Germans.
 This argument is now widely accepted in Russia. In ''Stalin's Folly,'' a new book aimed at a popular rather than a scholarly readership (at one point Marx is compared with Stephen King), the young Russian journalist Constantine Pleshakov has restated it, claiming to have new evidence in support of the theory that Stalin was bent on attack, not defense. The documents in question -- several drafts ''on the principles of the U.S.S.R.'s armed forces deployment'' from 1940 and 1941 -- also appear in 1941 god. 
 Yet there is a problem. While Stalin clearly did consider the possibility of attacking Germany, he was just as clearly in no hurry to do so. What he commissioned were sketches of a pre-emptive strategy; there was no detailed operational planning of the sort the Germans had been working on since July 1940. So why did Stalin ignore the intelligence that (in his terms) Hitler was about to pre-empt him?
 According to Gabriel Gorodetsky, Stalin was a prisoner of history. Memories of the Crimean War and of British intervention in the Russian civil war had persuaded him that the Soviet Union had more to fear from a British naval raid than from a German invasion.
 Murphy prefers to see Stalin as having been blinded by a combination of Communist dogma and Nazi guile. As a convinced Marxist, Stalin assumed that the capitalist powers, led by Britain, were more interested in the destruction of the Soviet Union than in the destruction of Nazi Germany. Any intelligence that pointed toward a German invasion of Russia must therefore be disinformation emanating from British sources, who hoped to dupe the two dictators into fighting each other. 
 As evidence for his interpretation, Murphy publishes a translation -- originally from a French source -- of a speech that Stalin may have made at a Politburo meeting on Aug. 19, 1939, supporting a nonaggression pact with Hitler. Even more intriguing, though perhaps just as likely to be fake, are the letters Hitler allegedly wrote to Stalin in December 1940 and May 1941, swearing on his ''honor as a chief of state'' that the German troops gathering on Russia's borders were destined for the British Isles, not the Ukraine. If genuine, the May letter does indeed indicate that Hitler's psychopathic mendacity trumped Stalin's pathological mistrust.
 But there was also a historical calculation in Stalin's mind. One of his favorite arguments was that Germany, having lost one two-front war in 1918, would never risk fighting another. Thus, so long as Britain was not defeated, Hitler would never invade Russia. In ''Stalin,'' his excellent new biography, Robert Service adds a further important point: Stalin may have ruled out a German invasion so late in the year as June 22, given the limited time that would remain before autumn rains turned the Russian roads into impassable bogs.
 Yet whatever Stalin was thinking -- whether he deluded himself or was deluded by Hitler -- the fact remains that he, and he alone, was to blame for the greatest military defeat in Russian history. How, then, did he get away with it? The answer is simple. By 1941 he had so ruthlessly wiped out any potential rivals to his authority that no one dared try to get rid of him. 
 Service and Pleshakov both describe the extraordinary scene on June 30, 1941, when Vyacheslav Molotov, the Soviet foreign minister, led a deputation from the Politburo to Stalin's dacha, where ''the boss'' had been skulking for nearly two days. Stalin seems to have feared that this was his comeuppance: ''Why have you come?'' he muttered. But instead of arresting him, they invited him to head a new State Committee of Defense.
 Was Stalin an unnecessary evil? The majority of Russians -- and not only those old enough to have been exposed to his cult of personality -- think not. In a poll conducted in 2003, on the 50th anniversary of his death, the Russian Center for Public Opinion found that 53 percent of Russians still regard him as a ''great'' leader. He was, a Russian pensioner told the BBC's Moscow correspondent, ''the father of the family, the person who took care of us.'' The popular view remains that Stalin brought victory on the battlefield and discipline on the home front -- a combination that many Russians look back on with nostalgia after the upheavals of the past two decades.
 If historians have failed to change such popular views, it has not been for want of trying. Like Stalin's other recent biographers -notably Robert Conquest, Dmitri Volkogonov and Edvard Radzinsky -- Robert Service paints a picture of a warped monster of a man, insatiable in his pursuit of power, ruthless in his treatment of real and imagined rivals, remorseless in his murder of millions. Service's innovation is to reveal Stalin's frailty -- above all, his capacity for miscalculation. He made no blunder costlier than that of June 1941; yet he himself got off scot-free.
 Intelligence failures, in short, can change the course of history, whether failures of espionage or failures of analysis. Had successive administrations heeded Richard A. Clarke, the World Trade Center might still stand. Had the C.I.A. discerned and frankly reported the feeble state of Iraq's defenses, Saddam might still rule in Baghdad. These are imaginable scenarios, because the consequences of these errors, though grave, have not been truly disastrous. It is much harder to conceive how World War II might have turned out if Stalin had not trusted Hitler -- or had not survived the terrible consequences of so doing.

 BODY:
Melissa Mowbray-d'Arbela is an unlikely player in the cigarette business, an incongruous figure in an industry run by Southern tobacco farmers on the production side and secretive capitalists on the retail side. You can see this in her appearance (the tailored suits, the chiseled face, the exotic appearance) and the elite resume (stints as a lawyer at Skadden Arps and as an investment banker at Lehman Brothers). You can also see it in her personal history and opinions. Born in England, raised in poverty in Australia by a mother who is half-Russian and half-Ugandan, Mowbray-d'Arbela, 38, has never smoked. In her view, no one should. And those who do should quit. Those who have failed to quit should try again. She does not take issue with the World Health Organization's projection that 500 million people now alive will eventually die from smoking-related diseases; when I first met her for breakfast late last winter in Manhattan, she actually pointed me to that very statistic. She then made an impassioned presentation about the toxins in tobacco, a display so granularly detailed and footnoted and cross-indexed that when she began to talk about the 4,000 or so chemicals (including some 60 known carcinogens) released by every burning cigarette, a tally now agreed upon by virtually all tobacco scientists, I feared she might list every one. 
 In fact, Mowbray-d'Arbela is not a tobacco executive but the head of a Hong Kong-based biotechnology company, Filligent, that has created a filter for a new type of cigarette. This cigarette, produced by an independent tobacco company at a factory in Timberlake, N.C., is expected to go on sale later this month in several states under the brand name Fact. It looks like any other cigarette, smells like any other cigarette, draws like any other cigarette. But if you were to tear apart a Fact cigarette, as I did one spring morning at the North Carolina plant, the filter would seem peculiar. Divided into two halves, the segment called the ''mouth end'' is composed of a white fibrous material, cellulose acetate, found in almost all cigarette filters. But the other half -- a plug inserted between the mouth end and the tobacco -- looks like tightly wadded crepe paper, colored teal blue. This segment, treated with a patented chemical process developed by several scientists over the past 12 years, screens out a variety of cancer-causing toxins. In several independent lab tests I obtained, Filligent's filter appeared to substantially reduce the mutagenic activity caused by cigarette smoke. Compared with a typical cigarette, those reductions (as measured per milligram of nicotine, an essential way to evaluate how many chemicals a smoker is ingesting) generally ranged between 40 and 75 percent.
 In industryspeak, Fact is what's known as a potentially reduced-exposure product, or PREP. It is by no means the only one: the big tobacco companies have been experimenting with such cigarettes for at least the past decade, only to find that their harsh taste or unconventional packaging (several use electronic devices to heat the tobacco rather than burn it) have made them nonstarters in the marketplace. Still, all of the well-known PREP's -- Omni, Eclipse, Accord, to name a few -- are examples of a new product line in its infancy. Philip Morris, which commands nearly 50 percent of the United States cigarette market, has devoted hundreds of million of dollars to researching less hazardous products. This has led those in tobacco-policy circles to conclude that it is only a matter of time before the company develops and promotes a brand that meets with wide popular acceptance. As Kenneth Warner, a public health professor at the University of Michigan and the head of the Tobacco Research Network at the school, told me recently, ''The PREP's that most of us are concerned about are the honest-to-god cigarettes, real cigarettes, that are modified to reduce specific toxins.'' A popular reduced-exposure cigarette is the kind of earthquake that many in the public health field have anticipated, like a team of worried geologists, for several years. According to a number of scientists and tobacco policy makers, PREP's are the single most ethically agonizing and professionally confusing issue they have ever encountered.
 This seems somewhat dissonant. What could be wrong with reducing the risk of smoking for the hopelessly addicted? As Mowbray-d'Arbela says, making a point that seems both pragmatic and empathetic, ''We have to do something about the one billion smokers who by 2010 either can't or won't quit.'' After talking with a number of health experts and spending time in a hospital ward, she says, she became convinced that the benefits of an improved filter outweigh the dangers.
 Those dangers are many and persistent, however. The science of tobacco is so murky, and the links between the components of smoke and illness so tenuously understood, that many researchers question whether reducing the exposure of smokers to certain chemicals can actually reduce the risk of disease. What's more, a so-called safer cigarette that removes some carcinogens might inadvertently raise the levels of other toxins, a phenomenon that has already been observed in some PREP's. Then there is a third predicament. If a new, independently produced cigarette like Fact -- or, just as likely, a product from a big tobacco company backed by enormous marketing resources -- promises to lower the odds of disease for smokers, couldn't it increase cigarette consumption? This is what most scares antitobacco policy makers. The more successfully a cigarette reduces risk, the more it might encourage smokers not to quit. Or lure ex-smokers to resume their habit. Or make kids smokers. It might, in other words, do exactly the opposite of what it is intended to do. In a worst-case scenario, it could reverse a half-century of antismoking education, policy and litigation in a flash.
Conversations about harm reduction usually begin with the example of methadone, the synthetic narcotic that is often used to wean heroin addicts from their illegal drug by replacing it with a controlled one. Methadone has gained the backing of most of the medical establishment over the past few decades not because it is easy to kick -- the drug has actually proved at least as habit-forming as heroin -- but because it has been shown to help addicts function better and lead longer and more productive lives. Moreover, it is taken orally (as opposed to intravenously), and so it has been credited with helping to reduce the spread of H.I.V.
 When it comes to tobacco, there is, of course, a drug already sold to addicts as an over-the-counter medication: nicotine. But should nicotine products, useful as they have been in helping millions of smokers to quit, be the last word on harm reduction when fewer than 10 percent of smokers who attempt to quit each year succeed? Should nicotine addicts only have a choice between using a nicotine patch, say, and quitting altogether? What if too many users are too habituated to the act of smoking itself? Would truly reducing the mortality rates associated with smoking require a less-hazardous variation on an actual cigarette?
 Mowbray-d'Arbela has spent a good amount of time wrestling with the issue. She was running a small venture-capital firm in Hong Kong when she first heard about Filligent from Neal Stewart, a tech pioneer who founded Astec, a large provider of power-supply components to the electronics and computer industries. Stewart is the kind of serial entrepreneur who tends to have several projects going at once. In early 2000, he was trying to get a call-center business going in the Philippines, and Mowbray-d'Arbela's venture firm had invested money in his project; at the same time, he and some colleagues were tinkering with a cigarette-filter technology he had had in the back of his mind -- ''a tickle,'' as Stewart puts it -- for a number of years. 
 The son of a heavy smoker, Stewart had encouraged some biochemical engineers to get involved in the filter project in the mid-1990's, and as a group they developed the basic technology a few years later, all the while making sure they acquired patent claims along the way. Stewart picked the name Filligent because he regarded the filtration system as intelligent. ''Not knowing the tobacco industry, there was no strategy in that stage in terms of what do we do with this thing,'' Stewart recalled not long ago. ''It was much more a bunch of people seeing if the chemistry would work.'' When he found out that it did -- the filter is treated with a porphyrin, an organic compound that bonds to a variety of chemicals in smoke and prevents them from reaching the smoker -- he took the idea and some lab results to Mowbray-d'Arbela to see if she would help commercialize it. It was 2001, and she immediately refused. ''He mentioned the word 'tobacco,' and I said no, I'm not doing it,'' she said. ''I'd had plenty of opportunities as an investment banker to work on tobacco deals, and I always managed to say that for ideological reasons I wouldn't.'' Stewart spent an afternoon at her home in Hong Kong and convinced her, over pots of tea, to at least think it over. Mowbray-d'Arbela took the idea to her husband, a physician-turned-investment banker, who reviewed the materials and thought the filter chemistry seemed feasible. She tentatively signed on and spent the next year teaching herself everything she could about biochemistry, cancer, smoke chemistry and the history of the tobacco industry.
 She also brought the idea for Filligent to Judith Mackay, a doctor and the senior policy adviser on tobacco to the World Health Organization, who happened to work across town. Mackay, arguably one of the most influential antitobacco policy makers in the world, has been especially effective in calling attention to the high levels of smoking and smoking-related illnesses in developing countries. ''I think we have to do harm reduction,'' Mackay told me, ''but we all know that we have to be cautious about its presentation to smokers so that we don't deceive them.'' After looking over the science behind the filter, she says, she didn't harbor much hesitation: she encouraged Mowbray-d'Arbela to pursue the project, even as she warned her to tread carefully. Mackay then invited Mowbray-d'Arbela to the 2003 World Conference on Tobacco or Health in Helsinki to see firsthand how the antitobacco lobby felt about the dangers of PREP's. One day, in a quiet corner of the lobby of a Helsinki hotel, Mackay introduced Mowbray-d'Arbela to Matthew Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, one of the leading antitobacco advocacy groups in the United States. Mowbray-d'Arbela explained her project as Myers listened thoughtfully, offering suggestions. Throughout the conference, Mowbray-d'Arbela repeated the drill. She requested confidentiality and then described the Filligent idea, usually in general terms that gave listeners the impression that she was talking about a concept rather than a product.
 There actually was a product, but even before the conference Mowbray-d'Arbela had concluded that bringing the filter to market required changes. The first problem was nicotine, which the filter was partially screening. Apart from its dangers to pregnant women, nicotine has been shown to pose few great hazards to the average user; its primary health risk comes from inducing smokers to ingest thousands of other dangerous chemicals that burning tobacco produces. Indeed, reducing nicotine and reducing harm are increasingly viewed as two contrary goals. Cigarettes that are low in the drug, for instance, marketed as ''lights'' or ''ultra lights,'' are now believed to be as deadly as their high-tar, high-nicotine predecessors, since smokers compensate for nicotine deficiency by smoking more cigarettes or taking more puffs per cigarette. ''Based on our research, we decided that we shouldn't be touching nicotine,'' Mowbray-d'Arbela says. ''So I had the guys come back and figure out a way to have the chemical compound in the filter, instead of attracting nicotine, repel it.'' That step, she says, took another year.
 In the United States, Mowbray-d'Arbela decided the easiest way to get the product in stores would be to team up with one of the independent discount-cigarette vendors that now control about 10 percent of the market. Because such vendors are sensitive to even the most modest price increases, a Filligent filter had to be cheap enough not to push up the cost of a pack of cigarettes by very much. And this focus on cost was even more important for the international market. There are 45 countries where the tobacco industry is nationalized; the biggest tobacco company in the world happens to be the Chinese government, which controls cigarette sales to an estimated 350 million smokers. (There are 50 million or so smokers in the United States.) In Judith Mackay's view, Asia would be the biggest market for any reduced-exposure filter -- a product that a government like China's could mandate be included in Chinese cigarettes, without any fanfare, as long as the price of the filter were reasonable. One of every three cigarettes smoked in the world is smoked in China, Mackay says, ''so I think if you're looking at harm reduction, the rest of the world is more important than the United States.''
 Does Mackay, who has pored over the lab data on Filligent, think the product has the potential to make a difference? ''It's exciting,'' she says. ''I think it holds a real possibility.'' But she is quick to add that she can't say for sure if it will save hundreds of thousands of lives -- or even a single life. Any reliable epidemiological studies on smokers are longitudinal in nature, meaning they can require several decades and a large group of subjects to show meaningful results. It hasn't been until the last few years, for instance, that public health officials have begun to correlate the rise in adenocarcinoma, a cancer deep in the lungs and often difficult to detect, to the introduction of the low-nicotine light and ultra-light cigarettes that became popular in the 1970's and 1980's. Smokers draw smoke from these cigarettes more deeply into their lungs in an effort to get more nicotine.
 Mackay says that it could be 20 years before anyone understands just how well, or how poorly, Filligent works. Mowbray-d'Arbela concedes that it's possible we may never understand.
It is a curiosity that most Americans know a great deal about smoking -- its lures and its dangers, the damage it can wreak on families -- while knowing very little about cigarettes. In part, this is because those who do not smoke have no interest in a product they despise. But it is also a result of how effectively the big tobacco companies have obscured what goes into their cigarettes, often giving the incorrect impression that all lights or ultra-lights are the same, or that a popular brand might actually be consistent from year to year or country to country. In fact, there are an infinite number of ways to engineer a cigarette -- by modifying the blend of tobaccos from season to season or sprinkling on chemical additives that affect taste and burn rate or lengthening a filter or changing its composition and altering the porosity of the wrapping papers so that more air mixes with the smoke. At the end of last year, the people at Filligent, working with a European paper manufacturer, figured out a way to bring the cost of their filter to within a fraction of a cent more than a typical cigarette filter -- an acceptable price point, in their view. But Filligent still had to find a company able to make and market cigarettes to which it could license its filter. An industry consultant connected them with Alex De La Cruz, who runs a Florida-based company known as the New Century Tobacco Group. New Century was about to start producing several new brands of cigarettes in Timberlake. There, a group of tobacco farmers, the Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corporation, had just bought a factory. Foreign imports and the erosion of farm quotas had frayed their traditional relationships with the big tobacco companies, so the farmers were going into business on their own. They had decided that because they already grew and cured tobacco, they might as well roll it up and sell it, too, Arnold Hamm, the head of the cooperative, told me. When De La Cruz and Mowbray-d'Arbela approached Hamm about producing cigarettes with special filters, he said he had no problem with that. Plus, he had all the tobacco they could use.
 To visit a cigarette factory is to see, at once, how a billion people can smoke a pack or two a day, every day, without ever facing a product shortage. The Timberlake plant is like a brightly lighted gymnasium, clamorous with the rhythms of assembly-line machines. The humidity level inside the facility is set at 60 percent, and an earthy, vegetal and not unpleasant aroma of cured tobacco hangs in the heavy air. On the machines, a long, narrow sheet of cigarette paper is laid flat and loose shreds of tobacco leaf known as cut-rag are poured onto it; the automated line moves these protocigarettes along as they are cut, rolled, glued, fitted with a filter, cut to size again, stacked and piled up in a hopper for packaging -- 20 to a pack, 10 packs to a carton and, on the morning I was there, 50 cartons to a case. The pace is relentless. ''Each of these machines can do 6,000 to 7,000 cigarettes per minute,'' Tim Jackson, the plant manager, explained to me, ''so on a good day on one machine you could do 2.5 million on an eight-hour shift.'' Jackson remarked that there were actually seven cigarette machines (called modules) in the room and that he could command three shifts per day. Running at full throttle, the Timberlake plant, which is neither the fastest nor the largest in the United States, could produce more than 45 million cigarettes a day.
 It's doubtful the demand for Fact will reach such a level. Later that day, Jackson and I sat down to plates of pulled pork and fried okra at the Hog Heaven Bar-B-Q with Alex De La Cruz. I asked Jackson what he would consider a success for the launch. ''If in 18 months it is trending at a quarter of a billion cigarettes per year -- which is one-quarter of 1 percent of market share -- I would consider that a success,'' he said.
 ''I think I would be happy with the level Tim is talking about,'' De La Cruz said. ''But I would envision something much bigger.''
 Jackson wasn't inclined to agree. A long-distance runner who smokes two cigarettes a day, usually plucked from the assembly line to test for quality (never on weekends), he said he thought the prospects of getting smokers to switch to Fact for health reasons were dim. ''I think even with my number we would need incredible effort and incredible luck to get to that level,'' he said.
 It will need to be luck, then, if you can call it that, because there is no great promotional effort behind Fact: De La Cruz, who owns the brand, will do only minimal marketing. As for Filligent, it will have no marketing campaign, no advertising budget -- nothing except for the Filligent group's expectation, perhaps, of a public-relations bump resulting from its willingness to talk about its product with those in the media, as it did with me. (While Filligent has a large American law firm representing its legal interests, it has no publicity agent.) Indeed, because PREP's are such a sensitive issue, Mowbray-d'Arbela and De La Cruz will not make any health claims for Fact cigarettes, although in the coming months their companies may each set up a Web site to make raw laboratory data available. During one of our conversations, I asked Mowbray-d'Arbela if she had considered more subtle ways of trying to reach consumers -- a buzz campaign, e-mail, something stealthy. ''Viral marketing, what would you get from that?'' she asked, somewhat taken aback by the possibility. ''It would be people saying, 'Here, try this cigarette.' But there is no safe cigarette. There is no safe level of consumption.''
 She paused and laughed slightly at the paradox -- of wanting, yet not wanting, consumers to smoke the product she has been trying to bring to market. ''I know it's a peculiar situation,'' she said. ''I hope this will work. I think it will.'' Her goal beyond getting Fact to the market, she explained, is for other cigarette manufacturers to license her company's technology and insert Filligent filters in their cigarettes without calling attention to the reduced-risk potential or even noting that there is a new filter inside. If any of those companies make health claims, Mowbray-d'Arbela told me, Filligent could stop shipping its filter paper to them. ''Then we would sue them,'' she said. In this case -- much like the one that Judith Mackay envisioned for China -- the inveterate smoker would never know he or she had bought something potentially less hazardous, and the nonsmoker (or ex-smoker) would never be enticed by reduced-risk claims.
 Another outcome Mowbray-d'Arbela would welcome is for her product to be scientifically rated by the federal government. During its formulation, Filligent relied upon a testing process, conducted by several independent biological laboratories, that focused on the filter's reduction of a cigarette's overall toxicity in relation to its nicotine content. (Among other things, the labs simulated the filter's ability to reduce the DNA mutations that often lead to cancer through a measure called the Ames Test, a common evaluation used by food and drug regulators.) The claims from big tobacco companies have usually focused on whether, or how much, their PREP's cut down on specific deleterious constituents in tobacco smoke, regardless of whether they are low or high in nicotine.
 Filligent's testing method is arguably superior, because it takes into account the fact that any smoker of low-nicotine cigarettes will probably compensate by smoking more and inhaling more chemical compounds. Yet the filter company's strategy means little in a market where there are no standards and even no certainties about which scientific tests are best to evaluate a PREP. At the moment, all cigarette vendors operate in the wilds beyond product regulation, with vast opportunities to alter their ingredients or finesse their lab results into marketing claims. In the mid-1990's, the United States Food and Drug Administration began to regulate tobacco and tobacco marketing, an effort that was turned back in 2000 when the Supreme Court issued a 5-4 opinion stating that the agency had exceeded its authority. A proposed law giving the F.D.A. specific powers to regulate tobacco passed in a Senate bill last year, only to be struck from the bill in conference committee. ''If it's light yogurt or low-fat milk, there's a certain standard today for all food products,'' Senator Mike DeWine, a Republican from Ohio who reintroduced the legislation with Ted Kennedy this year, told me. DeWine calls the situation ludicrous. ''In cigarettes you can say anything you want to say,'' he says. ''And it's going to get even worse when they get into a new generation of cigarettes when they are seriously trying to cut down on the risk -- and they may even be able to cut down on the risk. We don't know that. But they're going to be making claims. And there needs to be some umpire to look at those claims.''
 Until then, technology will move faster than government. And the next generation of cigarettes, as a result, could lead to the same consequences as the last generation of cigarettes. ''Light and ultra-lights are perhaps the greatest fraud in the history of consumer marketing that has ever been perpetrated on the American public,'' Mitch Zeller, a former associate commissioner of the F.D.A. who helped lead the agency's tobacco program from 1994 to 2000, says. ''And they became a public health disaster in part by well-intentioned folks in public health 30 years ago who simply didn't know any better.'' In Zeller's view (he was not aware of Filligent), the new products might well be ''lights all over again.''
 Matthew Myers of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids has similar concerns. ''I think it's face value that the makers of Filligent are looking to reduce the harm caused by tobacco products,'' he says. ''If those filters were put on otherwise-unchanged tobacco products and if they were shown to significantly reduce actual exposure to toxic substances, and if there were no health-based claims made about them, that would be a positive development.'' Yet Myers would never give even the faintest endorsement to such a product until a change in the regulatory environment has created strict testing standards and placed limits on marketing claims. ''For someone like me, Filligent is the ultimate conundrum,'' he says. ''What do you do when you have someone outside the industry who genuinely wants to improve public health? How do you foster that kind of innovation without opening the door for the tobacco industry to continue to mislead consumers?''
By late April, the filligent launch was still being kept quiet -- perhaps 50 people in the world knew about the product, and only a few of them, like Myers and Judith Mackay, were in the public health community. For the most part, the main topic of conversation in antitobacco circles this spring was a new cigarette called Marlboro Ultra Smooth, three different versions of which were being initially test marketed for taste in Tampa, Atlanta and Salt Lake City. Ultra Smooth is the first product from Philip Morris's Smoke Constituent Reduction (SCOR) program, a secretive research and development effort by the tobacco giant to create a new kind of reduced-exposure cigarettes. Philip Morris was not yet making any health claims with the release of Ultra Smooth. But the fact that it comes from its SCOR program had set off a scramble by health officials to see what Philip Morris was up to.
 In the early spring, as I kept tabs on Filligent's progress in North Carolina, I spoke to a number of tobacco researchers who were waiting impatiently for friends, colleagues or distant acquaintances in the three test-market cities to purchase a carton of Ultra Smooths. One such researcher was Gregory Connolly at the Harvard School of Public Health, who proceeded to dissect the cigarettes with a razor blade the day they finally arrived from his contacts in the South and West. Connolly then began the lengthy process of lab-testing the cigarettes to find out what the filter actually does in terms of reducing carcinogens. In Buffalo, Michael Cummings of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute followed a similar procedure. He could barely contain his scorn for Philip Morris's taste test, however, joking darkly, ''The race is really to see who in these three communities dies the fastest.''
 I asked Cummings why he thought the market tests of the Ultra Smooths were such a big deal. ''It's a big deal because it's Philip Morris, which is a big deal,'' he replied. ''It's a big deal because it's Marlboro, which has 40 percent of the market share in the United States. It's a big deal because these companies are still doing human experimentation without consent. It's a big deal because Philip Morris has a history of deception and concealment, and there is nothing that would change my view that this is any different today.'' After a quick analysis of the filter and tobacco, Cummings seemed to view the product as a subtle and insubstantial variation on the light cigarette, albeit one with an activated charcoal filter (an invention dating back 40 years or so) that would scrub some of the toxic gasses from the smoke. ''Philip Morris knows a lot about nicotine pharmacology, they know more than anyone in the world, and they could probably do a lot more good than something like Marlboro Ultra Smooth,'' Cummings said. ''This is tragic.''
 When I spoke with Philip Morris, the company declined to publicly confirm many details of the Marlboro Ultra Smooth campaign. It is unlikely, however, that Philip Morris will roll out this product any time this year. The Ultra Smooth tests are the first of many to gauge the appeal of the flavor of the company's next generation of cigarettes -- merely one aspect of a comprehensive research, marketing and lobbying effort. Last year, in preparing to introduce these products, Philip Morris backed the ill-fated DeWine-Kennedy bill that would have led to F.D.A. oversight of tobacco. ''I think the regulation would give them a market advantage over the other companies,'' Connolly says. ''Philip Morris is building a $300 million research facility in Richmond to build safer cigarettes. They're betting that they'll be the only company to meet an F.D.A. bar for exposure.'' When Philip Morris's C.E.O., Michael E. Szymanczyk, testified in April in a case against his company -- the Department of Justice is accusing the big tobacco companies of engaging in ''a massive 50-year scheme to defraud the public'' -- he said nearly as much. F.D.A. regulation, Szymanczyk testified, ''would provide consistency in tobacco policy, more predictability for the tobacco industry and an effective means of addressing issues that are of concern to our company, our consumers and society.'' Asked under oath why his company had spent so much money and effort on reduced-harm cigarettes, Szymanczyk replied, ''In addition to being the right thing to do, pursuing less-hazardous products also offers us a potential competitive advantage.''
 There is little doubt that Szymanczyk also knows the depths of his customers' brand loyalty. They may never switch to a newcomer like Fact. They also seem uninterested in switching to a variety of new oral tobacco products -- generally viewed as far less hazardous than cigarettes -- that have been introduced in the past few years. But market research suggests that large numbers of smokers would be inclined to give a new ''smoother'' Marlboro a shot. Recently I had the opportunity to see videotapes of some consumer panels that gave the impression that any reduced-exposure product from Marlboro would encourage smokers not to quit, especially if it comes with modest health claims. Those responses were very much in line with ''The Path to a Safer Cigarette,'' a recent report from J.P. Morgan's global equity research division, which went so far as to suggest that PREP's are the key to the future growth of the cigarette industry. In one survey of smokers, the analysts found that 85 percent of smokers would be willing to try a cigarette that could significantly lower health risks. They estimated that PREP's could account for $1 billion in United States sales by 2009 and more than $20 billion by 2015.
 Could it happen sooner? ''We're seeing a constant rate of quitting,'' Ken Warner of the University of Michigan says. ''So they're trying to find a product to keep people as their customers. And let's be straight: the tobacco companies don't want to kill their customers; that's just an unfortunate side effect. If they can come up with something substantially less risky, of course they will try to sell it. They just haven't gotten there yet.''
 To Mitch Zeller, there is more than mere economics at work: Philip Morris's reduced-risk project fits into the company's broader campaign of corporate social responsibility (the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on its youth-smoking-prevention efforts, for instance) and its cultural philanthropy. And of course it also enables the company to show judges and juries that it is taking steps in the direction of harm reduction. ''All of these programs are part of a much larger strategic effort by Philip Morris to change public perception,'' he says. ''One of the goals here is to demonstrate to their target audience that they are a changed company and that they have achieved -- and these are terms from internal Philip Morris documents -- 'Societal Alignment' and 'corporate normalcy.''' Already, public opinion surveys have shown that the company has significantly improved upon its abysmal public image of the late 1990's. PREP's, Zeller says, might help even more. They present an enormous opportunity for the rehabilitation of a consumer product, and the rehabilitation of a corporate reputation, that seemed beneath contempt as recently as just a few years ago.
Part of the extraordinary challenge for Filligent and New Century Tobacco is to prove to those in the antismoking policy ranks that their product is different from anything that has come from the big tobacco companies: different in its technology, efficacy, marketing, aims and social responsibility. For some public health officials, that may not be enough; some scientists and physicians are profoundly skeptical that any kind of burning cigarette, no matter how radical the technology or earnest its patron, can be a reduced-risk product. But others may yet be receptive, especially if Filligent performs well in the academic lab testing and human testing that inevitably follow the release of any new PREP -- and if Filligent successfully prevents the brands that license its product from making any health claims.
 I met up one last time with Mowbray-d'Arbela one afternoon in late April in Manhattan. She was with her lieutenant, Ben Frickel, who had just flown with her from Hong Kong to Miami (to meet with Alex De La Cruz) and then to Timberlake (to meet with plant officials). I asked her what success would mean for her product in the actual marketplace, where politics and health officials hold little sway, where buyers care mostly about brand and price. It seemed the things she worried about most were the various distribution hurdles associated with helping De La Cruz get Fact into the stores. ''For us, success is if we can just get this product on the streets in a responsible manner,'' she said.
 As we spoke, Frickel, a social smoker, produced a Ziploc bag of Filligent-fitted cigarettes he had brought with him from the factory. They seemed vaguely illicit, as if we were in one of those Ayn Rand novels where the cartoonish and heroically capitalistic characters occasionally light up cigarettes stamped with a dollar sign.
 Mowbray-d'Arbela and Frickel are not at all cartoonish. But they are venture capitalists, and as the conversation drifted to the topic of money, I asked if they had any idea what kind of return they would get on their investment. Mowbray-d'Arbela maintained that she wondered less at this point about what they'll do with their profits and more about when the backers -- all told, there are about a dozen -- will be able to recoup their money. Mowbray-d'Arbela, Frickel and Neal Stewart all told me they have made a point of choosing individuals (no institutional investors) who can afford to take a bath. ''None of us who are invested in this have put in our last dollar,'' Mowbray-d'Arbela said, ''and all of us are committed to making this work for what I would call the right reasons -- that this is the solution that should go out to as many people as possible to address the needs of smokers.'' Should it succeed in becoming profitable, she added, the company planned to give a significant portion of its profits -- she would not specify how much -- to antitobacco efforts.
 Of course, Filligent could well make a lot of people rich. One way that might happen is if the filter technology is licensed to other companies in, say, Europe, Japan and the developing world. In this case, the United States market might be viewed as more of a tactical gambit then a bet-the-company strategy. ''We'd like the United States to be a leader for this,'' Mowbray-d'Arbela said, noting that the largest tobacco companies are headquartered here and that the rest of the world looks to the United States markets as the example. Yet she and Frickel acknowledged that their company's Hong Kong locale has shaped their outlook as well as their business plan. ''The international markets are integral to our strategy,'' Frickel said. ''We've focused on the U.S. as our introductory market, and we plan to dovetail international sales right behind that. But if for some reason the U.S. market doesn't work out -- it would be unfortunate, but it's a possibility -- we're ready to go to several markets in Europe and South America and Asia. We're working on that currently.'' The two said they could not discuss specifics publicly. But as Judith Mackay of the World Health Organization pointed out, getting the Filligent product into many of these markets, especially those where the government has tight reins on the tobacco industry, would involve a top-down approach (essentially pitching it through government channels). Such an approach would be unsuited to the United States, where the product would bubble up through the mass market. In any event, both Frickel and Mowbray-d'Arbela acknowledged that Filligent could turn out to be a next-generation product in more ways than one. It might languish without any impact whatsoever on this generation of smokers, only to gain traction many years from now, perhaps in a future time when the F.D.A. exerts some authority over risk-reduction claims. In the meantime, a heavily promoted product that comes out from Philip Morris's SCOR program could bury it.
 With so many contingencies in play -- consumer acceptance, lab verifications, marketing claims, F.D.A. authority, even Mowbray-d'Arbela's expectation that counterfeiters might soon be peddling fake teal-blue Filligent filters in Asia -- it seemed difficult to imagine what the future looked like. ''What do you think will happen?'' Neal Stewart, the original mover behind the filter, asked me on the phone from the Philippines one evening. ''Because really I have no idea.''
 I didn't venture a guess. Even the veterans of tobacco policy are loath to make predictions in this area. ''On the one hand, the optimist says, we're on the verge of the era of these low-risk products,'' Kenneth Warner of the University of Michigan explained to me. ''On the other hand, the pessimist says we're on the verge of another light-cigarettes fiasco.'' The optimist sees a sunny time of lower risk and better health, Warner added, while the pessimist sees a dismal future. ''But the thing is, nobody knows. It's the most complicated thing I've ever encountered in 30 years of working on tobacco policy. It is the single-most-difficult issue in terms of trying to predict where it will go or where it can go.''
 In New York that April afternoon, I asked Mowbray-d'Arbela what she would do if Filligent -- which has mainly been tested in laboratories -- were to have the unintended effect of making people ill. She dismissed that possibility, on the grounds that the chemical compound in the filter is already F.D.A. approved for medical uses. Still, she said, should there be any adverse reactions: ''We'll stop it. Immediately.'' And if it has the adverse effect of keeping people from quitting? ''I think we'd have to really think about that extremely carefully and look at what we've done wrong to try and address that,'' she replied. ''Because that would. . . . ''
 She paused. She seemed to be sorting through, and then discarding, bad outcomes one by one, until finally she plowed forward, resolutely. After a few moments of what seemed like uneasy consideration, she had regained her bearings. ''Something,'' she said, ''would have had to have gone wrong for that to happen.''

HEADLINE: Doing Nails for a Living, With a Hammer

BYLINE: By Louise Kramer. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHEN Veronica Session was leaving work on a recent afternoon, she noticed a picture of a naked woman freshly penciled on the wall. She was hardly surprised. 
 Ms. Session, a carpenter who was finishing an interiors job in Manhattan, said it was common practice for construction workers to scribble suggestive drawings on unprimed walls they know will soon be painted over. As she has done many times before, rather than wait for the paint job, Ms. Session, 46, decided to grab a brush and paint over the image herself. 
 Ms. Session, who lives in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, switched from a low-paying bank job to carpentry 16 years ago, and still finds that besides skills, it takes inner strength to succeed. ''This is good honest work and good honest money with a living wage,'' she said. ''But there is an unpleasant environment involved. This would not fly in a regular office.''
 Operation Punch List, a group of about 250 New York City tradeswomen, including Ms. Session, is increasing efforts to get better access to jobs in the notoriously patriarchal construction field. The group's financing proposal to the City Council for the 2006 Tradeswomen's Conference said that $30 billion in construction activity is expected to flow into New York in the next decade.
 Advocacy organizations have been trying to improve the job picture for tradeswomen since the 1980's, with limited results. Women represent less than 2.5 percent of the city's construction work force, according to the 2000 census. That is up only slightly from 1 percent in 1993, and below the national average of 3.1 percent, according to Operation Punch List, named after the list of items to be finished or changed at the end of a construction job.
 ''We still have exactly the same issues,'' said Kathy Rodgers, president of Legal Momentum, formerly the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, which is working with Operation Punch List. Women in construction face the same problems that women in other formerly male-only fields do, Ms. Rodgers said. ''Some of the women are taunted at the job and given bad assignments. There is stereotyping that it is not women's work, that they don't want to get dirty, that they are too weak physically.'' 
 Those stereotypes serve to block capable women from high-paying jobs, Ms. Rodgers said. Construction is one of the few professions in which salaries can reach six figures for workers with only a high school diploma. The hourly wage for a unionized carpenter in New York is close to $40. Forest City Ratner Companies, the development firm, strives to have members of minorities and women make up 20 percent of the workers at its projects, according to Bob Sanna, an executive vice president. ''Since the 1980's, we have seen a significant rise of minority participation on the job site, but not as much for women,'' he said. Women in executive positions have fared much better, he said.
 To some degree, increasing women's representation in the construction trades is an orphan cause. No single group with hiring power, whether contractors, unions or developers, has embraced it. But signs of progress are emerging. In March, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg formed the Mayor's Commission on Construction Opportunity in an effort to help members of minorities, women, returning veterans and new high school graduates get jobs. 
 The city estimates that 260,000 construction jobs will be created in New York during the next 30 years by major development projects, including those in Downtown Brooklyn, Lower Manhattan and the Far West Side. The commission is looking at creating recruitment and retention programs and a high school for construction trades, said Ben Branham, a spokesman for the Department of Small Business Services.
 Operation Punch List and Legal Momentum are seeking $75,000 from the City Council for a conference on the construction industry early next year. It would bring together tradeswomen, builders, developers, contractors and unions to discuss ways that barriers to women can be overcome.
 But amid these meetings, the sound of jackhammers is already growing louder, and Ms. Session wants to make sure she, and younger women, get a piece of the action. ''There are still those who think I should be home baking,'' she said.

 BODY:
HAVE New Yorkers lost their chutzpah? The demise of the proposed Jets stadium on the Far West Side (and the attendant blow to the city's 2012 Olympic hopes), along with the politically induced inertia at the World Trade Center site, has led to speculation that the Big Apple is turning into a crab apple. So the Op-Ed Page approached several prominent New Yorkers with a question: If the city wants to start thinking big again, where should it start? Their suggestions follow.
 THE inability to get large public projects off the ground in New York reflects less a lack of ambition than a failure to come to consensus over the role of government in land use. There is a tendency to criticize any public investment in projects that are not absolutely needed. We take for granted our great public works, like Central Park and the Public Library, as if they were handed down by Moses. Actually, they were created by real people with precious dollars, public and private (including some by another Moses, Robert). These are our temples. 
 Today, however, instead of investing in public buildings the government tries to cut corners and generate financing for projects like the Moynihan rail station by selling zoning rights so that public buildings and parks find themselves in the shadow of oversized private development. This approach also leads to single-developer schemes with super-blocks and large plazas, which destroy the organic vitality of the city. Their public space is too calculated and cold. Just as important as placing a higher priority on public buildings and parks, we must ensure that private development is set in the traditional street grid, so that it is easily adapted for new uses as the economy and city evolve.

HAVE New Yorkers lost their chutzpah? The demise of the proposed Jets stadium on the Far West Side (and the attendant blow to the city's 2012 Olympic hopes), along with the politically induced inertia at the World Trade Center site, has led to speculation that the Big Apple is turning into a crab apple. So the Op-Ed Page approached several prominent New Yorkers with a question: If the city wants to start thinking big again, where should it start? Their suggestions follow.
 I DON'T think that politics has paralyzed Gotham's once vaunted ability to get big things done. At this very moment, New York is driving City Water Tunnel No. 3 through bedrock 60-odd stories beneath Manhattan, one of the most colossal construction projects on earth. Nor (happily enough) did every enterprise proposed in the Good Old Days come to fruition -- like the proposal in 1893 to tear down City Hall, or Mayor William J. Gaynor's suggestion in 1910 to ram a new street through Midtown between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. 
 There are, certainly, large-scale transportation proposals now on the table that are worthy of our collective consideration, like the the Cross-Harbor Freight Tunnel to link New Jersey and Brooklyn. But arguably more important are less flashy initiatives for struggling economic sectors: to revitalize our manufacturing base by developing new eco-industries; to bolster communications by creating the world's first totally wireless city; to reinvigorate our creative base by increasing financing for cultural institutions and enhancing cooperation between our academic institutions; and to gear up tourism, in part by throwing an improved hat in the ring for the 2016 Olympics.

HEADLINE: Jordan Is Preparing to Tone Down the Islamic Bombast in Textbooks

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan 

 BODY:
By Middle Eastern standards, Jordanian schoolbooks are relatively free of bombast. But some textbooks used here to teach Islamic culture contain nefarious conspiracies that just will not go away. 
 There is the Western plot to divide the Muslim world. There is the conniving Jew seeking to destroy Islam. And there is the call for a return to the faith in response. 
 But if a committee reviewing the country's Islamic curriculum has its way, such talk, at least in the current form, is likely to become history. Facing growing extremism and rising security threats, educators are seeking to revamp their religious studies curriculum to cultivate a more thoughtful and open mind in a country that is among the more moderate of Arab states. 
 The effort to foster more moderate expressions of Islam is decidedly ambitious for an Arab government, but also very delicate. Ostensibly, it seeks to inoculate Jordanian youth against extremism, although some critics complain that it is really an effort to ward off foreign pressure, especially from the United States, on which Jordan has grown increasingly dependent. 
 ''We want to cultivate an enlightened youth who won't take their faith blindly,'' said Khaled Touqan, Jordan's minister of education. ''We want them to be thoughtful about what they are doing, and teach them that violence for the sake of violence is against our faith.''
 Schoolbooks are being rewritten, curriculums reassessed and teaching techniques scrapped. The project is part of a broader reassessment of all school curriculums in Jordan, aimed at modernizing Jordan's education system and making its graduates competitive in the world economy. 
 Educators and religious leaders engrossed in the work call it ''improvement,'' rather than reform, seeking to distance themselves from the far broader political efforts -- seen as driven by foreign forces -- to change segments of Jordan's economy and government. 
 Almost all those on the committee for improving the Islamic curriculum agree that the best way to answer the tide of extremism is by describing Islam as an ''open faith'' and encouraging students to be more receptive to new ideas, while buttressing their understanding of the faith. ''If there is a lack of good education in the basics, it encourages confusion,'' said Abdul Nasser Abul Basal, head of the Islamic Law School at Yarmouk University in Jordan and a member of the reassessment committee. ''Education is ultimately the solution to waywardness.''
 Here, Islamic education is one class period out of many in the school day. Though mosques, which are tightly regulated, do teach special religion classes at night and on weekends, the Ministry of Education remains in firm control of all religious curriculum in schools, and all students study from the ministry's own textbooks. 
 Yet the current curriculum, Mr. Abul Basal said, is outdated. Chapters on slavery, almost unheard of today in Jordan, mean little to students, he said. The tradition of freethinking, a hallmark of Islam hundreds of years ago, is muted, he added. At the same time, Arab youths face oppression and conflict daily on their television screens and over the Internet, and extremists are harnessing their anger in the name of Islam, he said. 
 The new curriculum is intended to stimulate more free-form debate, and to encourage students to ask once taboo questions about democracy, human rights and other subjects. Notably, the scholars say, the new curriculum seeks to steer students toward peaceful solutions to the region's difficult problems. ''You want to show that the peaceful solution is always better than the military one,'' said Adil Rawashdeh, who oversees the Islamic curriculum at the College of Islamic Science in Amman. Members expect the reassessment effort to take about four years, but the recommendations that have already been made have been far reaching. 
 For Jordan, which established diplomatic ties with Israel in 1994, discussion of democratic ideas under Islam is in and talk of the ''Israeli enemy'' is out, committee members say. Talk of a Muslim work ethic and striving for progress are emphasized; discussion of apostasy is out, to avoid encouraging hostility toward nonbelievers. And nonviolent resistance is in, as is respect for non-Muslim minorities, said Hassan al-Saqqaf, an Islamic scholar on the committee. 
 The most controversial part of the reassessment is how to deal with the subject of jihad. Current Jordanian textbooks describe it as both the struggle within oneself for purification and armed struggle to resist oppression and defend Islam. Militants use the term to mean ''holy war,'' but scholars and educators insist that is not correct. Some advocates of change here have sought to drop the subject entirely, but others resist. Striking the issue of jihad from the books, Mr. Abul Basal said, would discredit the whole effort. 
 Some critics say that talk of striking jihad from schoolbooks is evidence of foreign interference. 
 ''There is an attack on the curriculum and I believe it is driven by the Americans,'' said Adnan Hassounah, a member of Jordan's opposition who heads the Parliament's education committee. ''We are open to improvements, but we don't want to lose our basic identity.''
 The educators and religious authorities involved in the effort go out of their way to emphasize that theirs is a homegrown solution to a local problem. United States diplomatic sources in Amman say they have no involvement with religious affairs, adding that all the curriculum changes are part of a broad campaign with Unesco to make Jordanian graduates more competitive in the global economy.
 The reassessment effort borrows from many other such efforts tried in the past. Al al-Bayt University (House of the Prophet University), about an hour from Amman, has worked to combine Islamic studies with a variety of fields like chemistry, architecture and political science, in an effort to cultivate a more rounded Islamic scholar. More than 10 years since it opened its doors, the university now enrolls some 14,500 students, including students from 31 countries, to study languages, the humanities and science. 
 Similar projects were also undertaken in Iraq in the 1930's and in Morocco and other parts of the Muslim world to encourage more rounded Muslim scholars. But those efforts have largely fallen by the wayside as economic and political problems have grown. ''There are schools focused on worldly sciences and there are ones focused on religion,'' said Ahmad Alawneh, vice president of Al al-Bayt. ''We wanted to form a school that ties the two.''
 Yet for all the work on curriculum, success lies with the teacher. A teacher could choose not to discuss the changes, or change language slightly, said Ali Muhammad al-Sawa, a professor of Shariah, or Koranic law, at Jordan University. Ultimately it is the teacher who must get through to the student. 
 ''The problem is that the average extremist has no trust in someone like me,'' Mr. Sawa said. ''If a kid thinks this is being brought by America, he simply won't be accepting this.''

HEADLINE: 'Smart Growth' Remakes a Beach Town

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
''TOO cool,'' cooed a svelte young woman in black as she entered the glitzy new McLoone's Pier House restaurant right on the beach in Long Branch, N.J., for an arts benefit one recent evening. ''But,'' the woman said, looking around in surprise, ''didn't Long Branch used to be sort of dumpy?''
 Actually, yes. There are less snarky ways to describe the city's image and general condition before the start of redevelopment about five years ago. But even those who have loved Long Branch a long time -- take City Councilman Anthony Giordano, a fourth-generation resident, for example -- allow that ''sort of dumpy'' isn't really a cruel or unusual remark.
 ''This is a total rebirth going on now,'' Mr. Giordano, 39, said. ''The redevelopment has taken a long time to fully come together, but it is giving the city a whole new life.'' 
 In contrast to other shoreline communities, Long Branch (population: 32,000) has always had a stable base of year-round residents. That is one reason it was selected as a model for ''smart growth'' initiatives instituted by former Gov. James E. McGreevey in 2001, and as a major recipient of redevelopment financing.
 About $20 million in public grants and low-interest loans were used to build subsidized and market-rate housing in town, reconstruct a section of Ocean Boulevard, replenish the beach, rebuild sections of the boardwalk, create public parks and restore public access to the beach in the area. That, in turn, spurred private developers led by the Applied Development Company and Matzel & Mumford to begin remaking the city's once-derelict oceanfront into a residential oasis a few years ago.
 Redevelopment work along the Long Branch shoreline is now more than half complete. Meanwhile, property values of existing housing have roughly doubled at every price point over the last five years, according to Mr. Giordano's wife, Elizabeth, who is a real estate agent with Re/Max Champions Ocean Township.
 Mr. and Mrs. Giordano happen to be putting their 130-year-old three-bedroom colonial on Brighton Avenue in the West End on the market. They are ''moving up'' to a four-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath house under construction on the same street, in order to have more space to raise their two children, ages 4 and 18 months. 
 ''I grew up right around the corner in a two-family house on Norwood Avenue,'' Mr. Giordano said. ''My grandparents lived upstairs. My grandma just turned 90 -- and she still lives there. That's not an atypical story for people who live around here.''

What You'll Find
 The population of Long Branch has traditionally been more ethnically and economically diverse than that of most shoreline communities, including employees of the Monmouth Medical Center in town, families affiliated with the Fort Monmouth Army base in Eatontown and people with ties to Monmouth University in West Long Branch, as well as wealthy summer-only residents.
 Mrs. Giordano said it was difficult to specify an ''average'' abode in Long Branch. The older housing stock varies widely, from modest Victorians and newer colonials in the West End, to multimillion-dollar mansions in the Elberon section. 
 The new housing going up along the beachfront -- including the Beachfront North and Pier Village developments along the boardwalk -- is a mix of town homes, low-rise condos and rental apartments.
 Beachfront North, a town house and condo development with 233 units, is about 90 percent sold. Pier Village, home to McLoone's Pier House, will eventually include 420 apartments, street-level retail, a beach club, fitness center, community park and performance stage. There are already about 60 residents in the first completed building at Pier Village, with the next group of apartments about to be released to the market. 
 The city is negotiating with a developer to put up 350 midrise condominiums at the southern end of the beach. And across Ocean Boulevard, two more midrise condominium projects are under construction.

What You'll Pay
 Only five years ago, the average home price in Long Branch was below $200,000. Now, brokers say the average has risen to somewhere in the $400,000 range. 
 Multiple listings show several one-bedroom condos available in the low $200,000's, quite a few single-family homes in the $400,000's, and a five-bedroom beachfront house in Elberon with an asking price of just under $5 million.
 At Beachfront North, town house and condo prices range from the high $500,000's to $1.5 million. At Pier Village, which is under construction beside the new McLoone's, yearly leases are available at monthly rates of $1,200 to $3,000, depending on size and location.

What to Do
 The present entertainment possibilities in Long Branch pale beside the future, when Applied Development promises a sort of social nirvana centered on Pier Village: year-round concerts, fitness classes on the beach, elegant rental cabanas with food-and-beverage service, boutique shopping, a surfside pool, etc., etc.
 At Beachfront North, a four-acre public park that will provide public access to the beach is under construction. A band shell for public concerts is planned for the open green space between the boardwalk and Ocean Avenue.
 Plans are also in place for creation of an arts district centered around an old theater building on Broadway that would be restored for use by the New Jersey Repertory Company.
 But even before those dreams are realized, there is plenty of opportunity for people seeking more than sun and sand. An array of events and exhibits are held throughout the year at Monmouth University, a mere 10 minutes from the beach. Monmouth Park Racetrack is also minutes away. And this summer, a series of Sunday evening jazz band concerts is set for the West End Park at Brighton and Ocean Avenues.

The Schools
 The Long Branch school district, identified as one of New Jersey's ''poorer urban districts'' in a court ruling 15 years ago, has benefited from more than a decade of supplementary state funding, and is generally regarded to be one of the funding program's success stories. In fact, the state school superintendent recommended in a recent report that Long Branch be removed from the special Abbott School funding list, saying the school system can now fly on its own.
 The town offers public prekindergarten and maintains a curriculum that promotes achievement across the board, while offering many extras at magnet-themed schools. With a magnet system, residents have a choice as to which school they want their children to attend, and schools offer special programs in technology, performing arts, marine biology or other fields to attract those with aptitude or interest.
 There are three schools offering kindergarten through second grade, three schools offering Grades 3 to 5, a middle school, an alternative middle/high school, and a high school. This year, the student body at Long Branch High School numbers 1,177.
 Three out of four Long Branch High School graduates go on to two- or four-year colleges, according to the local board of education. The high school is also known for turning out exceptional athletes. 
 Long Branch has also been a big beneficiary of the state's recent push to rehabilitate and replace aging school buildings. A new grade school was just completed, and a new high school is under construction and slated to open next year.

The Commute
 Long Branch has daily train service to and from Pennsylvania Station, which takes about an hour on New Jersey Transit's North Jersey Coast Line. 
 Andrew Murtha, an investment analyst in his early 30's who was among the first to move into Pier Village last February, commutes by train to Manhattan. The ride is much longer than his former commute from an apartment in Hoboken -- between 90 minutes and two hours door-to-door, he said. 
 ''But it is totally worth it,'' Mr. Murtha added, ''especially on the ride home, because it's so wonderful to live in this spot.'' 
 On summer weekends, extra trains run direct from Hoboken and Newark to the Jersey Shore, and New Jersey Transit operates the Pony Express rail service to the Monmouth Park track.
 For drivers, the good news is that Long Branch is only 10 minutes off the Garden State Parkway. The bad news is that the 10-to-15-mile stretch along Route 36 that must be negotiated to get to the beach can be maddeningly gridlocked on nice summer days.

The History
 President Ulysses S. Grant first visited Long Branch in 1869, and his subsequent annual visits helped establish the resort town as a playground for the Victorian era's super rich. Eventually, a total of seven presidents logged visits to the oceanfront city (Grant, Garfield, Arthur, Hayes, Harrison, McKinley and Wilson), and all are remembered now with bronze statues at a pavilion not far from McLoone's. 
 But Long Branch began its descent from glamour more than a century ago when transportation improved and the East Coast's upper crust quickly moved on. By the late 1980's, when the amusement park and the fishing pier burned down, its appeal as a vacation spot had already become limited.
 Ten years ago, a local community group called Long Branch Tomorrow began work on developing a master plan for rebuilding in a 300-acre redevelopment area along the shore.

What We Like
 ''Too cool'' is almost an understatement when it comes to Pier Village. The scale of the development, the tasteful architecture, the distinctive retail and restaurant mix being assembled make the oceanfront ambience appealing from every angle.

What We'd Change
 Despite efforts to transform the broad and faceless Ocean Avenue to make it more pedestrian-friendly, including the addition of several stoplights and intersections, the wide street running along the shore presents a barrier between the beach community and the rest of town.

HEADLINE: Real Estate, the Global Obsession

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
THE housing market in California may look like a textbook case of superheated ''irrational exuberance,'' but then how does one explain Spain?
 Home prices there have risen 130 percent since 1997, twice the run-up in the United States. 
 These days, house price vertigo is more than a local or national condition. It's a worldwide phenomenon.
 The American housing boom in recent years is nothing compared with the price run-up in countries like France, Spain, Britain, Ireland, Sweden and Australia, even though markets in Australia and Britain have cooled in the last year. 
 Million-dollar two-bedroom apartments are not only a fixture of New York, but of London, Paris and Hong Kong. In New Zealand, housing prices rose by more than 16 percent from 2003 to 2004. In Ireland, they rose more than 10 percent in that period. 
 The rise in prices is worrisome, because the international housing boom is a byproduct of globalization. A house on a plot of ground is the most local of assets. But the financial markets that make it possible for people to borrow money to buy a house, or speculate, are increasingly open, international and linked.
 Interest rate policies in the industrialized world tend to move in lockstep, usually led by the United States. A growing community of affluent professionals around the world now buy second homes and invest in housing abroad.
 The economic links act as a self-reinforcing network that has fueled the global surge in house prices but would also likely magnify the pain on the way down. The ripples would extend well beyond the housing markets. A fall in American house prices, for example, would crimp consumer spending -- and free-spending Americans have supported growth in many export-minded nations, notably China.
 ''The real concern is that the housing boom extends across so many countries this time,'' said Susan M. Wachter, a professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''That just raises the stakes, and the risk, when the music stops.''
 The global surge in house prices is a boom by design, largely manufactured by the world's central banks, led by the Federal Reserve. And it was done for good reason. Faced with a falling stock market and the collapse of the high-tech bubble, the Fed cut interest rates sharply in 2000 to try to limit the damage to the American economy and its trading partners. 
 Other central banks, like the European Central Bank, quickly followed the Fed's lead. Higher government spending and tax cuts were also part of the formula.
 Cheap credit worldwide fueled the housing market, making mortgage payments less costly. Homeowners refinanced their mortgages at lower rates, and the savings went into consumer spending. They took out home-equity loans on houses of rising value, and spent that borrowed money on cars, clothes, furniture, restaurant meals and vacations. The higher consumer spending and the soaring value of the home nest-egg have kept the global economy chugging along.
 ''The Fed and other central banks encouraged this boom so that the wealth lost in the stock market was replaced by housing,'' said John Llewellyn, the global chief economist at Lehman Brothers in London. ''And the housing boom has stimulated demand around the world.''
 The biggest globalization lift in house prices has been in what urban economists call ''primate cities.'' These are the places where the world's well-off want to live or visit regularly for business or culture like London, Paris, New York, Boston, Shanghai, San Francisco, Miami, Sydney and Vancouver.
 They are the most cosmopolitan of locales, often coastal cities and tourist hubs. They experienced the largest spikes in housing prices and pull up the national averages, while inland cities lag -- the tourist coast of Spain outpaces Madrid, San Francisco outdoes Milwaukee. 
 Hitching the world economy to the housing market has worked well for policy makers so far. But it probably can't continue. House prices in general are continuing to rise both in the United States and abroad, as speculative buying and interest-only mortgages are proliferating. 
 ''Much of Europe is like the United States, with roaring increases in housing prices,'' noted Michael Bell, a real estate economist at the University of Reading, in Britain. ''The boom must be peaking soon. It just can't keep going up.''
 The looming, unanswered question for the global economy is whether the housing boom will cool down in an orderly way over the next few years or end in a bust. The preferred path would be for interest rates to rise steadily but moderately, slowing the pace of house price increases and forcing consumers to save more. 
 This is what the Federal Reserve and some other central banks, like the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of Australia, have tried to do. The hope is that increased business investment would pick up the slack as housing markets worldwide calm down.
 But the European Central Bank is contemplating lowering, not raising, interest rates. It is more concerned with slow economic growth, especially in large economies, like Germany's -- where housing prices aren't skyrocketing -- than smaller, hot economies like Spain's. 
 The peril is that conflicting policies could conspire against an orderly retreat. And any trouble would come at a time when policy makers, especially in the United States, have fewer options than in the past. 
 The huge American federal deficit, trade deficit and minuscule savings rate mean the United States borrows about $5 billion a day mostly from foreigners, whose purchases of mortgage-backed bonds have helped keep mortgage rates low.
 If house prices drop and American consumers are forced to tighten their belts, buying fewer imports, China and other nations would have to slow their dollar investment spree, driving interest rates higher and higher. That could smack housing markets from Paris to Shanghai to Auckland. 
 C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, says the overheated global housing market is cause for concern. Yet the larger danger, he said, would be if it combined with another economic jolt, like an abrupt rise in oil prices, which would increase inflation and interest rates. 
 ''That would burst the housing bubble, and be a very serious hit to the world economy,'' Mr. Bergsten said. 
 In a recently published paper, Thomas F. Helbling, an economist at the International Monetary Fund, studied 75 housing price cycles in 14 industrialized countries from 1970 to 2002. He found that not every boom is followed by a bust, but booms often are signs of possible trouble.
 So applying Mr. Helbling's historical standard for booms to today's housing markets makes for nervous reading. 
 The housing markets in France, Spain and New Zealand have already boomed, according to Mr. Helbling's definition -- that inflation-adjusted prices have increased 19 percent or more over the last two years. And prices in the Scandinavian countries, Italy, Ireland and the United States are nearing that level. 
 All these countries must be looking anxiously to Britain and Australia, where prices have peaked, and the question is whether they will experience a bust. 
 History and common sense, of course, teach that sooner or later, economic gravity will return to house prices, either gradually or swiftly, soft landing or meltdown.

HEADLINE: Signs of a Spring Slowdown

BYLINE: By TERI KARUSH ROGERS

 BODY:
AFTER a torrid first quarter that spun the sales prices of Manhattan apartments to breathtaking highs, anecdotal evidence suggests that the headiness has started to dissipate. While the jig is hardly up, brokers are saying that the tempo resembles a more seasonable waltz, and that there are signs of growing price resistance among buyers.
 Prices are still rising, but more slowly, and the market is still strong, just not as crazy. ''It's been an overheated market for so long that it is a slowdown, but this slowdown is kind of like what we used to have all the time, which is a normal market,'' said Deanna Kory, a senior vice president at the Corcoran Group, echoing the views of most of the 25 real estate brokers and executives interviewed for this article across a broad range of firms and price points. 
 The spring slowdown -- variously referred to as a correction, softening, pause, seasonal adjustment, breather and normalization -- was typically discussed in tones of relief rather than alarm. ''In a way, it had to happen,'' said Ms. Kory, noting that the market since 2002 ''got a little out of hand -- it got crazy.'' 
 ''I don't see it as a bad thing,'' she said. ''It's only bad for sellers who expected to get a certain price.'' 
 Many apartments priced by tacking an extra 10 percent or more onto first-quarter comparables are lingering on the market, prompting 5 to 10 percent reductions during the last few weeks, especially among family-sized dwellings above $1.5 million, and particularly on the Upper East Side, where there is said to be a recent surplus of inventory. Brokers reported that in many cases, open-house attendance has lagged significantly behind the outsized crowds in the early part of the year.
 ''There are still bidding wars on certain properties -- something that's unique or totally done in a way that's very outstanding in a hot area -- but you're not seeing it on everything,'' said Dottie Herman, president and chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman, who, like some others, declined to categorize the shift as a slowdown. ''People do not feel the same feeling, and that has a lot to do with the papers,'' she added, referring to a mounting news media chorus about a possible housing bubble.
 For buyers, relief is mixed. Juggernaut competition may be easing, but prices aren't necessarily retreating below first-quarter levels. Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a Manhattan-based real estate appraiser, noted that while the volume of deals appears flat, ''purchase prices are still pushing the envelope across the board'' among contracts signed as recently as two weeks ago. ''Some of the sizzle might be off the steak, but the steak is still very expensive,'' said Pamela Liebman, chief executive and president of Corcoran, adding, ''What tells you if prices are going up is the price per square foot.'' She said that data from the firm's signed contracts show condo and co-op prices per square foot of $1,003 in March, $1,016 in April and $1,009 in May. 
 But buyers, perhaps fueled by the bubble press, are mounting more resistance.
 ''Right now, buyers are daring to put offers that are under the asking price -- I just got one for 8 percent under asking,'' said Jacky Teplitzky, an executive vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman, who held six open houses last weekend for family-sized apartments from $1.2 million to $1.6 million on the Upper East and West Sides, and in Murray Hill. Like her May open houses, attendance trailed by one-half to two-thirds the number typically attracted earlier in the year.
 ''Before, we had more volume and more offers coming to the table,'' she said. ''Usually after an open house, we would get two, three or four offers. Now, we get maybe one offer after the first or second open house.'' 
 More buyers ''are offering ask or slightly over ask,'' said Veronica Raehse, an executive vice president and sales manager at Bellmarc Realty's West Side office. ''Two months ago, where they were going $100,000 over ask, it's maybe only $25,000 to $30,000 now.'' 
 The loftiest end of the market is said to be showing the most strain. 
 ''I do think we're at the end of one of our cycles,'' said Kirk Henckels, a director and senior vice president of Stribling Private Brokerage, who described interest in the $4 million-and-up market as muted by ''some extraordinary overpricing lately'' and a ''pitifully low'' inventory. ''No one wants to go shopping in a store with nothing in it,'' he said, explaining that while some well-priced properties are still going quickly, he expects price reductions of 1 to 2 percent over the summer. ''This is a very value-oriented market.''
 Mr. Miller, whose appraisals include dwellings in the superluxury category, agreed. ''We're not seeing the intensity, the frequency of bidding wars,'' he said. ''There's a little bit longer marketing time for these properties. And that's partially because a significant portion of the inventory coming online over the past couple of years has addressed that segment, so that supply has tempered the frenzy.'' 
 Indeed, while new condo units under $2 million are selling briskly, properties above that are taking longer, said Andy Gerringer, a managing director and the head of new development projects at Prudential Douglas Elliman.
 The picture appears brighter, though not entirely cloudless, at the lower end of the real estate food chain. Brokers report brisk sales of properties costing less than $1 million. ''In our bread and butter, the $350,000-to-$750,000 market, things are O.K.,'' said Neil J. Binder, president of Bellmarc, citing falling mortgage rates as a motivating factor. He said his firm's inventory has jumped by 25 percent recently. 
 ''I don't see the same appreciation as last year,'' Mr. Binder said, ''but I do see a strong market. Last year they opened the door and there's five offers. Today they open the door and they have to do a little song and dance.''
 Still, Ms. Herman of Prudential Douglas Elliman noted, ''Anything at the low end of the market is always going to sell because there's always more people at that end of the pyramid.''
 Two listings held by Laura Matiz, a senior vice president in Bellmarc's East Side office, illustrate the schism that many see separating the two ends of the market. Both dwellings are in postwar Upper East Side buildings. The pricier one -- a two-bedroom 1,600-square-foot ''condop,'' a hybrid between a co-op and a condominium, on the 40th floor in a full-service building on East 89th Street near Fifth Avenue -- went for its asking price of $2.35 million on April 1, in a two-way bidding war. But both bids fell through later that month, and the apartment has garnered no further offers, despite a price drop to $2.1 million. Rather than carry it vacant, the investor-owner is considering taking it off the market and renting it out for $9,000 a month.
 Contrast this to the fate of a $299,000 studio on East 79th Street near York Avenue. The co-op, on the first floor of a full-service building, was sold in March near its asking price. The board rejected the buyer a few days after Memorial Day, and Ms. Matiz held an impromptu open house that weekend advertised only online. ''I got probably 12 people and three offers; it was a good crowd for a beautiful, hot summer afternoon,'' said Ms. Matiz, who predicted that the apartment will go into contract above asking price.
 Elaine Clayman, a senior vice president at Brown Harris Stevens with 15 listings in the $475,000-to-$750,000 range, said activity in the sector had quickened just since Memorial Day. 
 Other brokers, reporting a post-Memorial-Day rise in activity, were hopeful that the bubble coverage had worked its way through buyers' psyches. But the experience may have empowered buyers.
 Jerry Minsky, a senior vice president for Corcoran in Brooklyn, said that in a five-day period after Memorial Day, four buyers of properties in the $300,000-to-$700,000 range tried to lower their bids by 25 to 30 percent after signing contracts at asking price. 
 ''The buyers all systematically came back for cuts after they negotiated their contract, on the advice of their lawyer or mortgage broker,'' said Mr. Minsky, who advised his sellers to stand firm but said he could not predict whether they would.
 ''There is no economic reasoning behind this so-called bubble,'' he said. Mr. Minsky echoed others who noted that the fundamentals supporting New York's real estate market appear solid: low inventory, low mortgage rates and a decent economy. And, like others, he said he believed the spate of media coverage of a frothy housing market stoked anxiety during what is really a natural, seasonal slowing heading into the summer months. In fact, he said: ''I never got four or five bids a week in June. So where's the bubble?''
 Whether one exists may be beside the point. The direction of the market is also a state of mind.
 ''People have to hear it from several people about how things are different now, and then they change their minds,'' said Robert J. Shiller, the author of ''Irrational Exuberance'' (Princeton University Press; second edition, 2005) and a professor of economics at Yale University. Mr. Shiller shared the results of a Lexis-Nexis search he conducted among major newspapers: In May, 77 articles contained the words ''housing bubble,'' nearly double the 40 logged in April. 
 ''The market is so inertial that it just keeps going in the same direction, unlike the stock market,'' said Mr. Shiller, noting that real estate values have pushed northward for eight years, ''a huge trend.'' But if a drumbeat of public anxiety over housing values reverses the trend, the downward momentum could prove equally implacable. 
 ''I think there's a good chance that this is the end of the boom,'' he added, ''because it can't go on forever.''

HEADLINE: The Slow Struggle To Bring Back The Oyster

BYLINE: By SUSAN WARNER

DATELINE: CAPE SHORE 

 BODY:
THE cold, gray bay washes over the tiny oyster seeds nestled in plastic mesh bags. These baby oysters, cultivated by hand on a sandbar north of Cape May, may hold the future for a New Jersey industry that once flourished but is now gasping for breath.
 A handful of aquaculturists -- or fish farmers -- are trying to grow a new generation of oysters in this largely barren stretch on Delaware Bay just north of Cape May -- bred to be disease-resistant, spawned in temperature-regulated tanks and nursed on home-grown plankton.
 ''It's a lot of hard work,'' says Everett Marino, 66, who drives an hour each way, two to three times a week, to tend -- knee-deep in the tide -- his muddy crop of 200,000 to 300,000 oysters.
 A century ago, New Jersey's oyster business was in its prime. From 1880 to 1930, 1 million to 2 million bushels of oysters a year were harvested from beds in the lower part of Delaware Bay. (Each bushel contains about 285 oysters.) This year, the oystermen will be limited to a total of 26,203 bushels. In 1881, 675 oyster boats plied these waters. Today, 74 boats are licensed to take oysters in the state. 
 These days, Mr. Marino raises young oysters here, rotating the older survivors onto racks and rinsing them off when they become too muddy to try to prevent them from smothering. As they grow, he transplants them to a cove near his restaurant, Dill's Crab and Oyster Bar in Bridgeton. Yet after all that, 85 to 90 percent of the oysters die.
 To more-traditional oystermen, who dredge off the bay bottom the old-fashioned way, this new style of oyster farming seems strange and silly. 
 ''You'll never see me doing that,'' said Kenneth Bailey, who operates a dock in Bivalve and has been a waterman for 32 years. ''There's too much overhead. It's a pipe dream in my opinion.''
 Indeed, Steve Fleetwood, president of Bivalve Packing Company, the largest oyster harvester on the bay, said, ''We can sell in a day what they produce in a year.'' 
 So goes the current debate in the feast-or-famine oyster industry in the towns dotting the lower portion of Delaware Bay.
 Disease, changing tastes and development pressure have taken their toll on New Jersey's $14-million-a-year oyster industry, which has largely dwindled to a niche market for high-end seafood houses serving oysters on the half-shell. 
 ''I would like to see more shellfish cultivated and marketed, but for now the bulk of it is really a white-tablecloth market,'' said Sandra Shumway, professor of marine sciences at the University of Connecticut at Groton, who edits The Journal of Shellfish Research.
 In the glory days, towns along Delaware Bay like Bivalve were processing hubs where thousands of workers shucked and canned oysters that were shipped west by train to Chicago and even to California. On the East Coast, oysters were so abundant and cheap they were sold off carts the way hot dogs are today.
 But by the 1920's, the industry fell into decline as virgin beds became exhausted from overfishing. Then, in the late 1950's, bay oysters were nearly wiped out by a parasitic disease known as MSX, which was harmless to people but deadly for oysters. Just as the oysters developed resistance to MSX, however, a more virulent parasite, known as Dermo -- which also posed no danger to humans -- struck in the early 1990's.
 Once again, the industry struggled to come back, and did have a few good years in the late 1990's. But by this spring, the number of young oysters appeared to be at an all-time low after five years of abnormally high mortality, according to scientists at the Haskins Shellfish Research Laboratory of Rutgers University, which operates the hatchery here.
 Why the current dearth of baby oysters? The suspects include erratic changes in water temperature, variations in salinity, pollution, new predators or disease.
 ''We're puzzled,'' said Eric Powell, director of the Haskins laboratory. ''It could be any one of many things or some combination, but this is all new and it's all bad.'' 
 As a result, state officials cut the oystermen's total quota to 26,203 bushels this spring, down from 67,735 bushels in 2004. And last year's quota represented a gradual decline that began in 2001, when oystermen we allowed to take a total of 108,120 bushels.

'Harder to Make a Living'
 ''We can do that in a few days work,'' said Mr. Fleetwood, whose company also processes other types of seafood. ''It's getting harder and harder to make a living at it.''
 Last year, oysters valued at $1.8 million to $2 million on the wholesale market were harvested, and generated an additional $11 to $12 million in economic activity, Dr. Powell said.
 In the face of the latest difficulties, state officials, scientists from Rutgers and a handful of entrepreneurs like Mr. Marino are reviewing the industry and using aquaculture techniques to help nature along.
 ''God, unfortunately, has taken the babies away,'' Dr. Powell said. ''But we know how to respond to it. I don't think this is a hopeless situation.''
 The scientists from Rutgers are working with oyster growers on the lower bay to develop heartier, disease-resistant strains of the native Eastern oyster, which are found along the Atlantic seaboard from the Gulf of Mexico to the icy waters of Maine. In the meantime, the state and federal governments, along with oystermen, are financing a $700,000 effort to move clean, discarded shells onto sections of the bay bottom in the hopes of getting the oysters that spawn this summer to settle down and grow. 
 Oysters need a clean, hard surface to attach themselves to for about three years -- until they grow to three inches -- at which time they can be sold.
 At the same time -- with financing from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Public Service Electric and Gas and the State Commission on Science and Technology -- Rutgers is building a $5 million hatchery in Cape May to develop oyster brood stock as well as species of fish. The hatchery is a demonstration project in an effort to encourage private companies to get into aquaculture. 
 ''That is really the future,'' said Dr. Powell of the Haskins laboratory.
 Mr. Bailey, who operates the oyster dock in Bivalve, does not share that vision.
 ''What a waste of money,'' he said. 
 Similarly, Mr. Fleetwood of the Bivalve Packing Company contended that the state's oyster quotas were based on flawed research conducted by Haskins. He agreed that the population of young oysters was sparse, but he insisted that his boats were finding plenty of larger oysters on vast beds. Rather, he said he had urged the state to increase the quota; otherwise the older oysters would die off and go to waste.On average, oysters live four to six years in the bay, typically reaching market size in about three to four years.
 ''I've been running for 20 years, and these oysters right now are as good or better than I've ever seen,'' Mr. Fleetwood said.
 For his part, Mr. Bailey agrees, and contends that after decades on the bay he knows more than the researchers from Rutgers. ''They think they know it all,'' he said. ''They have no idea what's out there. I've got a Ph.D., too -- from being on the water all my life. I've seen things you can't get in a college classroom.''
 Despite the criticism, Dr. Powell's response was measured: ''When it is a big reduction like this you can anticipate a lot of unhappiness. It's understandable.''
 And rather than dismiss the baymen's complaints, he said, he had agreed to conduct additional studies of some of the areas that were not included in the scientific sampling used to set the quota. He conceded that perhaps there were sections of the bay that were considered to be areas of low-density growth but might indeed have a large number of market-size oysters. 
 His position was more flexible than that of Bradley M. Campbell, commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Protection, which regulates New Jersey's oyster industry. ''We think the quota is fair based on sound science, and we should be able to have a higher quota in future years,'' he said. ''That's one of the reasons we're investing in restoration projects.'' 
 In addition to disease and changes in the natural environment that can harm fragile baby oysters, Mr. Campbell said the industry was up against conflicts with recreational fishermen and development along the shoreline, which is limiting pier space for commercial fishing.
 Because of all these considerations, Dr. Powell said the Delaware Bay oyster industry would never return to its heyday. ''That was a fluke of bad management, and it will never happen again,'' he said.
 But he added that in 10 years it would be possible for the bay to produce annual harvests of 500,000 bushels of oysters.
 All sides in the debate over the future of oyster harvesting in Delaware Bay agree on at least one thing: The situation is not nearly as bad as in Chesapeake Bay, where officials are considering allowing the introduction of a hearty, non-native Asian oyster. Some scientists are concerned that the new species could introduce unforeseen problems.

Endangered or Not?
 To address the problem in the Chesapeake, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has agreed to consider a petition filed by a Maryland environmental consultant urging federal protection of the oyster beds along the entire Atlantic Coast under provisions of the Endangered Species Act. 
 For now, Mr. Campbell said, ''The science supporting our management quota would not support that finding'' -- that the oysters are endangered -- ''but each year we take a fresh look at the data.''
 Ms. Shumway, the editor of Journal of Shellfish Research, says the industry can be brought back to life with smart management, including aquaculture techniques, which are common on the West Coast. In Oregon and Washington, for instance, growers support huge hatcheries. As a result, oysters -- including many that are shipped to the East Coast -- are grown on racks in giant farms.
 As difficult as it is to grow oysters, Ms. Shumway says, the industry's greatest threat is man-made. ''The biggest obstacle to shellfish culture is the multiuse conflicts in coastal regions,'' she said. ''What it comes down to is, everybody says, 'It's wonderful, but not in my backyard.'''
 At low tide along the muddy flats at Cape Shore, a half-dozen oystermen tend their patches of baby oysters near the Rutgers hatchery. They push their crops, encased in plastic mesh bags, along the mud in wheelbarrows. Under big sun hats and baseball caps, they remain bent over their piece of bay for hours, looking like Chinese peasants farming rice.
 Daniel Cohen is among these new breeders. Mr. Cohen -- president of Atlantic Capes Fisheries, a large fishing fleet in Cape May -- and a group of investors have licensed technology developed by Rutgers to produce a sexless oyster that grows faster and meatier than oysters in the wild.
 Like Ms. Shumway, Mr. Cohen is optimistic. For one thing, he pointed out that regulation of commercial fishing along the East Coast dates back just 30 years, and is nearing the point where the supply of seafood is in balance with what commercial fishermen are taking.
 ''How do you get growth?'' Mr. Cohen asked. ''You use aquaculture.''
 So far, his experiment is running at a loss, but he is chalking it up as a learning experience.
 Along the beach at Cape Shore, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Marino are growing oysters that are being marketed on the East Coast as Cape May Salts. The oysters have won a following among some food writers and have been endorsed by the Slow Food movement, an Italian-based network of food enthusiasts who came together to protest the opening of a McDonald's in Rome in the late 1980's. The group is opposed to genetically modified foods and encourages local production of specialty foods.
 ''It's definitely a niche,'' Mr. Cohen said of his high-end oysters.
 At prices of up to $100 a bushel, oysters coming out of Delaware Bay can make a nice profit. 
 ''The value has increased to the point where you don't need the tremendous volume to be able to survive like you used to,'' said Mr. Fleetwood, whose company operates 10 boats.
 For decades, oystermen used to move oysters from spawning grounds to privately leased sections of the bay like farmers working their own fields. But that system was dismantled after disease struck in the early 1990's, leading the state to enact its current quota system.
 The old way was risky, but also rewarding, Mr. Bailey said. ''It was like going to the casino,'' he recalled. ''Now, you're guaranteed something, but we just don't get much.''

Oyster Harvests 'Run in Cycles'
 As Mr. Fleetwood said: ''These things run in cycles. There's been ups and downs. There's been good times and bad for everybody. It's one of those things where you just have to suck it up and don't spend too much money until it comes back.''
 Dr. Powell of the Haskins laboratory says intensive aquaculture, like the operations run by Mr. Cohen and Mr. Marino, may hold the promise of growth, but the traditional harvest of wild stock off the bed is also essential to maintain supply, at least until the new industry can begin to flourish in perhaps 10 years.
 Mr. Marino said the Rutgers hatchery under construction will help support small growers like himself who can begin to share growing hints the way the oystermen of Bivalve -- and before them native Americans -- have for generations.
 ''It's like anything else -- more than four or five guys have to be involved,'' he said. ''Then you can figure out the easier ways to do it.''
 For Mr. Marino and others tending their crops along the bay, there is a certain romance to cultivating the finicky oyster.
 ''My mother used to always ask me why I love oysters so much,'' he said. ''I don't know. I just like watching them grow from little seeds.'' 
 He said he also feels the weight of history and a responsibility to keep the once-powerful industry afloat. 
 ''Today we're struggling to keep it alive,'' he said, ''but the oyster is a natural resource of the Delaware Bay. We've got to preserve it, or at least keep it going as long as we can.''

HEADLINE: A Subliminal Message About a Frame-Up?

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN

 BODY:
GIVEN today's increasingly visual culture -- e-mail aside -- the formula that values a picture at 1,000 words may be truer than ever. This brings up the question: What, adjusting for deflation, are words worth? 
 One does not think of the painter Ed Ruscha as a text artist per se. But ''Course of Empire,'' which Mr. Ruscha created for the United States Pavilion of this year's Venice Biennale, reminds us just how deftly he uses language. Half of the piece is a suite of images of banal buildings bearing names like Tech-Chem and Tool & Die. The other half shows the same buildings years later, with different legends: Fat Boy, Chinese characters or nothing at all. 
 Mr. Ruscha, one of the art world's most talented iconographers, has not always needed words. Still, stripped down to their enigmatic selves, words -- Salt, Fats, Honk Lisp -- have been an integral part of his visual vocabulary, just as they are in the landscape of Los Angeles, where he has lived since the late 1940's. So it is appropriate that Mr. Ruscha should have a fondness for an object whose value rests to no small degree in its fine print. 
 A Southern-vernacular picture frame on a swiveling base, hand-carved with wood inlays, it looks like a charming prize you might find at a flea market anywhere in the United States, made by any dad in his workshop in the 1940's or 50's. But on the frame's white backing, where a picture would be displayed, is a small label that indicates a different sort of craftsman: ''Made by: Claude Stokes -- Murderer. Prisoner -- Life Sentence. Texas Prison System.'' 
 To some, the frame might seem a piece of gallows humor, its folksy charm belying its dark origin. But for Mr. Ruscha, the Riddler of the art world, the frame's allure is its ambiguity. 
 ''It carries with it a bit of a question mark,'' he said. ''Who was Claude Stokes? Did he sell these for cigarette money? It's got that little bit of mystery that I like. I tried to look up his name in the Texas prison system, and I haven't been able to locate anything about him.'' 
 Its style adds to its anonymity. The frame, though neatly executed, bears none of the obsessiveness that marks many prisoner artworks, like those of Frank Jones or Henry Ray Clark or the handbags woven out of empty cigarette packs. (An exhibition of cigarette-wrapper handbags made by prisoners will open on June 23 at the Ricco-Maresca Gallery in New York.) 
 Rarely have a frame and its image had such a tense, poetic relationship. Mr. Ruscha has never thought about putting something inside -- say, a picture of the girlfriend who gave it to him for Christmas many years ago. ''The label dramatizes the frame,'' he said. ''If it wasn't there, you'd look right through it.'' 
 It is an object unto itself. ''It's found art, without being a ready-made,'' he said. ''It's more particular, distinctive and anonymous.'' 
 Though Mr. Ruscha entertains fantasies about unearthing the story of Claude Stokes, he is not trying too hard. As much fun as it is to solve a riddle, the greater thrill is learning to live with the mystery.

MARRIAGE, A HISTORY
From Obedience to Intimacy,
Or How Love Conquered Marriage.
By Stephanie Coontz.
432 pp. Viking. $25.95.
 CONSIDER the story of Noah: all those eugenically suited pairs marching two by two into the ark for a 40-day, 40-night honeymoon cruise featuring high-seas adventure and no risk of erotic restlessness or romantic distraction. What an ingenious way to ensure the survival of the species! And how sad that marriage now seems so much more fraught with complication.
 Stephanie Coontz's informative and ambitious ''Marriage, a History'' charts the progress of this alternately (or even simultaneously) idealized and vilified institution as it has evolved over the centuries and has appeared, in remarkably diverse forms, in societies around the world. One of her central theses echoes the sobering discovery that each generation must make anew: the most apparently modish and outrageous sexual behavior has been around for longer than the young might care to imagine.
 Coontz reminds us that divorce and illegitimacy rates have at times been higher than they are today, and that the notion of same-sex marriage has occurred to lovers in other eras and places. Meanwhile -- and it's a strength of her book that she's willing to embrace contradictions -- many countries and cultures are currently gripped by a dramatic shift in their views of the emotional, social, economic and political consequences of a couple's decision to enter into whatever kind of folie a deux they and their neighbors recognize as a formal and binding union.
 Coontz begins by addressing the multiplicitous meanings of marriage -- as interpreted, for example, by African and Indonesian tribes in which husbands and wives neither live together nor pool their financial resources, or by matrilineal societies or, perhaps most strangely, by some Chinese and Sudanese who, in the interest of forming stronger kinship ties, encourage their children to contract ''ghost marriages'' with mates who have everything to recommend them except the fact that they're no longer among the living.
 Soon, however, the book turns to societies more like our own, in which marriage is generally understood to involve shared living quarters, a joint bank account and possibly even children. Coontz writes persuasively about the relative novelty of what she calls the ''love-based marriage'' (which she tracks back to the 18th century) and the ways in which the social unease occasioned by the French and American Revolutions actually caused gender roles to become more codified and rigid.
 If her attempt to channel the ruminations of our hunter-gatherer ancestors leads to some dubious speculations (''Couples in the Paleolithic world would never have fantasized about running off by themselves to their own little retreats in the forest''), Coontz is on firmer ground when she examines Greek and Roman attitudes toward love, marriage and extramarital attachments. But that still leaves plenty of territory to cover, and as she sprints along to the present both she and the reader can become somewhat breathless.
 ''Marriage, a History'' is based on some impressively broad research; footnotes take up almost a quarter of the book. (Though, inconveniently, there is no bibliography.) Yet, despite all this, you can't help thinking that the subject of each chapter might have -- and indeed already has -- merited entire books. And you may find yourself longing for the sort of depth a more narrowly focused and profound expertise might have provided.
 In the middle of Coontz's discussion of early Christianity, for example, I began thinking about the German theologian Uta Ranke-Heinemann's mordantly witty study of the church fathers' views on women and sexuality, ''Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven.'' And Coontz's argument that marriage was designed to consolidate and safeguard property (rather than protect or oppress women) will seem revelatory only to readers who slept through the college lecture in which it was explained that Friedrich Engels reached essentially the same conclusion in the 1880's.
 Perhaps it's ungrateful to ask more from a book that already offers so much. Nearly every page has some useful or provocative tidbit, particularly for the would-be historical novelist. Consider, say, the dramatic possibilities in the statement that ''under Athenian law, a man's seduction of another's wife was punishable by death, but the rape of another man's wife merited only a monetary fine.'' And try to imagine the domestic intrigue of a royal court like Charlemagne's, which was filled with his concubines and with his daughters' illegitimate offspring, thanks to his high tolerance for extramarital sex. What sort of union might have followed from the 1413 Derbyshire marriage contract drawn up with one name left blank ''because the bride's father hadn't yet decided which daughter to marry off''? There's even some perverse enjoyment to be derived from the words of a psychiatrist, writing in 1953, that a 20-year-old woman without ''a man in sight'' had better start worrying that she'll never find a mate.
 It does seem, however, that Coontz's book may be attempting too much -- and thus suffering from a surfeit of only partly digested (and consequently indigestible) information. What might the average reader take away from a typical paragraph, crammed to bursting with facts, statistics, surveys, examples and counterexamples? Or from entire chapters that begin to buzz like a kind of frenetic chatter?
 In the end, Coontz's book raises fewer questions about the subject of marriage than it does about the subject of nonfiction in general -- about the reasons we read it. Is it possible, in this age when information (or misinformation) is so readily available on the Internet, that the broadly generalist survey isn't as necessary and helpful as it once was? Might it not be much more satisfying to read books like Wayne Koestenbaum's meditation on opera, ''The Queen's Throat''? Or Alain de Botton's ''How Proust Can Change Your Life,'' Christopher Woodward's ''In Ruins,'' Victoria Finlay's ''Color'' or Sue Halpern's ''Migrations to Solitude''? Those books offer multiple pleasures: the rewards of instruction on a possibly unfamiliar subject combined with the delights of narrative style, of graceful language and, most important, of encountering a uniquely engaging sensibility -- watching someone make daring leaps and unpredictable associations. That's the book on marriage I'd like to read: one where the chatter of information is punctuated by periods of relative quiet, the sort of silence in which, paradoxically, you can hear the distinctive voice of a writer.

HEADLINE: Constructing Jobs

BYLINE: By Charles B. Rangel. 
Charles B. Rangel is a Democratic representative from New York.

 BODY:
HAVE New Yorkers lost their chutzpah? The demise of the proposed Jets stadium on the Far West Side (and the attendant blow to the city's 2012 Olympic hopes), along with the politically induced inertia at the World Trade Center site, has led to speculation that the Big Apple is turning into a crab apple. So the Op-Ed Page approached several prominent New Yorkers with a question: If the city wants to start thinking big again, where should it start? Their suggestions follow.
 WE suffer an unemployment rate of nearly 30 percent among black and Latino young people. This crisis must be addressed through the city's commitment to recruit, train and open the doors of union membership to unemployed minority youths. 
 To that end, we should rebuild Lower Manhattan and pursue three additional projects. We should develop the Hudson River waterfront from 125th to 131st Streets and the upland area from the piers to Broadway to include entertainment venues, open spaces, housing and office space. We should rebuild the Victoria Theater site on 125th Street to include a performing arts theater, a museum, rehearsal space, condominiums and offices. And we should create a plaza of stores -- big box and otherwise -- on the river in East Harlem. The projects are not meant to be substitutes for the stadium; they are meritorious in themselves, both in their purpose and in the thousands of construction jobs they will create for young people.

HEADLINE: In a Real Estate Boom, Many Try Life as a Landlord

BYLINE: By AMY ZIPKIN

 BODY:
THREE years ago, Stacey Wunsch, 34, bought a one-bedroom apartment in Jersey City for $285,000. Its building had a health club and views of Manhattan.
 When she married last year and then became pregnant, she needed more space. In September, she and her husband moved to a three-bedroom ranch home in the nearby suburb of Haworth, N.J. 
 When a golf course began taking shape next to her former apartment building, she decided to keep the unit as an investment. She refinanced from a 6 percent fixed-rate 30-year mortgage to the ''monthly Treasury average'' type of adjustable mortgage, which lets her pay an interest-only rate of 1.2 percent for the first year. 
 Although her maintenance charges are $610 a month, her expenses for the mortgage and taxes fell by $476, to $1,170.(But her monthly mortgage payment can be increased by 7.5 percent each year.) She started shopping for a tenant.
 With the stock market stalled, homeowners nationwide are tapping their equity and taking advantage of continued low interest rates to make the most of real estate investing. 
 In early March, the National Association of Realtors released a study showing that last year, 23 percent of all homes were bought for investment income, while 13 percent were bought as vacation homes, which could provide investment income, too. A record 2.82 million second homes changed hands in 2004, up 16 percent from 2003. 
 Speculators should tread carefully, though, and not only because of the unexpected expenses that pop up with ownership, say those who have taken the plunge. They warn that as so many people rush to buy, reliable tenants may be hard to find and that if the market turns, selling can take months.
 Indeed, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has warned that there may be ''a bubble in housing prices in the United States that will at some point implode.'' 
 In the last few years, real estate investments have come with different strategies -- and challenges. Whether a property makes money, of course, can depend on location, competition for tenants and even the type of financing chosen.
 David Brooks, 47, a publicist from Caldwell, N.J., had owned a home for a dozen years when he and his wife decided to buy Cape Cod property in 2002. He turned to real estate after asking himself, ''Is the next stock I buy going to be the next Enron?'' 
 With a $300,000 spending limit, they settled on a four-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath house in Harwich, Mass. Its monthly mortgage, plus taxes and insurance, is $1,650. 
 Instead of having one year-round tenant, they chose to offer a rental for the school year and weekly rentals in the summer. The school-year tenant, from September to June, pays $1,100 a month, with a June premium of $2,200. The weekly rental charge is $1,200. 
 Mr. Brooks finds many tenants by word of mouth, but he kept a rental agent on retainer as property manager, paying her 12.5 percent of his weekly rentals. ''I can't just jump on the New England Thruway when a light bulb blows,'' he said. 
 Recently, though, the property manager left, and his backup, his housekeeper, departed to open a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont. He considered alternatives: do-it-yourself management, hiring the housekeeper's partner or hiring another rental agent. He opted for the housekeeper's partner, whom he will pay 6 percent a week for property management during the summer in addition to a weekly cleaning fee. He said the cost of a professional agent, at 15 percent, would have been too much because he finds many of his tenants himself. 
 His distance from his property is an anomaly, real estate specialists say. Most owners of investment property venture no more than 18 miles from their homes when they buy, and owners of vacation homes typically stay within 50 miles, according to the National Association of Realtors.
 Even if there is a property manager, some things can go wrong. Last summer, Mr. Brooks rented the house in Harwich to six men. During their weeklong stay, the refrigerator broke. Mr. Brooks says the unit may have been fixable, but he called a local appliance dealer instead and bought a refrigerator by phone. He says he learned two lessons: ''You have to deal with expedience, even if it costs you a few bucks'' and ''you just hope for reasonableness on the part of the tenant.'' He bought some beer for the men to make up for the inconvenience.
 Keelyn Mulvey, a fund-raiser in Rye, N.Y., owns three co-op units in White Plains and houses in Vermont and Florida. 
 Ms. Mulvey bought the Vermont house for $240,000 in 2002, after selling another Westchester apartment for $125,000, double the price she paid in 1984. The Vermont house, in West Dover, is near a ski resort and has three bedrooms and two baths; tenants pay rent of $300 to $550 a night. 
 She advertises for tenants on Craigslist in Boston and New York, and although she has a caretaker for the house, she describes herself as a hands-on manager. She says she travels to Vermont twice a month, often sprucing up the property. The $12,000 she received for rentals last winter is being used for improvements. In February, she installed a gas stove in the kitchen and a wood-burning stove for $6,000; she has just completed a basement renovation. 
 The Internal Revenue Service requires an investor to report all income, but expenses for maintenance, rental management and utilities are deductible. How often an owner uses a property himself determines whether mortgage interest or taxes can be deducted. 
 In early 2003, Ms. Mulvey paid $220,000 for a home with three bedrooms and two and a half baths in Jupiter, Fla. She knew the area and school district because her parents had lived nearby, in Juno Beach, for 30 years. She narrowed her search for a home by going somewhat inland to avoid potential hurricane damage. Last year, when Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne made landfall, the property, a mile from the Atlantic Ocean, was secure. 
 She charges monthly rent of $1,400 to $2,300, depending on the season. 
 Specialists say her strategy is sound. ''The people who run into trouble are the ones who don't treat it as a business,'' said David Lereah, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors and author of ''Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?'' (Currency). Mr. Lereah advises homeowners to consider worst-case situations. ''If you can't afford to pay the mortgage and you're not collecting rent,'' he said, ''you can't afford to be in the property.'' He recommends having a three- to six-month cash reserve. 
 Economic downturns pose their own sets of challenges for owners. David C. Ling, director of the Center for Real Estate Studies at the University of Florida at Gainesville, had to deal with such problems after he moved there from Dallas in 1989 and could not sell his Dallas home. ''People dramatically underestimate their out-of-pocket expenses'' in such circumstances, he said.
 Real estate prices in Dallas plummeted after oil prices fell in 1985 and remained depressed after the stock market downturn of 1987. Unable to sell, he chose to rent and hired a property manager. One tenant signed a lease but did not show, Mr. Ling said, and another did not pay rent on time. ''You worry about whether the management is looking after the property and you worry whether the agent is looking out for your best interest,'' he said. 
 When he later decided to sell, he was restricted to times when a tenant's lease was expiring, and even then there were hurdles. ''How cooperative do you think a tenant is to clean up the garage or the kitchen because the broker is coming over?'' Mr. Ling asked. In 1996, he sold the property for 30 percent less than he paid for it in 1985. 
 ''People have been reading how good an asset class real estate is for a decade,'' he said. ''People have pretty short memories and are overly optimistic about gains in housing stock.'' 
 AS for Ms. Wunsch, in New Jersey, she says that based on neighbors' experiences, she thought she would find a tenant for the Jersey City apartment within a month. When advertising in local newspapers did not pan out, she resorted to renting temporarily to the parents of a neighbor who was expecting a baby. 
 Finally, she listed her apartment with another resident who had become a real estate broker. One potential tenant was a bad credit risk, she said, and another wanted a larger unit. Then the real estate agent told her that two prospective tenants thought the 1980's-era kitchen was dated, so she arranged to have new appliances and a granite counter top installed for $2,500. 
 Her broker finally found a tenant, who signed a one-year lease and moved in two days after the kitchen renovation was completed. But Ms. Wunsch and her husband had to dip into savings to pay for the renovation and the mortgage while the apartment sat vacant. ''I thought it would be easier to find people,'' she said. But she now realizes that because of the building boom along the Jersey City waterfront nearby, most people wanted to buy, not rent.

QUICK READ
Keep these points in mind when considering buying property as an investment, real estate specialists and landlords say.

Stay close to home. Specialists say owners should be able to reach a property quickly, to deal with any problems.

Have a cash reserve in case you can't find or replace a tenant. A minimum reserve of three to six months' worth of mortgage payments and other expenses is considered essential, on top of any reserve you already have for a job loss, for example.

Before you buy, ask an accountant to estimate possible cash flow and a local real estate agent to advise you on rental patterns in neighborhoods you are considering.

Expect to hang on to the property, and do not expect fast profits.

HEADLINE: Can England's Most Artful Power Plant Turn Up the Juice?

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
THE vast brick-faced power plant standing across the Thames from St. Paul's Cathedral still seems like an implausible home for a major museum, but that no longer worries Londoners. In the five years since Tate Modern opened, it has become a phenomenon: social, economic, urban, even artistic. And here, it seems, success counts more than appearance.
 True, the Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron did an imaginative job converting the monolithic building. They left its 350-foot-high chimney, raised the ''skirt'' of its facade at ground level and added a new glass-fronted top floor. Inside, they created three floors of exhibition space and left its cavernous Turbine Hall as a challenge to artists and curators.
 But the real alchemy occurred when the people arrived. From its first days, Tate Modern drew crowds, devoted as much to discovering London's first modern-art museum as to hanging out in its large bookstore, its cafes and its top-floor restaurant overlooking the river. Indeed, helped by free admission (except for temporary shows), it has become a genuine public space. 
 Little wonder, then, that for its fifth birthday, Tate Modern is blowing its own trumpet. Since May 2000, it boasts, it has received close to 22 million visitors. And between April 2004 and March 2005, the number was 4.15 million, surpassing, for instance, the 3.6 million visitors to the Pompidou Center in Paris during the same period. (It is too early to make a similar comparison to the ''new'' Museum of Modern Art in New York.) In 2004, 60 percent of Tate Modern's visitors were under 35, and 40 percent were repeat visitors.
 So, yes, Sir Nicholas Serota, 59, the Tate's director since 1988 and the man who took the gamble of creating Tate Modern and dividing the Tate's collection into post-1900 international art and British art, has reason to feel vindicated.
 Certainly, not everyone has been won over; not Matthew Collings, an independent art critic, who says that hip has become hype. As he recently told BBC Radio, ''that the relationship of that museum to art is one of solemn pretentiousness coupled with a sort of inane silliness.''
 But to those who say people visit the museum mainly to socialize, Sir Nicholas can now afford a dry retort: ''It's a kind of myth that, in the 1950's and 1960's, people came to museums only to look at art and now they come only to drink coffee.''
 The museum's timing was impeccable. From the early 1990's, thanks to the mischievous antics of the so-called Young British Artists like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, and the marketing skills of the collector Charles Saatchi, contemporary art became all the rage here. Even tabloid ridicule of the annual Turner Prize -- is this art? -- kept it in the news. And then Tate Modern appeared, wrapping new art in respectability.
 Yet for all its popularity, Tate Modern is still a work in progress, starting with the building itself. ''It always takes time for any institution to learn to manipulate the instrument it has created, and it has taken us time, and I think we haven't quite got hold of the building,'' Sir Nicholas said over coffee in his office in the old Tate Gallery near Westminster, now the Tate Britain. ''Some things have worked well. Turbine Hall has been a startling success. But the layout of the galleries can create the sense that you are on a conveyor belt.''
 One solution is a new extension planned for the south side of the building, he said, to cost an estimated $300 million. Here, he went on, galleries would be designed more as destination spaces than as corridors, not least because they would be displaying less traditional art forms -- installations, architecture, video and film -- a diversification that, perchance, mirrors the broad mission of the Pompidou Center.
 Yet what has really prompted the Tate's trustees to invite the firm of Herzog & de Meuron to design the new extension is, again, success. Sir Nicholas said he had originally imagined a need to seek new space around 2010, but the museum's large crowds -- averaging 11,200 a day -- made it necessary sooner. Further, the French utilities company Electricite de France Energy, which still occupies part of the building, is planning to upgrade its equipment and will soon be freeing new areas.
 But there is another reason. Even more than Shakespeare's Globe Theater, which opened 100 yards away in 1997, Tate Modern has energized this long-neglected Southwark neighborhood. Art galleries and restaurants have sprung up, buildings are being renovated, and new ones are appearing. Nearby, for instance, the Iraqi-born British architect Zaha Hadid is building a new exhibition center for Britain's Architecture Foundation, her first project in London.
 ''We also have to develop a plan because our neighbors are beginning to come forward with plans for major office and residential buildings and, if all those are completed, they would probably restrict what we could do in the long term,'' Sir Nicholas said. ''We have to tell Southwark what we're planning to do -- and we're going to do so this year.''
 As it happens, the threat of unwanted neighbors is real. A development group has acquired a small property barely 30 yards from the ramp leading down to Turbine Hall, where it plans to build a high-rise that would soar above Tate Modern. Attempts by local residents -- and by the Tate -- to block the project have so far failed, but a residents' association has now taken the case to the European Court of Human Rights.
 Still, for all the talk of real estate, what about the art? Sir Nicholas has long tired of conceding that Tate Modern's early-20th-century collection is weak, especially compared with the Modern's in New York and the Pompidou's in Paris. ''We obviously can't fill these holes other than by a gift from an individual collection,'' he explained, ''and in this country, at least, there are not big collectors. What we can do, however, is to try to acquire major works from the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's. Of course the market pushes up prices, particularly in the United States, but there are opportunities.''
 The Tate empire as a whole -- Tate Modern, Tate Britain, Tate Liverpool and Tate St. Ives -- has only about $8 million to spend each year on new acquisitions. Sir Nicholas has therefore looked for donations by leading British artists. So far, with pledges from 30 artists, 8 works have been delivered.
 In the meantime, Tate Modern will rotate art from its permanent collection every six years, with the first new display scheduled for next year.
 Vicente Todoli, the museum's director, said somewhat murkily: ''It will be neither thematic nor chronological, although in some areas the public will sense time, and other areas may suggest themes. It will have a lot do with movements of art, confrontations, hubs, cross-sections. But it will start from the strengths of the collection, not from an idea.''
 When it comes to temporary exhibitions, Tate Modern has an advantage. It naturally counts on blockbusters to fill its cash box, and it is looking to its new Frida Kahlo retrospective, which was to open on June 9, to pull in the crowds. But with smaller shows, it is also introducing the art of non-Britons like Giorgio Morandi, Sigmar Polke, Luc Tuymans and Arte Povera artists, to the public here.
 That these shows are also popular is a measure of the remarkable awakening to modern and contemporary art in Britain today. And in promoting this interest, Tate Modern is accompanied by the Whitechapel Gallery, the Serpentine Gallery and the Royal Academy of Arts (which presented the infamous 1997 ''Sensation!'' show by Young British Artists from Mr. Saatchi's collection). But Tate Modern is the proof that modern art has come here to stay.
 ''The success of Tate Modern has been so complete and so far-reaching that it takes an effort to remember a time when it did not exist,'' Richard Dorment, the respected art critic of The Daily Telegraph of London, wrote in his anniversary tribute. ''Today, London is acknowledged to be the center of the art world, a role that once belonged to Paris and then New York.''
 So, Sir Nicholas was asked, did he now intend to follow the Guggenheim Museum of New York and the Pompidou in expanding his empire abroad?
 ''The empire is built,'' he replied with a smile. 
 He sounded convincing. More or less.

HEADLINE: Federal Audit Says Lender Exploited Subsidy Rules

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
A nonprofit student loan company in New Mexico improperly exploited a federal subsidy program that guaranteed it 9.5 percent interest on loans, a federal Department of Education auditor has found. The auditor recommended the recovery of millions of dollars in overpayments. 
 A Department of Education spokeswoman, Stephanie Babyak, said that the recommendation was being reviewed and that department policy barred her from making additional comments. 
 Before the audit report was issued May 25, the New Mexico Education Assistance Foundation, the subject of the audit, went to federal court in Albuquerque, trying unsuccessfully to stop its publication and asking the court to direct the department not to enforce the recommendation. 
 The 9.5 percent loan guarantee was established in the 1980's, when interest rates were high, to keep lenders in the low-interest college loan business. Congress tried to phase out the guarantee in 1993, but the loans ballooned as lenders exploited a loophole allowing them to refinance pre-1993 loans at the 9.5 percent rate.
 The report found that the New Mexico lender had wrongly received payments for two classes of loans: those that had been used as security for a new bond after the pre-1993 bond had been retired, and those financed by bonds issued after Oct. 1, 1993, the cutoff date in the legislation. 
 Elwood G. Farber, the loan company president, said the firm had acted under Education Department guidelines allowing lenders to refinance their pre-1993 bonds. 
 ''I totally disagree with the findings, which are based on a misinterpretation of the guidance and the statute,'' Mr. Farber said. ''If we have to pay back the government, the real-world effect is that our student borrowers' rates will go up.'' 
 In a letter to Education Secretary Margaret Spellings last week, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and a prime critic of the loan guarantee, said the inspector general's report and recommendations ''potentially have multibillion-dollar budget implications far beyond the single lender studied'' and urged the department to audit all lenders that claim entitlement to the subsidies. 
 Other critics saw the New Mexico audit as a possible signal of broader action.
 ''This is a potentially big moment, because it points to the possibility that a lot of these payments have been illegal and could be recovered,'' said Robert Shireman, an education policy adviser in the Clinton administration who now directs the Institute for College Access and Success. ''This is a moment when the department could take the bull by the horns and save taxpayers some money.'' 
 With borrowers paying as little as 3 percent in the recent low-interest-rate years, student loan companies have had an incentive to find ways to expand their portfolios of loans subsidized at the 9.5 percent rate. 
 According to federal records, Nelnet, a major student loan company, billed the government for $48.7 million in quarterly subsidy payments in June 2004, compared with $4.6 million at the end of 2002. 
 Mr. Shireman said it was unclear just how widespread the practices described in the audit had been. Until now, he said, the data available on the 9.5 percent loans have been the amounts billed the government; the audit, for the first time, traced the genealogy of the tax-exempt bonds that finance the loans to assess what actually took place before and after Oct. 1, 1993. 
 Last fall, Congressional Democrats accused the Education Department of being lax in preventing loan companies from exploiting the loophole, in part because of the Bush administration's political connections with lenders. 
 The Education Department said that it was following policies established by the Clinton administration and that it lacked the authority to close the loophole. But a Government Accountability Office report said the department could have stopped the program at any time. 
 In October, Congress unanimously passed a bill to help close the loophole, but the legislation was to last only a year, and it allowed lenders to reinvest their income at the same high subsidized rates. 
 In April, federal subsidies to lenders were as high as ever, with most government officials saying they would remain that way for months. 
 Payments to lenders under the guaranteed rate rose to $262 million for the first quarter of the 2005 fiscal year, about $22 million more than in the last quarter of fiscal 2004, before the legislation. It was unclear why the payments increased.

HEADLINE: Yes, Virginia, There Is an Answer

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
WEIRD things are happening in this economy.
 It's not the first time. Three decades ago, economists working with simple models were confused by stagflation -- the one-two punch of high inflation and weak demand.
 Today, a different mystery confronts them. Economic growth has strengthened, but inflation remains low. On top of that, the stock market is slumping. Throw in the combination of a sagging dollar and a string of record trade deficits, and you have a full-blown enigma. 
 Or do you? There is an explanation that fits all these facts. It may not be the only one, and it may not even be the best for any single fact, on its own. Still, it's worth considering.
 It has to do with one of the most fundamental aspects of the American economy: competition.
 Competition is the magic ingredient that determines who wins big in markets. Whatever group faces less competition -- the buyers or the sellers -- tends to get the upper hand. When a market has only one buyer or seller, that person or company can grab all the bargaining power, setting the most advantageous price.
 The federal government has watched over markets, ostensibly to ensure some degree of competition, since the Sherman Antitrust Act became law in 1890. The government has generally focused on the supply side and on companies doing business nationwide, like the old Bell Telephone and Microsoft.
 At the state and local levels, enforcement has been harder to come by. Yet the very size of those markets naturally works against competition. In a small suburb, a rural area or in any geographically isolated region, it's easier for one or two businesses to corner a market.
 And that's where the changes have occurred. Creating a local monopoly is harder than it used to be. For one thing, television, telephones and the Internet are powerful tools for reaching into local markets. When a home shopping channel appears on cable television, or when someone sets up a store on an auction Web site, it's just like a new shop opening on Main Street in every town in America.
 As a result, sellers of goods and services have less power in thousands of markets. Competing against one another, they end up supplying their products at prices closer to their costs. The sellers' profits fall, but the well-being of consumers rises; they're getting the same useful things for less money. 
 In theory, society is better off when this happens. But at the very least, there's a redistribution of well-being from sellers to buyers. Shareholders are probably the primary losers, at least in the short run. Even consumers who don't use the Internet or shopping channels benefit, as long as other consumers use them.
 If the first competitive force pushing down prices seems obvious, the second is even more so. It's Wal-Mart Stores, and all the other enormous retailers of its ilk.
 Wal-Mart has another kind of market power, that of the top buyer. The company wrings enough out of its own suppliers that it can keep prices low for consumers -- and the regulators quiet. Hypothetically, Wal-Mart could decide one day to become a local monopolist, taking over small markets and then pushing prices sky-high. For now, however, that doesn't seem to have happened. 
 Nevertheless, wherever Wal-Mart goes, it instantly becomes the biggest player. Smaller stores have to lower their prices, find other ways to hang onto customers, or fold. Again, at least from the standpoint of price, all consumers win, even if they don't shop at Wal-Mart.
 So what's the upshot? The economy keeps growing. Profits lag, so the stock market stays mired in the muck. In the long term, lower profits may mean less money invested in capacity and innovation.
 In the short term, consumers can take advantage of lower prices. They may even use the money they save to buy more imports. But exports aren't necessarily less expensive -- market conditions may not have changed abroad -- so the trade balance may deteriorate.
 IT'S rare that a single phenomenon can explain a whole set of economic circumstances. But it's also rare that a logical explanation for such circumstances is completely wrong. If new sources of competition are indeed affecting prices, the situation presents a challenge for policy makers, especially the Federal Reserve.
 Usually, the Fed tries to monitor the economy for overheating, which happens when spiking demand for goods and services sends prices spiraling higher. To cool the economy down, the Fed raises interest rates.
 In this case, prices are under control, and not because of weak demand. The need for much higher interest rates is remote. Yet the Fed still has to be vigilant. The two trends that put a leash on prices will run their course, perhaps even at the same time. If that happens, let's hope that the Fed hasn't been lulled to sleep at the switch.

HEADLINE: Ultra-High-End Homes, Built on Faith

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
IN Rye, the developer Gary Hirsch is building a $9 million home with a 1,000-square-foot master bedroom suite, a gas fireplace, a marble bath and a sitting room with views of the morning sun rising over Long Island Sound. The 11,000-square-foot house on two acres also has a winding staircase, 17 large rooms, a wine cellar, a home theater with stadium seating for 12 people and a gym. 
 Even more stunning than the home's features is the fact that Mr. Hirsch, chairman of Elk Homes, is building it on speculation; he doesn't have a buyer yet, although he said he was certain that in Westchester's explosive real estate market, a purchaser would come along sooner rather than later. Likely prospects include high-placed corporate executives relocating from elsewhere in the country, Wall Street types from Manhattan or residents of surrounding suburbs who have been lusting for such a luxury property. 
 In Bedford, Joseph Simone, a developer whose company, Simone Development, specializes in commercial projects, started a housing division five years ago in response to Westchester's booming residential market. He is now building Stone Manors on Twin Lakes, where the estate-style homes, each on four to five acres, start at $3 million and can exceed $7 million when extras like elevators are added.
 (The elevators, Mr. Simone said, are not to lure empty-nesters. Rather, these houses are for families with children, and the elevators can be handy when lugging suitcases from the upstairs bedrooms to the garage before a vacation, said the builder, whose commercial properties include the Hutchinson Metro Center, an office complex in the Bronx.)
 Mr. Simone is completing construction of 14 luxury residences built on speculation at Stone Manors at Purchase, a project that sold out in fewer than 18 months, as well as several houses in another Purchase development. Like some of the homes in Purchase, the new houses in Bedford will have circular staircases, soaring ceilings, three-car garages and kitchens with the latest bells and whistles.
 ''There's a big demand for this kind of luxury housing in an area within a reasonable commute to Manhattan,'' said Mr. Simone, whose privately held company has been selected to build a $175 million condominium tower, retail space and municipal parking garage project in New Rochelle.
 National census figures show that the average income for the top 0.1 percent of the population was $3 million in 2000. Adjusted for inflation, that figure is two and a half times the number that was reported in 1980. 
 ''Nationally, there are a lot more people who can afford very high-priced homes,'' observed Gopal Ahluwalia, staff vice president for the National Association of Home Builders, a trade organization in Washington, ''and people are moving up.'' 
 Still, homes selling in the United States for more than $1 million, according to Mr. Ahluwalia, represent less than 1 percent of the residential real estate market. The major markets for superluxury homes are San Francisco, San Diego, New York, Washington and some parts of Florida, Mr. Ahluwalia said.
 Out of 337,486 households in Westchester, 35,048 -- more than 10 percent -- have annual median incomes of $200,000 or more, current census figures show, with more of them in Scarsdale that any other community. 
 Of the 2,919 single-family homes on the market in the county, 182 are being offered for $3 million or more, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors in White Plains. Of those, 63 have been built since 2000, according to George M. Stone, manager of the Julia B. Fee real estate agency in Rye. From June 1, 2003, to the end of May in 2004, 70 homes sold in Westchester for $3 million or more, Mr. Stone said. In the next 12 months, the figure rose to 88 homes.
 The demand for building lots, Mr. Stone said, is particularly strong in central Westchester -- Scarsdale, Rye, Harrison, Purchase and Mamaroneck -- where they are few and far between.
 Mr. Simone, who occasionally tears down existing homes on prime building lots to make way for new luxury homes, said, ''I'm constantly on the lookout for building sites in these locations.''
 One recent tear-down project is a home on seven acres in Purchase where Herman Tarnower, the celebrity Scarsdale diet doctor, was murdered in 1980 by Jean Harris. The Tarnower house, a brownish-gray contemporary with a bullet hole still in a bedroom wall, Mr. Simone said, will be razed to make way for two luxury homes, one with a tennis court and swimming pool and the other with a pool and a pond.
 In another project on property formerly owned by a well known person in Westchester, the Bedford architect Carol J.W. Kurth is designing homes on land that was part of Stonwin Farm, the family estate in Scarsdale of the jeweler Harry Winston.
 The 11 houses, which are being built by Fortune Home Builders, are selling for $3 million and up, said Jeffrey Doynow, one of the developers. ''Customers in this market like their houses to look old on the outside but to have all the modern conveniences inside,'' he said.
 Many of those customers, Ms. Kurtz said, ''are dual-career clients, with maybe the woman staying home temporarily to raise a family.'' Ms. Kurtz's designs include a minimum of five bedrooms on the second floor and lots of closets, and a nanny's room elsewhere in the house. 
 Her clients -- some have apartments in New York City and vacation homes elsewhere -- also want home offices, a movie theater and billiards room, and other features that make a house feel like a ''hotel at home,'' she said, ''like an indoor pool where you can go and take a swim before bed.''
 One strong new trend these days in upscale housing is the conversion of what used to be called the basement to what is now referred to as ''the lower level of the house,'' said Michael P. Castaldi, a custom home developer. ''The day of the old dark mildewed basement is done,'' said Mr. Castaldi, whose company, MPC Industries, is building two $6 million houses on speculation in Rye.
 With more efficient waterproofing methods available, higher ceilings -- as much as 10 feet 6 inches high, in some cases -- and larger windows and better lighting, the former basement is fast becoming the location for extensive wine cellars, second cooking areas, theaters and well-equipped home gyms.
 But along with the glitz and glamour of marketing such houses, there are risks, Mr. Castaldi said, sounding a note of caution. ''It hasn't yet happened to me, but what about a bubble?'' he said.
 ''Some people say the luxury market is immune, but that's not necessarily true,'' he explained. ''When and if the market corrects, it's usually not a forgiving market, so a builder -- especially a builder of luxury homes -- has to have all of his ducks in a perfect row.''
 After often paying more than $1 million for the land itself, Mr. Castaldi said, when a luxury home is completed and not sold, ''the clock keeps ticking, and the big bite of taxes and utilities still have to be paid.''

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE

BYLINE: By Nicolai Ouroussoff

 BODY:

It's hard to think of an architecture that conjures more grim associations than the housing projects conceived in New York City between 1968 and 1975. A show at the CENTER FOR ARCHITECTURE offers a more nuanced view of these urban projects, which many consider one of architecture's most miserable failures. Today, their unbridled optimism may even spark a brief moment of nostalgia. Center for Architecture, 536 LaGuardia Place, Greenwich Village, (212)683-0023, through Sept. 10.

For an example of how much that landscape has changed, wander up to the MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK, where a number of architectural works by the Mexican firm TEN ARQUITECTOS are on view. The show focuses on a range of visions for New York projects, from a soaring residential-and-commercial tower in Spanish Harlem composed of glass and concrete slabs to a residential glass tower in TriBeCa whose facade looks as intricate as lace. Richly articulated, the works offer a more refined but cautious take on the contemporary city. Museum of the City of New York, Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672, through Oct. 30.

Finally, a grass-roots design approach can be gleaned at the MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, where a 20-foot model of the HIGH LINE project is suspended from the ceiling on cables. A segment of elevated tracks in the Manhattan meatpacking district that is being converted into a public park, the High Line has already sparked a stream of development projects by emerging firms like NEIL DENARI ARCHITECTS and WORK ARCHITECTURE COMPANY. But its allure stems from the delicacy with which it promises to weave together a variety of creative visions -- all in the service of the public interest. The Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212)708-9400, through Oct. 31.

The demise of the proposed Jets stadium on the Far West Side (and the attendant blow to the city's 2012 Olympic hopes), along with the politically induced inertia at the World Trade Center site, has led to speculation that the Big Apple is turning into a crab apple. So the Op-Ed Page approached several prominent New Yorkers with a question: If the city wants to start thinking big again, where should it start? Their suggestions follow.
 MARSHALL McLUHAN waited for the reporter's lips, mine, in fact, to stop moving, leaned back in his seat in the rear garden of that year's (1967) restaurant of the century, Lutece, looked up at a brilliant blue New York-in-May sky, lifted a forefinger and twirled it above his head in a loop that took in the 30-, 40-, 50-story buildings that rose all around and said, apropos of nothing anybody at the table had been talking about:
 ''Of course, a city like New York is obsolete. People will no longer concentrate in great urban centers for the purpose of work. New York will become a Disneyland, a pleasure dome ...''
 At that stage of his mutation from unknown Canadian English teacher to communications swami and international celebrity, cryptic, Delphic, baffling, preposterous predictions were McLuhan's trump suit. Intellectuals argued over whether he was a genius or a dingbat. If the case of New York is any proof, however, the man was a pure genius.
 Twenty-first century New York is fast becoming what Marshall McLuhan saw as he looked up in that garden out back at Lutece almost 40 years ago: a one-industry town, strictly in the pleasure dome business, with a single sales pitch, ''You're Gonna Love Gothamland.''
 When it comes to the industries that created the metropolis 100 years ago, New York, like many big American cities, is a ghost town. Manufacturing, most notably New York's once famous garment industry, has moved to sweatier shops in China, Thailand, Mexico and Fiji. Mainstream retail has long since departed for the suburban ''edge cities'' Joel Garreau writes about. New York's original reason for being, shipping, is so far gone that the great piers on the Hudson River are now used for everything from an aircraft carrier welded to a dock as a museum to a golf driving range with a net to keep the balls from landing in the water.
 Real estate development and the construction industry have never recovered from the commercial real estate crash of the 1990's that left nearly 60 million square feet of office space vacant, much of it in lonely and still unlovable Lower Manhattan. In terms of the location of the big investment firms, Wall Street today should be called Sixth Avenue and Broadway. Moreover, it is now obvious that there is no sound economic or geographical reason a financial market should consist of a great mob of men with sopping dark half-moons on their shirts beneath their armpits flailing about on ''the floor'' of some antiquated ''stock exchange'' ... or in New York at all. The hemorrhaging of corporate headquarters from New York during the 1990's was stanched finally by a drug available only in Manhattan -- Lunch.
 Many a chief executive who knew it would save his corporation a fortune if he moved it to Pleasantville, Cincinnati or South Orange could not conceive of ... life without Lunch ... that daily celebration of his royalty at the sort of peculiarly Manhattan restaurant where a regular ensemble of maitres d' and captains hovers about the great man and his guests cooing sweet nothings in movie French ... where nothing so vulgar as a three-martini lunch ensues but, rather, a refined one-gallon-of-Cotes-du-Rhone lunch ... and his majesty the chief executive feeds in a supragustatory bliss upon Brazil-nut-and rosemary-encrusted day-boat halibut lying on a bed of millet infused with a double fermentation of malbec grape ... and the waiters arrive bearing the artistry of a chef for whom the owners of this restaurant, this month's restaurant of the century, all five years of it, combed the earth.
 Such an ambrosial experience is a product not of the food industry but of the pleasure dome. None of Gothamland's stocks in trade are tangible. Rather, all offer the sheer excitement, even euphoria, of being ... ''where things are happening.''
 Humanity comes to New York not to buy clothes but, rather ... Fashion ... not to see musicals and plays but to experience ''Broadway,'' which resembles the turn-of-the-19th-century trolley town one finds himself in upon entering Disneyland in California. If the traffic on Broadway should ever lack congestion, if the people ever stop spilling over the sidewalks and out into the street, if they ever stop hyperventilating in a struggle to get to the will-call window before the curtain goes up, the producers and theater owners should hire hordes of the city's unemployed actors to serve as extras and recreate it all.
 Millions roam New York's art museums each year, not to enjoy the artwork but to experience the ineffable presence of ... Culture. People throng Yankee Stadium game after game, season after season, not to see the Yankees play, not this year's Yankees, as the fellow might say, but to inhale ... The Myth ... 
 Which brings us to the fate of the West Side stadium proposal. In the short run, it may look like a foolish expenditure of billions desperately -- it's inevitably desperate, government's ''need'' for money -- desperately needed elsewhere. In the McLuhan-length run, however, a few billion might prove to be a bargain, especially if it led straight to holding an event the magnitude of the Olympics in New York. After all, what does our city now live on? Why, something about as solid as a sharp intake of breath: the world's impression that Gothamland and only Gothamland ... is where things are happening.

HAVE New Yorkers lost their chutzpah? The demise of the proposed Jets stadium on the Far West Side (and the attendant blow to the city's 2012 Olympic hopes), along with the politically induced inertia at the World Trade Center site, has led to speculation that the Big Apple is turning into a crab apple. So the Op-Ed Page approached several prominent New Yorkers with a question: If the city wants to start thinking big again, where should it start? Their suggestions follow.
 NOW that the stadium is less likely to be built, one may wonder what would be the best use for the area around the Javits Convention Center (aka the Hudson Yards). All told, we are talking about 40 to 50 blocks south of Javits that extend over the rail yards and down to 28th Street. My proposal would be to use five of those blocks to expand the Javits center to 3 million square feet, from 800,000. Here's why.
 During my three years as chairman of NYC & Company, the city's official tourism marketing arm, I found that the uniform view among industry leaders was that the Javits center is drastically undersized. For New York, the biggest city in the United States, to have the 18th-largest convention center is an embarrassment. Even the state's current plan to expand the center to 1.1 million square feet won't make it stack up to the facilities of other cities. Chicago, for example, has 4.5 million square feet of convention space. Las Vegas has 5.5 million, with a million more under construction.
 With the extension of the No. 7 subway line, an expanded Javits would become a major engine for economic growth. Some experts have estimated that a 3-million-square-foot Javits center would pump $3 billion a year into the New York economy -- not to mention 33,000 permanent jobs and a huge number of construction jobs.
 With the expansion, we will be able to attract conventions from around the world, even from Europe, where convention costs are far higher than here. The new influx of visitors would be of enormous benefit to our restaurants, stores, hotels, theaters and cultural institutions.
 Given the economic consequences of this project, Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Michael Bloomberg should appoint a panel to take responsibility for the intelligent development of the entire 50-block area, with the expansion of Javits leading the way.

HEADLINE: Angela Whitiker's Climb

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 10 

 BODY:
Angela Whitiker arrived early and rain-soaked at a suburban school building with a carton of sugar water in her purse and a squall in her stomach. It was the small hours of the morning, when the parking lot was empty and the street lights were still on. There she was alone in the darkness for the biggest test of her life.
 If she passed, she could shed the last layer of her former self -- the teenage girl who grew up too fast, dropped out in the 10th grade, and landed aimless and on public assistance with five children by nearly as many men. 
 She would finally be the registered nurse she had been striving toward for years. She could get a car that wouldn't break down in the middle of the Dan Ryan Expressway. She could get an A.T.M. card and balance her checkbook and start paying down her bills and save up for that two-story colonial on Greenwood that was already hers in her dreams. 
 She would never again have to live in that gang-run nightmare of a place, the Robert Taylor housing projects -- where she packed a .38 for protection -- or in Section 8 housing or in any government-subsidized anything. Her children could be proud of her and go on to make something of themselves too, once she proved it could be done. 
 But if she didn't pass. 
 She couldn't think about that. And so, as she would often tell the story later, she got up before dawn and made herself some oatmeal and a hard-boiled egg and toast and got to the testing site for the state licensing boards for registered nurses two hours before the test began. 
 She had never been good at tests. All through nursing school, she agonized the night before an exam, overstudying the charts and graphs, termites dropping from the ceiling onto her physiology books, mice crawling at her feet, and her children tugging her leg to find out what was for dinner. 
 She had only recently become the first woman in her family with a college degree and, if everything went well this day, would be the first nurse anybody in her family knew personally. 
 So, she left long before she needed to that morning to avoid traffic, a missed turn, not enough gas. Once there, she sat parked in the rain trying to compose herself. She pulled out her Bible to read the 91st Psalm, the one about the Lord being her refuge. She broke out the sugar water to get glucose to the brain. 
 In the hallway, she avoided looking anyone in the eye. She spoke to no one. She didn't want to pick up on anyone's anxiety. She had enough of her own. She took a last drag on a Newport.
 The testing room began to fill. The examiner checked her identification and assigned her computer No. 12. She drew in another deep breath as she walked to her place. She was about to sit down to take a $256 pass-or-fail entrance exam into the American middle class.
 For most of her 38 years, Angela Whitiker has been on the outside looking in at the seeming perfection of the professional classes, the people who did the college-career-wedding-house-in-the-suburbs-2.5-kids routine. Her life has been so very different from that. She was a child of the working class who, through ill-considered choices and circumstance, slipped into the welfare class and had to fight her way out. 
 While the rest of the country has fitfully cut back welfare and continues to debate class disparities and the barriers to mobility, Ms. Whitiker has quietly traversed several classes in a single lifetime. She has gone from welfare statistic in the early 1990's to credit-card carrying member of the middle class, a woman for whom there are now few statistics, so rare has her experience been. This is the story of her 12-year slog to the middle class and of how hard it is to stay there.
 The third of five children, she was born to a mother who was a cook and to a laborer father whom, though the parents had married, she didn't meet until she was 10. She said it was a heartbreaking visit in which, smelling of whiskey, he promised to buy her a bicycle and didn't. She hasn't seen him since. 
 Within a few years, she was using men as a substitute for her father and her adolescent longing for him. By 15, she was pregnant with her first child. By 23, she was the mother of five children, had been married and separated, and been a casualty of the crack epidemic of the 1980's. She had lost and would later win back custody of her children, and had worked a variety of odd jobs, from sausage vendor to picking butterbeans. 
 At 26, she gained short-lived celebrity when she and her oldest son, Nicholas, then a 10-year-old fourth grader with a man's obligations, were the subjects of a profile by this reporter in The New York Times, part of a 1993 series on at-risk urban young people called Children of the Shadows.
 She, Nicholas and her four other children were living in a second-floor walk-up in Englewood, a crime-burdened neighborhood abandoned first by the white middle class and then by the black middle class that succeeded it. 
 For her, each day meant trying to piece together enough to take care of herself and her kids -- one day petitioning the fathers for child support, the next counting what was left of her food stamps; one minute rushing to an administrator's office to get bus vouchers for school, the next bargaining with the electric company to get her lights turned back on. 
 To keep her family out of the projects and on what might be described as the upper rung of poverty, she had taken up with a man who worked handling baggage at O'Hare International Airport. He paid the rent and was the father of her fifth child, Johnathan. His paycheck gave her breathing room to get into a pre-nursing program at Kennedy-King Community College on the South Side. 
 But men never seemed to hang around that long, and it fell to Nicholas to be father to the younger children that the men in their lives seemed unwilling to be.
 He was the one who washed his and his siblings' school uniforms in the bathtub at night because they each had only one set. He was the one who pulled his brother Willie out of the line of fire by the hood of his jacket when gunshots rang out in the schoolyard. And he was the one who took the blame and the beatings if something wasn't done to his mother's boyfriend's liking.
 Readers responded with great outpourings of generosity after the article was published, but it was clear from the reporter's continuing contacts with the family over the years that it was not enough to materially change the basic facts of their lives. It was still a household run by a single mother with only a high school equivalency degree, no career skills, no assets and no immediate prospects for independence. 
 In addition, the fraying relationship between Ms. Whitiker and her boyfriend fell apart after publication of the article, and, without him to pay the rent, she fell further behind. She wound up in the only place that a woman with five children, no job and no money could get in Chicago in 1994, a cellblock of an apartment in the Robert Taylor Homes, an urban no-man's land where you could move about only when the gangs that ran the place let you. The elevators, sticky with urine, didn't work, and gunshots were background music.
 From the start, Ms. Whitiker felt that it was beneath her. She looked down on the women who had grown accustomed to bullet holes over their dinette tables, who watched ''All My Children'' and ate Doritos all day and didn't seem to want anything better. She carried the gun to protect herself and had to use it once when, having climbed nine flights of stairs, she found some strangers playing cards at her kitchen table. She fired shots into the ceiling to get them out.
 It was the lowest rung of the poverty class in America, lower in a way than the worst nights in a crack house in her early 20's, because now she was fully conscious of exactly where she was. She vowed from the very first night to get out. But she knew she couldn't make it out on public assistance. So she figured she'd get whatever job she could. She would have to put off her nursing studies.
 She worked at a fast food restaurant, rising to assistant manager but never making much more than minimum wage. She worked nights as a security guard in the projects, a job that was dangerous and equally dead-end but paid a bit more. 
 Every day held its own kind of peril or indignity, much of it coming from her 1976 Chevrolet, which she relied on to get to and from work but was well past its natural lifespan. It had a cracked windshield and a hole rusted through the floor. It wasn't big enough for all of her children, but they piled in just the same with no thought of seatbelts, because there weren't enough anyway.
 When she was coming home in the rain on the expressway one night, the defroster conked out and the windshield fogged up. ''I had to stick my head out the window to drive,'' she said. ''God drove that car that night.''
 One time the car caught fire because of a hole in the gasoline line. Flames shot out of the hood and into the air. Ms. Whitiker jumped out and told her sister, Michelle, riding in the passenger seat, to do the same.
 ''Get out of the car!'' she screamed. ''It's gonna blow!''
 A fire truck came to put out the fire. The firefighters argued over which one should try to start the engine. None of them wanted to. So she had to try herself. Somehow, it started and got her home, just another day on her long climb out of the hole. 
 The drug economy played out every day on the cracked concrete lawns of Robert Taylor, and her preteen older sons, Nicholas and Willie, could not help breathing it in. The only working men they saw were the drug dealers who were up early to meet their sales quotas, wore the latest gym shoes and got the girls. Their cars were new and didn't catch fire.
 The family lived at Robert Taylor for nine months. ''It was hell,'' she would say later. ''I wouldn't want a dog to stay up in there.'' 
 She left there a new woman. She knew she had to get back into nursing school if she was ever going to get anywhere.

Learning a New Way
 Then she met a man by the name of Vincent Allen. He wasn't like the other men she had known. He had a college degree. His father had been a military man, his mother a homemaker, solidly middle class. He had a nice apartment with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Lake Michigan. Ms. Whitiker was struck by his manners and how he spoke like the teachers and social workers she had known growing up -- enunciating his words, slipping in a few she didn't know. He was a police detective. 
 They met on the job when they were working as private security guards. He took an immediate liking to her, saw that they both wanted the same thing -- in his words, a ''picket fence kind of a life.'' He encouraged her to follow her dreams. Soon she and the kids were moving in with him. He took his job as the man of the house seriously and actually liked the father role. Suddenly, there was a man asking about homework and where Nicholas and Willie had been. He noticed if they had slipped on some gang colors or had their caps pushed to the left or the right as gang members did. 
 He took it upon himself to correct the behavior of the younger children and pick them up from school. 
 That had been Nicholas's job for all of his short life, and, as his mother recalled, he did not take displacement well. First, she said, he figured he would scare his rival away. He stole his clothes, talked back, came in late. 
 It would only be a matter of time before this man would go the way of all the other men, Nicholas thought. But Mr. Allen did not leave. And the sweet little boy who had been the father of his family went out and found a new family in the streets. The drug dealers were more than willing to take him and put him to work. Before long, Ms. Whitiker discovered that her 12-year-old Nicholas was a lookout for the dealers.
 She and Mr. Allen could see the road Nicholas was on, but, streetwise though they were, could do little to stop it. The more vigilant Mr. Allen was, the more resentful and alienated Nicholas became and the worse things got. It was as if he had grown so accustomed to the chaos of his mother's previous lives that he did not know how to function when a family worked as it should. He had made himself into a wind gauge and had no purpose when the air was still.
 Ms. Whitiker sent Nicholas to live with his father, a laborer who had married, had other children and lived on the other side of town. She hoped that being far from his homies would put Nicholas on a straighter course.
 Mr. Allen started encouraging her to go back to nursing school. They figured that, with him providing a place for her to live, and with Pell grants and the other financial aid for low-income students, she could make a go of it. 
 She enrolled at Kennedy-King College again, but it was different this time; or, rather, she was different. She was no longer the fun-loving girl looking for something to do. She had seen the bottom of the well and never wanted to go back there again. 
 She had also seen a new way of managing one's life. The professional people she met in college and now Mr. Allen had different ways of thinking about spending and saving money and carrying oneself. They tended to plan and save for things. She had never had enough money or reason to save. They paid attention to things like late fees and interest rates; she mostly ignored them because she couldn't pay the bills anyway. They set long-term goals for themselves; she just tried to get through the day. It all rubbed off on her, and it changed her. 
 On top of that, she had a renewed sense of time pressing against her. How long would Mr. Allen put up with her and the kids while she went to school? What if he got tired of it and left? What if he insisted she quit school and get a job to pay her share of the expenses? She didn't like the idea of owing him and couldn't bear the thought of slipping backward again. So, when it came to her studies, she would have to be more focused and efficient than she had been about anything in her life.

'I Had to Make It'
 There were certain points in certain years -- say from 1996 to 2002 -- when Angela Whitiker didn't yet know that Tupac Shakur had been killed or that President Bill Clinton had been impeached.
 ''If it wasn't about nursing or biology or what was on my test Friday, I wasn't interested,'' she said. ''I blocked everything and everybody out. I used to be so particular about cleaning the house. I got to the point where I'd see a shoe, and I'd just kick it over.''
 She felt she had to work extra hard because she felt so outranked in the classroom. She endured the stares of the middle-class teacher's pets who looked down on her for the circuitous route that got her there. ''They were snobs whose moms were nurses, and they knew everything,'' she said. ''I had to show them that I was somebody, that because I had five kids, that I made bad decisions, that I didn't have a father -- and so what? -- I was determined to show them I can do this. I had to make it. I couldn't fail.'' 
 Whenever test day came, she recalled, she would work herself into such a state of anxiety that sometimes she had to excuse herself to throw up. The professor had to go get her out of the bathroom. 
 ''Are you O.K.?'' the professor would ask. ''You're going to kill yourself.''
 Everybody knew when a test didn't go well. They could see it in her face, the simultaneous pouting and rolling of the eyes, and hear it in her voice, the way she snapped at the lowest registers over the littlest thing.
 ''Mama didn't pass her test today,'' the first child to notice would say to the others. ''Don't say nothing.''
 Because she wasn't from a professional family, she brought a kind of naivete to school with her. One day in a clinical class, she recalled, the teacher went around the room asking students how their patients were doing. When the teacher got to her, Ms. Whitiker thought about the colostomy bag attached to her patient and started crying. 
 ''Oh my God,'' the teacher said. ''Did your patient die?''
 ''No,'' she said, still sobbing. ''But she had this hole in her stomach.''
 ''Well, go on in there and wash your face,'' the teacher told her. 
 Soon she was working with cadavers as if they were just another piece of office equipment, but she didn't know anyone who could give her the ins and outs of the field or tell her what to expect. ''I didn't have anybody I could go to who had a degree other than Vince,'' she said. He went over her papers and marked them up -- too much for her liking, sometimes -- and read her papers aloud so she could hear what was wrong with them. 
 When she made the dean's list, he celebrated. When she failed a test, he consoled her as best he could. 
 ''Oh baby, you're going to make it,'' he'd say.
 ''Oh shut up, you don't understand,'' she'd shoot back.
 In May 2001, she finally finished nursing school at Kennedy-King, one of the City Colleges of Chicago. For her class picture, she wore her hair in a flip like Gidget and a nurse's cap that looked like white dove wings. It was a long way from the teenager in a jheri curl and too-tight jeans. 
 Soon she would be driving in the rain to take the nursing boards on computer No. 12. ''It was a step to another life,'' she would say years later. ''It was a do-or-die type of thing. I thought I was going to kill myself waiting for the results.''

The Test Results
 One morning in late 2001, when Ms. Whitiker was alone and the apartment was uncharacteristically quiet, the mail arrived and, in it, an envelope from the state boards. In that moment, she came closer than at any other time of her life to upper-middle-class young people awaiting word from the Ivy League school of their dreams. The chatter among her fellow nursing students was that a thin envelope meant you passed; a thick one, presumably filled with the things you got wrong, meant you failed. She got a thin envelope. 
 ''My heart just dropped to the floor,'' she said. She took the envelope into the apartment and threw it on the bed, afraid to open it, afraid that, given the disappointments of her life, somehow the grapevine had been wrong and the thin one meant failure. 
 She called her mother to get the courage to open it. Soon she was out in the middle of the hallway. ''I passed my boards!'' she screamed to neighbors fumbling for their house keys.
 The family took her out to celebrate. They had dinner at Hooters and bought her a cake. Soon after, she and Mr. Allen agreed it was time they married.
 ''My daughter was getting to an age where I was trying to tell her to do right,'' Ms. Whitiker said of Ishtar, now 17. ''I can't tell her to do right if I'm doing wrong.''
 They married at Faith Temple Coptic Church on June 7, 2003. She wore an ivory shift and a long white veil and carried a bouquet of white carnations. He wore a black tux. It was the groom's first marriage, the bride's second. 
 All the kids were there except Willie, who, still on the path he learned at Robert Taylor, was in jail. The remaining kids were dressed to their mother's specifications, except Nicholas, who, having by now declared that he wanted to be a rapper, showed up in pants hanging off his body and a baseball cap turned backward. 
 For the family wedding picture, Ms. Whitiker told him to stand in the back so nobody could see what he had on. She was already becoming class conscious, aware of appearances and decorum. And so, on this triumphant day in the family's history, all that is visible of Nicholas is his head.

High-Stress Work
 Ms. Whitiker finished nursing school as vice president of her class and with academic awards in biology and pharmacology, but despite her hard work and potential, the reality of her life was that she could not afford to go any further than a two-year associate's degree. That limits her job prospects even in a high-demand field like nursing. She doesn't have the contacts to get a job at the teaching hospitals in Chicago where she would get better training and higher pay.
 She landed a job at a small inner city hospital on the South Side, known not for its groundbreaking procedures or training opportunities but as the hospital where the eight student nurses killed by Richard Speck in 1966 had worked. It's an unnerving history that is always in the back of her mind, but she needs the job and the pay is more than she could ever have imagined back when she was on food stamps. 
 She has worked high-stress assignments in telemetry -- monitoring cardiac patients -- and in the intensive care unit. With all the night hours she puts in, she made $83,000 last year, more than 90 percent of all American workers. It is hard work, messy, often thankless. She has found herself in a pecking order that surprises and frustrates her. The doctors seem to expect her to work magic on their orders, she said, and the certified nursing assistants resent her place of privilege. 
 A few years back she might have sympathized with the nursing assistants. They do what no one else wants to do, attending to the unpleasant bodily needs of the very ill. There was a time when that would have been a move up for her. But their envy and resentment only made her feel more distant. And now, she was showing the same disdain for them that the middle class might have felt for her in her other life. 
 ''I'm like, don't be mad at me because I'm a nurse,'' she said. ''If you want my job, you need to suffer and cry like I did.''
 She tried to find her bearings in this new class she was in. She resented the old friends who drank muscatel at the taverns late into the night and hit her up for money. And yet her past had a way of catching up with her in unexpected ways. She was out running errands once when a man recognized her from her days on the street.
 ''I know you,'' he said. ''You're the one who stole money from me.''
 She feigned ignorance and walked away, even though, she would later say, she remembered taking his money and his television set, too, back when she was on drugs.
 She tried hanging out with the nurses from work. But some were bourgeois and uppity, had a sense of comfort and confidence she did not possess. At one party she went to, some of them started smoking marijuana. It was a fun little escape for them, but it took her back to a place she could not afford to revisit.
 ''I reached for my purse,'' she said. ''When I got my first paycheck, that was high enough for me.'' 
 Her life was complicated as it was. For one thing she was now the mother of six (seven, if you counted Zach, her husband's 13-year-old son, who recently moved in with them). Her youngest, Christopher, had been born shortly after the uncertain time at Robert Taylor and had been with her only off and on because of a custody fight between her and Christopher's father. 
 Both the fight over Christopher and the fact that he came after a lull in childbearing when she was a more mature 28 help explain why she is investing in him in ways she had not had the luxury of doing with her older kids.
 She now knows how to discipline without using a belt, and the value of grounding and timeouts. She spends her off time shuttling Christopher to and from school or to little league practice in her new Chevrolet sport utility vehicle, an early benefit of her higher paychecks. When he has a science project, she's on the floor helping sculpt the volcano with him. She's quick to hug him and expects a kiss when she drops him off. She says he has become the very embodiment of the fresh start she was seeking for herself, and onto him she has grafted all her middle-class hopes. 
 He reminds her so much of Nicholas -- the same round face and velvet skin, the same precociousness that she saw as impudence in young Nicholas when she was barely out of her teens, but now sees as reflecting her youngest's unlimited potential. While Nicholas went to a strapped public grade school in a perilous neighborhood, Christopher is in the gifted program of a school she handpicked on the middle-class side of town. While Nicholas played a hand-me-down Nintendo on a television with a busted tube, Christopher plays 3-D chess on the family's Dell computer.
 Christopher is now 10, the same age as Nicholas when he appeared in The Times, but he talks like one of the sweet, smart-alecky kids on a network sitcom rather than a streetwise man-child who's seen too much too soon. 
 Asked what it means to be in the gifted program, he had a ready answer. ''It means I'm smarter than the other kids,'' he said without flinching. At that age, Nicholas's conversations were about running from bullets.

Demands and Responsibilities
 At first, nursing was like hitting the lottery. She was making enough for the family to move into a four-bedroom apartment in a prewar building overlooking Lake Michigan. It has crown molding, a marble fireplace and grander rooms than they have furniture for. She had a contractor paint the rooms the colors of sweet peas and corn on the cob. She bought a mahogany king-size bed, propping it high with pillows for herself and her husband, and bunk beds for the kids. 
 But she has found herself alone. She is making more money than anybody she knows. And come payday, everybody needs something, and not just the kids. Relatives need gas money, friends could use help with the rent. Even her patients, on hard times themselves, have their hands out.
 ''You got some money to lend me?'' one of them, an older woman whose telephone had just been cut off, asked her. ''You get your check yet?''
 Suddenly, she is the successful star in her universe who is supposed to cover the cost of the family reunion, give career advice to the nieces and nephews, show up for their basketball games, float a loan to whoever needs it. After all, she's making $83,000 a year.
 She is making more than her police detective husband and has found herself tiptoeing around his ego and expectations. They have tried different ways of dividing the bills, at one point splitting the $1,475 rent and sharing the utilities, at another point, one paying the rent and the other the utilities. But after Medicare and Social Security deductions and her share of the household obligations, groceries for a family of seven, her $500 monthly car payment, the assorted expenses that come with three teenagers, loans to relatives who think she makes a fortune and the debt left over from her previous life, she finds that there is often little left over at month's end, and most months she's still in the hole.
 She exists in an in-between place, middle class on paper but squeezed in reality. Take her car, for instance. It's a 2002 two-door Blazer that cost $29,000. She really needed the bigger four-door, just so everybody could easily get in. But that would have cost an extra $5,000, so everybody crams into the two-door. Insufficient though it is, it still comes at a high price. She pays 17 percent interest on the car loan -- with $13,000 remaining -- because of bad credit from her previous life, when sometimes the choice was whether to eat or pay the light bill.
 The kids asked her the other day if she was getting a new car. ''No,'' she said, ''you can pop the seat and duck your head and get in like everybody else.'' 
 But she winces every time Christopher and Zach have to fold themselves into the size of a bag of groceries to fit into the rear storage compartment. She says she wants a bigger car like a Lincoln Navigator, but with gas so high she shudders at what it would cost to fill the tank, and she knows she can't afford a new car anyway.
 So despite her income, Saks and Macy's are somebody else's world. Instead, she frequents the places she did in her previous life. She still shops at the dollar stores in Englewood, her old down-and-out neighborhood. On a recent trip to Louisiana for her family reunion she watched every nickel and checked her balance at the automated teller machine several times a day. 
 She has become keenly aware that what middle-class comforts she does enjoy are built on uncertain scaffolding. First, her status requires two paychecks and the stability and backup she gets from being married. It requires that she work the higher-paying 12-hour night shifts that keep her away from her family for long stretches and leave her tired and irritable when she's with them. 
 It requires that Mr. Allen work extra hours as security at an elementary school, which leaves the two of them with little overlapping time to reinforce the strong marriage they need to stay where they are.

Stretching Every Dollar
 Her job and paycheck say she's middle class, but what does that mean? She said that when she was on the outside looking in, she never imagined it would mean working three and a half years without a vacation or having an empty dining room waiting for a table and chairs. It never would have occurred to her that she would be working this hard and still have to choose between paying the phone bill and paying for her daughter Ishtar's prom. 
 She exhibits a mounting awareness of just how far her money will and will not go, and of how much hard work each dollar represents and how carefully she must protect it because any loss means she has to work that much harder.
 So she drops what she's doing when she sees a spot on the sofa because it cost four figures and it's not paid for yet. She buys in bulk and has to watch out for relatives wanting to shop in her kitchen.
 ''I caught my aunt going into my pantry getting her some soap,'' she said. ''I told her, 'That's Dove!''' 
 For Ms. Whitiker, being middle class has meant working upside-down hours for so long that she's started to greet people on the street with ''Have a good evening!'' It means taking on family members as unofficial patients with their edema and diabetes. ''When you're the only nurse in the family they think you're a doctor,'' she says. ''Mama calls me. Mama has her friends calling me.''
 She has no choice but to keep up the pace because she wants to get vested in the retirement plan at the hospital. She has 18 months to go. She wants to open up a Roth retirement account, but can't seem to save enough. She wants to go back to school to get a bachelor's degree, but has neither the time nor the money. 
 ''I feel like every corner of my body is being stretched,'' she said the other day. 
 More than anything, Ms. Whitiker wants to buy a house. Sometimes she drives by her dream house on Greenwood in the comfortably middle-class neighborhood of Chatham. It's yellow brick with a spiral staircase and a two-story foyer and vertical blinds. But she's having trouble saving anything toward that house or any other. The bad credit from her previous life still haunts her. Where she wants to live, they can't afford. And where they could afford, she doesn't dare live.
 ''I have to live in a decent neighborhood,'' she said. ''I can't walk around the projects in my nursing uniform. They would try to take everything I got. And my husband -- he's arrested half the people in Englewood. We're in danger.''

Missing Pieces
 Ms. Whitiker's ideal of middle-class perfection, with well-educated, smartly groomed kids gathered around a big middle-class dining room table, has two missing pieces: Nicholas and Willie. Her success came too late to benefit them. They were already on a road she was unable to steer them from. Nicholas dropped out of school in the 11th grade and has been on and off the streets ever since. Willie, ever the follower looking up to Nicholas, was right behind.
 At 22, Nicholas is a burdened soul who saw too much too soon. His front tooth is broken from a fight he got into trying to protect Willie on the streets. His car has bullet holes from a drive-by shooting. He knows what it's like to have a pistol jammed into your chin, or to be a 12-year-old making $50 from neighborhood drug dealers for sitting on a hydrant and calling out ''Five-O!'' -- street slang for the police. And worse.
 ''I could be dead right now,'' said Nicholas, his chiseled features weary, water welling in his eyes. ''I should be dead. I hurt so many people. I hurt myself.''
 There were times when Mr. Allen, on patrol and by then Nicholas's putative stepfather, would catch him on the street and write up a summons but then let him go. But Nicholas finally got caught and spent about six weeks in jail in 2002 for stealing two coats from a Marshall's store in the suburbs and for fighting the police when they tried to arrest him, a consequence, his mother believes, of unresolved ''anger issues'' from the chaos of his childhood. She wishes she could go back and do some things differently. She thinks he needs to get into anger management and get into school to put his quick mind to good use.
 For now, he lives in a walk-up apartment in the suburbs with the mother of the second of his three children; she's a housekeeper at the local Y.M.C.A. He has worked part-time as a stock clerk, but he is pinning his hopes on his rap music, which his exasperated mother admits is pretty good. He closes his eyes with hands quivering and begins one of his songs: ''Going to change my ways,'' he sings in a near whisper. ''Lord have mercy on me.'' 
 Willie has become a sturdily built young man with a movie star smile and a precisely trimmed goatee. Like Nicholas, he has worked low-paying service jobs when he has worked. He has two children, and a more serious criminal record that includes a felony drug conviction for selling near a schoolyard. ''I was doing some things I shouldn't have been doing,'' Willie said, still sweet-faced at 21. 
 Ms. Whitiker's two older sons are living reminders of the world she wants to put behind her. She lives in constant fear of what may happen to them. 
 ''I go to work,'' she said wearily, ''and I don't know when I'm going to get that call, that your son is dead or in jail again.'' 
 It was soon after she began working as a nurse that she got the call she had been dreading. She was in the intensive care unit bandaging a patient when she was called to the phone. Willie had been shot. It was not clear where he had been shot or how seriously hurt he was, or if he was conscious or would live.
 She dropped everything. It turned out he had been shot twice in the leg. She found it suspicious that he was shot on a well-known South Side drug corner that had been contested by rival dealers. But she rushed in to save her son. 
 ''It almost killed me,'' she said. ''I almost had a nervous breakdown. I'm at work bandaging up patients, and I get the call that he's been shot. He said he was robbed. So I took him in and took care of his wounds.''
 Last summer, she got another call. She was at home in bed this time. 
 ''Your son Willie's been shot,'' said the slurred, panicked voice on the phone.
 It was a call from one of Willie's acquaintances from the very corner where Willie had been shot the first time. 
 ''They were so ghetto,'' Ms. Whitiker recalled with exasperation. ''They were arguing over the phone about what they should do.''
 She thought quickly. The nurse in her kicked into gear.
 ''Where was he shot?'' she asked.
 ''In the leg,'' came the answer.
 ''Is he breathing?'' 
 ''Yeah.''
 She knew then that he would live. 
 ''So I hung up and turned over and went to sleep,'' she recalled later. ''I didn't even tell my family.''
 In the days and weeks that followed Willie's shooting, Ms. Whitiker made perhaps the most painful decision a mother could make in order to keep her family on the straight and narrow. She has performed a kind of emergency triage, banishing the infected to save the well.
 She didn't visit Willie in the hospital, didn't take him home to tend him as she had the first time. She made it clear that neither he nor Nicholas was welcome until they got themselves together, got their high school equivalency diplomas and started taking care of their kids. She has big plans for the younger ones: graduations, proms, college, professions. She doesn't want them getting shot like Willie.
 ''I told him you can't bring that here,'' she said. ''How are his brothers supposed to feel? They're trying to do right and their brother is in the other room with a gunshot wound. I don't want him bringing that to the house and spreading it to the others. The other boys are on the right path, and I want it to stay that way.''
 Her plan appears to be working. The younger children rarely speak of Nicholas and Willie. When Willie showed up at the apartment one afternoon, Ishtar knew to alert her mother on her cellphone. 
 ''Willie's here,'' Ishtar said. ''What you want me to do?'' 
 Everyone knows about the quarantine, even if it's breached. When Nicholas's name comes up, there's an awkward silence and a looking away.

Pushing Higher Goals
 Thursday was a big day for the family. It was the day Ishtar walked across the stage and became the first of Ms. Whitiker's children to get a high school diploma. It caused quite a flurry in a family with a history of more births than graduations. After the ceremony, Ms. Whitiker's sister, Michelle, took Ishtar's yellow mortarboard and said, good-naturedly: ''Let me try this on. Which way does it go? They don't give you these when you get your G.E.D.''
 Everyone was there, except Willie, who was looking for work in Milwaukee, and Nicholas, who was in the public library reading up on contracts and music royalties to get a record deal. The day put Ms. Whitiker in a class quandary even as she went without a telephone to pay for the commencement and the prom. 
 While proud of Ishtar, who made it to the prom after all, Ms. Whitiker is torn between making a big deal of graduation and keeping it in perspective. ''I'm not going to do like these other mothers and brag about, 'My baby graduated from high school!''' she said the other day. ''I'm not going to say that's good. No, that's just the beginning. I want her to go to college and have a profession. She asked me, 'What age do you think I should have sex?' I said, 'I think about 30.'''
 Ms. Whitiker has made no attempt to hide her displeasure over Ishtar's wanting to join the Navy -- not only because her daughter could be deployed to the Middle East but also because it does not fit the middle-class ideal Ms. Whitiker now has for her children. She sees Ishtar going into law. 
 She is nudging 14-year-old John, who brings home A's, is a linebacker on the football squad and a squad leader in the Reserve Officers Training Corps, to consider becoming a doctor. John listens and applies himself but says he wants to go into the Army first. Before she became a nurse, the military might have been seen as a step up for her kids. Now she sees it as a detour from what they really should be doing.
 ''I try to talk to my kids to go into a profession,'' she said. ''If you're certified and licensed, nobody can take that away from you.''
 To Nicholas and Willie, her advice is very different. ''Can't you see your life is going down the drain, and you're the only one who can save it?'' she asks to shrugging shoulders. ''You want a quick way out. There is no quick way out. I tried that. It doesn't work.''
 But she still has hope. ''I'm a late bloomer,'' she says, ''and I know it's not too late for them.''

Real Riches
 What has kept Ms. Whitiker going is the knowledge that there are certain things no one can ever take away, that certain pieces of paper really do matter. That is why the letter she was afraid to open, the one announcing she had passed her nursing boards -- it's folded up, crinkled in her wallet beneath a picture of her husband and her A.T.M. card. The college diploma that it took her eight years to earn -- her husband keeps that in his bedroom drawer, as if it is as much his as hers. 
 But as their second anniversary approached, the balancing act that plays out every day of their lives came down to the more immediate questions of getting by. Will they have a telephone this week or will Ishtar go to the prom? Will Ms. Whitiker be able to cut back her hours at the hospital and spend more time with her family? Can she work days instead of nights? Will she be able to find a home she can afford instead of spending five figures in rent each year?
 Recently, she took a second job as a visiting nurse, checking in on elderly patients on the South Side during the day. It allows her to have more control over her schedule and work fewer nights at the hospital. The earnings potential is uncertain, and she has no health benefits under this new part-time arrangement, relying instead on her husband's. But a burden has been lifted for now. 
 So here she is on a late spring afternoon in her S.U.V. running errands in the old neighborhood. She has always felt safest with the familiar. She drops off some clothes at the dry cleaners where her sister's former husband's sister works. She buys a duffle bag at a dollar store that hired her aunt to fill in. She checks in on the niece who just had the Caesarean. ''How's the baby?'' she asks. ''You know I want to come up and give her some sugar.''
 Her cellphone rings. 
 ''That's the kids,'' she said. She answers immediately, confident that, whatever bills are waiting in the mailbox, she's rich in the one thing that matters.
 ''Family is like the most important thing in life,'' Ms. Whitiker said. ''Without family, I don't even see a purpose.'' 

ABOUT THE SERIES
This article is the 11th and final part of a series examining the role of social class in America today. A team of reporters spent more than a year exploring ways that class -- defined as a combination of income, education, wealth and occupation -- influences destiny in a society that likes to think of itself as a land of opportunity.

TWO OF US -- A supportive relationship is one key to rising out of poverty, as Angela Whitiker found with her husband.
Ms. Whitiker worked her way out of poverty in the hope of a better life for her children, shown with her in the early 1990's. The warning above, from a 1993 article in the Children of the Shadows series (nytimes.com/class), went unheeded by her son Nicholas, right, who turned to the streets.
The Whitiker family lived for nine months in the gangridden Robert Taylor housing projects in Chicago. ''It was hell,'' Angela Whitiker said later. ''I wouldn't want a dog to stay up in there.'' (pg. 22)

To the Editor:
 ''How We Feel About Home'' (June 5) mentions ''the departure from the city of people who can't handle its real estate costs,'' and quotes Chris Mayer of Columbia University as saying that rising demand to live in New York City is pushing out ''people at the bottom end of the income spectrum'' and changing ''the character of who lives in the city.''
 This is potentially a profound observation that doesn't seem to get a lot of coverage. Has the character of the city fundamentally changed in the last several years? Is the city losing its economic diversity or is it becoming more economically segregated? Are these changes affecting the city culturally or politically? 
 These questions go to the heart of what New York City means, and I'd love to see them get deeper coverage.

HEADLINE: Gabreski Air Base, Pro and Con

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Off Base,'' by Lawrence Korb (Op-Ed, May 22) is indeed off-base in its suggestion that the Gabreski National Guard Air Base in Westhampton should be closed. This base was kept off the list of bases recommended for closing by the Department of Defense not because it's good for Long Island but because it is essential for homeland security purposes.
 Completely off-base was Mr. Korb's claim that ''had Gabreski been closed, its operations could easily have been moved to the Stewart Air Base in Newburgh, N.Y., thus keeping jobs from going out of state.''
 Stewart is approximately 150 miles from Gabreski. On base at Gabreski are 908 trained military personnel. Among them are 56 highly trained air-rescue parajumpers whose training requires more than three years to complete. The 150-mile move would decimate the wing because more than 90 percent of its citizen airmen live and work on Long Island at their full-time jobs and would not move.
 One cannot get from Long Island to Stewart without facing significant traffic and major bridge crossings. Faced with such a commute, most of the highly trained air guard would resign and be lost to our region's and nation's safety and defense forever. 
 Current Pentagon leadership is right on target in recognizing the superior military value of Gabreski and should decide that it should stay open for many years to come. And Long Island, the metropolitan area and the nation will be safer and more secure because of this decision.

HEADLINE: Mexico Labor Case Grows For Maker of Barbie Gowns

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN; Elisabeth Malkin also reported from Tepeji del Rio for this article.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 11 

 BODY:
There was not much that Guadalupe Avila Jimenez liked about her factory job making children's costumes, including flowing Barbie gowns for little girls who like to play princess. 
 ''They shouted at us, they did not let us go to the bathroom, they gave us food that made us vomit,'' said Ms. Avila, 21, reciting a litany of indignities she said she had suffered at the factory, in Tepeji del Rio. About the only thing she did like were the costumes the workers made. ''What we made was really pretty,'' she said. 
 Today the factory is facing a labor dispute that is anything but pretty. What started out as a local struggle may now shift its focus to the American toy giant Mattel, which licenses the Barbie label to the plant's owner, Rubie's Costume Company, based in Richmond Hill, Queens. Unlike other toy companies, Mattel has an eight-year-old code of conduct for subcontractors and licensees. 
 Saying they were fed up with managers who called them names, closed factory doors to force overtime and required them to buy work equipment and even toilet paper, Ms. Avila and 60 co-workers -- most young women, some as young as 15 -- voted for a new union. In April, they say, they were locked out and lost jobs that paid little more than $5 a day. 
 Mattel and Rubie's deny allegations of verbal abuse, forced overtime, making workers buy equipment and the consistent use of child labor, and they say the workers were not dismissed but walked off the job. 
 ''They said we chained people to sewing machines,'' Marc Beige, president of Rubie's, one of the world's largest costume companies, said by telephone from New York. ''That's outlandish. There's nobody being locked in the factory.'' 
 An audit last month by Mattel of the Rubie's plant found several violations of its code of conduct, including one worker who was 15, said Lisa Marie Bongiovanni, a spokeswoman at Mattel's headquarters in El Segundo, Calif. ''Child labor is a zero-tolerance issue for us,'' she said.
 The auditors did not speak to the workers picketing outside, she said. 
 The dispute has revived charges of abuses in Mexico's export assembly plants, known as maquiladoras, and of obstacles to independent unions. 
 Mexico's toy and garment industries have been hard hit in recent years as many maquiladoras have left for China in search of cheaper labor, creating more pressures on workers. The plants that remain are mostly in the interior, like the one in Tepeji del Rio, a hardscrabble town 60 miles north of Mexico City, where wages are lower than on the border. 
 ''China has served as a pretext to diminish labor conditions,'' said Salim Kalkach Navarro, secretary general of the Labor Vanguard Federation of Workers, the union that Rubie's workers voted to join. It is known by its abbreviation in Spanish, F.T.V.O.
 At the same time, organizations that a decade ago fought poor working conditions in garment plants around the world say the toy industry has escaped similar scrutiny. 
 Stephen Coats, executive director of the US/Labor Education in Americas Project, a Chicago labor advocacy group, charged that Mattel had not responded aggressively to the workers' complaints. ''I'm just kind of stunned they are behind the curve,'' he said. 
 He said labor advocates would continue to pressure Mattel to correct any abuses at the plant and require Rubie's to allow the workers to choose their own union. ''As long as the union is pressing forward its collective demand, Mattel is frankly a juicy target,'' Mr. Coats said.
 Mattel's code may in fact make it more vulnerable to pressure. 
 Lance Compa, of the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, said, ''Mattel actually does have a fairly advanced code of conduct and there is some evidence that they try to have it implemented in their licensees.'' 
 American labor activists and the F.T.V.O. charge that eight workers at Rubie's were younger than 16, including several who were 14 when they were hired. Mexican law permits 14- and 15-year-olds to work only a reduced day, which the union says did not happen. 
 Mattel requires workers to be at least 16, and Mattel and Rubies acknowledge that the audit turned up one 15-year-old. 
 Ms. Giovanni, the Mattel spokeswoman, said that as a result of Mattel's audit, Rubie's has promised to hire only employees older than 16 and set up a system to identify forged documents. It has also committed to paying overtime correctly and on time.
 Until the dispute is settled, Mr. Beige, Rubie's president, said the plant was accepting fewer orders. It has not made the Barbie costumes since January for reasons unrelated to the dispute, he said. He acknowledged increasing competition from China but said the plant intended to stay in Mexico.
 This week, Teresita de Jesus Hernandez, 15, joined the workers protesting outside the plant. Until she lost her job, she said, she was the sole support for her mother, who suffers from a heart condition and diabetes. 
 At 12, she left school and began working in another garment plant nearby. At 14, she was hired at Rubie's and was told that her age was no problem. The plant manager altered her birth certificate, she said. 
 ''It was O.K. at first,'' she said. But then, she said, workers were required to carry heavy loads. ''They gave us special belts and asked us to pay $45 for them.'' 
 Rubie's says that no worker was ever required to pay for equipment. 
 Three other underage workers were also protesting at the plant. The union says another four, including a 13-year-old boy, have remained at home for fear of reprisals. 
 The dispute has followed what has become almost a standard script in maquiladora labor conflicts over the past decade. Workers try to form their own union, only to find that they have been represented -- often without their knowledge -- by a union that is part of the Confederation of Mexican Workers, the old-line federation that was a pillar of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which ruled Mexico for 71 years. 
 Labor analysts and activists here and in the United States hoped that the election of President Vicente Fox in 2000 would loosen the old federation's grip on labor. But nothing has changed, many say. 
 ''It's clear that the old-line labor groupings have worked out a modus vivendi with the Fox government, and they've basically gone back to business as usual,'' said Mr. Compa of Cornell. 
 Harley Shaiken, director of the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, in a separate interview, agreed. ''You can count the number of independent unions in maquiladoras on one hand and still have fingers left over,'' he said. 
 Mr. Kalkach, the F.T.V.O.'s secretary general, said Rubie's initially agreed to sign a contract, which was filed and accepted with the national labor board. He produced a copy of the board's decision.
 But a few days later, the board rejected the contract, on the grounds that a contract already existed with another union from the Confederation of Mexican Workers. 
 The long wait is taking its toll. About 50 of the workers accepted severance payments from Rubie's on Monday. 
 The union is also appealing the national labor board's rejection of the contract. Suspicious of the monitoring Mattel says it has done so far, the union has asked Mattel to set up an independent monitoring system for its licensee plants in Mexico. Mr. Kalkach said, ''That's a moral demand, not a legal demand.''

HEADLINE: What's Bad for G.M. Is . . .

BYLINE: By GREGG EASTERBROOK. 
Gregg Easterbrook, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the author, most recently, of ''The Progress Paradox.''

 BODY:
THE announcement last week that General Motors would cut 25,000 jobs and close several factories is yet another blow to the Goliath of automakers and its workers. But only if you work for G.M. is the company's decline a worry. For consumers, the decline can be seen as a symbol of healthy competition.
 G.M.'s sales, market share and work force have all been falling for a generation, even as the quality of its vehicles has gone up. Why? Because its competitors' products have improved even more. Today's auto buyers enjoy an unprecedented array of well-built, well-equipped, reasonably priced vehicles offered by many manufacturers. 
 So, is what's bad for General Motors good for the country?
 In the 1950's, General Motors had 46 percent of the American auto market, Ford and Chrysler 44 percent, and everyone else combined just 10 percent. Today, G.M. sells 27 percent of the cars bought in America, Ford and DaimlerChrysler combined sell 32 percent, and other automakers add up to 41 percent. 
 This means that the international competition, once trivial compared with General Motors, is now bigger than General Motors. Intense competition within the auto industry has resulted in steady improvements in the workmanship, performance, safety and design of cars, while holding down prices. That's the ideal outcome for consumers but not for General Motors, which, as the largest automaker, had the most to lose.
 Pop-culture economics assumes that competition crushes the little guy, but in practice it's often the big enchilada that gets eaten. AT&T was besieged by competition and now barely exists. ABC, CBS and NBC have been pecked down by cable stations. Sears and Kmart, even combined into a single company, are shadows of their former selves, with falling sales and far fewer locations. In recent years, McDonald's and Microsoft have seen flat or faltering market share, as more nimble competitors move in. (Subway is close to passing McDonald's for total outlets.) How long can Wal-Mart, the world's largest corporation, maintain its invincible position? Target and Europe's Tesco are giving it Wal-Mart fits. 
 Competitors often concentrate their fire on the industry leader because its sales represent the richest target. And in the auto business, the old General Motors was an enchilada with extra cheese. In 1990, it sold 5 million passenger vehicles in the United States; last year, the company sold 4.6 million, and its 2005 sales are likely to be lower. 
 In 1990, G.M. had 35 assembly plants and employed 228,000 hourly workers; when the new round of cuts and closings take effect, General Motors will be down to perhaps 23 assembly plants and 85,000 hourly workers. The Oldsmobile brand is history, and either the Buick or Pontiac brand may follow.
 In recent years, General Motors has offered cash-back deals that wreaked havoc with the company's operating margins. Last week, the company announced a fire sale, offering most vehicles at its employee discount price, about $5,000 below the list price. Basically for the month of June, G.M. will give its cars away. And the worst is yet to come: Toyota is on pace to pass it as the world's No.1 automaker.
 For all its struggles, General Motors still sells more cars than anyone else, both in the United States and globally. But its future is almost certainly one of still-lower market share. Last week, my youngest son's public elementary school held a band concert in Bethesda, Md., the sort of trend-setter community that indicates the direction of future sales. Of the 108 vehicles in the school parking lot when the concert started, just 11 bore G.M. badges. General Motors cars still sell well in rural areas and the Midwest. But G.M. keeps losing ground in the leading-edge communities of California, the Northeast Corridor and Pacific Northwest. 
 Many factors contributed to the General Motors decline -- health care costs, corporate bureaucracy and detachment from the market. (Toyota, Honda and others have long focused their marketing research on California, to be close to the pulse of car culture. G.M. does its big thinking in Michigan, which is a little like studying fashion in Toledo.) Company executives bet heavily that gas prices and poor fuel economy would not dampen enthusiasm for G.M.'s S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks; now, that is happening.
 General Motors also declined because of poor quality. But in this spring's influential J.D. Power & Associates automotive workmanship rankings, General Motors rose to No. 2, trailing only Toyota for overall quality. The Buick and Cadillac divisions ranked ahead of Mercedes. 
 Yet even if a new generation is drawn to G.M.'s products, recovery of its former position seems unlikely. Other brands have improved, too: J.D. Power estimates that for the auto industry overall, manufacturing defects declined 32 percent since 1998 alone. 
 There is also great pressure to hold prices down, which is bad for companies like G.M. with vast amounts of overhead. According to the consumer price index, new cars and light trucks today cost less in real-dollar terms than in 1982, despite having air bags, antilock brakes, CD players, power windows and other features either unavailable or considered luxury options back then. 
 This means that during the very period that General Motors has declined, American car buyers have become better off. Competition can have the effect of ''creative destruction,'' in the economist Joseph Schumpeter's famous term, harming workers in some places, while everyone else comes out ahead.
 FOR instance, the same week that G.M.'s cut made the front pages, DaimlerChrysler announced it would invest $40 billion in North American operations over the next five years, including building a new assembly plant in Illinois and expanding factories in Ohio and Michigan. 
 According to a study by the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, non-Detroit automakers have in the last two years created 55,000 new factory jobs in the United States. Today just under 50 percent of the ''foreign'' cars sold in America are made here, with BMW, Honda, Nissan, Toyota and others operating large factories in Alabama, California, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee. About 800,000 passenger vehicles are expected to be manufactured this year in Alabama, all for global brands; cars have become to the state's economy what cotton once was. 
 As it continues to shrink, G.M. may serve as an exemplar of what the world economy will do in many arenas -- knock off established leaders, while improving quality and cutting prices. In their 2001 book ''Creative Destruction,'' Richard Foster and Sarah Kaplan, analysts at McKinsey & Company, documented how even powerhouse companies that are ''built to last'' usually succumb to competition. 
 Competition can be a utilitarian force that brings the greatest good to the greatest number. Someday when the remaining divisions of General Motors are bought by some start-up company that doesn't even exist yet, try to keep that in mind.

HEADLINE: In Overhaul of Social Security, Age Is the Elephant in the Room

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11 

 BODY:
Americans turning 65 this year can expect to live, on average, until they are 83, four and a half years longer than the typical 65-year-old could expect in 1940. And government actuaries predict that American life spans will just keep growing.
 This demographic trend -- by 2040, the average 65-year-old will live to about 85 -- has major financial implications for Social Security and major political implications for the lawmakers now trying to overhaul the system.
 Policy experts across the political spectrum, who agree on little else, have told Congress in recent weeks that any effort to improve Social Security's long-term finances should somehow deal with this jump in life expectancy -- by adjusting benefits, raising the retirement age, increasing taxes or creating new incentives to work longer. 
 Not only are Americans living longer, these experts say, but most are also retiring earlier, and these demographic pressures will be heightened by the sheer size of the baby boom generation -- 78 million strong -- which will begin to retire in the next five years. 
 Major committees in the House and Senate, struggling to produce Social Security legislation this summer, are beginning to confront the longevity issue. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the chairman of the Finance Committee, says the retirement age will be addressed in the solvency plan he hopes to develop with his fellow party members in the coming week, and his Republican counterparts in the House are holding hearings on the issue on Tuesday.
 ''We've got to deal with reality,'' said Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi.
 But the politics are treacherous, all the more so because Republicans are dealing with it alone. Democrats have refused to engage in discussions over Social Security's finances until President Bush withdraws his proposal to create private investment accounts in the program.
 The most direct way to deal with the financial strain of greater longevity is simply to raise the retirement age, which now stands at 65 years and 6 months and will gradually rise under current law to 67 for people born in 1960 and later. But of all the options to shore up Social Security's finances, that ranks as one of the most unpopular, pollsters say. In a New York Times/CBS News Poll earlier this year, nearly 8 out of 10 respondents said they would oppose raising the age when people are eligible for Social Security benefits.
 Political strategists say this issue is viewed very differently by policy experts, who may see nothing wrong with working longer, and average Americans, with jobs that may be uninteresting, stressful or physically demanding, who are often eager to retire and doubtful of their employment prospects in their mid-to-late 60's. 
 ''In Washington, the focus is on the demographic reality that people live longer, and most of the people who are having this conversation wouldn't mind working well into their 70's and 80's,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. ''But out in the country, most working people don't look forward to working forever.''
 Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster, agreed: ''Forty might be the new 30, but they don't necessarily believe that 70 is the new 65.''
 Lawmakers in both parties have acknowledged that many people not only want to but also need to retire at 62 or 65. Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, recently reflected, ''I know my father, in terms of his plumbing activities, was pretty -- the phrase, I guess, would be pretty used up by the time he was 65.'' Representative Earl Pomeroy, Democrat of North Dakota, a committee member, said, ''I represent a lot of people doing some pretty hard labor out there on those farms.''
 As a result, many analysts say any proposal to deal with increased life expectancy would probably include some protections for low-income workers in physically taxing fields. There are other potential inequities associated with raising the retirement age: on average, women live longer than men; whites live longer than blacks; the rich live longer than the poor.
 Another political hurdle is AARP, the lobby for older Americans, which notes that a major increase in the retirement age is already under way as a result of the last significant overhaul of Social Security, in 1983. The normal retirement age, as the Social Security Administration calls it, is to rise by about two months a year until it reaches 67 in 2027. (One proposal occasionally discussed is simply speeding up the increase to 67.)
 Workers can take earlier retirement at 62, as most do, but their benefit checks are reduced as a result -- 20 percent or more every month for the rest of their lives, depending on how early they retire.
 David Certner, director of federal affairs for AARP, said, ''Just because you raise the age, doesn't mean there will be jobs out there so you can continue working, even if you want to.'' Moreover, he added: ''you've got a whole group of people who are just not physically or mentally able to continue. I think a lot of people recognize that if you change the age, you just push those people onto the disability rolls,'' which are financed by the same Social Security taxes as retirement benefits.
 Still, experts say that the system as a whole needs to reflect the new demographic realities. C. Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and a former official in the Reagan administration, notes that Americans already retire, on average, for close to one-third of their adult lives, and argues that Social Security ''has morphed into a middle-age retirement system.''
 The change in the last 60 years is striking: The average retirement age in 1940 was 68. As recently as 1965, about two-thirds of workers did not begin drawing Social Security benefits until they were 65 or older. Now, more than half retire at 62 or younger, and three-quarters receive their first benefit checks before they are 65.
 Edward M. Gramlich, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board and an authority on Social Security, says that if the architects of Social Security ''had known about the explosion in life expectancy, they would have put in some adjustment in the retirement age.''
 One way to address the problem -- and the direction some lawmakers seem to be heading in -- is an automatic adjustment in the retirement age or the benefits received at each age to reflect increases in life expectancy. That way, retirees' total lifetime benefits would remain more or less constant even as they lived longer. Automatic changes are already made for average wage increases and price inflation.
 For individuals, such a change, called indexing for longevity, would be little different from a direct increase in the retirement age or a specified reduction in benefits, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, director of the Congressional Budget Office. But for the system, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said, it would make a big difference because the changes would be automatic and would not require new laws.
 It might also be politically attractive because politicians would be relieved of the responsibility of periodically voting to raise the retirement age or to cut benefits.
 Adjusting the system for longevity would not contribute much to solving Social Security's solvency problem over the next 30 years or so, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. But over 75 years and longer, he said, it would have an important effect.
 Still, pollsters question whether even a gradual adjustment based on life expectancy will sell. ''You can call it indexing for longevity in Washington, but in America it's raising the retirement age,'' said Mr. Garin, the Democratic pollster. Mr. Bolger, his Republican counterpart, said, ''There's no appetite for anything related to age among the public.''

HEADLINE: War on Terror Dominates Talks Given at Graduations

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton addressed an audience of graduates in New Haven this spring as ''you who entered Yale as the twin towers fell.'' Many other commencement speakers, including Tom Hanks, also emphasized that this year's graduating class was the first whose entire university career unfolded in the post 9-11 world.
 ''None of you were untouched by the events in September of your freshmen year, none unaffected by the ideological movements of local and geopolitics since,'' Mr. Hanks told Vassar graduates.
 The Sept. 11 attacks and the war on terrorism dominated speeches again on hundreds of college campuses this spring as an estimated a million students who were freshmen in 2001 received their diplomas. 
 At Texas A&M, Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, who until last summer served as the top commander in Iraq, compared the challenges posed by the war on terror to those that face corporate, judicial and academic leaders. Vice President Dick Cheney drew cheers at the Air Force Academy when he said, ''This is a war we are winning.'' 
 Many other speakers warned of the erosion of civility, loss of political liberties and outright threats to the rule of law that have emerged over the last four years.
 ''I can never remember a time in my life when people were so afraid to speak out,'' said James McBride, an author and jazz musician who addressed Pratt University graduates. ''I can never remember a time when you were actually afraid to ask someone what political party they belong to, or who they voted for.''
 The speakers this year included the usual eclectic lineup of politicians, including media stars like Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who spoke at several commencements, and Senator John McCain, who spoke at the University of Oklahoma, as well as dozens of obscure state representatives who spoke at remote community colleges; poets like Edwin Hirsch; scientists like Jane Goodall; dozens of clergy members; the former astronaut Neil Armstrong; and at least one cook, Mario Batali. Foreign heads of state this year included President Ricardo Lagos of Chile, who spoke at Duke, and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, who addressed Boston University graduates under the watchful eyes of Secret Service sharpshooters on nearby rooftops.
 President Bush addressed two graduation ceremonies, offering significantly different messages. At Calvin College, a Christian institution in Michigan, he praised community groups across America that bring ''people together for the common good'' and urged graduates to work in them to strengthen grass-roots democracy. At the Naval Academy, he said that the Pentagon's extraordinary new weapons systems were ''transforming war in our favor.'' He urged the graduating midshipmen not only to fight the terrorists but also to help ''transform our military for the 21st century, so we can deter and defeat the new adversaries who may threaten our people in the decades ahead.''
 Not all speakers, of course, dwelt on terrorism. Many speeches were feel-good exercises dominated by homilies and truisms.
 ''The point of a commencement speech is to congratulate you, your parents, and all those who have supported you,'' said Stephen G. Breyer, the Supreme Court justice, in his address to New School University in New York City. ''A graduation speaker also should tell a joke, give advice, make a prediction, express a hope.''
 Chris Matthews, the host of MSNBC's ''Hardball'' program, combined advice and humor. He counseled students to travel widely before settling down, and he recalled how he once heard Nelson Mandela ''tell a story of the first Christmas eve, how St. Joseph begged the innkeeper for a room.''
 ''My wife is pregnant, really pregnant.''
 ''It's not my fault,'' barked the innkeeper.
 St. Joseph answered, ''It's not my fault either.''

 After so many years of American dominance in science and technology, the rest of the world is clearly starting to catch up. Countries like China and India, which have been sending their best and brightest students to study in America, are now working to keep more of their young scholars at home. They are building their own networks of fine research universities, and forging their own partnerships with government and private industry, and establishing their own high-tech communities.
 And while fewer students from overseas are coming to study physics and computer science and engineering at American schools, ever fewer U.S. students are choosing to enter these critical areas of study as well. This should be a serious concern for every member of this faculty, for every corporate executive who needs a high-tech workforce, and for people like the secretary of energy, who has to make sure that we have enough good engineers and scientists working in our national laboratories, universities and other institutions. Clearly, one of this nation's urgent challenges in the coming years is rekindling an interest in math and science among our young people.

 The great leader is one who is willing to ''lead under fire.'' Now you may think, ''Hey I am not going to be a soldier, so I won't be on any battlefield.'' But wait a minute, every profession has its battlefields -- the courtroom, the classroom, the boardroom -- and for the soldier it is the killing fields. You will immediately find yourself in your chosen profession's battlefield facing challenges that parallel what I face as a professional warrior -- leading units and individual soldiers under very tough conditions to accomplish missions critical to the survival of our institution under austere, expeditionary and uncertain conditions. That is when a leader must step forward and lead -- our ethics mandate it and our subordinates expect it.

 Smart folks concocted a computer simulation of gridlock to determine how many cars should be taken off the road to turn a completely jammed and stilled highway into a free-flowing one. The results were startling. Four cars needed to be removed four cars out of each one hundred. Call it the Power of Four. If merely four people out of a hundred can make gridlock go away by choosing not to use their car, imagine the other changes that can be wrought just by four of us out of a hundred. Take a hundred musicians in a depressed port city in Northern England, choose John, Paul, George and Ringo and you have ''Hey Jude.'' Take a hundred computer geeks in Redmond, Wash., send 96 of them home and the remainder is called Microsoft. Take the Power of Four and apply it to any and every area of your concern. Politics: Four votes swung from one hundred into another hundred is the difference between gaining control and losing clout. Culture: two ticket buyers out of fifty can make a small, odd film profitable.

 Revolutionary advances in technology are transforming war in our favor. And in the decades ahead, the changes will be even more dramatic. ... These technological advances will put unprecedented agility, speed, precision, and power in your hands, and you will use them to protect the American people in the dangerous decades ahead. ... Technology changes the balance of war in another important way: We can now strike our enemies with greater effectiveness, at greater range, with fewer civilian casualties. In this new era of warfare, we can target a regime, not a nation, and that means terrorists and tyrants can no longer feel safe hiding behind innocent life. In the 21st century, we can target the guilty and protect the innocent, and that makes it easier to keep the peace.

 The case for the way we do business in the present is weak, and anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you something. Some of them are simply folks who benefit from stasis. But then there are the powerful people. And people who are in power seek to magnify their importance, and there's no greater way to do that than to paint the present as an outstanding victory, the happy ending to a long and harrowing story. And why does this matter? Because if there's someone competent in the driver's seat, then we can sit back, relax and watch the scenery go by. But if the world we're given is flawed, we've got to do something about it. If we're in a car that's headed over a precipice and there's no one at the wheel, someone had better grab the steering wheel before we go over the edge.

 Seldom have I felt as concerned for the rule of law. Prominent elected officials, and others, talk openly about the need to punish judges -- and that is their word, ''punish'' -- for making unpopular decisions. Judges are threatened with impeachment for ruling to uphold constitutional rights of disfavored minorities, or for striking down laws of Congress. Proposals are advanced to strip courts of jurisdiction to hear certain kinds of cases, to deny courts the ability to review even constitutional claims. A prominent Congressman endorses a campaign, in the word of its sponsors, to ''save America from the judges.'' I worry when judicial independence is seen as a problem to be solved, and not a value to be cherished. Respect for the rule of law is deeply embedded in our American experience. But it is not imbedded in our DNA. Each new generation must decide, each of you must decide, whether to embrace, to protect the rule of law or to repudiate it. And make no mistake, inaction and indifference are acts of repudiation.

 Pay attention to the truth. It's not an intellectual thing. It's a gut thing. My truth is that I love real, honest, passionate, intense experiences. Experiences that don't apologize for themselves or claim to be something they aren't. You want a recipe? Boil some spaghetti in well-salted water. While you're doing that, heat up some good extra-virgin olive oil in a skillet and throw in some thin slices of garlic and some red pepper flakes. When the pasta's cooked, toss it in the skillet. Throw in some chopped parsley and a little of the pasta water. Toss it around. Put it on a plate. Grate some Parmigiano Reggiano on top. Congratulations, dude. You've just made spaghetti all'aglio e olio. One of the greatest simple truths of humankind -- and a damn good emergency dinner. That's a recipe. It's an idea. It's a dish. It's an icon. It's an experience. It's not rules. And as you cook up your life, I hope you never let anyone else's recipe for success intimidate you or get in your way. Rules are overrated.

 When I was about 10 years old I found the books about Tarzan and fell in love madly with this glorious lord of the jungle. That was when my dream crystallized. Everybody laughed at me but eventually I got to Africa. And over the 45 years of study, the most striking thing is we now know how like us chimpanzees are. We even share 99 percent of the composition of our DNA with them. Their brain is more like ours than that of any other living creature. They have intellectual capabilities that we used to think unique to us. Nonverbal communication, kissing, embracing, holding hands, patting on the back, swaggering, shaking the fist, throwing rocks. Family bonds that persist throughout life, and life can be over 60 years. We realize there is no sharp line dividing us from the rest of the animal kingdom, it's a very blurry line. And it leads to a new respect, not only for these chimpanzees, but the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet.

 Mutual respect is the lifeblood of democracy. The signs of disrespect are all around us. In the ferocious assault on the judiciary. In the shrill debate over Terri Schiavo. And worst of all, in the hateful ad hominem attacks that issue daily from the radio and TV talk shows. We are living in a smash-mouth culture in which extremists dominate public debate to the point of hijacking it. You cannot have a reasoned discussion about abortion when one side is slandered as ''baby-killers'' and the other side is smeared as ''religious wing nuts.'' It is hard to pursue a reasoned debate about the Iraqi war when opponents of the war are accused of treason and the president of the United States is compared to Hitler. Reach across the aisle, pursue collaborative solutions, or explore the shades of gray on any charged issue, and you are likely to be ignored or dismissed as indecisive. That's if you're lucky. More likely, you will endure crude and often malicious attacks on your intelligence, faith and patriotism. You may even face death threats.

 There are those who believe that the best idea is to give everyone one big refund on their government -- divvy it up into individual portions, hand it out, and encourage everyone to use their share to go buy their own health care, their own retirement plan, their own child care, education and so forth. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society. But in our past there has been another term for it -- Social Darwinism, every man and woman for him or herself. This isn't us. This isn't how our story ends -- not in this country. America is a land of big dreamers and big hopes. So let's dream. Let's imagine what we can do to give every American a fighting chance in the 21st century. Every one of us will have to work more, read more, train more, think more. We will have to slough off bad habits -- like driving gas guzzlers that weaken our economy and feed our enemies abroad. Our kids will have to turn off the TV sets and put away the video games and start hitting the books. We will have to reform institutions, like our public schools, that were designed for an earlier time. Republicans will have to recognize our collective responsibilities, even as Democrats recognize that we have to do more than just defend the old programs.

 It is now conventional to talk about how Sept. 11 changed everything. This is often said with a tone of ''it is time to set aside foolish causes like human rights and turn to serious causes like national security.'' I think that is the wrong point. We all felt the sense of unity that first characterized the response to September 11. We need that strength to make sure that the things that define us as a society are not compromised and lost.

 Thank you. Thank you for standing up, and thank you for sitting back down. You don't know how many times in politics a standing ovation is a cover for a mass exodus. I want to thank each and every one of you who took time to pray for me. I deeply appreciate your prayers. The Apostle Paul in writing to a friend of his a couple thousand years ago -- aren't you glad that we didn't have the Internet back then, it would have all been lost in deleted e-mail. But he said, ''I exhort you therefore to pray one for another, for kings and for all who are in authority that we might lead quiet and peaceful lives in all godliness and honesty.'' What a tremendous exhortation to pray for each other and to pray for those, especially those in authority!

 Not long ago I read from the Declaration of Independence in the Capitol Rotunda in Washington. I was arrested and jailed for doing so. As I thought that was a violation of my free speech rights under the Constitution, I went back and read from the Bill of Rights. That landed me in jail, too. I felt freer in that jail, because I had spoken out as a free person, than I have ever felt in the open air. And I am not finished being a free American, whatever happy costs await me. I do not know what is in store for you. But I know that courage is freedom, and freedom is joy.

 If I were 21 I would walk the earth. I would go barefoot longer; I'd learn how to throw a Frisbee, I'd go braless if I were a woman and I would wear no underwear if I were a man. I'd play cards and wear the same pair of jeans until they were so stiff they could get up and strut around the room by themselves. So don't take the short road. Fool around. Have fun. You're not going to get this time back. Don't panic and go to graduate school and law school. This nation has enough frightened, dissatisfied yuppies living in gated communities, driving S.U.V.'s and wondering where their youth went. 
 We need you to walk the earth, so that other nations can see the beauty of American youth, rather than seeing our young in combat fatigues behind the barrel of an M-16.

 The new racism that is seeping up across our land is wrapped up in new euphemisms, in budget technicalities, in judicial and criminal justice choices, in racial disparities in health and in education. Frederick Douglass warned us it is still the same old snake. I am deeply concerned that the black preschool boy today, born in 2001, has a one-in-three chance of going to prison before he reaches 30, that we've got 58,000 black males in prison and fewer of them -- 40,000 -- who graduate from college each year. A cradle-to-prison pipeline threatens decades of hard-earned civil rights progress for poor children, especially poor males of color.

 I never set out to be a role model, to get to the corner office, or to have a big career -- or any career for that matter. After Smith, the only reason I went on to get an M.B.A. from Columbia was because I needed a job and I heard that if a woman had an M.B.A. they probably wouldn't make her type, which is what you had to do starting out in the commercial world at the time if you were a woman. By the way, this was only a hypothesis, not proven fact. There weren't enough women M.B.A.'s to know if they would still make you type even if you had the degree. I needed a job to make money so I could get married and George and I could eat. Simple as that. And I didn't want to type.

 You must know that many adults of my generation despair of your generation. All too often in my primary field of endeavor -- sports -- the headlines go to the players who defy authority and misbehave on and off the field, players who showboat and show up others. Instead, those who should be recognized more often are the fine athletes who are also fine citizens and role models for the youngsters following in their footsteps.

 A scientist at Stanford University, a Nobel Prize winner no less, who successfully placed human cells in mice, recently announced that he now wants to create mice with entirely human brains. I am not making this up. This should alarm us all. Sixty years ago, the essayist E.B. White once spoke of the dangers that arise when man plays God. He described it as man ''stealing God's stuff.'' This morning we must ask ourselves: When we play creator and mix mice and men; when we tamper with the institutions of marriage and family; when we calibrate whose lives are worth living and whose are not; and when we discount the lives of our poor, are we not playing God?

 The web of cooperation is under siege. A profound transformation is occurring in America as the balance between wealth and the commonwealth is threatened by that ''winner-take-all'' ideology. From public schools and universities to public lands and other natural resources, from the media with their broadcast and digital spectrums to scientific discovery and medical breakthroughs -- and to politics itself -- a broad range of the American commons is undergoing a powerful shift away from public responsibility and obligation to private control and exploitation. This is no ordinary time. You are leaving here as the basic constitutional principles of America are under assault -- an independent press and judiciary, the separation of church and state, progressive taxation and the social contract. You are going to be needed if we are to recover America as a shared project.

A collection of excerpts on Sunday from this season's commencement speeches misstated the name of the institution where the writer and composer James McBride spoke. It is Pratt Institute, not Pratt University. The excerpt from remarks by Marian Wright Edelman included an erroneous figure, from Colgate University's text, for the number of black males in American prisons. In 2002, it was 580,000, not 58,000.

HEADLINE: U.S. Asks Others To Pressure Iraq To Be Inclusive

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, seeking to close the continuing rift between Shiite and dissident Sunni Arab leaders in Iraq, is enlisting Europe, the Arab world and the United Nations to pressure the Baghdad government to include minorities in the political process, administration and other diplomats say. 
 The American effort has produced consensus among a broad spectrum of countries, including many that had opposed the 2003 invasion and have been reluctant to send troops or large donations. 
 These countries, which have joined in general United Nations resolutions supporting elections and the reconstruction of Iraq, are now said by American officials to be ready to go a step further by trying to persuade Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari and his Shiite and Kurdish allies to be more inclusive. 
 The administration officials and diplomats said the campaign was taking several forms, from a surprise visit to Baghdad last week by top envoys of the European Union and Britain to a conference in Brussels on June 22 on Iraq, to be attended by envoys from 80 countries, the United Nations, the World Bank, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. 
 Though the Baghdad government has taken some steps in reaching out to Sunni Arabs, the administration has found it hard to persuade it to do more while acting alone. In part, that is because the new government, confident in its popular mandate, is less open to American influence, and the United States, not wanting to be seen as manipulating Iraqi politics, has not wanted to press harder alone.
 ''The ostensible reason for the conference is for the international community to recognize the legitimacy of the newly elected Iraqi government,'' said an administration official, asking not to be identified because of the implicit criticism of the new government of Mr. Jaafari. ''The other reason, less stated publicly, is to get the Iraq government to commit to steps so that it is not a narrowly based Shiite regime.'' 
 The administration official said that the Shiite leadership of the new government, which was elected at the end of January in balloting largely boycotted by Sunni Arabs, had made some headway in inviting Sunnis into the constitution-writing process, but that ''Sunni dissatisfaction remains deep.''
 ''There is a kind of radical, unrepentant core of Shiites in the government that thinks they've done plenty and don't need to do more,'' the official said.
 The administration and its international allies have three main signals they want to send at the conference: making sure the political process reflects Iraq's political diversity, ensuring that the constitution protects minority rights and a separation of the state from religious law and, finally, guaranteeing that Iraq maintains a federal system that prevents the Kurdish region and others from splitting off.
 Administration, Western, Arab and European diplomats speaking about the conference asked not to be identified because they did not want to be seen as pressuring Iraq. They said it was uncertain whether the conference would achieve any immediate result in terms of Iraq's politics, but that bringing together a broad group of nations, including some that had declined to join the war or send peacekeeping troops, would send a positive message to Baghdad.
 ''The idea is to take another step forward in the creation of a new Iraq,'' said a second administration official. ''Having the French, the Germans, the Russians and the United States sitting together and underscoring a common vision for Iraq will be a significant event, even at this point. But what happens is not up to us. It's up to the Iraqis.''
 European, Arab and United Nations diplomats said in interviews that they supported the administration's goal of making the Iraqi government more inclusive and that they would work to press for further steps and for a process of producing a constitution with guarantees for minorities, in their own contacts with Iraq and at Brussels.
 ''We cannot be seen as telling the government in Baghdad what to do,'' said an Arab diplomat, asking not to be identified because he did not want to be seen as insulting the Iraqis. ''But we can tell them what they need to gain international legitimacy.'' 
 A European diplomat said: ''The constitution has to be put together by the Iraqis. But people in the international community have to make clear that we're following what they do very closely, and that all segments of Iraqi society must participate and that United Nations Security Council resolutions have to be respected.''
 The diplomat was referring to the goal set by the Security Council to complete the constitution-writing process by August and hold a referendum and elect a new government by early next year.
 A Western diplomat with extensive contacts in Iraq said the new Iraqi government was not as amenable to pressure as the Iraqi Governing Council, its predecessor. The council members were put in place by the American-led occupation administration, chosen mainly from among exile leaders.
 ''This is not an American puppet government anymore,'' said the diplomat. ''It's standing up to the United States because it feels it has been elected and has legitimacy.''
 The first administration official said, ''Despite the rhetoric and the to-ing and fro-ing in Washington, people in Washington are getting more worked up over Iraq as their influence on the ground becomes less and less.''
 American officials say the Brussels conference will not be aimed at new aid pledges from the international community or new troop commitments. The number of foreign troops in Iraq has dipped to 21,000, and of the $13 billion pledged in the fall of 2003 by international donors, only a fraction has been delivered.
 For example, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund set up two separate entities for contributions by donor countries, but only about $1 billion has gone into the funds so far. A major reason for the lag in donations is the security situation, which is also a main reason why only $7.5 billion of nearly $19 billion appropriated by the United States for reconstruction of Iraq two years ago has been spent.
 The political pressure is expected to be exerted in the conference most acutely when Iraqi envoys join with a session on Iraq's political future to be led jointly by Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations and a senior Egyptian envoy, most likely Foreign Minister Ahmed Abdul Gheit. A session on economic reconstruction is to be led by envoys of the European Union and Japan, and a session on ''rule of law and public order'' is to be led by Ms. Rice and Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief.
 Another element of the conference, administration officials said, would probably involve pressure by the Bush administration on Arab countries to upgrade their diplomatic representation in Baghdad. 
 Arab countries say, however, that the only obstacle to sending such missions is security. A month ago, King Abdullah II of Jordan said the country would send an ambassador as soon as one could be protected.

THE SURVIVOR
Bill Clinton in
the White House.
By John F. Harris.
Illustrated. 504 pp.
Random House. $29.95.
 MILLIONS of Americans despise Bill Clinton. They have done so since he became a presence in national politics in the early 1990's, and they continue to do so today, more than four years after his retirement from public office. 
 The passion of the Clinton haters is a phenomenon without equal in recent American politics. It is not based on any specific policies that Clinton promoted or implemented during his years in office. It is almost entirely personal. In its persistence and intensity, it goes far beyond anything that comparable numbers of people have felt about Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan or either of the presidents Bush. It surpasses even the liberals' longstanding detestation of Richard Nixon. The only political obsession comparable to it in the past century is the hatred that a significant minority of Americans felt for Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 
 In this respect the phenomenon is all the more puzzling. Roosevelt made enormous and sometimes reckless changes in the American government and economy, and when his critics loathed him for it, he loathed them back. ''They are unanimous in their hate for me'' he said of them in his 1936 re-election campaign, ''and I welcome their hatred.'' Clinton, on the other hand, was a centrist who undertook no dramatic transformations of society or government and, what was more, showed himself to be an instinctive conciliator who believed in compromise almost to a fault. 
 Viewed in historical perspective, Clinton-hatred is not easy to explain. Certainly the Monica Lewinsky affair does not explain it. The people who detested the president after that dalliance became public were essentially the same ones who had detested him in 1992. They merely grew louder.
 There is, of course, a simpler argument that some Clinton haters use to explain the persistence of their passion. They say that he was, to put it bluntly, a very bad president -- immature, self-absorbed, indecisive in domestic affairs and disastrously weak when it came to representing America in the affairs of the world.
 It is this argument that John F. Harris utterly demolishes in ''The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House,'' his thorough, readable and scrupulously honest account of the Clinton years. Harris, who was The Washington Post's White House correspondent from 1995 through 2000, is no Clinton apologist. His portraits of the decision-making process he witnessed reveal a president who indeed lacked discipline in his daily routine; examined and re-examined policy choices endlessly, to the frustration of his advisers; and was fearful about the use of military force abroad, even in behalf of the most defensible causes.
 But over the course of 500 pages, Harris also documents the history of a president who, however frustrating he may have been in style and method, usually made the right choices in the end -- even when he felt that he was hurting himself politically. The 1993 spending cuts and tax increases, over which he agonized for months, ultimately reduced the federal deficit, reassured financial markets and set in motion the prosperity that marked the second half of the decade. The 1996 Welfare Reform Act, which Clinton signed against the advice of his closest Democratic allies, turned out to be the most successful domestic policy initiative of the 1990's. 
 On Bosnia in the early years and then on Kosovo in 1999, the president did shrink from military action while hostilities continued and innocent people died. But the war in Bosnia was settled at an administration-sponsored peace conference in Ohio in 1995, and a few weeks of American bombing persuaded Slobodan Milosevic to give up his assault on Kosovo in 1999. By the time Clinton left office, Bosnia was in the midst of a peaceful recovery, and Milosevic had been deposed from power and was awaiting trial as a war criminal.
 Harris tells all the important stories of the Clinton years in detached, workmanlike prose that not only tracks the events and decisions but offers perceptive judgments of the figures who were close to the president as they unfolded. The national security adviser, Sandy Berger, was ''a shrewdly political man'' who, when Clinton barked at him, ''was comfortable barking right back.'' The chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, was a natural organizer who, as Harris saw him, protested a little too often about his preference for business over politics. The treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, had ''an appreciation for shades of gray and a disdain for absolutes that were very much like Clinton's.'' 
 Most impressive is Harris's balance and fairness. All of Clinton's conspicuous personal failings are detailed, including the sexual obsessions that ultimately cost him much of his reputation. But his warmth, optimism and sense of larger purpose come through equally well. ''However heedless he could sometimes be in his personal life,'' Harris writes in the closing pages, ''Clinton brought a dutiful sensibility to his public life.'' Having tangled with the president numerous times over eight years of reporting on him -- and having chronicled some of those conflicts openly in the pages of his newspaper -- Harris sounds at the end very much as if he would enjoy having a few dinners with Clinton in years to come. In this, he is similar to so many of the people, from all walks of life, who have come to know Bill Clinton well -- including a large number of his political enemies. If it were only Clinton's admirers who enjoyed his company, he would not be the social celebrity he has become since 2001.
 Most presidents -- most public leaders -- are complex human beings, and that is certainly true in Clinton's case. But as Harris makes clear, he was more than that: he was a man who appreciated complexities and pondered them endlessly; who saw the ambiguity in nearly any policy situation; who loved to tease out the subtleties and distinctions that lesser minds found uninteresting. Occasionally during the Clinton presidency, writers dredged up Scott Fitzgerald's definition of a first-rate intelligence: that of someone who could hold two opposed ideas in his head at the same time and still function. No one in the past century of American politics met that test better than Clinton.
 Sometimes it brought him serious trouble, as when he labored to tell the literal but not the contextual truth to prosecutors in the Lewinsky case, and left much of the public angry at him. Sometimes it made him maddeningly slow to make up his mind. Erskine Bowles once marveled at Clinton's ability to ''analyze all the factors, all the risks and opportunities, and weigh them brilliantly.'' On those occasions, Bowles said, all the president needed was someone who could make sure he wasn't influenced to change his mind by the last old friend whom he happened to talk to on the phone. Such is the hazardous life of any politician blessed -- or cursed -- by the ability to see all sides of a difficult question.
 But if Clinton was indecisive, he was also supremely resilient. This is the quality that seems most to impress Harris, and the one the title of his book emphasizes. Clinton may have been a man plagued by uncertainties, but he was also a man who never gave up. Not when the Republicans humiliated him in the 1994 election; not when they seemed to have him cornered in budget negotiations the following year; not when the Lewinsky case seemed as if it would force him out of office in disgrace. ''I'm the big rubber clown you had as a kid,'' he told Newt Gingrich, his Republican nemesis, in 1995. ''The harder you hit me, the faster I come back up.'' That very trait -- documented by Harris in situation after situation -- portrays a strength of character seldom acknowledged by Clinton's many critics.
 If, as Harris believes, Clinton was in the most important ways a competent president -- and certainly not a combative or ideological one -- then the conundrum of Clinton-hatred remains essentially unsolved. Harris does try to explain it. He suggests -- as others have -- that Clinton, not entirely through his own doing, suffered as the embodiment of a generation and a set of values that much of the country had never understood or been willing to accept. He was the tangible symbol of the Baby Boom, its conceits, its self-absorption, its lack of discipline and failures of responsibility. He was a child of the 1960's preaching to millions of people who had never come to terms with the 1960's and didn't want to be reminded of them. 
 Robert Reich, Clinton's labor secretary and close friend since their Oxford days together, told Harris that Clinton's personal history of youthful rebellion and conventional adult success, all achieved without significant personal sacrifice, was threatening to many Americans, even if they themselves did not entirely understand why. And so they despised him. And they despised his wife. Whether Hillary Clinton manages in the end to overcome this generational taint may be one of the more significant political questions of the next few years.
 The generational issue is surely not the only explanation of Clinton hatred, but it may be the most persuasive one anybody has presented so far. Ultimately there will be others. The debate about Bill Clinton, about his character and achievements and moral worth, will go on long after the subject himself has departed from the scene. Clinton ''was too vital and too vexing a character to be easily forgotten or dismissed,'' Harris writes. This is a complex, interesting and subtle book about a complex, interesting and subtle man.

HEADLINE: Don't Follow the Money

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THE morning the Deep Throat story broke, the voice on my answering machine was as raspy as Hal Holbrook's. ''I just want you to remember that I wrote 'Follow the money,''' said my caller. ''I want to know if anybody will give me credit. Watch for the accuracy of the media!''
 The voice belonged to my friend William Goldman, who wrote the movie ''All the President's Men.'' His words proved more than a little prescient. As if on cue, journalists everywhere -- from The New York Times to The Economist to The Washington Post itself -- would soon start attributing this classic line of dialogue to the newly unmasked Deep Throat, W. Mark Felt. But the line was not in Woodward and Bernstein's book or in The Post's Watergate reportage or in Bob Woodward's contemporaneous notes. It was the invention of the author of ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' ''Marathon Man'' and ''The Princess Bride.'' 
 This confusion of Hollywood's version of history with the genuine article would quickly prove symptomatic of the overall unreality of the Deep Throat coverage. Was Mr. Felt a hero or a villain? Should he ''follow the money'' into a book deal, and if so, how would a 91-year-old showing signs of dementia either write a book or schmooze about it with Larry King? How did Vanity Fair scoop The Post? How does Robert Redford feel about it all? Such were the questions that killed time for a nation awaiting the much-heralded feature mediathon, the Michael Jackson verdict.
 Richard Nixon and Watergate itself, meanwhile, were often reduced to footnotes. Three years ago, on Watergate's 30th anniversary, an ABC News poll found that two-thirds of Americans couldn't explain what the scandal was, and no one was racing to enlighten them this time around. Vanity Fair may have taken the trouble to remind us that Watergate was a web of crime yielding the convictions and guilty pleas of more than 30 White House and Nixon campaign officials, but few others did. Watergate has gone back to being the ''third-rate burglary'' of Nixon administration spin. It is once again being covered up. 
 Not without reason. Had the scandal been vividly resuscitated as the long national nightmare it actually was, it would dampen all the Felt fun by casting harsh light on our own present nightmare. ''The fundamental right of Americans, through our free press, to penetrate and criticize the workings of our government is under attack as never before'' was how the former Nixon speech writer William Safire put it on this page almost nine months ago. The current administration, a second-term imperial presidency that outstrips Nixon's in hubris by the day, leads the attack, trying to intimidate and snuff out any Woodwards or Bernsteins that might challenge it, any media proprietor like Katharine Graham or editor like Ben Bradlee who might support them and any anonymous source like Deep Throat who might enable them to find what Carl Bernstein calls ''the best obtainable version of the truth.''
 The attacks continue to be so successful that even now, long after many news organizations, including The Times, have been found guilty of failing to puncture the administration's prewar W.M.D. hype, new details on that same story are still being ignored or left uninvestigated. The July 2002 ''Downing Street memo,'' the minutes of a meeting in which Tony Blair and his advisers learned of a White House effort to fix ''the intelligence and facts'' to justify the war in Iraq, was published by The London Sunday Times on May 1. Yet in the 19 daily Scott McClellan briefings that followed, the memo was the subject of only 2 out of the approximately 940 questions asked by the White House press corps, according to Eric Boehlert of Salon.
 This is the kind of lapdog news media the Nixon White House cherished. To foster it, Nixon's special counsel, Charles W. Colson, embarked on a ruthless program of intimidation that included threatening antitrust action against the networks if they didn't run pro-Nixon stories. Watergate tapes and memos make Mr. Colson, who boasted of ''destroying the old establishment,'' sound like the founding father of today's blogging lynch mobs. He exulted in bullying CBS to cut back its Watergate reports before the '72 election. He enlisted NBC in pro-administration propaganda by browbeating it to repackage 10-day-old coverage of Tricia Nixon's wedding as a prime-time special. It was the Colson office as well that compiled a White House enemies list that included journalists who had the audacity to question administration policies.
 Such is the equivalently supine state of much of the news media today that Mr. Colson was repeatedly trotted out, without irony, to pass moral judgment on Mr. Felt -- and not just on Fox News, the cable channel that is actually run by the former Nixon media maven, Roger Ailes. ''I want kids to look up to heroes,'' Mr. Colson said, oh so sorrowfully, on NBC's ''Today'' show, condemning Mr. Felt for dishonoring ''the confidence of the president of the United States.'' Never mind that Mr. Colson dishonored the law, proposed bombing the Brookings Institution and went to prison for his role in the break-in to steal the psychiatric records of The Times's Deep Throat on Vietnam, Daniel Ellsberg. The ''Today'' host, Matt Lauer, didn't mention any of this -- or even that his guest had done jail time. None of the other TV anchors who interviewed Mr. Colson -- and he was ubiquitous -- ever specified his criminal actions in the Nixon years. Some identified him onscreen only as a ''former White House counsel.''
 Had anyone been so rude (or professional) as to recount Mr. Colson's sordid past, or to raise the question of whether he was a hero or a traitor, the genealogical line between his Watergate-era machinations and those of his present-day successors would have been all too painfully clear. The main difference is that in the Nixon White House, the president's men plotted behind closed doors. The current administration is now so brazen it does its dirty work in plain sight. 
 In the most recent example, all the president's men slimed and intimidated Newsweek by accusing it of being an accessory to 17 deaths for its errant Koran story; led by Scott McClellan, they said it was unthinkable that any American guard could be disrespectful of Islam's holy book. These neo-Colsons easily drowned out Gen. Richard Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, both of whom said that the riots that led to the 17 deaths were unrelated to Newsweek. Then came the piece de resistance of Nixon mimicry: a Pentagon report certifying desecrations of the Koran by American guards was released two weeks after the Newsweek imbroglio, at 7:15 p.m. on a Friday, to assure it would miss the evening newscasts and be buried in the Memorial Day weekend's little-read papers.
 At other times the new Colsons top the old one. Though Nixon aspired to punish public broadcasting by cutting its funding, he never imagined that his apparatchiks could seize the top executive positions at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Nor did he come up with the brilliant ideas of putting journalists covertly on the administration payroll and of hiring an outside P.R. firm (Ketchum) to codify an enemies list by ranking news organizations and individual reporters on the basis of how favorably they cover a specific administration policy (No Child Left Behind). President Bush has even succeeded in emasculating the post-Watergate reform that was supposed to help curb Nixonian secrecy, the Presidential Records Act of 1978.
 THE journalists who do note the resonances of now with then rarely get to connect those dots on the news media's center stage of television. You are more likely to hear instead of how Watergate inspired too much ''gotcha'' journalism. That's a rather absurd premise given that no ''gotcha'' journalist got the goods on the biggest story of our time: the false intimations of incipient mushroom clouds peddled by American officials to sell a war that now threatens to match the unpopularity and marathon length of Vietnam. 
 Only once during the Deep Throat rollout did I see a palpable, if perhaps unconscious, effort to link the White House of 1972 with that of 2005. It occurred at the start, when ABC News, with the first comprehensive report on Vanity Fair's scoop, interrupted President Bush's post-Memorial Day Rose Garden news conference to break the story. Suddenly the image of the current president blathering on about how hunky-dory everything is in Iraq was usurped by repeated showings of the scene in which the newly resigned Nixon walked across the adjacent White House lawn to the helicopter that would carry him into exile. 
 But in the days that followed, Nixon and his history and the long shadows they cast largely vanished from the TV screen. In their place were constant nostalgic replays of young Redford and flinty Holbrook. Follow the bait-and-switch.

HEADLINE: The Russia House, After the Oligarchs

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and STEVEN LEE MYERS; Timothy L. O'Brien reported from New York for this article and Steven Lee Myers from Moscow.

 BODY:
EVEN in the end, Mikhail Khodorkovsky remained defiant. After being handed a nine-year prison sentence two weeks ago for tax evasion and fraud, Mr. Khodorkovsky, the former oil tycoon, vowed to appeal the verdict in Moscow. Brazenly jousting with his accusers, he also played to the Western sympathies he had spent so much time and money cultivating.
 ''Despite the obvious lack of evidence for my guilt, and numerous witnesses having testified that I was not involved in committing any crime, the court has decided to send me to prison,'' he said in a statement. ''I am aware that my verdict was decided in the Kremlin.''
 A shrewd billionaire who once reigned as Russia's richest man and controlled an oil empire built on the back of illicit billion-dollar deals and strong-arm tactics, Mr. Khodorkovsky also strained to invoke a Russian tradition of a moral cleansing through hardship. 
 ''Even if I'm to spend years in prison, I still feel a great sense of relief,'' he said. ''My fate now holds nothing extraneous, nothing inadvertent, no stains. The future looks bright to me, and the air of tomorrow's Russia seems pure.''
 Mr. Khodorkovsky began his career as an ax-wielding railroad payroll guard. He eventually snared lucrative state holdings in rigged privatizations and built a Western-style conglomerate before government agents arrested him in late 2003 aboard his private jet. And now he has assumed the role of a political martyr whose authenticity is likely to be forged in a penal camp. 
 But wherever his unusual journey ends, the economic cast of tomorrow's Russia has been shaped by his demise and that of his company, Yukos Oil. 
 ''The central take-away from the Khodorkovsky affair is that the Russian state is taking control of the commanding heights of the Russian economy,'' said Clifford Kupchan, a research director at the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm in Washington that specializes in geopolitical and economic analysis. ''After the tumultuous years of the Yeltsin regime where hundreds of thousands of average Russians got ripped off, it's an expected political and economic outcome. That doesn't mean, however, that it's good for the economy.''
 But predicting the path of Russia's economy in the post-Khodorkovsky years is a cut above guesswork. Stephen F. Cohen, a Russian studies professor at New York University, likes to remind students of the Will Rogers maxim: ''Russia is a country that no matter what you say about it, it's true.''
 Clearly, the pell-mell and baldly inequitable land grabs that defined state privatizations of the Yeltsin era have ended under President Vladimir V. Putin. One reason analysts believe he halted them was widespread distaste among average Russians -- perhaps shared by Mr. Putin himself -- for wealthy oligarchs like Mr. Khodorkovsky. Another reason may have been the country's seesawing economic fortunes during the 1990's. 
 China, whose strong state successfully oversees free market initiatives, may have supplanted the United States as Russia's guiding economic light. And the Kremlin, as the downfalls of Yukos and Mr. Khodorkovsky illustrate, now defines Russia's energy sector as a state-controlled economic zone; foreigners and private companies seen as disloyal to the top need not apply.
 While Mr. Khodorkovsky's incarceration has been widely interpreted as Mr. Putin's crackdown on a potential political rival, some Kremlinologists have also speculated that the entire episode may have been prompted by Yukos's effort to sell part of itself to the oil giants Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco -- transactions the Kremlin may have deemed to be potential national security threats. 
 ''I don't think Khodorkovsky's arrest had anything to do with politics,'' Professor Cohen said. ''It was about who had control of Russia's natural resources.''
 Yet even with no-trespassing signs planted around Russia's oil fields, other sectors, particularly the country's booming automobile and consumer goods markets, welcome outside involvement. Coca-Cola recently bought one of Russia's largest juice makers, Multon of St. Petersburg, in a $500 million joint venture -- giving Coke a large stake in the Russian juice market. 
 ''Our belief in Russia stems from the large educated population, huge natural resources and rapidly developing economy,'' said Grant Winterton, a senior Coke executive in the region. ''It's one of our key growth markets for the company, and we are here for the long term.'' 
 OTHER foreign companies, including General Electric, Toyota and DaimlerChrysler, have also waded into Russia.
 ''We've come to the conclusion that Yukos is, more or less, a one-off for the Russian economy,'' said Blake Marshall, executive vice president of the U.S.-Russia Business Council, a trade group in Washington representing about 300 companies operating in Russia. ''We're not likely to see something of this scale and of this gravity again.''
 When Mr. Khodorkovsky was arrested, Mr. Putin remarked that the situation represented an ''isolated criminal matter,'' indicating that he did not plan to pursue other oligarchs in a similar way. Mr. Putin has essentially kept his word so far, though there have been signs that prosecutors may pursue lower-profile cases against other companies, especially in areas beyond Moscow. 
 ''Putin cares about foreign investors; he just doesn't care about them enough to allow one oligarch to use his ill-gotten gains to hijack the state for his own economic purposes,'' said William Browder, a veteran money manager in Moscow. ''The received wisdom and the conventional foreign view is that Putin is weak, politics are unstable and Russia could easily go the way of Georgia or Ukraine. But I don't think that's true.''
 Nonetheless, the dismantling of Yukos, ostensibly to right the wrongs of sweetheart deals arranged by moguls like Mr. Khodorkovsky, also suggests that insider manipulation, bureaucratic shenanigans and perhaps even graft remain alive and well in Russia. In fact, an entirely new oligarchy may be in the making.
 Rosneft, a state-owned oil giant, picked off Yukos's huge Siberian oil subsidiary through a shell company that initially won the unit in what analysts describe as a questionable auction nakedly orchestrated by the Kremlin. Rosneft's chairman is Igor I. Sechin, a senior Kremlin official and a high-ranking member of the siloviki, as those who once served in Russia's security and intelligence services are now known. 
 The siloviki represent one faction of the rugby scrum jockeying for influence inside the Kremlin. Another important faction is made up of liberal reformers who are trying to institute democratic changes, property rights, a reliable court system and enforceable contracts.
 Marshall Goldman, associate director of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard, said Mr. Sechin and the siloviki recently flexed their economic muscles after Mr. Putin announced that Gazprom, the state-owned natural-gas giant, would merge with Rosneft. Mr. Sechin scuttled the deal, Professor Goldman said, to preserve for himself the wealth and influence that Rosneft commands.
 ''What is fascinating is that Putin finds he is not the master of his own fate because he's a lame duck and because the siloviki have agendas of their own,'' Professor Goldman said. ''What I think you'll see are people like Sechin emerging as the new oligarchs and they are all going to make sure to fatten their pockets.''
 Professor Goldman recalled attending an invitation-only meeting of academics and economists in Moscow last year; Mr. Putin had convened it to advise the Kremlin on how best to remedy privatization abuses without disrupting the economy. Professor Goldman said a document was circulated listing oligarchs other than Mr. Khodorkovsky who would be chased by prosecutors, leading him to believe that Yukos's unraveling might not remain an isolated incident.
 Last weekend, Mr. Putin publicly criticized Anatole Chubais, head of Unified Energy Systems, for recent electricity blackouts in Moscow. Mr. Putin also chastised Mr. Chubais, accusing him of managerial lapses at the electricity provider and calling for an investigation into Unified Energy's tax payments -- the same kind of inquiry that ultimately ensnared Mr. Khodorkovsky. Mr. Chubais is a faded luminary of the Yeltsin years and a widely disliked architect of some privatizations. If the Russian rumor mill is to be believed, the Kremlin has Mr. Chubais in its cross hairs. 
 Perhaps not coincidentally, Mr. Chubais, who recently survived an assassination attempt on a highway outside Moscow, heaped praised on Mr. Putin and his leadership in an interview published on Friday in Moskovskiye Novosti, a newspaper. 
 Still, as is the case with most things Russian, not everyone agrees with this analysis of the current state of affairs -- that is, an ascendant siloviki, a weakened president and Yeltsin-era oligarchs on the chopping block. Financiers say Rosneft's proposed merger with Gazprom was not unwound by the siloviki but by Yukos lawyers, who blocked the transaction in American courts.
 ''It's complete nonsense to say the siloviki are making economic policy -- their mandate is national security and it's the liberals who are making economic policy,'' Mr. Browder, the money manager, said. ''Putin is trying to balance these two groups and he remains the ultimate arbiter.''
 For as much as Mr. Putin's critics deride him as bad for the economy, there is a solid consensus that foreign investment in Russia has increased handsomely during his tenure, although accurate figures are hard to come by. 
 The flip side of this argument is that capital flight also appears to have soared recently, indicating a lack of confidence in Russia's prospects. Like foreign investment figures, however, capital flight data in Russia is notoriously unreliable.
 Mr. Putin boasted in a speech early last year that Russia remained on track to have its gross domestic product double between 2000 and 2010. That is an ambitious goal: it would mean that the economy of a country where about a quarter of the population remains mired in poverty would have to grow about 7 percent annually. 
 ''The aim of government, regional and local authorities should be for at least one in three of our citizens -- and not one in 10 as at present -- to acquire by 2010 an apartment that meets modern requirements,'' Mr. Putin said in his speech.
 Mr. Putin has met his economic targets for each of the last four years, but economic expansion has slowed during the first half of this year, largely because of a softening oil industry that, with or without Mr. Khodorkovsky, remains Russia's economic backbone.
 And, even behind bars, Mr. Khodorkovsky continues to loom large. Though the Kremlin has declawed him financially, he may remain a political factor.
 ''Russia, historically, whether through the state or the party, has been the sole grantor and guarantor of wealth and income,'' said Bernard Sucher, an investment banker living in Moscow. ''That all really has changed, but they're still struggling with who should have wealth, who should make wealth and how well wealth should be distributed. 
 ''The story is by no means over, either in the specifics of Khodorkovsky, or the company, or the battle between politics and business in Russia,'' he added.
 THE day after his prison sentence was handed down, Mr. Khodorkovsky's supporters published the results of a poll conducted by a respected agency, the Levada Center, showing that 8.3 percent of Russians surveyed were prepared to vote for him as president. While hardly a huge endorsement, it indicated that, at least in theory, the fallen oligarch would fare as well or better than other politicians -- except, of course, Mr. Putin.
 A week later, Nikita Belikh, the newly elected leader of Russia's principal liberal, pro-market party, the Union of Right Forces, raised the idea that Mr. Khodorkovsky could top the party's electoral list in the 2007 parliamentary elections. But that is a distant prospect at best, considering that he would not be eligible for parole until after the 2008 election of Mr. Putin's successor. 
 Still, it underscores the partial transformation that Mr. Khodorkovsky has undergone in some quarters -- from a despised oligarch who amassed a vast fortune with questionable tactics to a voice of political opposition. Stanislav A. Belkovsky, the president of the National Security Institute, a Moscow political consultancy, declared him ''a tragic prisoner of conscience.''
 Even within the Kremlin, some cracks have emerged. Andrei N. Illarionov, Mr. Putin's outspoken economic adviser, derided the prosecutors as incompetent. ''I personally felt and still feel very ashamed of the state that has to represent itself in such a way,'' he said at a news conference after the verdict. 
 He also called the Yukos affair ''the biggest economic and political event in the country'' since the collapse of the Soviet Union. That may overstate things a bit, but his comment served the purpose of elevating Mr. Khodorkovsky's stature.
 Mr. Khodorkovsky's reputation was so low that all it could do, perhaps, was rise. ''Khodorkovsky was not someone you wanted your daughter going out with,'' said Eric Kraus, an analyst at Sovlink Securities in Moscow. ''Making martyrs and heroes of these people is rather silly.''
 But whatever Mr. Khodorkovsky's past and whatever he may have done in the pursuit of his fortune, he chose not to flee the charges brought against him -- unlike Boris Berezovksy, Vladimir Gusinsky and several of his own business partners, who fled the country. Whatever the causes or motives behind that decision -- naivete, hubris or even a calculated campaign to transform himself and his reputation in his country's hard-bitten prisons -- he wound up trapped inside a courtroom cage.
 ''It is precisely those who wish me ill, the ones who have dreams at night of Khodorkovsky rabidly thirsting for vengeance, who are doomed to spend the rest of their lives trembling over the stolen assets of Yukos,'' he said in court. ''It is they who are profoundly unfree and will never be free. It is their pitiful existence that is the true prison.''
 Perhaps because of his defiance, he faces the possibility of further charges, which could add at least a decade to his current sentence. 
 ''Are you asking me who will be the next one?'' Russia's deputy prosecutor general, Vladimir I. Kolesnikov, told an interviewer last Sunday. ''Believe me, there are those to deal with today. We are stuffed with work.'' As for the leaders of Yukos, he added, ''They are all covered in blood.'' 
 Some analysts dismiss the notion that Mr. Khodorkovsky is a political threat. Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a leader of the Yabloko Party, which Mr. Khodorkovsky supported financially before his arrest, said his benefactor faced far greater challenges than building a political coalition.
 ''The only wish I have, with all my understanding of Russian prisons, is that he would be alive and free,'' Mr. Yavlinsky said in an interview.
 For his part, Mr. Khodorkovsky's final words in the courtroom offered fodder for supporters who see him as a Russian Rockefeller, as well as for detractors who believe he flagrantly stole every ruble he had. ''Let my fate serve as a lesson and an example,'' he said. ''Truth always wins out -- sooner or later.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Bubble

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan keeps saying that it's unclear why home mortgage rates have remained so low. After all, the Federal Reserve chairman has been doing all the things people in his position normally do to push rates up -- warning about ''bubbles'' in the housing market, assuring the business community that the economy is basically strong and tripling the Fed's overnight lending rate, to 3 percent. 
 Perhaps we can help solve the mystery. 
 Persistently low mortgage rates are symptomatic of an economy that is not doing as well as Mr. Greenspan suggests. Mortgage rates are linked to Treasury bond yields, which are unusually low. And depressed bond yields are generally the market's way of saying that the economic outlook is worrisome. 
 In his Congressional testimony last Thursday, Mr. Greenspan called that notion ''less persuasive'' than other explanations, but it looks pretty persuasive to us. By keeping rates so low for so long, the Fed not only helped to inflate housing prices, but also made it easy for homeowners to borrow against those inflated values. 
 The ability to get cheap loans against some, or even all, of one's home equity -- in addition to credit cards, auto loans and other forms of borrowing -- has increasingly replaced savings from income as the source of consumers' spending money. 
 At the same time, tax cuts have sent the federal budget deep into the red, setting the stage for slower growth. Already, the combination of paltry personal savings and government deficits has driven the national savings rate to near zero. 
 That means there is virtually no domestic pool of money from which to make investments and pay obligations, so business and government must borrow from abroad: an astounding sum approaching $1 trillion is projected for 2005 alone. That puts the economy at risk, in part, because lending by foreigners currently puts downward pressure on United States interest rates, further inflating the bubble. 
 The challenge now is how to deflate the housing bubble slowly without a dangerous collapse. It is hard to see how the Fed could raise its own rates enough to deflate the housing bubble without painfully squeezing heavily indebted Americans. And since bubbles are fun while they last, Congress and the administration are unlikely to change their profligate ways as long as the bubble is expanding. 
 That ''what, me worry?'' behavior increases the chances that the bubble's deflation, when it comes, will be severe, because a government already in hock cannot easily turn on the money spigot to ease a downturn. So it's hard to imagine how the housing bubble might deflate in a way that spared millions of Americans from serious financial distress. Still, a big step in the right direction would be for Congress to revert to disciplined budgeting in which tax cuts and spending increases are fully paid for, even if that means defying President Bush.
 Meanwhile, it is hard to take Mr. Greenspan's reassuring talk about the economy seriously when there's so much evidence to the contrary.

HEADLINE: The Rehnquist Court and Its Imperiled States' Rights Legacy

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WILL the Rehnquist Court's federalism revolution outlast the Rehnquist Court?
 If Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist retires this summer, as appears likely, the court's ruling last week that federal drug law trumps states on the use of medical marijuana will be its last word on federal-state relations during his tenure. 
 A hallmark of the Rehnquist Court has been a re-examination of the country's most basic constitutional arrangements, resulting in decisions that demanded a new respect for the sovereignty of the states and placed corresponding restrictions on the powers of Congress.
 But what had seemed until very recently to be a legacy in the making now appears evanescent, perhaps even illusory. Those who thought they were witnessing a revolution were last week using very different words. 
 ''The federalism boomlet has fizzled,'' said Michael S. Greve of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization here. Mr. Greve directs the group's federalism project, dedicated to ''rehabilitating a constitutional federalism.''
 The outcome of the marijuana case had been expected. The 2003 decision by a federal appeals court in San Francisco that Congress lacked constitutional authority over marijuana, grown for noncommercial purposes, that did not cross state lines had appeared ripe for overruling. A unanimous reversal in the case, Gonzales v. Raich, would have signified only that the combatants in the federalism wars were waiting for a more fruitful battleground. 
 But the decision was a hard-fought 6 to 3, with the chief justice in dissent along with two of his allies in the federalism cases, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas. Clearly, the justices had treated Gonzales v. Raich as a major federalism battleground, and just as clearly, the chief justice had lost.
 And where were the other two members of his usual 5-to-4 majority? Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined the majority opinion without explanation. Justice Antonin Scalia did explain himself, at length, in terms that gave little comfort to those who viewed the outcome with dismay. 
 ''A fair-weather federalist,'' was how Roger Pilon, director of the libertarian Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, described Justice Scalia. Asked for his response to the decision, Mr. Pilon exclaimed: ''A disaster.''
 The full measure of what was at stake, and what was lost, was provided by Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion. It was a cri de coeur from a justice whose commitment to the federalism agenda had led her five years ago to vote with the majority to strike down a central portion of the Violence Against Women Act, which authorized victims of crimes ''motivated by gender'' to sue their attackers in federal court. Intrastate activity that was not essentially economic was beyond Congress's reach under the Commerce Clause, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the 5-to-4 majority in United States v. Morrison.
 The marijuana decision, Justice O'Connor said in her dissent, was ''irreconcilable'' with the Violence Against Women Act ruling and with United States v. Lopez, a 1995 case that overturned a federal law prohibiting the possession of guns near schools. The Lopez case ''makes clear that possession is not itself commercial activity,'' Justice O'Connor said, and for the court to now deem the possession of marijuana within Congress's authority ''threatens to sweep all of productive human activity into federal regulatory reach.''
 It was a complaint the majority barely deigned to answer. ''We need not determine,'' Justice John Paul Stevens said in the majority opinion, whether the cultivation and use of marijuana for medical purposes, ''taken in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce in fact, but only whether a 'rational basis' exists for so concluding.'' Clearly it did, he said, adding: ''That the regulation ensnares some purely intrastate activity is of no moment.''
 For the 85-year-old Justice Stevens, a vigorous dissenter from the Rehnquist federalism decisions, it was a moment to savor -- and not the only recent one. In some of the most important cases of the past three terms, on affirmative action, gay rights, the juvenile death penalty and a federalism decision a year ago that rejected state immunity under the Americans With Disabilities Act for inaccessible courthouses, he has managed to pull together and hold a majority.
 ''Stevens is at the peak of his effectiveness,'' Professor Thomas W. Merrill of Columbia Law School, a former deputy solicitor general and close observer of the federalism cases, said last week. ''It is a remarkable achievement.''
 Was the federalism revolution ever real and, if so, what happened to it?
 It was a revolution, but a flawed one, in Professor Merrill's view, ''a revolution of convenience'' rather than deep conviction on the part of all five. ''They wanted to make a difference, to leave a legacy. It was something that all five could rationalize themselves into going along with. But once things started to get on difficult territory, it started to fall apart.''
 In a law review article he published two years ago, entitled ''The Making of the Second Rehnquist Court,'' Professor Merrill proposed that among the five, Justice Scalia's commitment to Rehnquist-style federalism was the weakest, the product of a strategic choice by the justice to ally himself with the four others for the sake of being on a winning team after concluding that he was unlikely to make headway with his agenda on abortion, religion, and other social issues.
 Professor Mark V. Tushnet of Georgetown University Law Center, the author of a new book, ''A Court Divided: The Rehnquist Court and the Future of Constitutional Law,'' said that the earlier decisions had ''brought the justices to a threshold that was far away when Rehnquist joined the court.'' And now, he said, ''they have to decide whether to stay where they are, or continue on, or retreat.'' 
 The marijuana case ''does not necessarily mean a retreat,'' he said. ''It was an easy case, a case at the heart of national regulatory authority.'' Professor Tushnet said a more telling case would be a challenge to the application of the Endangered Species Act to a species without commercial utility, found only within one state.
 Such a case is on the court's calendar, awaiting the justices' decision whether to hear it. The question in GDF Realty Investments v. Norton is whether Congress has authority to apply the Endangered Species Act to require protection of six species of cave-dwelling insects that live in caves west of Austin, Tex.
 Other cases awaiting action by the court question federal authority over homemade machine guns and over the possession of child pornography. In these two, federal appeals courts ruled against the government, citing the authority of the Supreme Court's Lopez and Morrison decisions. How much of that authority remains is now the question.
 ''The court was never clear about what it wanted to accomplish or how the revolution would play itself out when the first modest steps bumped up against entrenched political structures,'' said Mr. Greve of the American Enterprise Institute.
 Like Mr. Greve, other scholars have wondered whether the court was actually engaged with anything more than ''symbolic federalism'' that did not actually threaten federal policies that affected many people. 
 ''The court never reached a stable equilibrium, and now we are in a period of very robust national commitments, domestic as well as foreign.'' Ultimately he said, ''it is a revolution that has found no takers.''

HEADLINE: No Stadium? No Problem: The West Side Is Getting Hot

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Despite Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's bitter lament this week that the demise of his long-sought stadium project will delay development of the West Side, the neighborhood seems hotter than ever.
 Residential developers have already begun snapping up properties in the neighborhood. High-rise apartment towers are planned for several important intersections. Land prices there have more than doubled, a 1,500-room hotel is proposed for 11th Avenue, and even some commercial builders are making plans. 
 Mr. Bloomberg had argued for more than three years that building a high-profile 75,000-seat stadium for the Jets and the Olympics would spark the creation nearby of the kind of office towers and apartment houses that had long eluded the hardscrabble maritime neighborhood of tenements, factories and parking lots. Without the stadium, he said on Friday, it will be much harder to attract both tourists and developers to the area.
 ''The West Side, it wouldn't have needed any incentives for developers, and now it is going to need incentives for developers, and there's only so many incentives we can give,'' he said on his weekly radio program. ''I thought the stadium would be the catalyst. Short of that catalyst, we've got to find other catalysts -- maybe tax breaks or something like that, but we've got to plow ahead with that.''
 But developers, urban planners and members of the local community board say that growth along the Hudson is already starting to happen, fueled by the city's housing boom, relatively low interest rates and one of the mayor's most remarkable accomplishments: the rezoning of a 42-block, 310-acre area west of Eighth Avenue for large-scale development.
 ''It's ironic, because Bloomberg wants to be remembered for the Olympics,'' said Jules Demchick, president of the J.D. Carlyle Group, who is building a 478-unit apartment tower on 42nd Street, between 11th and 12th Avenues. ''But he accomplished the Hudson Yards rezoning. That's going to be memorable, because it's going to be a major, major area that will be developed.''
 And as much as he admires the mayor for that accomplishment, Mr. Demchick echoes the feelings of many developers in questioning the whole concept of the stadium.
 ''I never believed we were going to get the Olympics,'' Mr. Demchick said. ''I don't get building a stadium in Midtown. I don't know what it does for anybody.''
 But stadium or not, there is no question the West Side is on the verge of a transformation. Increased demand by builders of apartment houses has forced up land prices along Ninth and 10th Avenues from $90 per square foot of buildable space 18 months ago to more than $200 today.
 Steven C. Witkoff of the Witkoff Group is in the process of buying a large parcel across 11th Avenue from the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, between 36 and 37th Streets, where he wants to build a 1,500-room hotel on a platform over the Amtrak railroad tracks.
 The Rockrose Development Corporation, which has become the largest property owner in the district in recent years, is putting together three large development sites, including both sides of 10th Avenue between 37th and 38th Streets, for as many as 1,400 apartments. The company told community board officials it hoped to begin construction this fall.
 According to real estate executives, developers Douglas Durst and Gary Barnett are among the bidders for a site now owned by Verizon, on 11th Avenue, between 34th and 35th Streets, where zoning allows for a large commercial building with apartments in the tower.
 Brookfield Financial Properties owns a large development site on Ninth Avenue and 31st Street that is zoned for 2 million square feet of office space, plus apartments, and the company says the loss of the stadium project has not reduced the number of phone calls it is getting from housing developers.
 ''We're going ahead with the project,'' said John Zuccotti, Brookfield's chairman. ''We have interested developers who want to build the residential right now. They're still as anxious today as a week ago.''
 Already, 42nd Street west of Eighth Avenue has become a residential corridor of high rises, replacing tenements, army-navy stores, parking lots and a police horse barn. Gary Barnett of Extell Development, which is building the 60-story Orion condo tower at 42nd and Ninth, estimates that another 4,000 apartments will be built nearby.
 The boom has been helped along by plans to expand the Javits Center and transform the General Post Office near Madison Square Garden into an imposing rail station. But it is driven mostly by the insatiable desire for more housing in Manhattan.
 Commercial development is likely to come later. Although Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver helped kill the stadium largely out of fear the neighborhood would draw businesses away from downtown, developers say there is little demand for office towers. That could change, however, if the city extends the No. 7 subway line west from Times Square, which would make the area more accessible for workers.
 The prospects of building that extension remain unclear. The city had planned to pay for it using rising tax revenues from the commercial development, which could be years away. Mr. Silver may also try to work against the subway plan for the same reasons he vetoed the stadium.
 Hotel developers say they are also worried that there has been little movement on the Javits expansion in the six months since it was authorized by the state legislature.
 Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Javits Development Corp., acknowledged that he plans to bring in a new architect, engineer and construction manager for the project, but he said the expansion will move swiftly after that.
 In general, though, developers say they are upbeat about the area, no matter what gets built on the stadium site. H. Henry Elghanayan, a principal in Rockrose, the largest landowner in the area, said the administration is taking the wrong approach in lamenting the stadium.
 ''They're viewing this as a defeat,'' he said. ''They should look at where we are and what we have accomplished, with the zoning and a beautiful master plan. It can and should go forward.''

HEADLINE: In Connecticut, Quiet Corner Is Next to One With Big Plans

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: WOODSTOCK, Conn. 

 BODY:
First came the colonists on a mission to convert the Indians. Then came a brush with the American Revolution, followed by a couple of centuries of benign isolation and several decades of occasionally being confused with the site of a famous muddy concert festival in New York.
 But it was not until last fall, more than three centuries after it was settled by religious men from Massachusetts known as the Thirteen Goers, that this redoubt of dairy farms and distinctive architecture in northeast Connecticut arrived at a defining moment. 
 Town leaders, facing another wave of newcomers from Massachusetts and elsewhere -- this time known as long-distance commuters -- decided something had to be done, and fast.
 So they hired a town planner. 
 ''The first selectman told me my job is to save all the cows in Woodstock,'' said John P. Guszkowski, who came here from Hartford in December. 
 He added, with only half a laugh, ''It's kind of like the final frontier.''
 And now, amid economic upheaval, a surge in residential development and a sometimes surreal convergence of old ways and new, Woodstock and the rest of the eastern end of Connecticut, one of the nation's earliest settled areas, is a frontier in flux. 
 After decades of relative stability, the region's identity as a farming, manufacturing and military corridor is in peril and tiny old towns are confronting an unfamiliar phenomenon: change.
 ''Nobody seems to know how to stop it,'' said Christopher Collier, a former state historian.
 The two casinos in southeast Connecticut, Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods, both run by Indian tribes, are among the largest in the world. The casinos generate about 60,000 jobs, said Fred V. Carstensen, director of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis at the University of Connecticut. 
 This summer, Foxwoods plans to begin construction on a $700 million, two-million-square-foot expansion that will include a new hotel, restaurants, convention space and more gambling areas.
 Just south of the casinos, however, the Pentagon's proposal to close the Navy's submarine base in Groton, which has helped anchor the economy for more than a century, could threaten more than 31,000 jobs. Many are in high-end manufacturing work, state economists say. 
 Gov. M. Jodi Rell, along with the state's Congressional delegation and its legislature, the General Assembly, are campaigning to save the base. An independent federal commission will make a final recommendation to President Bush by Sept. 8.
 ''There really is a serious issue about the health of the manufacturing sector going forward,'' Mr. Carstensen said. 
 But directly across from Mohegan Sun on the banks of the Thames River in the farming town of Preston, developers have entered a memo of understanding with the town to build a $1.6 billion project that includes a theme park, movie studio, hotel and shopping area.
 The project would cover 470 acres, the site of a former state mental hospital, now a cluster of decaying brick buildings, broken windows and weeds. The new development is called Utopia.
 ''It's looking like it's going to happen,'' said Robert M. Congdon, Preston's first selectman, the town's top elected official. ''The sub base would be a huge loss, but this would fill some of that job void.''
 Further north, in Plainfield, another developer wants to build a $400 million, domed, 140,000-seat Nascar-ready racetrack on a vast parking lot next to where greyhounds used to race. The dog track closed two weeks ago to allow site testing for the new project.
 ''I'm a Nascar fan,'' said Donald F. Gladding, Plainfield's first selectman.
 As glossy entertainment options dominate talk of the future, one of the region's indigenous species is becoming scarce.
 ''They called us swamp Yankees all my life,'' Russell Robbins said.
 Mr. Robbins, 73, sat sipping from a can of beer in the back of his son's garage in East Putnam, about a mile from the Rhode Island line. The room smelled of the cows, pigs and deer that are slaughtered there.
 Outside, bloody bits of hide had been swept into a small pile. A cow walked by and pressed its nose against the window.
 ''We don't sell nothing,'' Mr. Robbins said, noting that state law forbids it and that they had been warned about that in the past. ''We just do it for our neighbors. We're apple-tree butchers.''
 Google returns no hits for ''apple-tree butcher.'' 
 The term, Mr. Robbins said, comes from the practice of suspending dead animals from trees to gut them. 
 And as for the swamp Yankee, their subset of the Connecticut Yankee, his son, also Russell, offered an explanation. During the Revolutionary War, he said, one story goes that local residents fled when word spread that the British were coming.
 ''They ran to the swamp,'' explained the younger Mr. Robbins, 49. ''And we've just been called that all our years.''
 Eastern Connecticut is set apart from the rest of the state by the wide and quiet Connecticut River. But the part facing so much uncertainty is at the eastern end, beyond the Hartford suburbs, in Windham and New London Counties. Covering the length of the state's border with Rhode Island, the two counties make up about a fourth of the state's area but have less than 400,000 of the state's 3.5 million people. And even between those counties there is a divide.
 To the south, New London County, once home to whaling ships, has small industrial cities like Norwich, New London and Groton. For decades, it has been defined by the naval base and submarine manufacturing, as well as by Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, which employs more than 6,000 people there, and now the casinos. 
 North of that is Windham County, in a rural area called the Quiet Corner and, by those who work to preserve it, the Last Green Valley. The shells of old textile mills still stand, along with remnants of a farming economy.
 The north and south are linked by Interstate 395, which runs from near New London north to Massachusetts. The road is crucial to the surge in development in the north, experts say.
 While New Yorkers have helped transform rural places in northwest Connecticut, like Kent and Cornwall, into escapes for the affluent, those towns are not as threatened by large-scale development because access is limited by small roads, said John J. Filchak, the executive director of the Northeastern Connecticut Council of Governments.
 Over there and in nearby parts of Massachusetts, Mr. Filchak said, land is often sold to wealthy individuals. ''It's a James Taylor song,'' he said. ''You've got the Berkshires and Stockbridge, Mass.''
 But to the east, he said: ''We have an interstate. We have a railroad. There's a different dynamic at work.''
 The interstate, which began as part of the Connecticut Turnpike in the 1950's and is still remarkably uncongested, is making the region attractive -- and, some say, vulnerable. Commercial real estate companies promote the road for its easy connections to Boston, Providence, R.I., and New York. Residential commuters, drawn by lower prices and a slower pace, can get to the outskirts of Boston from northeast Connecticut in less than an hour. They can get to Worcester, Mass., or Providence even more quickly.
 ''They found us,'' said Mr. Guszkowski, the Woodstock planner. 
 In 2004, Woodstock issued more than two and a half times the number of building permits it issued in 1994, according to statistics compiled by the state. Yet growth here might not strike outsiders as sprawl. Last year the town, with an area of more than 60 square miles, issued only 84 total residential building permits.
 It is not crowded.Students from Woodstock Academy, founded in 1801, jog on the streets and play Frisbee on the green across from Roseland Cottage, the ornate Gothic revival home of Henry Chandler Bowen, a 19th-century abolitionist. 
 Although the population in Woodstock soared by 20 percent from 1990 to 2000, the state estimated it in 2003 to be just 7,685. 
 In November the town enacted a moratorium to prevent farmers from selling their property to be subdivided into housing developments. The moratorium expires in August, when Mr. Guszkowski hopes new zoning rules will slow the pace of development.
 The goal, he said, ''is protecting the parts of Woodstock that most define it and connect it to its past, and allowing Woodstock to grow in a way that won't harm it.''
 Not all farmers are looking to sell.
 ''The easy way out would be to develop it,'' said Peter M. Orr, who bought his father-in-law's dairy farm nearby in Thompson several years ago. 
 Mr. Orr, a former research scientist, owns one of a small group of family-owned dairy farms in the area that plans to begin selling locally-produced milk later this year under the brand the Farmer's Cow. 
 A tight economy has driven some dairy farmers to sell their land. ''We have to be somewhat creative to still make it,'' he said. 
 While some feel the development pressure every day and seek their footing in a changing local economy, others may not detect the tension.
 Eddie Troiani, 67, takes the ferry from Long Island to New London and then takes a car or a shuttle bus to visit the Mohegan Sun casino. He stays overnight in the dark glass hotel tower that rises out of the trees like a giant jagged crystal.
 ''I'm on the 30th floor and the view is unbelievable,'' Mr. Troiani said one recent night, taking a break between bets in the Race Book Room, where he wagers on horse races shown on giant video monitors. ''It's gorgeous. It's all woods and you've got the river on one side. It's pretty awesome from that high up.''

HEADLINE: See the New Car in the Joneses' Driveway? You May Soon Be Driving One Just Like It

BYLINE: By David Leonhardt

 BODY:
EVEN as General Motors' executives were announcing 25,000 jobs cuts last week, they were doing a little advertising of their coming attractions. At G.M.'s annual meeting in Delaware, Robert Lutz, the company's vice chairman, vowed that a burst of on-the-edge new cars and trucks would come forth in the next three years. ''We are in the arts and entertainment business,'' Mr. Lutz said, ''and we're putting a huge emphasis on world-class design.''
 But among all the other hurdles Mr. Lutz and his colleagues face, including health care and pension costs and growing foreign competition, a less obvious one may be the biggest threat to their marketing plans: the unforgiving nature of consumer behavior. 
 However objective we imagine ourselves to be, most of us do not judge a product solely on its merits, weighing quality, value and style before making a decision. Instead, we are easily influenced by the people around us. And there is nothing wrong with this. It is probably a smarter way to make decisions than relying on only our own opinions.
 But it does make life hard for struggling companies. They thrash about in a feedback loop, where the collective wisdom about their problems can overwhelm the chances of any single new product. No matter how good it is, the 2006 Pontiac Solstice will not start as a blank slate. Car buyers will be thinking about it in the context of everything they and their friends know about G.M. vehicles. 
 Marketers have long understood that groups of friends and relatives tend to buy the same products, but understanding the reasons has been tricky. Is it because they are so similar in how much money they make and what television ads they watch that they independently arrive at the same decision? Or do they copy one another, perhaps out of envy or perhaps because they have shared information about the products? 
 Three economists recently found a novel way to answer the question across the Atlantic, in Finland. Like the United States, it is a wealthy country with a largely open economy, where people can buy any of dozens of car models or shoe brands. But Finland also keeps amazingly detailed records of everything from a household's vehicle purchases to the age, sex and income of people living in the house to the amount they spend each year on commuting.
 To understand the researchers' method, imagine three households with nearly the same demographic profile, two that live on the same street and one that lives across town. If the neighbors are more likely to own the same car than is the faraway family, there is strong evidence of neighborly influence. In fact, the evidence was overwhelming. When one of a person's 10 nearest neighbors bought a car, the odds that that person would buy a car of the same brand during the next week and a half jumped 86 percent. 
 The researchers, an American and two Finns, argued that it was not just a matter of envy. Used cars, strangely, seemed to affect neighbors even more than new cars. Low-income families and those who lived in rural areas -- not the typical conspicuous consumers -- were more likely to be influenced by their neighbors than were wealthy Helsinki residents. 
 All this seemed to suggest that people do not covet thy neighbor's car so much as they ask their neighbor about his car. Since used cars are less reliable, an endorsement of one might carry more weight. The same could be true of the inexpensive cars bought by poorer families. Low-income and rural households also have less access to car magazines and the Internet, so they might ask friends for advice more often. 
 ''The 'keeping up with the Joneses' effect doesn't really seem to be driving this,'' said Mark Grinblatt of the University of California, Los Angeles, who did the research with Matti Keloharju and Seppo Ikaheimo, both of the Helsinki School of Economics. 
 There is little reason to think the same dynamic is not at work in this country. One survey shows that as people get closer to buying a car, they switch from paying attention to television and magazine ads to newspaper ads and the Internet, where the information is more specific. But the opinions of their friends and colleagues remain a crucial influence at every stage. 
 ''This is research that has been verified again and again,'' said Christine A. MacKenzie, vice president for corporate research and planning at DaimlerChrysler. ''People like to get a third-party, unbiased opinion.'' 
 My grandfather, for example, grew up adoring American cars. He and his brother spent much of the summer of 1938 dismantling and rebuilding the engine on a 1932 Chevrolet Roadster they owned. By the 1970's, though, he was getting fed up with what he saw as their deteriorating quality. When a window on his Chrysler would no longer roll up properly, he called it a symbol and vowed never to buy another one. He has not.
 Fair or not, most members of my family would probably need to hear a few years of good news about American cars before we could forget about that crooked window. Millions of other people apparently have similar feelings. The reputations of G.M. and Ford have fallen so far that one-third of their sales go to employees, the friends or relatives of employees, or rental-car companies, all at almost no profit.
 This would also help explain why car buying habits vary so much across the country. The best-selling vehicle in the Orlando area, the Toyota Corolla, ranks only 10th in the Dallas area, according to AutoCountUSA, a research company. The Chevrolet Suburban is the 62nd-best-selling vehicle in Orlando, but comes in at No. 15 in Dallas. Those gaps are too big to be explained by the different transportation needs of Floridians and Texans.
 For G.M., however, there is one silver lining in all this. If a few of its cars can break through consumers' skepticism, entire neighborhoods might start going the company's way. It wasn't so many decades ago that the feedback loop worked in G.M.'s favor.

HEADLINE: One Nation, Uninsured

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Harry Truman tried to create a national health insurance system. Public opinion was initially on his side: Jill Quadagno's book ''One Nation, Uninsured'' tells us that in 1945, 75 percent of Americans favored national health insurance. If Truman had succeeded, universal coverage for everyone, not just the elderly, would today be an accepted part of the social contract. 
 But Truman failed. Special interests, especially the American Medical Association and Southern politicians who feared that national insurance would lead to racially integrated hospitals, triumphed. 
 Sixty years later, the patchwork system that evolved in the absence of national health insurance is unraveling. The cost of health care is exploding, the number of uninsured is growing, and corporations that still provide employee coverage are groaning under the strain. 
 So the time will soon be ripe for another try at universal coverage. Public opinion is already favorable: a 2003 Pew poll found that 72 percent of Americans favored government-guaranteed health insurance for all. 
 But special interests will, once again, stand in the way. And the big debate among would-be reformers is how to deal with those interests, especially the insurance companies. These companies played a secondary role in Truman's failure but have since become a seemingly invincible lobby.
 Let's ignore those who believe that private medical accounts -- basically tax shelters for the healthy and wealthy -- can solve our health care problems through the magic of the marketplace. The intellectually serious debate is between those who believe that the government should simply provide basic health insurance for everyone and those proposing a more complex, indirect approach that preserves a central role for private health insurance companies.
 A system in which the government provides universal health insurance is often referred to as ''single payer,'' but I like Ted Kennedy's slogan ''Medicare for all.'' It reminds voters that America already has a highly successful, popular single-payer program, albeit only for the elderly. It shows that we're talking about government insurance, not government-provided health care. And it makes it clear that like Medicare (but unlike Canada's system), a U.S. national health insurance system would allow individuals with the means and inclination to buy their own medical care.
 The great advantage of universal, government-provided health insurance is lower costs. Canada's government-run insurance system has much less bureaucracy and much lower administrative costs than our largely private system. Medicare has much lower administrative costs than private insurance. The reason is that single-payer systems don't devote large resources to screening out high-risk clients or charging them higher fees. The savings from a single-payer system would probably exceed $200 billion a year, far more than the cost of covering all of those now uninsured.
 Nonetheless, most reform proposals out there -- even proposals from liberal groups like the Century Foundation and the Center for American Progress -- reject a simple single-payer approach. Instead, they call for some combination of mandates and subsidies to help everyone buy insurance from private insurers.
 Some people, not all of them right-wingers, fear that a single-payer system would hurt innovation. But the main reason these proposals give private insurers a big role is the belief that the insurers must be appeased.
 That belief is rooted in recent history. Bill Clinton's health care plan failed in large part because of a dishonest but devastating lobbying and advertising campaign financed by the health insurance industry -- remember Harry and Louise? And the lesson many people took from that defeat is that any future health care proposal must buy off the insurance lobby.
 But I think that's the wrong lesson. The Clinton plan actually preserved a big role for private insurers; the industry attacked it all the same. And the plan's complexity, which was largely a result of attempts to placate interest groups, made it hard to sell to the public. So I would argue that good economics is also good politics: reformers will do best with a straightforward single-payer plan, which offers maximum savings and, unlike the Clinton plan, can easily be explained.
 We need to do this one right. If reform fails again, we'll be on the way to a radically unequal society, in which all but the most affluent Americans face the constant risk of financial ruin and even premature death because they can't pay their medical bills.

HEADLINE: Beartooth, Buried

 BODY:
Mudslides usually make the news only when they take out a neighborhood of expensive hillside homes or bury a major route like the Pacific Coast Highway. But for anyone headed to Yellowstone this summer, the only mudslide that matters is the one that began on May 19, closing a long stretch of the Beartooth Highway -- U.S. 212 -- between Red Lodge, Mont., and the Wyoming state line.
 On a good map, the Beartooth looks like a schematic illustration of the small intestine. It is not the fast way from anywhere to anywhere else. It is not even the only way from anywhere to anywhere else. It is simply the most vertiginous way. 
 Most highways at least hint at an underlying economic purpose. They take you where the traffic wants to go, or at least where it used to want to go. But the Beartooth feels like a highway that was built just for the heck of building it. Whether you are driving west out of Red Lodge or east out of Cooke City, there comes a moment when you begin to wonder if the road will ever top out on Beartooth Pass, elev. 10,947, or whether it will just keep climbing in switchbacks forever. And you wonder, too, just how it was ever possible to build such a road. Somehow it makes sense that it was constructed in the mid-1930's, when earth-moving equipment was a lot smaller than it is now. It's easier still to imagine the highway having been carved out of the granite by small men using dental drills.
 So far, everyone who has gone up the Beartooth Highway seems to have made it down, though no one knows how many have sworn not to make the trip again. At some points -- the stunning drop into Rock Creek Canyon is one -- a fear of heights is the only rational response. The Montana Highway Department is pledging to have repairs done by mid-October. In other words, it hopes to reopen the highway just in time to close it for winter.

HEADLINE: Five Unions To Create A Coalition On Growth

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Five labor unions that are highly critical of John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., are planning to announce this week that they are forming a coalition aimed at unionizing large numbers of workers, several union officials said yesterday.
 Labor leaders said they were planning this move because they want to form an aggressively pro-growth coalition and because they believe the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is doing too little to organize nonunion workers.
 This new coalition will be formed by the Service Employees International Union, the Teamsters, the laborers, the food and commercial workers and Unite Here, which represents hotel, restaurant and apparel workers, two union officials said. These officials insisted on anonymity because they feared some union leaders would be angry at them for disclosing the plan before it is announced Wednesday, after union leaders meet in Washington. 
 The five unions represent more than one-third of the membership of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., an umbrella federation of 57 unions and 13 million workers. 
 The union officials said the new coalition -- tentatively called the Change to Win Coalition -- would not compete with the federation. Rather, they say, it will complement the federation to give new energy and excitement to the flagging labor movement. Just one in 13 workers in the private sector is in a union, down from one in three a half-century ago.
 But federation officials said yesterday that they feared that this new coalition would be competition and create an unnecessary distraction. One official questioned how effective the coalition would be in unionizing workers, considering that four of the five unions, except for the service employees, have been losing members.
 The service employees' union, with more than 1.7 million members, is spearheading efforts to form this coalition at the same time that it is threatening to secede from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. At a meeting in San Francisco on Saturday, the service employees' executive board voted to give its top leadership authority to quit the main federation, if necessary.
 ''The union movement must focus on uniting with us the 9 out of 10 workers who have no union,'' the union's board said in a statement. ''Without doing so, we not only cannot build a broad movement for social and economic justice, but we can't even win consistently at the bargaining table or in the legislative arena for the small minority of workers who still have a union.''
 Andrew L. Stern, the service employees' president, has said repeatedly in recent months that unless the main federation becomes far more aggressive about organizing nonunion workers, his union would pull out and seek to ''build something stronger.'' Mr. Stern has also warned that his union would secede if Mr. Sweeney wins a new four-year term.
 Mr. Sweeney, who has headed the labor federation for nearly a decade, said he had enough support to assure re-election at its convention in Chicago in late July.
 Responding to the five unions' plan to create a new coalition, Mr. Sweeney said yesterday: ''We all have the same goals, and we need to commit to work together to resolve the differences because if ever there was a time for the union movement to be united, this is it -- with working people under the biggest assault in 80 years. Disunity just plays into the hands of the worst enemies of workers.'' 
 Mr. Stern has said that he hopes any new pro-growth union coalition will someday include the International Brotherhood of Carpenters, which quit the federation in 2001.
 Union officials backing the new coalition say it will engage in multi-union organizing drives -- something rarely done -- seeking to unionize tens of thousands of workers at various major companies. 
 In recent weeks, several officials from the Teamsters, the food and commercial workers and Unite Here have hinted that their unions might also secede from the federation. But some of Mr. Sweeney's supporters say those threats are largely designed to increase pressure on him not to run for re-election.

HEADLINE: As Stern Warns of Lockout, Union Stands Its Ground

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, June 12 

 BODY:
N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern warned the players union that the league would pull its current offers off the table if a labor agreement could not be reached by the July 1 deadline. 
 Speaking before Game 2 of the finals Sunday, Stern said the league's owners had already made concessions. He blamed the union for not agreeing to year-round drug testing, a player age limit of 19 years old, six-year maximum contracts and a guarantee of 57 percent of revenue to the players.
 ''If we don't have a deal by July 1, we won't make a deal anytime soon after,'' Stern said. ''If July 1 comes and there's a lockout, the union will have made a mistake of epic proportions that I don't think the average member of the rank and file understands.'' 
 No meetings between the parties are scheduled, and Stern said he was waiting for the players to conclude their meetings, which are taking place this week in Chicago and New York, and approach the league.
 Stern criticized what he called the union's rhetoric, and he expressed bewilderment that the negotiations had taken this turn. He said he was optimistic now, but ''post-July 1, I am so pessimistic that I find it to be incredible that the players, when they finish their meetings, the players themselves who are averaging $4.4 million, won't say let's just go someplace and get a deal done.''
 Billy Hunter, the executive director of the union, said by phone from Chicago, where he was meeting with players: ''We're not afraid of a lockout, but we understand, it would be foolish if we can't make a deal. We're going to try to make a deal.''
 Hunter said Stern was not giving a full picture of where negotiations had broken down. He said of the drug-testing issue: ''I think it's grandstanding. I think David wants to be out in front of this issue. The reality is we will agree to random testing, but I've got to balance that with privacy issues.''
 Stern said the owners had ceded ground by asking for an age limit of 19, down from 20. He said the union suggested amending the age limit so that the top four picks are not subject to it. Hunter said, ''I think that's the commissioner's issue; I don't believe that it's the owners.'' 
 Hunter said one league proposal was to have three rounds of the draft to expand its minor league, the National Basketball Development League. He said the N.B.A. was also trying to reduce guaranteed contracts for rookies to two years from three. It seemed clear that the sides were entering a heated time of posturing. 
 ''Time has just about run out to get a deal before July 1,'' said the league deputy commissioner, Russ Granik. ''It's not impossible.''
 Stern acknowledged that the N.B.A. would take a hit if it followed the path of the N.H.L., which canceled last season and still has not reached an agreement.
 ''We have seen the damage that a lockout can do across the board: fans, sponsors, licensing, network partners and the like,'' Stern said. ''Anyone who thinks or writes that that doesn't have enormous economic impact is wrong.''
 Stern said the league had recently changed its proposal on the length of contracts to six years (for players staying with the same team) and five years (for other free agents) from four and three years. Hunter said he was not aware that the league had made that offer. 
 Stern said: ''If we do have a lockout, this offer will not be on the table. That is why we are pushing so hard to get a deal done.'' 
 Stern rejected the notion that the league was trying to impose a hard cap. He said the operating costs after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, with increases for insurance and security, had increased, but that ''our current proposal ignores that.'' 
 Stern said the owners had made a concession by agreeing to allot 57 percent of revenue to the players. Hunter countered that over the past seven years of the current collective bargaining agreement, the average revenue given to players was closer to 60 percent. He said the union sought other concessions in exchange.
 Stern said: ''I'm trying to find a way to make sense of it because from the owners' perspective, we've moved a lot. If that's not reciprocated, then we are going to have a real problem.''

HEADLINE: Dr. Dean Speaks, For Better or Worse

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Howard Dean is right on target in criticizing the Republicans. Who needs a bunch of Casper Milquetoasts cowering in the corner of Congress when the United States is being dismantled economically, morally and institutionally? 
 As a contributing member of the Democratic Party, I want to see some backbone in Congress. If the Democrats hope to succeed, they had better find their voice. If their fund-raising falls short, don't blame Howard Dean.

HEADLINE: Pro-Trade Democrats Go AWOL

 BODY:
Back in 1993, Vice President Al Gore went on prime-time television to debate Ross Perot, a foe of free trade, in a clash Mr. Gore is widely believed to have won. The debate helped propel supporters of the North American Free Trade Agreement to victory in a 234-to-200 cliffhanger in the House. Some 102 Democrats -- representing the party traditionally more skeptical of liberalized trade -- voted for the pact. Afterward, President Bill Clinton called Nafta a defining moment for America. He said the country had decided not to retreat in a world where ''change is the only constant.'' Then he thanked lawmakers, particularly his fellow Democrats, for ''voting their consciences.'' 
 Where are those Democrats now? Fast forward 12 years, and Mr. Clinton's wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, has yet to decide whether she's going to support the Central American Free Trade Agreement, or Cafta, which would open up trade, valued at $32 billion, between the United States and El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. Only four Democrats have announced their support, while the list of Democrats against grows ever longer. Last month the influential, centrist New Democrat Coalition of House lawmakers, usually pro-trade, came out against the deal.
 The centrist Democrats argue that the Bush administration's irresponsible fiscal policies have robbed the nation of the ability to invest in programs that would cushion the blow for workers whose jobs migrate. It's true that America should be much more aggressive and creative on that front. But globalization isn't going away whether Cafta gets approved or not. Free-trade Democrats should be using their leverage to get more support for retraining assistance to displaced workers, not simply posturing with blanket opposition.
 The Democrats also argue that the trade agreement's labor provisions don't go far enough to protect workers in the six other countries. But they are ignoring a provision that improves on existing rules by taking fines collected for violations of labor laws and using them to correct labor infractions. That's far better than the current system, in which penalties collected for labor violations end up in the United States Treasury.
 The crux of the opposition seems to come from a general feeling of peevishness that the Bush administration didn't consult more with the pro-trade Democrats while negotiating the agreement. When you add that to the general anger over the Bush administration's failure to really negotiate with Democrats over issues from prescription drugs to education reform, it's understandable that they feel burned. But that doesn't make it right for them to take their marbles and go home. The Central American people deserve better. 
 Cafta would lower tariffs and help job growth in a needy region. It would encourage growth in the region's textile and apparel industries, a huge helping hand at a time when China is sucking up textile manufacturing jobs. The American Farm Bureau Federation estimates that Cafta would increase United States agricultural exports by $1.5 billion a year. The National Association of Manufacturers says the trade agreement would add $1 billion a year to United States exports of manufactured goods. And a study by the United States International Trade Commission estimates that Cafta, when fully implemented, would cut the trade deficit by $756 million.
 ''This issue is much too important to allow your unhappiness with when somebody called you and when you were consulted stop you from doing what you know is right,'' says Cal Dooley, the former California Democratic congressman. He's right.

HEADLINE: As Iraqi Army Trains, Word in the Field Is It May Take Years

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE and JOHN F. BURNS; Sabrina Tavernise reported from Mahmudiya for this article, and John F. Burns from Baghdad. Layla Isitfan contributed reporting from Baghdad.

DATELINE: MAHMUDIYA, Iraq 

 BODY:
A small but telling test of Iraq's fledgling army came recently in this troubled farm town south of Baghdad, when a group of Iraqi soldiers, ending a house raid and rushing to board pickups they use as troop carriers, abandoned the blindfolded, handcuffed man they had come to arrest.
 ''They left the detainee,'' an astonished American soldier said, spotting the man squatting in the dust along a residential street. ''They just left him there. Sweet.''
 The Iraqi troops were on their seventh house raid of the morning, part of a cordon-and-search operation in an area of towns and farmland so dangerous that American soldiers call it the Triangle of Death. Prompted by the soldier, the Iraqis ran back for the detainee, and managed much of the rest of their mission effectively, rounding up 13 insurgent suspects in three hours without having to call for direct involvement of the watching American troops. 
 Such limited successes stand against a backdrop of American disappointment with many of the Iraqi units, whose effectiveness is crucial to a future American troop withdrawal. 
 Despite the Bush administration's insistent optimism, Americans working with the Iraqis in the field believe that it could be several years, at least, before the new Iraqi forces will be ready to stand alone against the insurgents.
 A few days before the Mahmudiya raids, Iraqi soldiers at a local checkpoint apparently fell asleep in the hours before dawn, and the checkpoint was ambushed by insurgents. They tossed a grenade into the building, then stormed in and executed those left alive, killing at least eight Iraqis, American soldiers said. Since the attack, American troops have been conducting nighttime patrols to make sure the Iraqis stay awake.
 The American command has already created military transition teams of soldiers to work with Iraqi troops, and there are plans for up to 10,000 Americans to be attached to Iraqi units at every level from divisions down to battalions and companies, with up to 10 men at the battalion level, and 2 with each company.
 ''I just wish they'd start to pull their own weight without us having to come out and baby-sit them all the time,'' said Sgt. Joshua Lower, a scout in the Third Brigade of the First Armored Division who has worked with the Iraqis. ''Some Iraqi special forces really know what they are doing, but there are some units that scatter like cockroaches with the lights on when there's an attack.'' 
 The Iraqi troops' story is one of light and dark, American officers say. Especially in regions sympathetic to the insurgents, they have performed woefully, with Sunni Arab soldiers making little secret of their support for Saddam Hussein and their contempt for the Americans.
 Among Shiite and Kurdish soldiers, the overwhelming majority in the new army, the Americans say, there are problems beyond loyalty -- those inherent in building a new army, at breakneck speed, in the midst of a brutal war.
 ''We are realists,'' said Lt. Col. Frederick P. Wellman, a former Black Hawk helicopter pilot and West Point graduate who is a spokesman for Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, the American who heads the coalition training command in Baghdad. ''Are the Iraqis doing everything perfectly? No, they are not. But they're in the fight, and they're taking more casualties than we are. 
 ''Increasingly, it is the Iraqis who are bearing the burden of this war, even more than Americans.'' 
 The Mahmudiya raids were one measure of where things stand. 
 After taking office on May 3, Iraq's Shiite majority government, finding its way after centuries of Sunni Arab rule in Baghdad, was confronted by a new insurgent offensive. 
 It ordered a crackdown across the Baghdad region, deploying thousands of Iraqi troops. Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari called it the largest Iraqi-led military operation yet, making it a highly visible test of the American exit strategy. 
 But the Baghdad sweeps have underscored the raft of problems the American command has identified in the Iraqi force buildup, including hasty recruiting, insufficient training and a weak command structure, leading to breakdowns in discipline, especially in combat.
 Earlier this year, the Pentagon suggested that an initial drawdown of the 140,000 American troops in Iraq might begin by the end of this year. Now, American generals are saying it could be two years, perhaps longer.

Few Battalions Are Operational
 At three main training centers established at former Hussein-era bases -- Taji, north of Baghdad; Kirkush, near the Iranian border; and Numaniya, southeast of Baghdad -- a $5.7 billion American-financed program to train and equip the new forces is in high gear, graduating soldiers in battalion-size classes of 1,500 troops. 
 From a single American-trained Iraqi battalion a year ago, the American command says there are now 107 battalions of Iraqi troops and paramilitary police units, totaling 169,000 men. The total is set to rise to 270,000 by next summer, when 10 fully equipped 14,000-man Iraqi Army divisions are scheduled to be operational. 
 But figures alone tell only part of the story, since only three battalions are rated fully operational by the Americans, and many others are far behind in terms of manpower, training and equipment. 
 General Petraeus, 52, commanded the 101st Airborne Division during the 2003 invasion, then was tapped to lead the rebuilding of the Iraqi forces last spring. By then, it was clear that disbanding the old army -- a decision made early in the American occupation, when the emphasis was on rebuilding Iraqi institutions from scratch -- had been a blunder, and that the few Iraqi units assembled and trained in the first year of the American presence here were crumbling under widespread desertion, and, in one case, at Taji last April, of mutiny when ordered into battle at Falluja.
 General Petraeus's international training team is 1,100-strong, and new recruits graduate quickly: three weeks' training for veterans of the old army, eight weeks for newcomers. But the training is rigorous, similar to an American boot camp, and better, Iraqi officers say, than anything under Mr. Hussein, when a trainee infantryman was allowed a maximum of three bullets a month on the firing range. 
 Morale at the camps seems high. At the end of one recent eight-week course at Kirkush, graduates marched close-ordered in the 110-degree noontime heat, shouting ''Iraq! Iraq! Iraq!'' and ''Army! Army! Army!'' In the old days Iraqi soldiers, in the same cadence, shouted ''Saddam! Saddam! Saddam!'' and ''Baath! Baath! Baath!''
 Many new soldiers, and most officers, are veterans of the Hussein-era army, and American officers believe they could become a formidable force. As an example, the Americans cite the 1,000 men serving in Iraqi special forces units -- some of them veterans of elite commando units under Mr. Hussein -- who have trained at a heavily guarded base outside Baghdad that reporters visit only on condition they not disclose its location. The Iraqis are equipped much like the American Army's elite Delta Force -- with lightweight rip-proof camouflage uniforms, black balaclavas, Humvees and American weapons like M-4 rifles.
 The Iraqis have been deployed, in units stiffened by Americans, in some of the war's toughest operations, like the offensive that recaptured Falluja in November and assaults in other cities, like Mosul and Najaf, where insurgents have threatened to take control. Last month, General Petraeus, flanked by visiting generals from the American Special Forces, glowed as he watched in a hangar at the special forces' base as the Iraqis stormed a mock enemy-held house and simulated a room-by-room raid with live ammunition and stun grenades.
 ''You have been to virtually every part of Iraq where there are insurgents, and you have done great service to your country,'' he told rows of tough-looking men lined up for a medals ceremony. As the men stepped forward, American officers ticked off their achievements: more than 700 combat missions, 500 insurgents killed, 1,400 captured. ''You are the best of the best,'' the general said. He concluded in Arabic: ''Shukran jazilan'' -- ''Many thanks.'' 
 At Camp Phoenix, General Petraeus's headquarters inside the Green Zone, the American nerve-center in Baghdad, American officers answer doubts about the buildup by pointing to a steady flow of new recruits, despite relentless insurgent targeting of recruiting centers and convoys moving to and from training centers. By unofficial count, more than 1,000 recruits or trainees have been killed in suicide bombings and ambushes since the revised training program began last year. But American officers, with statistics for virtually every other aspect of the program, say they have none on the numbers of Iraqis killed in such attacks. 
 In any case, the Americans say the response to calls for new recruits has exceeded requirements: 7,000 men, they say, turned up outside the Numaniya base one winter morning in response to false rumors of a fresh call. But with Iraq's unemployment rate at 30 percent or more, and as much as 60 percent among the poorest classes, a regular pay packet is a powerful incentive, army trainees and others say. A common soldier's base pay can be up to $340 a month, rising to $950 for generals. 
 Many doctors at Baghdad's best hospitals earn $500 a month or less, and many other Iraqis survive on $200 or less a month.
 Briefings at Camp Phoenix focus on the numbers. In a briefing at the end of April, American officers ticked off the catalog of equipment delivered to the Iraqis under General Petraeus's command: 9,000 vehicles, 140,000 flak jackets, 480,000 uniforms and 270 million rounds of ammunition. They also said 24,000 Iraqis were employed on $1.9 billion worth of American-financed construction projects, from building bases, barracks and command centers to constructing 240 border forts as part of the effort to stem insurgent infiltration, especially from Syria.
 But at the highest levels of the American command, and at the Pentagon, there has been growing unease about the reliance on meeting statistical targets without, many officers say, a corresponding emphasis on the quality of the troops moving into the field, on the command abilities of their officers and on the communications networks that will let Iraqi units coordinate their operations and communicate with other units. 
 One of the Americans who has made his frustrations known is Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the top American commander in Iraq, who has pushed for greater efforts to build up the command abilities of the new forces, at every level from company commanders to generals. 
 On some occasions, American officers say, General Casey, normally affable, has barked his exasperation over the issue, saying that having new divisions of Iraqi troops means little unless the troops ''are connected to something,'' meaning an effective command-and-control network.
 With many senior officers from Mr. Hussein's era excluded because of links to past atrocities, relatively few of the new commanders have experience of high command. Men who were majors under Mr. Hussein have been promoted to generals, and some former generals who have been brought back were once assigned to war colleges or logistics tasks. 
 ''If they could, Iraqi generals would spend their time deciding on the location of every checkpoint in every city and town in the country,'' one American officer said.

Iraqis as First Line of Defense
 One of the toughest tests yet for Iraqi forces came on May 29, the first full day of the new government's crackdown across the Baghdad region.
 Striking first, insurgents attacked with a sequence of ambushes and suicide bombings across their strongholds in western Baghdad. At 3:45 p.m., they attacked one of the most heavily secured sites in the city, the Interior Ministry's Major Crimes Unit, often used to hold captured rebels.
 Three car bombs struck on roads near the detention center, followed by an attack by about 50 rebels using grenades, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns, according to an Iraqi police officer who said he had helped fight off the attack. He said the aim appeared to be to free a large group of detainees, including about 50 women, a former police commander in the northern city of Mosul seized as an insurgent spy, and a doctor from a Baghdad hospital who had been caught videotaping the detention center a few days before the attack.
 But the attempt failed, and Iraqi and American commanders credited their strategy -- the Iraqis as the first line of defense, backed up by American reinforcements. 
 ''They had this urgent situation, they started making calls, we responded in support, and the insurgents didn't achieve any military objectives,'' Brig. Gen. C. Donald Alston, chief spokesman for the American command, told reporters. ''The Iraqi forces did what we have been working on all along, and that is bringing together and integrating in a competent military way Iraqi and American forces to achieve the military effect we need.'' 
 A less optimistic view taken by other American officers was that even a police detention center protected by 20-foot concrete blast walls and watchtowers with mounted machine guns needed American firepower to defend it. 
 American officers said a unit of American Humvees and Bradley fighting vehicles was sent urgently to the center's defense, supported by Apache attack helicopters. Some accounts from Iraqis living near the detention center said some Iraqi defenders abandoned their posts before American reinforcements arrived.
 In Mahmudiya, American officers traced many of the problems with Iraqi units to a lack of competent junior officers, coupled with enlisted men with minimal training, motivation centered on the monthly pay, and equipment that included cheap fiberglass helmets and poor-quality flak jackets.
 First Lt. Carlos Montalvan, an American officer attached to the unit that conducted the house raids, described it as ''pre-MOC,'' not even minimal operational capability. The unit ''should have been locked down for several months to train and to do static operations,'' he said. 
 A lack of basic infantry tactics surfaced during the raids, when Iraqi troops assigned to watch the houses while raiding parties entered to make arrests gathered closely together outside, rarely taking up defensive positions. On several occasions, Sgt. First Class Michael Hanaway admonished the Iraqi soldiers to watch the perimeter instead of staring at the house being raided. 
 ''You've got to look that way,'' he shouted, motioning. ''Not at me. That way.'' The sergeant sighed. ''They probably shouldn't have been out here,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Again, Tooting Horns on Madison Ave.

BYLINE: By Nat Ives

 BODY:
MOST people already hear plenty from the advertising industry, which chases consumers in places ranging from cellphone screens to bathroom stalls -- all on behalf of its clients.
 But the organizers of last fall's Advertising Week in New York, an industry promotion that included parades and networking events, say the business still does not do enough to promote itself. They are forging ahead with a second annual Advertising Week, planned for Sept. 26 through Sept. 30 of this year.
 ''There is nothing wrong with celebrating a great industry,'' said O. Burtch Drake, president at the American Association of Advertising Agencies, which conceived of the first Advertising Week. ''What's wrong with tooting our own horn?'' 
 Ad agencies, after all, help other businesses succeed by promoting their products and services. Their work both shapes and reflects the culture at large. And advertising support is fueling the development of new media formats like video-on-demand. 
 But outside of the industry's award shows, recognition remains faint, Mr. Drake said. ''The original intent, and still the current event, is to elevate and raise the visibility of the advertising business in New York City.'' 
 The first Advertising Week got the support of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and had about 40,000 participants from 30 countries, organizers said. According to a study by the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the week generated $55 million in revenue for city hotels, restaurants and other businesses.
 This year's week will reprise many of last year's events. Well-known advertising characters will again begin the week at the opening of the Nasdaq stock market, before a procession of Budweiser Clydesdales and other mascots proceeds through Times Square.
 Organizers have again nominated separate slates of icons, like the Coppertone Girl and the Geico gecko, and slogans, like ''This is your brain; this is your brain on drugs,'' for inclusion on the ''Madison Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame.'' The winners will be determined by consumers; last year, about 600,000 people voted online for favorite mascots and slogans.
 Among the five winners in each category, M&M's talking candies and the slogan ''Melts in your mouth, not in your hand'' won the most votes.
 Many of the runners-up from last year are nominees again, like the California Raisins, Charlie the Tuna and Juan Valdez in the icons category. New nominees for icons this year include the Nike swoosh, the Vlasic stork and Cap'n Crunch.
 One frequent complaint last year was that the week included an overabundance of panels, speeches, award ceremonies and other events, which led some of those attending to feel overwhelmed by choices and unsure of the week's focus.
 ''As is common in the marketing industry, Advertising Week was plagued by a weak and unexpressed strategy,'' one attendee wrote in a letter to Advertising Age, the trade publication. ''Were the goals to educate industry talent, regain trust from consumers or, sadly, prove our own worth within our organizations?''
 Ken Kaess, co-chairman of this year's Advertising Week, said organizers had built a crowded schedule for the inaugural event partly in response to skeptics. ''We were so aware of the criticism that this was just a celebratory event and lacking in substance,'' he said. ''You will see a little more clarity in terms of communications and who different events will appeal to most.''
 Organizers also did not know how many attendees to expect last year, said Ron Berger, also a co-chairman. ''We had too many events and too many people wanting to go to too many events,'' he said. ''If you had asked us about that three months before, we wouldn't have thought that was going to be a problem.''
 Then there is the spectacle of the ad industry taking a week to advertise itself, which some critics questioned last year. Coincidentally, the concept was recently mocked by The Onion, the satirical weekly paper, with a front-page fictional article headlined, ''National Advertising Board Launches 'Advertising: Get the Message!' Campaign.''
 The week nonetheless shows every sign of growing.
 All the members of last year's organizing committee, including groups like the Radio Advertising Bureau and the Advertising Educational Foundation, plan to participate again this year. 
 Yahoo, an important corporate supporter the first time around, is back to help promote the week and to be host of a Web site, with USA Today, where people will do the voting for mascots and slogans. Panasonic and Time Warner have increased their commitments to Advertising Week this year, while Google, MSN Music and MSNBC have signed up as new supporters.

HEADLINE: The Madrassa Myth

BYLINE: By Peter Bergen and Swati Pandey. 
Peter Bergen, the author of ''Holy War Inc.,'' is a fellow at the New America Foundation. Swati Pandey is a research associate there.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT is one of the widespread assumptions of the war on terrorism that the Muslim religious schools known as madrassas, catering to families that are often poor, are graduating students who become terrorists. Last year, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell denounced madrassas in Pakistan and several other countries as breeding grounds for ''fundamentalists and terrorists.'' A year earlier, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld had queried in a leaked memorandum, ''Are we capturing, killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting, training and deploying against us?''
 While madrassas may breed fundamentalists who have learned to recite the Koran in Arabic by rote, such schools do not teach the technical or linguistic skills necessary to be an effective terrorist. Indeed, there is little or no evidence that madrassas produce terrorists capable of attacking the West. And as a matter of national security, the United States doesn't need to worry about Muslim fundamentalists with whom we may disagree, but about terrorists who want to attack us. 
 We examined the educational backgrounds of 75 terrorists behind some of the most significant recent terrorist attacks against Westerners. We found that a majority of them are college-educated, often in technical subjects like engineering. In the four attacks for which the most complete information about the perpetrators' educational levels is available -- the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, the attacks on the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, the 9/11 attacks, and the Bali bombings in 2002 -- 53 percent of the terrorists had either attended college or had received a college degree. As a point of reference, only 52 percent of Americans have been to college. The terrorists in our study thus appear, on average, to be as well educated as many Americans.
 The 1993 World Trade Center attack involved 12 men, all of whom had a college education. The 9/11 pilots, as well as the secondary planners identified by the 9/11 commission, all attended Western universities, a prestigious and elite endeavor for anyone from the Middle East. Indeed, the lead 9/11 pilot, Mohamed Atta, had a degree from a German university in, of all things, urban preservation, while the operational planner of 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, studied engineering in North Carolina. We also found that two-thirds of the 25 hijackers and planners involved in 9/11 had attended college.
 Of the 75 terrorists we investigated, only nine had attended madrassas, and all of those played a role in one attack -- the Bali bombing. Even in this instance, however, five college-educated ''masterminds'' -- including two university lecturers -- helped to shape the Bali plot. 
 Like the view that poverty drives terrorism -- a notion that countless studies have debunked -- the idea that madrassas are incubating the next generation of terrorists offers the soothing illusion that desperate, ignorant automatons are attacking us rather than college graduates, as is often the case. In fact, two of the terrorists in our study had doctorates from Western universities, and two others were working toward their Ph.D.
 A World Bank-financed study that was published in April raises further doubts about the influence of madrassas in Pakistan, the country where the schools were thought to be the most influential and the most virulently anti-American. Contrary to the numbers cited in the report of the 9/11 commission, and to a blizzard of newspaper reports that 10 percent of Pakistani students study in madrassas, the study's authors found that fewer than 1 percent do so. If correct, this estimate would suggest that there are far more American children being home-schooled than Pakistani boys attending madrassas. 
 While madrassas are an important issue in education and development in the Muslim world, they are not and should not be considered a threat to the United States. The tens of millions of dollars spent every year by the United States through the State Department, the Middle East Partnership Initiative, and the Agency for International Development to improve education and literacy in the Middle East and South Asia should be applauded as the development aid it is and not as the counterterrorism effort it cannot be.

HEADLINE: Giving in '04 Was Up 2.3% In Rebound

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Charitable giving rose somewhat last year, reflecting economic stability and stock gains that helped pump up foundation assets and corporate profits.
 Americans and their institutions gave away an estimated $248.52 billion, a 2.3 percent increase on an inflation-adjusted basis over their 2003 contributions, which were essentially unchanged from the previous year. 
 Last year was the first since the stock market bubble burst in 2000 that giving has rebounded, but the total remains below that year's levels when the amounts are adjusted for inflation.
 ''After several years of so-so giving, we're seeing a change in direction,'' said Henry Goldstein, chairman of the Giving USA Foundation, an educational and research program of the American Association of Fundraising Counsel, which together with the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University publishes the annual report on giving statistics. ''At almost $250 billion, it's a very large number, and it's finally moving in a positive direction.'' 
 As a part of the nation's gross domestic product, giving accounted for 2.12 percent of gross domestic product, down a notch from 2.15 percent in 2003, according to calculations by Empty Tomb Inc., a Christian organization that encourages and conducts research about giving to churches. Empty Tomb has been critical of the Giving USA statistics.
 Using Giving USA's figures, Empty Tomb calculated that giving per person rose in absolute dollars, to $639.29 last year from $620.39 in 2003, but fell 1.65 percent as a portion of disposable income. ''That may not seem like much, but if it happens year after year after year, it would start to have serious implications for America,'' said Sylvia Ronsvalle, vice president of the organization.
 Giving USA is regarded by some as a tool of the professional fund-raising industry. ''It seems hilarious that in this nation that boasts of its giving, the giving statistics are provided by an organization representing for-profit companies,'' said Lester Salamon, director of the Center for Civil Society Studies at the Johns Hopkins University. ''Obviously, it's in their business interests to promote giving and make it seem important to our economy.''
 Mr. Goldstein said that such criticism was misplaced and that the adjustments for inflation in the report were adequate. ''We look very hard at our numbers, and we are very careful to say this is an estimate,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''If they can come up with any better data or methodology, they should do it.''
 He did note that the data on bequests, or gifts left by people at death, was faulty, in part because estates can be mired in probate for more than a year and because the government has limited which estates must report.
 The dollar value of bequests, the third-largest source of charitable gifts last year, increased an inflation-adjusted 6.4 percent, to $19.8 billion, after a decline in 2003.
 Giving to tsunami relief accounted for less than half of 1 percent of giving in 2004, the report said. Most of the contributions for such relief will be included in the tally for this year, but the estimated $1.5 billion to $2.5billion will probably not have a marked effect on overall giving.
 Individuals account for the bulk of giving, donating more than three-quarters of the total amount last year. They gave away an estimated $187.9 billion, an inflation-adjusted increase of 1.4 percent.
 Foundations accounted for 11.6 percent of the contributions. Adjusted for inflation, their giving of $28.8billion was 4.5 percent higher last year than in 2003.
 Giving increased for religious groups, which received more than one-third of total donations, as did gifts to educational institutions, foundations, health organizations, arts groups and environmental charities. 
 But giving to human services organizations, which provide services like after-school programs for children and housing for the homeless, fell for the third year in a row. ''When people see the overall number for giving in this country, they immediately think to themselves, well, aren't we generous to the poor?'' Mr. Salamon said. ''But services for the poor attract less than 10 percent of total giving, while religious organizations attract the lion's share.''
 Some parts of gifts to religious organizations are directed to nonprofit groups that provide human services programs, but not much, according to research by Mark Chaves, a sociology professor at the University of Arizona and author of the book ''Congregations in America.''
 Professor Chaves found that the median amount spent on social services by those congregations that spend money in that area was $1,200 a year, or less than 3 percent of the average congregation's total budget.

HEADLINE: Brief Scare for Investors

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Was it merely a passing cloud? Investors were briefly nervous a week ago Monday when Quest Diagnostics, the largest medical-testing company, disclosed that it had received subpoenas from the Justice Department about its contracts with the federal government and other leading customers from 1993 to 1999.
 Many investors may have recalled that the mid-90's were years when the clinical laboratory industry seemed on the verge of crumbling under the weight of price wars and wide-ranging inquiries into overcharging and other fraudulent business practices. Deep-pocket players like Corning, Hoffman-La Roche and SmithKline Beecham fled the business by spinning off or selling their tarnished subsidiaries. 
 Investors were uneasy enough about Quest's disclosure to send its recently highflying shares down $1.01, to $105.42, in trading a week ago Monday. But a second subpoena disclosure -- the next day from the Laboratory Corporation of America -- soon quieted fears that the latest Justice Department investigation might bring new exposure of misconduct at the labs and additional liabilities. 
 LabCorp, as it is known, disclosed in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had been asked for the same types of information as Quest. LabCorp added that it had been told by the Justice Department that it was not a target of the investigation. Quest then indicated for the first time that it had been given similar guidance by federal investigators. 
 The Justice Department, as usual, declined to comment. That left open the question of why the United States attorney's office in Newark was looking at the contracts. But it was enough for Wall Street to settle back into its current view of the labs as a business segment with a $35 billion to $38 billion annual market in the United States, dependable profits and growth prospects that are modest but clear. 
 Combined revenue for the four publicly traded companies in the sector is forecast by Thomson Financial to climb about 6 percent this year and earnings to rise at a pace about double that, with somewhat higher rates for the two smaller public companies: LabOne and Specialty Laboratories. 
 Three of the field's stocks have been trading close to 52-week highs reached in recent weeks. But Specialty Labs has been hobbled this spring by tension between senior managers and its founder and controlling shareholder, James B. Peter. It is now searching for both a new chief executive and a new chief financial officer.
 ''The sector is trading at a premium because it's a safe haven,'' said Thomas Gallucci, who follows the testing companies for Merrill Lynch. ''There's not a lot of businesses that have this kind of visibility and steady growth.'' (Merrill has banking relationships with Quest and Specialty.)
 To hear the companies and analysts tell it, the 1990's are history. The lab companies say they have introduced stringent quality controls to prevent recurrences of the abuses. Nor, they say, are they as dependent as they once were on wringing every last cent out of routine analysis of fluid and tissue specimens. 
 Breakthroughs like the mapping of the human genome have spawned a flood of new types of analytical jobs for them, like tests that identify which patients are susceptible to particular types of heart disease or cancer. 
 "The role of diagnostics is very different from 10 years ago,'' said Dr. Surya N. Mohapatra, the chairman and chief executive of Quest. ''Now they are used not only to diagnose disease but to monitor therapy and predict disease.'' 
 The visibility is partly a result of the current structure of the testing business, according to Robert Michel, a consultant in Spicewood, Tex., who publishes The Dark Report, a newsletter focused on clinical testing. Some 50 percent to 60 percent of the business is conducted by pathology departments in hospitals and clinics, about 25 percent in doctors' offices and the rest in the independent labs operated by companies like Quest, according to Mr. Michel, who does not invest in any of the companies. 
 After more than a decade of acquiring rivals, Quest, based in Lyndhurst, N.J., is the clear leader in the independent sector. Net income last year was $507 million on $5.13 billion in revenue. LabCorp, which has also been a serial acquirer and is based in Burlington, N.C., had income of $363 million on revenue of $3.08 billion. Quest's earnings per share have risen 36.7 percent annually over the last five years while LabCorp's have grown 26.7 percent. 
 Both companies are far larger than their competitors and operate nationwide networks of laboratories that perform routine tests like Pap smears and urinalysis as well as labs that do more demanding tasks like searches for particular proteins associated with cancer or complex gene analysis.
 As analysts see it, an aging population means a steady growth in the number of tests, while the current structure of the business with just two broad-based companies and specialized expertise required for the more unusual tests makes price wars unlikely. ''The market likes companies that aren't going to miss numbers,'' said William Bonello of Wachovia Securities.
 If the industry agrees on anything, it is the opportunity presented by diagnostic tests being developed to assess illness, or even the risk of future illness, by analyzing a patient's DNA and RNA, the storehouses of genetic information. New and nonroutine tests are the only part of the business consistently growing at double-digit rates. 
 Most new tests are developed outside the lab companies, which license them or sometimes buy the developer. But this advanced-technology business is also attracting new competitors, like Genomic Health, a start-up in Redwood City, Calif., that has developed a gene test to help oncologists predict which breast cancer patients are most likely to suffer a recurrence and which chemotherapy treatments will work best for their cancer. Genomic Health, still privately held, has set up its own laboratory to process specimens sent to it by doctors.
 Ultimately, the big lab companies not only need to have access to the new technology but also to figure out how to deliver it profitably on a large scale. 
 ''The danger is that the large labs have such a broad range of tests to sell that they may not be focusing on the new ones,'' said Matthew C. Watson, who recently became chief executive of Combimatrix Molecular Diagnostics, a newly formed unit of the Combimatrix Corporation, which is owned by Acacia Research, a holding company in Newport Beach, Calif. 
 The new business aims to develop diagnostic kits from devices Combimatrix makes to automate tests on large arrays of DNA snippets. Such arrays are used by researchers for tasks like identifying compounds that might be useful drugs.
 And what about that passing cloud? Wall Street may have breathed a sigh of relief and turned its attention elsewhere after Quest and LabCorp said that they were not targets of the federal investigation. But Mr. Michel, the newsletter writer, said the inquiry, like those in the 1990's, could still affect the lab companies by leading to new rules on how they can do business.
 ''It won't result in an economic blow,'' Mr. Michel said, ''but it could end up as a wedge affecting today's business practices.''

HEADLINE: Where Have You Gone, Norman Rockwell? A Fresh Look at the Family

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
While many historians spend their lives sifting through documents about American presidents or Civil War generals, Dr. Stephanie Coontz's territory is both more mundane and contentious. 
 Dr. Coontz, 60, a professor of family studies at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., researches how people have formed families through the ages. Her special expertise is the history of marriage. Her fifth book on the topic, ''Marriage, a History: From Obedience to Intimacy or How Love Conquered Marriage,'' has just been released by Viking. Publisher's Weekly said Dr. Coontz ''presents her arguments clearly, offering an excellent balance between the scholarly and the readable in this timely, important book.'' 
 Dr. Coontz's own family includes her husband, Will Reissner, a 60-year-old recent retiree from Northwest Airlines, and son, Kris Coontz, 24, a firefighter about to begin medical school. ''I study what I live,'' Dr. Coontz said over a glass of wine. She was visiting Boston last month, promoting the new book.

Q. How did you develop a specialty in the history of marriage?

A. When I started on this in the 1970's, it really was weird. I had trained in political and economic history. In 1975, which was the height of the women's movement, I thought I'd write a book on women's history. But in searching for a topic, I realized that there were few places in history where men and women interacted.
 Finally, it hit me: ''Oh, look at the family. That's the one place.'' In the 1970's, family history wasn't yet thought of a serious field for study. I was terrified of being laughed at by other historians. I called my book ''The Social Origins of Private Life.'' It should have been ''As Pompous as You Want to Be.'' Every sentence was academic jargon, and if I said X, I qualified it with Y. The new book isn't like that.

Q. What is the book's central thesis?

A. That marriage has changed more in the past 30 years than in the previous 3,000. This has happened largely because women have changed so dramatically. In my lifetime, marriage has been transformed from a rigid institution where gender roles were strictly defined to what we often have now -- partnerships. Until the mid-20th century, it was the man's duty to support the family. It was the wife's to provide sex and housekeeping. That's gone.
 In three decades, we've gotten rid of all the legal and political requirements that women be subordinate to their husbands. At the same time, women have gained economic independence, so that they are not subordinate. We've also eliminated laws penalizing children labeled illegitimate. Taken together, this is as dramatic a change in human history as the Industrial Revolution.

Q. Didn't the romantics of the late 1700's try to reform marriage?

A. Yes, this was part of the Enlightenment, the demand to marry for love. The defenders of what was then traditional marriage, arranged marriage, were horrified. They said, ''If love matches become the norm, we'll get people living together without marriage, homosexual partnerships, divorce and illegitimacy.''
 They were right. The love match was destabilizing. But the radical implications of the ''love revolution'' wouldn't be actualized until women got reliable birth control and independent incomes. 

Q. Some critics wonder whether the changes in marriage have been good for children. Are you sympathetic to their concerns?

A. Certainly the situation for modern families is not easy. But you know, when people romanticize the marriages of the past, they say, ''Marriage is about making sure that every child has a mother and a father.'' But for thousands of years, marriage was about getting in-laws, making alliances, determining which child had a right to parents and inheritance. Illegitimate children had no rights. A lot of these traditionalists idealize a paradise that never was.

Q. Why are the 1950's often thought of as the golden era of American families?

A. Some of that is economic. The 1950's were a time of optimism, when a cohort of G.I.'s returning from World War II moved to subsidized suburbs and started families all at the same time. The economy was expanding, as were national hopes, and there was this shared experience.
 By contrast, we are living now in an era where social disparities are widening. At the same time, women are working at paid jobs, and they are not at home. Some people wonder what will happen to children when women are no longer compelled to do the child care. Americans believe you can have a winner-take-all economy, because the nuclear family will take care of all altruism and obligation. So when it looks like the nuclear family isn't going to do that, it's very frightening. A lot of the social-issue voting during the last presidential election, I think, was fueled by this. 
 It all came to a head because of the gay and lesbian issue. America is one of the most sexually conservative nations in the West, especially about homosexuality. So for many voters, gays' seeking marriage while heterosexuals were revolutionizing it was the last straw.

Q. What do you make of the fact that divorce rates are especially high in many ''red'' states like Oklahoma and Alabama?

A. I see it as a sign that families are changing so rapidly that stated values are poor predictors of actual behavior. Educated individuals are more likely to have a value system that says it's O.K. to be divorced, but they are less likely to do it. Blacks are more likely to disapprove of cohabitation than whites, but much more likely to cohabit. Oklahoma and Alabama have high divorce rates. Massachusetts, the poster state for liberalism, does not.

Q. Magazines sometimes run articles on female tycoons who quit to become soccer moms. What are those articles really about?

A. Wishful thinking, I suspect. The trend measurements don't show that's happening. What they show is that the rapid influx of mothers with young children into the workplace has leveled off and fallen, slightly. In 1998, almost 60 percent of women were returning to work before their kids were 1. Now it's 55 percent. This may be a sign of the revolution consolidating rather than reversing itself. Many women now have the confidence to say, ''I can negotiate longer leaves, and if I can't, I'll quit and find something else later.''

Q. You say that a key component of the marriage revolution has been women's ability to control their fertility. Would these changes continue if abortion became illegal?

A. That will not send women back into the home. There will be an increased polarization between the options of affluent women and poor women. Affluent women will find ways around restrictive abortion laws, and poor women will be stuck. I think the marriage revolution is just a too big social change to be reversed.

Q. What's the upside to the marriage revolution?

A. How much men have changed in these past 30 years. You never used to see men with their children. Husbands may now believe they do more housework than they in fact do, but they are doing some. When I see the wonderful, respectful relationships that my son and his friends have with the women in their lives, I see something really new.

Q. What's the marital history of the marriage historian?

A. I've had the kind of complex life I write about. I was a single mother for 12 years. I'd been engaged. The wedding fell through. I then discovered I was pregnant and opted to have the child on my own. I was a professor. I was in my mid-30's. I could manage it financially. Twelve years later, another man, Will -- he was my college sweetheart -- reappeared in my life. We married, and he became a second father to my son.
 My story illustrates what I sometimes write about. You can't judge a family's health by the form it's in at a given moment. Nowadays, people get to good places by some very weird routes. It's also true that people can take very traditional routes and end up in very bad places.

HEADLINE: Taxpayer Expense Is Less In Deal for New Stadium 

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
The city and the state may not be funneling $600 million into a new Mets stadium, the amount they promised to the Jets on the West Side, but there is still plenty of taxpayer expense built into the hastily negotiated deal to build a new stadium for the Mets and the Olympics.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced on Sunday that the Mets had agreed to ''privately finance'' a new stadium in the parking lot next to the team's existing Queens ballpark. He said the city and the state would invest about $180 million -- $105 million from the city and $75 million from the state -- in ''infrastructure and site preparation.''
Although the details are still being worked out, the city and state would pay for highway improvements, environmental cleanup, electric and sewer lines to the new stadium, and other forms of ''site preparation,'' according to state and city officials. 
 The estimate of $880 million overall for the Mets stadium pales in comparison with the $2.2 billion project for the Jets, which would have been the most expensive stadium in the world with the largest public subsidy ever provided for a professional team. But in the world of stadium financing, what one team calls an expense for infrastructure another will call a government subsidy. It is also clear from interviews with state and city officials that the Mets will get a series of state and undisclosed public benefits.
 Despite references to private financing, state and city officials say the Mets expect to pay for the stadium by using as much as $700 million in tax-exempt bonds rather than conventional financing, thereby reducing government tax revenues. That would allow the team to save an estimated $11.2 million a year in annual bond payments.
 The Mets, like the Yankees, who are expected to announce plans for a new $800 million stadium later this week, will not pay rent, though the teams play on city-owned land.
 One element of the Mets deal that was not described at the Sunday news conference has to do with parking at Shea Stadium. The city now gets that revenue, but in the future the Mets would get the first $7 million a year in net parking revenues, and the city and the team would split whatever else comes in, according to three people involved in the deal-making who refused to be identified because the terms are under negotiation. That much revenue is unlikely, though, since annual parking revenue at Shea has not exceeded $3.8 million for five years, according to the city's Parks Department.
 City officials scrambled to put together a deal with the Mets over the last week after their first choice, a West Side stadium for the Jets, was rejected by the state's top legislators. The new deal is supposed to provide the Mets with a long-sought replacement for Shea that could be used for the Olympics if New York is selected for the 2012 Olympics.
 Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff estimated Sunday that a new Mets stadium would generate $180 million in additional tax revenue for the city over the next 30 years. More importantly, he said, the city would no longer have to pay the fast rising cost of maintaining Shea, because the Mets would build, operate and maintain the stadium.
 ''We believe over 30 years,'' Mr. Doctoroff said, ''we will save or earn $393 million.''
 The city's leases with the Mets and the Yankees have always been good examples of the term ''sweetheart deal,'' according to real estate executives. In the five years from 2000 through 2004, the Mets paid a total of $24.5 million in rent to the city. The city spent $20.8 million in turn maintaining the aging stadium, leaving a net gain of less than $4 million. City officials contend that stadiums also generate millions of dollars in tax revenue.
 Most economists are skeptical of public investments in stadiums, which they say largely enrich the team but create very little additional business because they provide only seasonal, relatively low-paid jobs.
 Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., said the Mets deal was better for taxpayers than the Jets project.
 ''It's an O.K. deal, as these deals go,'' Mr. Zimbalist said. ''The fact that the Mets are nominally putting up $600 million or $700 million is better than you usually get. The typical stadium deal usually entails 60 to 70 percent public financing.''
 The Mets and the Yankees had struck a far different deal with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in 2001, in which they agreed to a 50-50 split of the cost of two $800 million stadiums with retractable roofs. The state agreed to cover tens of millions of dollars in infrastructure costs.
 A month later, though, newly elected Mayor Bloomberg called a halt to public financing for sports stadiums.
 Given the sea change in stadium politics at City Hall, the Yankees last year proposed building a new home in the Bronx for $800 million and paying for it. The team asked the state and city to pay about $300 million for a Metro-North train station, subway platforms, parking garages and parkland.


CORRECTION-DATE: June 16, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A chart on Tuesday comparing the financing of the stadium proposals for the Jets on the West Side of Manhattan and the Mets in Queens referred imprecisely to the Jets' compensation for the use of land owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Although the team would not have paid rent, its proposal included a $250 million payment for development rights.

HEADLINE: Memo Seems to Link Annan To Contract of Son's Company

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
A memo written by someone who was then an executive of a major contractor in the United Nations oil-for-food program states that he briefly discussed the company's effort to win the contract in late 1998 with Secretary General Kofi Annan and his ''entourage'' and that the executive was told that ''we could count on their support.''
 The secretary general's son, Kojo Annan, was employed by Cotecna Inspection Services, a Swiss contractor based in Geneva, and the nature of that relationship is among the issues being investigated by a panel appointed by the United Nations and several Congressional committees. 
 Kofi Annan has said several times that he did not discuss the contract with his son and was not involved in Cotecna's selection. A United Nations panel headed by Paul A. Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, concluded in March that Mr. Annan had not influenced the awarding of the $10 million dollar-a-year contract to the company. 
 But the memo appears to raise questions about the secretary general's role. 
 Asked for comment, a consultant for the company who is familiar with its role in the oil-for-food program said that on Monday Cotecna provided copies of the e-mail messages and other documents that were recently discovered in company files to investigators of three Congressional committees. The committees have been looking into fraud and abuses in the $65 billion program.
 The consultant said the memo was found by accident three weeks ago in a search of company archives as part of an effort to account for all of Cotecna's payments to Kojo Annan.
 ''No senior Cotecna officials initially had any memory of the e-mail or of such a meeting, and the memo appears to contradict what the company has said,'' said the company's consultant, who declined to be identified. 
 A copy of the memo was provided to The New York Times, and the consultant confirmed that it was authentic.
 The memo, written on Dec. 4, 1998, by Michael R. Wilson, then a Cotecna vice president who was Kojo Annan's friend and a family friend of the secretary general, describes a meeting that took place during the 20th summit meeting of Francophone leaders in Paris in late November 1998. 
 ''We had brief discussions with the SG and his entourage,'' the memo states. ''Their collective advise was that we should respond as best as we could to the Q&A session of the 1-12-98 and that we could count on their support.'' 
 The ''1-12-98'' refers to a meeting Mr. Wilson and a delegation of Cotecna officials had in New York on Dec. 1, 1998, with senior United Nations officials who were considering which of three companies to select for the inspection contract that Cotecna won 10 days later.
 The memo does not state that Kojo Annan was present at the discussion with the secretary general. But it continues with a description of ''courtesy greetings'' on behalf of Cotecna with presidents of several African countries held by a person identified as ''KA'' at the summit meeting. Asked for comment, a consultant for the company said it appeared that Mr. Wilson was referring to Kojo Annan in the memo. 
 The memo is attached to an e-mail message sent by Mr. Wilson to the company's owners and senior executives. It is dated Dec. 4, 1998, a week before Cotecna was informed that it had won the contract to inspect goods purchased by Iraq under the program, which allowed Iraq to sell some of its oil to meet needs of its civilian population despite United Nations sanctions. 
 Fred Eckhard, a United Nations spokesman, said Monday that Mr. Annan was in Paris and that his chief of staff did not wish to disturb him, at about 10:45 p.m. there. But Mr. Eckhard confirmed that Mr. Annan attended the French-African summit meeting in Paris in November 1998. 
 ''We cannot comment on documentation for which we don't have the full context,'' Mr. Eckhard said. ''The secretary general established the Volcker commission precisely in order to have a credible investigation able to examine all aspects of the oil-for-food program.''
 The company's consultant said senior Cotecna executives did not know if Mr. Wilson was accurate in his memo on the meeting. The consultant said that the Volcker panel had not yet seen Mr. Wilson's e-mail message and memo and that the company intended to provide copies of both to the panel on Tuesday. 
 Mr. Wilson did not respond to a message left on his cellphone in Geneva. Nor could Kojo Annan be reached for comment. His lawyer did not respond to an e-mail message, and his assistant said he was at an airport and could not be reached. 
 Cotecna has acknowledged that its owners held at least two private meetings with Secretary General Annan before the oil-for-food contract was awarded. But the company and its executives have denied that they discussed Cotecna's effort to win United Nations business at those meetings, or that any Cotecna executive lobbied Mr. Annan for the contract.
 In a report issued in March, the Volcker panel criticized both Cotecna and Kojo Annan. Though it concluded in an interim report that Secretary General Annan had not influenced the awarding of the contract to the company that employed his son, it faulted him for not looking more aggressively into the company's relationship with the United Nations once questions were raised about it.
 The panel also criticized both Cotecna and Kojo Annan for trying to conceal the duration of their business and professional relationship. It said the younger Mr. Annan had deceived his father about it and had been uncooperative with Mr. Volcker's investigators.

HEADLINE: Back on the Boards, but Haunted by an Injury and the Rent

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER REARDON

 BODY:
Sarah Michelson prides herself on being a survivor, a latchkey kid who crossed an ocean, beat the odds and made a name in New York. As a choreographer, she commands an avid downtown following, wins plum commissions and basks in critical acclaim. 
 But last winter Ms. Michelson (pronounced MITCH-el-son) suffered a wrenching blow. While rehearsing on Jan. 2, four days before the scheduled opening of her new show, she cracked a bone in her right foot. The injury, she said, was cataclysmic. It forced the cancellation of a three-week run at P.S. 122 in the East Village, costing her troupe an estimated $43,550 in production expenses, theater fees and lost ticket sales. 
Now back on her feet, Ms. Michelson plans to return to the stage tomorrow through June 26 for the belated premiere of ''Daylight,'' an abstract work initially conceived as a meditation on urban geography and displacement. 
 Yet the injury haunts her. It has intensified her already acute sense of stage fright, she said, driven her deeper into debt and weakened her devotion to the art form. ''I really cannot go on this way,'' said Ms. Michelson, 40, who has no health insurance and consequently ran up a $12,000 medical bill. ''I have no money to live on.'' 
 The winner of two Bessie Awards, she has made dances for Mikhail Baryshnikov's White Oak Dance Project and, this spring, the Lyon Opera Ballet. Still, she is five months behind in her rent. That a choreographer of her caliber can barely keep the lights on suggests how tenuous the economics of dance can be, especially for those who inhabit the realm between emerging artists and household names. 
 A native of Manchester, England, Ms. Michelson has mesmerized the downtown dance world in recent years with her vivid theatrical environments and her cryptic montages of quirky, repetitive movement. Her last offering, ''Shadowmann'' (2003), was a two-part tour de force.
 For the first installment, she inverted the usual seating plan at the Kitchen (so that audience members faced the street) and flung open the lobby doors. There was dancing everywhere: trancelike kicking and slashing onstage, young women shuffling back and forth over to the side, an old man noodling around the lighting booth. For the second part, shown several days later in a tiny downstairs space at P.S. 122, she draped the walls in chintz, laid down a plush white carpet and filled the stage with enigmatic figures who crawled around glassy-eyed, whirled their arms and muttered in German.
 ''What was it all about?'' mused the critic Laura Shapiro in New York magazine. ''Something creepy, something humane and finally something transcendent.'' 
 But if Ms. Michelson has little use for narrative, she likes thwarting expectations. Through prolonged repetition, she can endow a small gesture with operatic grandeur or turn a simple entrance into a central event. Her surreal aesthetic often elicits bemused laughter. But ''there's nothing flip about what Sarah's doing,'' said the choreographer Tere O'Connor, an early champion of her dances. ''It comes from a deeply investigated imagination and a capacity to craft important theatrical work.'' 
 When making dances, Ms. Michelson tends to create movement with her own body, then transfer it to her closely knit ensemble of dancers. Three of them -- Parker Lutz, Mike Iveson and Greg Zuccolo -- perform with her in ''Daylight.'' While rehearsing the piece last week, they were all business. One day Ms. Michelson spent two hours fine-tuning a five-minute section, calibrating every detail down to the contour of the dancers' fingers and the movement of their eyes. 
 Four days later she was still polishing the same section. Such technical rigor is a hallmark of her work, and details that may seem incidental or improvised onstage seldom are. ''I'm a very formal choreographer,'' she said. ''I use idiosyncratic movement and a certain ironic stance that makes it seem like I'm fun or something. But I don't think I'm fun. I think I'm the opposite of fun: very dark and formal.'' 
 In talking about new work, she and her dancers are resolutely opaque. '''Daylight,''' she said, ''is about us and where we're up to in the journey of making dances together.'' Pressed to elaborate, she said, ''I don't want to say anything that might create preconceptions before people have experienced it.'' 
 Fair enough, though she did allow that ''Daylight'' marks a departure for her in several respects. For the first time, she is tackling the larger upstairs space at P.S. 122. And initially she set out to make the piece without repeating a single movement. Although she later relaxed that notion, she said it remained evident in the finished work. ''I'm not going to make 'Shadowmann' again,'' she said. ''I left behind being clever and big and flashy.'' 
 In recent weeks, she made a few minor modifications to the piece, like eliminating a backward roll that put pressure on her right foot. ''There are things that I can't do,'' she said, ''and it's nerve-racking. My foot aches. It gets unstable. It's hard to balance.'' 
 The injury also has compounded her existing financial problems and heightened her desire for a career change. Indeed, she speaks of quitting after a swansong next year at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. What then? Filmmaking, she said, a vocation that could build on her knack for directing, editing, creating movement and designing visual environments. 
 Although she's reluctant to turn her back on dance, she sees no alternative. ''I know I'm lucky,'' she said. ''I got to come to New York and become someone who makes a dance on Baryshnikov. I got to do that. But it doesn't change the fact that I'm hiding from my landlord.''

HEADLINE: Strong Demand Limits OPEC's Leeway

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: VIENNA, June 13 

 BODY:
OPEC representatives arriving for a meeting here this week said that they were prepared to lift their oil production ceiling in an effort to bring down high crude oil prices, but emphasized that strong global demand for oil limited their ability to influence markets. 
 ''OPEC members are already pumping at full capacity and can do nothing about prices,'' Bijan Zanganeh, the oil minister of Iran, OPEC's second-largest producer behind Saudi Arabia, said in Tehran before traveling to Vienna. 
 Ali al-Naimi, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, the most pivotal member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said he supported raising the group's output ceiling by 500,000 barrels a day, but suggested that refining bottlenecks in rich industrialized nations would prevent such an increase from having much effect on prices. 
 The group, which produces 40 percent of the world's oil, still appears to be somewhat stymied by the resilient demand for oil in major markets like China and the United States, even if member countries have been delighted about the financial windfall created by high oil prices. 
 Production quotas for OPEC's 11 members, excluding Iraq, stand at 27.5 million barrels a day. The International Energy Agency, however, estimates that those 10 OPEC nations actually produced 27.51 million barrels a day in May as they rushed to exploit strong demand. 
 Katherine Spector, an energy strategist for J.P. Morgan in New York, said that while some OPEC members were publicly calling for more production, such statements were ''mostly semantic'' because, in effect, OPEC members have recently been giving a smaller discount for the oil they sell in international markets in relation to commonly quoted prices. 
 OPEC's enhanced bargaining power is yet another illustration of the growing global demand for oil. Demand is expected to reach 86.4 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter, the International Energy Agency said this month, translating into 1.78 million barrels a day more than last year, or a 2.2 percent increase. 
 World oil demand rose 3.4 percent in 2004, its fastest pace in a quarter- century, as the economies of China and the United States required more oil for their factories and automobiles. China alone accounted for about 40 percent of new oil demand from 2001 to 2004, and is planning to build a strategic petroleum reserve similar to the reserves in the United States and some European countries, a move that could put additional pressure on oil prices this year. 
 Oil prices rose sharply ahead of OPEC's meeting, which is scheduled for Wednesday at OPEC's headquarters here. Crude oil for July delivery climbed $2.08, or nearly 4 percent, to $55.62, on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday on concern about refining capacity. Oil prices have been volatile since rising above $57 a barrel in early April before pulling back somewhat. 
 Some OPEC representatives remain worried that high oil prices could encourage consumers in rich countries to start switching to other fuels as energy efficiency becomes a bigger concern. There is little evidence, however, to suggest that such a large-scale transition might be under way. 
 In fact, major international oil companies are factoring in estimates for relatively high oil prices into the foreseeable future. Senior executives at two companies, Royal Dutch/Shell and BP, recently said they expected oil prices to remain at or around $40 a barrel for at least the next several years.
 Forecasters at Shell went even further this month, discussing the possibility of governments of oil-rich countries becoming more aggressive over the next two decades in their dealings with private companies. 
 The pursuit of such policies by the governments of countries in OPEC and elsewhere might seem reminiscent of the 1970's, when the United States, Europe and Japan were shaken by embargoes and the nationalization of private oil company assets in several producing countries. But in a major difference with those oil shocks, oil price increases over the last two years have not been driven by the restriction of supply but by an unforeseen and steady climb in demand. 
 OPEC could add about 700,000 to 800,000 barrels of daily production capacity among its members by the end of the year, according to the International Energy Agency. But it remains to be seen whether the availability of that oil will have an effect on prices, given the tight refining capacity for certain blends of oil and forecasts of rising demand.

HEADLINE: Rockies' Fans and Revenues Are Vanishing Into Thin Air

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
In his big office at Coors Field in Denver, General Manager Dan O'Dowd of the Colorado Rockies keeps a sheet of paper covered in colored lines, most of them disconnected, some almost straight, others quite curved, a seemingly abstract impression of -- what?
 ''Coors Field,'' O'Dowd said. His son drew the picture two seasons ago at age 2. ''I always leave that on my desk,'' O'Dowd said. ''It reminds me of the reality of life.''
 Indeed, the current reality of the franchise is a picture difficult to discern. The Rockies have the worst record in the National League. The team is rebuilding with a roster that is baseball's youngest and one of its lowest paid. 
 The Rockies play in a charming stadium at high altitude, making it a funhouse for hitters and a house of horror for pitchers. Born in the 1993 expansion, the Rockies have had their initial romance with fans fade. Attendance has plummeted along with their winning percentage, revenues and franchise valuation.
 The team's principal owner, Charles K. Monfort, made an analogy to a dot-com company after the burst of the speculative bubble. He said the financial difficulties were being fixed, but he added: ''You're not going to make a lot of money in this game. You're not going to make any money, in fact, from what I can understand.'' 
 O'Dowd, speaking of the skills mixture on the roster, said, ''Quite honestly, we're not sure which formula completely works here yet.'' With a chuckle, he added, ''We finally hit rock bottom around here, or are in the process of it.''
 The Colorado pitching coach, Bob Apodaca, said the team needed durable, determined pitchers who were not worried about earned run averages and were not afraid of hitters making contact, guys who could bounce back from adversity.
 The Rockies work in a place where breaking balls do not always break in the mile-high air, and where fly balls sometimes land over the fences or in front of, or in between, outfielders on baseball's largest lawn. Shawn Chacon, a veteran Rockies pitcher, was asked how to build a pitching staff there. ''Get as much offense as you can,'' he said.
 Discussing Denver's peculiar challenges, the team's president, Keli S. McGregor, said, ''There's a lot of experienced baseball people who come here and scratch their heads and say, 'You know, I'm not really sure what I'd do.'''
 Others speak more harshly. Bud Selig, the commissioner, recently told of a phone call from an owner whose team endured a run-filled visit to Coors. ''He was outraged,'' Selig said. ''He said: 'Any ball hit up in the air is gone. You can't allow that. It's making a mockery of the game.''' Selig said he told the owner, ''Well, I can either blow Coors Field up or move the team.''
 It would seem hasty to destroy or vacate a 10-year-old stadium that was part of the retro era that blended modern convenience with old-fashioned architecture. Coors Field spurred a business boom in its downtown neighborhood in a city where football, basketball and hockey have thrived.
 From some seats, fans can gaze at the sun setting over the Rocky Mountains. Inside the stadium, behind the outfield fences, are rock gardens, evergreen trees and water jets bubbling in a pond. They spurt high to celebrate the home team's home runs. 
 There are plenty of them, even though the foul lines stretch 347 feet in left field and 350 feet in right, and the fence is 415 feet away in center field and 390 and 375 feet in the power alleys. Baseballs have been stored in a humidor since 2002 to counteract the drying effect of Denver's low humidity. That has subdued hitting somewhat, but balls here still seem more alive.
 The Elias Sports Bureau says Rockies games at Coors Field lead the major leagues in runs a game this season (11.88) and since the stadium opened in 1995 (13.30). Colorado home games also lead in home runs a game since 1995 (3.05) and are 11th this season at 2.24. And home runs tend to increase in the warmer months.
 Games at Coors Field have been called arena baseball and compared to slow-pitch softball. Tony Gwynn, the former batting champion for San Diego, said batting here was like hitting golf balls on the moon. 
 Albert Pujols of the St. Louis Cardinals won a game at Coors on May 30 with a three-run home run off Jay Witasick by pulling a slider, low and away, over the left-field fence with an awkward swing that looked as if it were one-handed in his follow-through.
 ''Nasty pitch,'' said Pujols, who called the 5-4 victory ''a weird game.''
 Chacon said: ''That was probably the most surprising home run I've ever seen here. And I've seen a few, man. I've seen some real far ones. I've seen a couple broken-bat ones. But that one was just mind-boggling.''
 Two nights later, Cardinals pitcher Matt Morris won an 8-6 game despite giving up 10 hits and 5 earned runs in six innings. During a four-run Colorado fourth, Morris said, he was ''just spinning cutters up there'' because his pitches stopped breaking.
 ''I lasted long enough to get the win, which I'm almost embarrassed about,'' Morris said with a sheepish smile. ''They say there is no such thing as a cheap win, but this is pretty close. I'm lucky. This place just messes with your mind.''
 And Morris visits only once this season. Jason Jennings, in his fifth season with the Rockies, went seven innings in a 2-1 victory, his 25th victory at Coors Field, more than any other pitcher. Only three games here, which all ended 2-0, have had fewer runs.
 Rockies Manager Clint Hurdle said playing a 2-1 game here was like ''eating spaghetti in a white shirt.''
 When asked if he liked pitching at Coors Field, Jennings blinked and replied: ''I don't think anybody would tell you they like pitching here. But I embrace the challenge.''
 Is Coors more difficult on pitchers physically or psychologically? ''Both,'' Jennings said.
 Going into last night's games, Colorado's earned run average of 5.68 was tied for last with Tampa Bay among the 30 major league teams. It has never been better than 24th. That was in 1994, when there were 28 teams.
 When Colorado made its only playoff appearance, as a wild-card team in the strike-shortened 1995 season, its E.R.A. was 4.97, the third worst in baseball. Dave Duncan, the Cardinals' pitching coach, said curveballs at Coors had a different role.
 ''You have to use it more as a chase pitch rather than a strike pitch,'' he said. 
 Could Duncan work here? ''I don't think there is any circumstance in which I would feel comfortable as a pitching coach in this ballpark,'' he said. ''It would challenge me beyond my ability to accept the challenge.''
 Some who have accepted the challenge were broken by it. Mike Hampton came to the Rockies as a free agent in 2001 and started 9-2. After that, he was 12-26 and was moved in a three-team trade via Florida to Atlanta. On a recent visit to Boston, Hampton said Coors Field was harder on pitchers than Fenway Park.
 ''The feel of the ball is different,'' he said, referring to Coors Field. ''It is by far the toughest place to build a pitching staff.'' 
 Leo Mazzone, the Braves' pitching coach, said Hampton was in a state similar to shell shock when he left Colorado after two seasons and joined the Braves. 
 ''He was trying to make the ball do way more than what it could do,'' Mazzone said. ''That's what happens when you go to that place, and it's the reason why a lot of guys struggle. They overexaggerate everything to try to make it work. I don't really think it ever will.''
 But there is hope for pitchers who grow up in Colorado's system and know no other home park. Jeff Francis, whom the Rockies chose ninth over all in the 2002 draft, was 6-0 in his first seven starts at Coors Field.
 ''I'm confident pitching here,'' Francis said. ''I don't know what it could be. I'm sure I'll go through some troubles.'' 
 Days later, on June 8, Francis allowed 5 runs and 12 hits in a 15-6 loss to the Chicago White Sox at Coors.
 After going through a hitting phase as the Blake Street Bombers, the Rockies tried hiring free-agent pitchers like Hampton and Denny Neagle, then emphasized speed and defense. Now, they want to build by drafting what they call character players who can be groomed.
 Every two years, O'Dowd said, the best 25 prospects are brought to Denver in the winter to stay with local families and take seminars about the social and psychological skills they will need to cope.
 ''We are trying to let them know as an organization that we're going to try and love them as people first and performers second,'' O'Dowd said. ''This is the hardest personnel model to figure out in all of professional sports.''
 O'Dowd said the park affected hitters as well as pitchers because hitters become greedy and try for extra-base hits instead of merely advancing runners.
 St. Louis shortstop David Eckstein said his teammate Larry Walker, a former Colorado right fielder, told him the Rockies beat visiting teams in the mid-1990's by hitting line drives to the wide gaps in the outfield while visitors ''would try and go big fly.''
 When asked about how his former team might fashion its pitching staff, Walker said, ''They have to be the type of personalities who are not worried about personal statistics.''
 O'Dowd agreed, but he said that was a problem because baseball rewards personal statistics. He said pitching was 60 percent to 70 percent of the game at most parks but not at Coors Field, which creates a problem in building a roster because half the games are on the road.
 Scott Boras, a top player agent, recently told The Denver Post that Coors Field first seemed like a Rubik's Cube, a solvable puzzle. ''But now it's become a black hole,'' he said. ''The baseball intellect that drives so many organizations doesn't serve this one marketplace, and it's to the detriment of the franchise.''
 O'Dowd added that the altitude wore down players physically so that they must be rested more, but that the fatigue on starting pitchers forced relievers to work more. He said all the sophisticated scouting reports and performance statistics were less valuable at Coors Field.
 ''You can take a lot of that here and open up the window and throw it out,'' O'Dowd said.

HEADLINE: Air of Subway Series In Race for Ballparks 

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
If all proceeds according to schedule, the Mets and the Yankees will play in April 2009 at new ballparks designed by the same architectural firm. 
 That would be an accident of timing. Not one major league stadium or arena has been built in the metropolitan area since 1981, when Continental Arena opened at the Meadowlands. Shea Stadium replaced the Polo Grounds in 1964 and has looked outdated almost ever since. Yankee Stadium began life in 1923 and reopened with a less distinctive look in 1976, after a two-year renovation. 
 Now, the region is awash with the prospect of new stadiums and arenas. 
 The Devils are to move into a Newark arena in 2007. The Nets are expected to be in Brooklyn for the 2008-9 season. In late 2009, after the expected openings of the baseball ballparks, the Giants are to open their new stadium.
 ''There's been a lot of pent-up demand, and, quite frankly, economic times are awfully good, with stable interest rates,'' said Jeffrey Vanderbeek, the Devils' owner. ''The time is right for this. And you can't compete if you're not in there with a new arena, with naming rights and all kinds of new seating and restaurants.''
 The Yankees had appeared to hold a substantial lead over the Mets in planning for a new stadium. They were days from announcing their detailed plans when the city turned to the Mets last week to help salvage its bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had hoped that the Jets would build a $2.2 billion stadium on the Far West Side of Manhattan, with $800 million in subsidies from the state and city, but state officials refused to approve it.
 The Mets' principal owner, Fred Wilpon, looked confident and a bit relieved at the City Hall news conference Sunday. He announced that he would finance a new ballpark that would expand to Olympic size if the city won its 2012 bid. In quiet talks with the city, he had no reason to expect a resolution so quickly, and certainly not at virtually the same time that the Yankees were to announce their deal.
 Wilpon offered no designs for the ballpark. The Yankees may show theirs to the news media as early as tomorrow. Both teams will use HOK Sport as their architect.
 ''Part of the difficulty all along was how to take care of both New York teams,'' said Adolfo Carrion Jr., the Bronx borough president. ''The smarter players prevailed on this one. The fans win and the city wins.''
 If the city is selected to be host for the 2012 Olympics, the Mets' new 45,000-seat stadium will be temporarily reconfigured as an 80,000-seat track and field/soccer stadium, and the Mets will play that season at the new Yankee Stadium. 
 A determination would then have to be made on how the Mets would be compensated for a year in the Bronx. 
 The lower deck and dugouts of the old Yankee Stadium are to be converted for Little Leagues and high school play. Other applications are being planned for the rest of the building and the area around it. 
 The new Yankee Stadium is expected to look in some ways like the original 1923 design by Osborne Engineering, from the exterior to the facade along the roof. Wilpon has not said if the Mets will preserve such designs as an entrance rotunda resembling the one at Ebbets Field, which he first suggested in 1998.
 The ability to make more money at their new ballparks is essential to the Yankees' and Mets' financing plans. Despite the Mets' less-storied history and historically lower attendance, they should not encounter serious problems finding as much as $700 million from banks or other institutions, financial professionals said. 
 ''Given their cash flow and profile, it's eminently financeable,'' said Sal Galatioto, an investment banker who, while he was with Lehman Brothers, arranged the financing for Wilpon to buy out his former partner, Nelson Doubleday. ''It's a major project, and Fred will have no shortage of people giving him ideas.''
 Marc Ganis, a sports finance and marketing consultant, said that with their new ballpark, the Mets would add fixed costs of at least $50 million annually to pay for the bonds they would issue to finance the stadium and operate it.
 ''He'll have to raise it and he can,'' Ganis said of Wilpon.
 With a new stadium, the Mets would not have to pay the city rent, which came to about $10 million last year, and would be able to deduct their stadium payments from some of their revenue-sharing obligations to Major League Baseball. 
 The Mets would also presumably benefit from higher stadium revenues and a stream of money coming from a television network that they will launch next season.
 The virtually simultaneous announcements of new stadiums for the Yankees and Mets does not surprise Harvey Robins, a former top aide to Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. ''What's surprising is the hysteria over stadiums when there are so many other infrastructure needs in the city,'' he said. 
 The Yankees are investing $800 million in the stadium, while the city and state will spend up to $300 million for infrastructure projects, the largest element being new garages to be financed by the state, which will get all the parking revenues. The city and state are to spend $180 million on infrastructure for the Mets' project.

HEADLINE: Early Gains in Shares Fade As Crude Oil Prices Surge

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks ended slightly higher yesterday, helped by a 2 percent gain in Morgan Stanley shares after the firm's embattled chief executive, Philip J. Purcell, announced that he would resign. But the market trimmed earlier gains as the price of oil rose.
 United States crude oil futures jumped more than $2, settling up 4 percent at $55.62 a barrel as heating oil prices surged to their highest since April 4. High oil prices tend to hurt many stocks, as they crimp corporate earnings and reduce consumer spending. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 9.93 points, or 0.09 percent, to 10,522.56. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 2.71 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,200.82. The Nasdaq composite index was up 5.96 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,068.96.
 Morgan Stanley, a Standard & Poor's 500 component, rose $1, to $50.88, as Mr. Purcell, 61, announced his resignation, after a heated internal conflict within the company and numerous high-level departures.
 Shares of Hewlett-Packard rose 2 percent, or 47 cents, to $23.89. After the close, the company named R. Todd Bradley to head its personal computer division and said the unit would once again be a stand-alone business.
 Among Nasdaq stocks, Electronic Arts rose 8.4 percent, or $4.50, to $58, ahead of a planned announcement of a new global marketing initiative with the National Basketball Association. 
 Sirius Satellite Radio rose 6 percent, or 34 cents, to $5.99, after it said it had developed a technology that would initially increase its network capacity by about 25 percent.
 The News Corporation, the media company, was up 2.9 percent as it said it would buy back $3 billion worth of its shares. The stock rose 47 cents, to $16.66. 
 Stocks have been gaining for nearly eight weeks, after hitting 2005 lows in April. But all three indexes are still in the red for the year.
 Ned Riley, the chief investment officer at Riley Asset Management, pointed to concerns that the Federal Reserve might increase interest rates further. Comments by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, last week suggested that the Fed was not finished with its tightening cycle.
 ''We're almost back to the guessing game of how much strength is there in the economy,'' Mr. Riley said. ''I think some people are concluding there's enough to allow the Fed to continue to tighten. I'm not of that belief but I think that's what the market's looking at at this moment.''
 Prices of Treasury securities slipped yesterday as investors worried that coming data on retail sales and inflation might suggest that the recent rally in bonds was overdone. In particular, traders were nervous that any unexpected rise in price pressures or unforeseen strength in consumer spending might prompt investors to rethink the logic of holding onto safe-haven government debt.
 Either event would give the Federal Reserve plenty of room to continue raising interest rates, thereby dashing the hopes for a pause that had fueled the monthlong rally. 
 By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 10/32, to 100 9/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.09 percent, from 4.05 percent on Friday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.247	98.422	High Rate	2.975	3.120	Investment Rate	3.039	3.214	Low Rate	2.940	3.070	Median Rate	2.965	3.105	Total applied for	$44,608,891	$38,438,478	Accepted	$24,964,179	$21,071,528	Noncompetitive	$1,664,179	$1,203,652	

Both issues are dated June 16, 2005. The three-month bills mature on Sept. 15, 2005 and the six-month bills mature on Dec. 15, 2005.

HEADLINE: The Old And The Rested

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Men in their 70's raced on bikes for 40 kilometers in this month's National Senior Games in Pittsburgh. A 68-year-old woman threw the discus 85 feet, and a 69-year-old man hurled the javelin nearly half the length of a football field. 
 Is it possible that people this age are still physically capable of putting in a full day's work at the office?
 I realize I'm being impolitic. In the Social Security debate, the notion of raising the retirement age is the elephant in the room, as Robin Toner and David Rosenbaum reported in The Times on Sunday. Both liberal and conservative economists favor the change, but politicians are terrified to even mention it to voters. 
 Americans now feel entitled to spend nearly a third of their adult lives in retirement. Their jobs are less physically demanding than their parents' were, but they're retiring younger and typically start collecting Social Security by age 62. Most could keep working -- fewer than 10 percent of people 65 to 75 are in poor health -- but, like Bartleby the Scrivener, they prefer not to.
 The problem isn't that Americans have gotten intrinsically lazier. They're just responding to a wonderfully intentioned system that in practice promotes greed and sloth. Social Security is widely thought of as a kumbaya program that unites Americans in caring for the elderly, but it actually creates ugly political battles among generations.
 With the help of groups like AARP, the elderly have learned to fight for the right to retire earlier and get bigger benefits than the previous generation -- all financed by making succeeding generations pay higher taxes than they ever did themselves. 
 The result is a system that burdens the young and creates perverse incentives for people to retire when they're still middle-aged. Once you've worked 35 years, more work often yields only a tiny increase in your benefits (sometimes none at all), but you still have to keep paying the onerous Social Security tax, which has more than doubled over the last half century.
 If the elderly were willing to work longer, there would be lower taxes on everyone and fewer struggling young families. There would be more national wealth and tax revenue available to help the needy, including people no longer able to work as well as the many elderly below the poverty line because they get so little Social Security.
 Getting that kind of system seems politically hopeless at the moment here, but it already exists in Chile. Its pension system has a stronger safety net for the older poor than America's (relative to each country's wages) and more incentives for people to work, because Chileans' contributions go directly into their own private accounts instead of a common pool like Social Security.
 Once Chileans accumulate enough money in the account to finance a pension that pays at least half their salary (which is better than what the typical American gets from Social Security), they can start collecting the pension and still go on working. In fact, they have an extra incentive to go on working because they keep more of their paychecks: elderly Chileans, unlike Americans, are freed of the obligation to continue making pension contributions. 
 The result has been a big change in working habits. Before the private-account system began in 1981, Chile had a traditional pension system going broke with the same problems as America and Europe: rising taxes on the young to pay for older workers who were retiring earlier and earlier. But under the new system, there's been a 30 percent increase in the labor force participation by workers in their 60's, according to two economists, Estelle James and Alejandra Cox Edwards.
 Best of all, Chileans who control their own private-account pensions don't have to count on politicians or groups like AARP to decide when they can retire. It's a personal choice, not a public battle, and the Chileans I interviewed had a saner attitude about retirement than the American baby boomers dreaming of retiring to decades of golf.
 A 57-year-old schoolteacher, Maria Clara Meyer, told me she was thinking of spending her 60's running her own tutoring program or setting up an ecotourism business in Chile. ''I'm a little tired of my teaching job,'' she said, ''but I'm not stupid, so I shall keep doing something. It's not healthy for you to stop working if you're still able.'' And not healthy for your country, either.

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Talks Moving Slowly, Chief Says

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, June 13 

 BODY:
Negotiations aimed at producing a new global trade pact are moving very slowly on trade in services, but a comprehensive deal remains possible next year, the director general of the World Trade Organization said here on Monday.
 Earlier rounds of global trade talks, including the Uruguay round that ended in 1994 and created the W.T.O. in 1995, focused mainly on trade in manufactured goods and agriculture, although the Uruguay round also covered some service industries like banking. 
 The current Doha round, which started in Doha, Qatar, in 2001, encompasses manufacturing and agriculture, but was in particular supposed to bring greater international competition to services like banking and stock brokerage, health care, education, transportation and telecommunications.
 Trade in services is especially important to countries like the United States where the bulk of the growth in employment has tended to be in services and not in manufacturing or agriculture. 
 But little progress has been made on services so far, with the exception of international voice and data communications, said Supachai Panitchpakdi, the director general of the W.T.O. The 148 member nations of the W.T.O. were supposed to submit by May their best offers to open up their services sectors to foreign companies, but only a handful have done so, he said.
 ''I don't think there is much on the table at the moment,'' Mr. Supachai said in a meeting here with foreign correspondents and local journalists.
 While Mr. Supachai voiced worries about the services negotiations, he expressed optimism that recent disputes over textile trade, pitting China against the United States and the European Union, would not disrupt the Doha round. China reached an agreement on Friday night to limit its textile and apparel exports to the European Union.
 The European Union has threatened to impose limits on Chinese exports but, unlike the United States, has not actually done so. Wu Yi, a vice premier of China, criticized the United States at a conference here on Monday for having taken what she characterized as an approach that was more unfair to Chinese companies.
 Trade ministers from the W.T.O. member nations are scheduled to meet here in mid-December in an attempt to resolve most of their remaining differences in the Doha round, with the goal of then reaching a comprehensive agreement in further meetings next year. 
 It is arguably easier to hold large demonstrations in Hong Kong than in the host city of any W.T.O. ministerial meeting since the Seattle gathering in 1999, which ended in violent street protests.
 Mr. Supachai, who will step down as director general in August, said that he had been told that 8,000 farmers would be coming from South Korea alone to protest at the Hong Kong meeting, but added that he still expected an orderly event. Pascal Lamy, the former European trade negotiator, will assume the leadership of the W.T.O. on Sept. 1.
 At the Pacific Basin Economic Council conference that brought Mr. Supachai and Ms. Wu to Hong Kong, several speakers were gloomier than Mr. Supachai about the prospects for significant progress here in the December talks and beyond.
 Norman Sorensen, the chairman of the Coalition of Service Industries, an American trade association, commented, ''The outlook for an agreement in services is not good.''
 Mr. Supachai said that services issues were proving difficult because most countries sent delegations from their trade ministries to the W.T.O. headquarters in Geneva, when the real decisions need to be made by their health, education, finance and transport ministries. ''Don't blame us in Geneva that we're not moving on services,'' he said.
 International voice and data communications have been an exception because developing countries have been willing to open their markets in the hope that multinational companies will invest substantially and bring in the latest equipment, allowing these countries to compete better in global markets. 
 Developed countries, already competitive in such services, have also been eager for more open competition in such services. Americans already pay relatively low rates for international calls, and competition could bring international rates down sharply for residents of other countries.
 But if little overall progress is made at the Hong Kong meeting, some countries may start withdrawing the offers they have already made, Mr. Supachai warned. ''It's not going to be the end of the world, but it would be costly,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Airbus Chief Says Order Ensures Jet Will Be Built

BYLINE: By DON PHILLIPS

DATELINE: PARIS, June 13 

 BODY:
Qatar Airways said Monday that it would buy 60 Airbus A350 long-range jets, a number that Noel Forgeard, chief executive of Airbus, said was enough to ensure that the plane would be built. 
 Qatar Airways also announced that it would buy 20 Boeing 777 wide-body jets, the first Boeing aircraft to enter Qatar's all-Airbus fleet. The Airbus order is worth $10 billion and Boeing's is $4.5 billion at list prices, though airlines rarely pay full price. 
 The Qatar order was good news for the A350, which had not received enough orders to move forward and was facing questions about possibly losing its government support. The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, Airbus's parent, deferred any formal announcement on the fate of the A350 until after the Paris Air Show, which began Monday. But Mr. Forgeard left little doubt that he thought the A350 would be built, even if all government subsidies for it were stopped. ''In any event, we have the money,'' Mr. Forgeard said Monday at a news conference at Le Bourget airport. ''That's not to say we would spit on any support.'' 
 That support is at the heart of a dispute between the United States and the European Union, which contends that Boeing receives tax breaks and research and development aid from the United States government that amount to the same thing. The case is now before the World Trade Organization. 
 Mr. Forgeard said it would take about 4.5 billion euros, or $5.4 billion, to develop and test-fly the A350. He added, ''We have far more than what's needed.'' 
 With the tentative commitment from Qatar Airways, orders for the A350 now total 90. John Leahy, Airbus's chief commercial officer, predicted that orders would top 100 before the end of the show on Sunday. 
 Qatar's order of A350's was a blow to the rival 787 Dreamliner of Boeing. Boeing did, however, announce that it would accelerate production of the 787, according to Bloomberg News. The company may accelerate production for its 2009-10 schedule.
 Qatar Airways also made clear that its order was not a firm commitment. 
 ''Negotiations are under way with both Airbus and Boeing, but subject to the resolution of certain important outstanding issues with each manufacturer, Qatar Airways will shortly commit to the purchase of a large fleet of Airbus A350 and Boeing 777 aircraft,'' it said, without specifying what the issues were. 
 Qatar Airways said it planned to triple in size over five years as it moves to capitalize on a boom in development and tourism in the Middle East.

HEADLINE: Africans Press Bush to Speed Aid Program

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13 

 BODY:
The leaders of five African nations confronted President Bush on Monday about what they said was the slow pace at which the United States is releasing aid to poor nations, and got a pledge from Mr. Bush to speed things up.
 The presidents of Botswana, Ghana, Mozambique, Namibia and Niger visited Mr. Bush at the White House as part of the administration's effort to promote democracy and economic development in Africa and to highlight the policies it has pursued to reduce poverty and disease there. 
 The leaders -- all of whose countries held democratic elections last year -- generally praised the United States for trying to do more to assist Africa. But they said they were disappointed that the administration had not done more to accelerate disbursements of aid through the Millennium Challenge Account, the White House's primary channel for dispensing money to poor countries that show committment to democracy and sound economic policies. 
 Until Monday, only one country, Madagascar, had won final approval for aid under the program. On Monday afternoon, the government approved a second country, Honduras. Madagascar's deal, which was signed in April, qualifies it for $110 million in aid over the next four years. Honduras is eligible for $215 million over five years. Nicaragua and Cape Verde are on the verge of signing final agreements.
 Almost none of the money has been disbursed. Of the five nations whose leaders met with Mr. Bush, two, Mozambique and Ghana, are applying for help under the program. Niger has yet to meet the conditions for eligibility. Botswana and Namibia have income levels above the cutoff for participation in the program.
 The African leaders ''complained bitterly'' about the slow pace of the talks and the disbursement of money, President Festus Mogae of Botswana told reporters. He said Mr. Bush had assured them the United States would resolve the logjam.
 ''One thing we discussed was the Millennium Challenge Account, and I assured the leaders we will work harder and faster to certify countries,'' so that they ''can see the benefit of this really important piece of legislation and funding,'' Mr. Bush said in remarks after the meeting.

HEADLINE: A First Step on African Aid

 BODY:
The Bush administration took a modest but important step in the right direction recently when it reached agreement with six other rich countries to ease the burden of debt in Africa. The arrangement would eliminate $40 billion of debt owed by 18 of the world's poorest countries, including 14 in Africa. 
President Bush deserves credit for agreeing to provide additional money to make sure the World Bank does not go out of business when the payments stop coming. The bank and the International Monetary Fund are the largest creditors to poor countries.
 But enough patting on the back; the real mountain remains to be climbed. Mr. Bush has yet to sign on to the meat of the proposal by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain to increase aid to Africa by $25 billion a year. That is the amount that Britain and many development economists say is essential to achieve the United Nations' goal of halving global poverty by 2015. Indeed, the debt relief package actually comes to the relatively small sum of about $1.5 billion a year, not all for Africa. 
 The big summit in Scotland, where the rich countries will take up Mr. Blair's Africa proposal, is in three weeks. Britain, France and Germany have already agreed to timetables for increasing their aid to poor countries to 0.7 percent of national income by 2015. America, which gives a microscopic 0.16 percent, has yet to do the same. President Bush, who played host to five democratically elected African presidents yesterday with his usual rhetoric about spreading wealth, hope and opportunity in the world's most wretched region, must move beyond platitudes and step up to the plate in a meaningful way on increased aid to Africa.

HEADLINE: Raped, Kidnapped and Silenced

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
No wonder the Pakistan government can't catch Osama bin Laden. It is too busy harassing, detaining -- and now kidnapping -- a gang-rape victim for daring to protest and for planning a visit to the United States.
 Last fall I wrote about Mukhtaran Bibi, a woman who was sentenced by a tribal council in Pakistan to be gang-raped because of an infraction supposedly committed by her brother. Four men raped Ms. Mukhtaran, then village leaders forced her to walk home nearly naked in front of a jeering crowd of 300. 
 Ms. Mukhtaran was supposed to have committed suicide. Instead, with the backing of a local Islamic leader, she fought back and testified against her persecutors. Six were convicted.
 Then Ms. Mukhtaran, who believed that the best way to overcome such abuses was through better education, used her compensation money to start two schools in her village, one for boys and the other for girls. She went out of her way to enroll the children of her attackers in the schools, showing that she bore no grudges.
 Readers of my column sent in more than $133,000 for her. Mercy Corps, a U.S. aid organization, has helped her administer the money, and she has expanded the schools, started a shelter for abused women and bought a van that is used as an ambulance for the area. She has also emerged as a ferocious spokeswoman against honor killings, rapes and acid attacks on women. (If you want to help her, please don't send checks to me but to Mercy Corps, with ''Mukhtaran Bibi'' in the memo line: 3015 S.W. First, Portland, Ore. 97201.)
 A group of Pakistani-Americans invited Ms. Mukhtaran to visit the U.S. starting this Saturday (see www.4anaa.org). Then a few days ago, the Pakistani government went berserk.
 On Thursday, the authorities put Ms. Mukhtaran under house arrest -- to stop her from speaking out. In phone conversations in the last few days, she said that when she tried to step outside, police pointed their guns at her. To silence her, the police cut off her land line.
 After she had been detained, a court ordered her attackers released, putting her life in jeopardy. That happened on a Friday afternoon, when the courts do not normally operate, and apparently was a warning to Ms. Mukhtaran to shut up. Instead, Ms. Mukhtaran continued her protests by cellphone. But at dawn yesterday the police bustled her off, and there's been no word from her since. Her cellphone doesn't answer.
 Asma Jahangir, a Pakistani lawyer who is head of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, said she had learned that Ms. Mukhtaran was taken to Islamabad, furiously berated and told that President Pervez Musharraf was very angry with her. She was led sobbing to detention at a secret location. She is barred from contacting anyone, including her lawyer.
 ''She's in their custody, in illegal custody,'' Ms. Jahangir said. ''They have gone completely crazy.''
 Even if Ms. Mukhtaran were released, airports have been alerted to bar her from leaving the country. According to Dawn, a Karachi newspaper, the government took this step, ''fearing that she might malign Pakistan's image.''
 Excuse me, but Ms. Mukhtaran, a symbol of courage and altruism, is the best hope for Pakistan's image. The threat to Pakistan's image comes from President Musharraf for all this thuggish behavior.
 I've been sympathetic to Mr. Musharraf till now, despite his nuclear negligence, partly because he's cooperated in the war on terrorism and partly because he has done a good job nurturing Pakistan's economic growth, which in the long run is probably the best way to fight fundamentalism. So even when Mr. Musharraf denied me visas all this year, to block me from visiting Ms. Mukhtaran again and writing a follow-up column, I bit my tongue.
 But now President Musharraf has gone nuts. 
 ''This is all because they think they have the support of the U.S. and can get away with murder,'' Ms. Jahangir said. Indeed, on Friday, just as all this was happening, President Bush received Pakistan's foreign minister in the White House and praised President Musharraf's ''bold leadership.''
 So, Mr. Bush, how about asking Mr. Musharraf to focus on finding Osama, instead of kidnapping rape victims who speak out? And invite Ms. Mukhtaran to the Oval Office -- to show that Americans stand not only with generals who seize power, but also with ordinary people of extraordinary courage.

HEADLINE: Australia and U.S. Barring Him, Chinese Says

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, June 14 

 BODY:
The high-ranking Chinese diplomat who defected here two weeks ago only to be rebuffed by the Australian government says he also sought political asylum at the United States Embassy, and was turned away there as well.
 The defector, Chen Yonglin, a 37-year-old career diplomat, said in his first interview with a foreign journalist that he had called the American Embassy in Canberra and followed up with a fax. 
 ''My wife, my 6-year old daughter and I are now in a desperate status,'' Mr. Chen wrote on June 4 in imperfect English in his faxed appeal, which he showed to The New York Times. ''I have no choice but seeking the only hope of political asylum of the United States.'' He gave his cellphone number. 
 Later that day, Mr. Chen said in the interview on Monday, he received a call from an American Embassy official, whose name he could not recall, who told him the United States could do nothing for him.
 Why Mr. Chen was dismissed without even an interview is not clear. Generally, in the past, defectors from Communist countries, whether athletes, dancers or diplomats, have been protected and assisted with their asylum claims.
 A spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Canberra would not comment on Mr. Chen's case. Nor would a State Department spokesman in Washington, Noel C. Clay, who said it was a longstanding policy not to comment on individual requests ''in order to protect any possible applicants, their families, and the integrity and confidentiality of the process.''
 Since he walked out of the Chinese Consulate here on May 26, Mr. Chen has created a political storm in Australia, with both conservatives and liberals criticizing the government for turning away a diplomat who has suggested that he has valuable intelligence to offer and who has approached the West as a vocal critic of China's human rights record. 
 Some politicians and commentators say Australia had put economic interests -- China is a major buyer of its natural resources -- ahead of concerns about human rights. Others have been skeptical of Mr. Chen's claims, saying he is overstating them to avoid being sent home. 
 But Mr. Chen's credentials have not been challenged, and few doubt that he would be punished if he returned to China. He held the title of a political first secretary and says his principal duties were to spy on Falun Gong and pro-democracy activists.
 Since his case has come to light here, Mr. Chen and his wife, Jin Ping, and their daughter, Fang Rong, have lived in virtual hiding and are now applying to remain in Australia under a ''protective visa.'' 
 Ms. Jin, also present during the interview, said she had supported her husband's decision to defect, which the couple described as a result of years of growing disillusionment with the Chinese authorities. 
 Each had been a student activist in the late 1980's, he at a university in Beijing, she while studying law in Shanghai. They were not married at the time. After the Tiananmen Square demonstrations were put down in 1989, they were sent separately for ''re-education,'' they said. 
 Ms. Jin said she was assigned to work in a family planning program in a rural area. One woman she tended to was eight months pregnant with her second child when forced into a hospital for an abortion, she said. The woman escaped, was caught, and an operation performed. The baby boy, born alive, was then killed by the doctors, she said. 
 The couple were accompanied during the interview by Jennifer Zeng, who acted as an interpreter when the couple needed help with their English. Ms. Zeng is a Falun Gong practitioner and the author of ''Witnessing History: One Woman's Fight for Freedom and Falun Gong.'' 
 Mr. Chen said he was not a member of Falun Gong, but he is clearly sympathetic to the group. In his letter to Australian authorities seeking asylum, Mr. Chen wrote, ''Falun Gong may be a cult, but its practitioners are a social vulnerable group and innocent people.'' 
 Mr. Chen said his father was accused of antirevolutionary activity during the Cultural Revolution, taken away and beaten for two weeks before he died. As a boy, Mr. Chen said he raised the family's pigs, goats and chickens to help his mother, a primary school teacher, provide for the family.
 He decided to join the Foreign Service, he said, for the simple reason that it would be steady employment. He started with a menial job in the Foreign Ministry. When there was an opening for a post in Fiji, he took it. ''I was quite eager to leave that environment inside China,'' he said. ''There was no freedom.''
 By the time he was posted to Sydney in 2001, he said he had lost hope that China's government might change. His job here was to monitor the activities of dissidents, and almost from the beginning, it weighed on his conscience. ''It's dirty work,'' he said. He was scheduled to leave in August.

HEADLINE: 2 European Giants Betting Banks Can Blur Borders 

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, June 14 

 BODY:
UniCredito's chief executive, Alessandro Profumo, is betting a sterling reputation and nearly 20 billion euros' worth of his bank's stock on an unproven idea. 
 With the purchase of the HVB Group, Mr. Profumo is wagering that one financial firm can successfully straddle Europe, serving people and companies with vastly different cultures, customs and languages. 
 The deal, which was reached Sunday, has already received applause from investors, analysts and other bank executives around Europe. Unicredito's stock rose after the deal was announced, and already financial markets are buzzing about where the next cross-border banking deal may happen. 
 But, as both Mr. Profumo and HVB's chief executive, Dieter Rampl, acknowledged in an interview Tuesday, the easy work is behind them. ''For sure, the most difficult part of the deal will be cultural integration,'' Mr. Profumo said. ''It's important to avoid anyone feeling like there is a loser and a winner.'' 
 That may be tough. The deal unites one of Europe's most successful banks, UniCredito, with one of its least profitable, HVB. The combined institution will have more than 125,000 employees, offices from Milan to Warsaw, a presence in 19 countries, and be larger than the Swiss behemoth, the Credit Suisse Group.
 The only banks based in the United States that would be larger are Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America. As Citibank proved when it merged with Salomon Smith Barney, even integrating two institutions in the same country and on the same financial footing can mean years of battles over management control. 
 Mr. Profumo, 48, a former McKinsey consultant who created Unicredito by pulling together seven domestic banks, wins high marks among European executives. He's ''a straight talker, good listener and a valuable source of advice,'' said Roberto Quarta, a partner with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and chairman of Italtel Holding, an Italian telecommunications company. 
 Many were skeptical that Mr. Profumo could pull together the handful of local banks that made up UniCredito, particularly in the complex Italian business environment, Mr. Quarta said. But Mr. Profumo has made the bank a ''model of governance for the Italian banking system.'' 
 On Tuesday, Mr. Rampl and Mr. Profumo seemed to have integrated themselves, at least. They showed the results of long hours spent together putting the finishing touches on the deal, occasionally completing each other's sentences. 
 Mr. Profumo, who will become chief executive of the combined entity and is generally seen as the brain behind the deal, left questions of strategy to Mr. Rampl, occasionally offering him a spontaneous encouraging pat on the back. 
 The two declined to elaborate on how the deal came together, except to say they had often spoken about combining. These talks became more serious at the beginning of this year, and they met several times to discuss the idea, Mr. Rampl said. The German banking market knows more about international cooperation than it does about domestic cooperation, he said, and he and Mr. Profumo ''had the same vision.'' 
 That shared vision lies in the banks' plans outside their home markets. Together they will be the dominant bank in Central and Eastern European countries, like Poland and Bulgaria, and a big player in some markets that have yet to become part of Europe, like Turkey. 
 Despite the recent upheaval in Europe that came just as they were putting the deal together -- both France and the Netherlands voted against ratifying the European constitution -- both bankers insist they never had second thoughts. ''We feel we can be successful through economies of scale,'' and create a European player, Mr. Profumo said. 
 European investors are lauding the vision. The deal is ''not the typical, United States-style short-term'' deal done to plump up earnings, said Guy de Blonay, manager of New Star Asset Management's global financials fund, which has $:17 million in assets under management. Mr. Profumo is ''looking at strategic positioning for the future,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Turbulent Bolivia Is Producing More Cocaine, the U.N. Reports

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, June 14 

 BODY:
Cocaine production has shot up in this politically unstable country, the United Nations said Tuesday, warning that international assistance is immediately needed to wean poor farmers from growing drug crops.
 Eradication efforts bankrolled by the United States had until recently wiped out much of the coca in Bolivia and Peru, the two countries that in the 1990's supplied much of the raw material used to produce the world's cocaine. But in Bolivia, the eradication has come with a high social cost, with displaced coca farmers joining protests that led two presidents to quit in the past 20 months, including Carlos Mesa last week. 
 In its annual survey of coca production, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says the acreage devoted to coca was up 17 percent from 2003 to 2004, while cocaine output rose 35 percent to 107 tons. The numbers raise questions about the effectiveness of antidrug programs, and they suggest a link between the continuing political turbulence and increased coca production. 
 ''We are very concerned about the situation in Bolivia,'' Antonio Maria Costa, director of the antidrug office, told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday in releasing the report. ''We strongly believe that the international community should engage in massive support to Bolivia.''
 The report showed that neighboring Peru registered a 14 percent increase in coca plantings and a 23 percent rise in cocaine production. The only good news, the United Nations said, was that cocaine production in Colombia, the world's main source of the drug, had fallen.
 Much of the growth in coca cultivation in Bolivia has come in the Yungas region, where Mr. Mesa's government prohibited forced eradication for fear of angering organized cocaleros, or coca farmers. It is an approach unlikely to change with the new president, Eduardo Rodriguez, who faces simmering anger from a range of antigovernment forces, including the cocaleros.
 Coca farmers from the Yungas, where the United States would like to spray, said they would fight if efforts were made to destroy their crops. In the Yungas, many farmers grow coca for traditional use, as permitted by Bolivian law, though American and Bolivian officials say much of the new growth goes toward drug trafficking. ''This would be like taking our daily bread,'' said Valentin Quispe, 42, a farmer who on Tuesday was selling his coca leaves in Bolivia's main coca market in La Paz. ''We have to defend our source of income, to the last consequence.'' 
 Jeffrey D. Sachs, a Columbia University economist who has advised Bolivian governments, said the problem was that the United States had done little to provide real options to coca farmers whose livelihoods were wiped out by Bolivian forces under American supervision. Indeed, Mr. Sachs noted, rising anger against the eradication and the Americans helped make Evo Morales, the leader of the cocaleros, a national figure who now has a shot at winning the presidency in the next election.
 ''If you want to deal with this in a sustainable way, you need to have a sustainable approach,'' Mr. Sachs said by phone from New York when told of the spike in coca production. ''If you think you can solve this militarily, then you've got it wrong.''
 Mr. Sachs says alternative development programs financed by the United States amount to a ''ludicrously small investment'' that cannot replace coca farming. The State Department contends that the programs, which total $212 million over a generation, have helped thousands of families switch to legal crops.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Prices and Retail Sales Decline

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15 

 BODY:
Wholesale prices fell at the fastest pace in more than two years in May, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday, helping to ease concerns that the big increases in energy costs in recent months might lead to inflation troubles.
 In another report, the Commerce Department said retail sales in May fell 0.5 percent, the first decline in nine months. The decline was attributed to unusually cool weather and was not seen as evidence that consumer spendingmight wane. 
 The Producer Price Index, a principal measure of wholesale prices, fell 0.6 percent last month, well beyond the 0.2 percent decline that analysts had been expecting. The Labor Department is to report on consumer prices Wednesday, and analysts predict a 0.1 percent rise, compared with a 0.5 percent increase in April.
 Three-quarters of the May decline in producer prices was attributed to lower energy costs, which were down 3.5 percent. Wholesale gasoline prices fell 9.9 percent, and home heating oil at the wholesale level was down 7.8 percent. 
 Food costs were also lower in May. A 0.3 percent decrease in food was led by a 15 percent drop in the wholesale cost of vegetables, which offset a 19.5 percent jump in egg prices.
 The core inflation rate -- excluding food and energy prices -- was contained, edging up 0.1 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent increase in April. The price of cigarettes was up 0.8 percent; the price of passenger cars fell 0.2 percent; and computer prices were down 4.8 percent.
 Over the last 12 months, producer prices have risen 3.5 percent; excluding food and energy, the increase has been 2.6 percent. 
 In retail sales, the sales of motor vehicles fell 1.6 percent in April. Demand at clothing stores was down 0.8 percent. Sales at gas stations fell 1.6 percent, reflecting a decline in pump prices during the month.
 Sales at furniture stores posted a 0.4 percent increase, and those at hardware stores rose 0.5 percent.
 Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors, commented that ''after having emptied their wallets in April, consumers took a bit of a vacation in May and retailers felt the pain.''
 Cool weather reduced sales of summer clothing, though with temperatures now sharply higher in parts of the country, many economists predicted a rebound in June.

HEADLINE: All Are Together, and Everyone Is Alone

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
If you compose plays with the same ease and frequency that most of us scribble grocery lists, you run the risk of being taken for granted. The British playwright and director Alan Ayckbourn now has 68 plays to his name, so he can't expect each offering to be met with a fanfare of praise, even when the play happens to merit such a greeting, as is the gratifying case with Ayckbourn No. 67.
 The play, called ''Private Fears in Public Places,'' has sneaked into New York almost unheralded, at the 59E59 Theaters, as the jewel in the crown of the Brits Off Broadway festival. A minor-key comedy about six Londoners leading lives of quiet desperation, it is rueful, funny, touching and altogether wonderful. It runs only through July 3, which would break my heart if Sir Alan and his fine company hadn't already done the job. 
The production marks the United States debut of Sir Alan's repertory troupe from the Stephen Joseph Theater in Scarborough, England, where virtually all of his plays have had their premieres. (He has been the artistic director there since 1971.) The sensitivity and simplicity of the performances on view here inspire the fanciful thought that Scarborough should be anointed a mecca for admirers of first-rate, frill-free acting. I'm ready to make a pilgrimage if this production represents the company's everyday standard.
 Sir Alan is a comic playwright; he has often been called, half-disparagingly, Britain's Neil Simon. But he has written in a wide variety of comic modes, from traditional farces to comedies of manners to ruminative character studies. In his weaker plays he has often relied on gimmickry to gussy up rote essays on love and other domestic problems of the British middle classes. ''House'' and ''Garden,'' for instance, the last Ayckbourn plays to be seen in a major New York production, were performed in adjoining theaters by the same cast simultaneously.
 But there is virtually no artifice in ''Private Fears in Public Places.'' (''Private Lives'' would have been a more apt and economical title, but that was taken.) A delicate play with the transparent texture of a piece of chamber music, it comprises dozens of brief scenes, most with no obvious comic payoff. Some are wordless tableaus: a woman sitting alone in a cafe, shrinking sadly into a cappuccino cup, a man moored in an armchair before a flickering television screen, lost in wonder at what he sees before him.
 For audiences used to comedy that grabs you by the throat, if not in more private places, patience may be needed, but it is richly rewarded. By the end of this intermissionless evening, these quiet, loosely overlapping scenes gradually cohere to compose a collective portrait of contemporary urban isolation that feels uncommonly wise and tender and true.
 The characters are two-a-penny types drawn with fine brush strokes. Stewart (Paul Kemp) is a meek real estate agent who shares a flat with his sister Imogen (Sarah Moyle), a receptionist. Imogen, a little lumpen and, like Stewart, sliding inexorably into middle age, answers personal ads, disguising her generally unsuccessful forays as nights out with the girls. On a lucky evening she meets the handsome, hunky Dan (Paul Thornley), an ex-army officer who was recently kicked out of his flat by his frustrated girlfriend, Nicola (Melanie Gutteridge). She's tired of waiting for him to get his life in gear.
 The links between characters are forged by everyday circumstance, not the mechanics of dramaturgy. Until Dan and Nicola separated, they were shown apartments by Stewart, for instance, while Dan's days before and after the breakup are spent exchanging desultory chat with Ambrose (Adrian McLoughlin), the barman at a nearby hotel. The play's sixth character, Sir Alan's most peculiar, is Stewart's prim assistant, Charlotte (Alexandra Mathie), who moonlights as a caregiver for the elderly and is hired by Ambrose to spend nights tending to his abusive, bedbound father.
 Charlotte's beatific smile and her ever-at-hand Bible belie a secret life that she accidentally -- or perhaps not accidentally -- divulges to Stewart when she lends him a videotape of an inspirational program she admires. Stewart, armchair-bound and pushing his grocery-store dinner around the plate, lets the tape run on, only to hear the uplifting tones pointing the path to happiness give way to moans of sexual delight: Can it be that Charlotte has a taste for hardcore porn?
 The ramifications of this revelation provide some of the play's more pointedly comic moments, but Sir Alan never allows his humor to warp the humanity of his characters. Charlotte's dilemma -- the inner battle she wages daily between her sexual impulses and the flesh-denying dictates of her beliefs -- is merely a more absurd version of the conflicts besetting all the characters. Each struggles with the problem of how and when secret anxieties and hopes should be divulged to friends, lovers and strangers, what must be risked to forge the connections that sustain life and give it richness.
 Sir Alan's flawless cast amplifies the emotional impact of his writing in variously subtle and hilarious ways. All of the performers here respect and understand the depth in the spareness of his writing, the economy that is a welcome consequence of his long experience as a playwright. Sir Alan may have nothing left to prove, but clearly he has much yet to say.

 CORRECTION:
A theater review on Wednesday about ''Private Fears in Public Places,'' a play by Alan Ayckbourn at the 59E59 Theaters, misstated the precedent for performances in the United States by his repertory troupe from the Stephen Joseph Theater in Scarborough, England. It has in fact performed in the United States; this production is not its United States debut.

HEADLINE: Let's Talk About Iraq

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Ever since Iraq's remarkable election, the country has been descending deeper and deeper into violence. But no one in Washington wants to talk about it. Conservatives don't want to talk about it because, with a few exceptions, they think their job is just to applaud whatever the Bush team does. Liberals don't want to talk about Iraq because, with a few exceptions, they thought the war was wrong and deep down don't want the Bush team to succeed. As a result, Iraq is drifting sideways and the whole burden is being carried by our military. The rest of the country has gone shopping, which seems to suit Karl Rove just fine.
 Well, we need to talk about Iraq. This is no time to give up -- this is still winnable -- but it is time to ask: What is our strategy? This question is urgent because Iraq is inching toward a dangerous tipping point -- the point where the key communities begin to invest more energy in preparing their own militias for a scramble for power -- when everything falls apart, rather than investing their energies in making the hard compromises within and between their communities to build a unified, democratizing Iraq. 
 Our core problem in Iraq remains Donald Rumsfeld's disastrous decision -- endorsed by President Bush -- to invade Iraq on the cheap. From the day the looting started, it has been obvious that we did not have enough troops there. We have never fully controlled the terrain. Almost every problem we face in Iraq today -- the rise of ethnic militias, the weakness of the economy, the shortages of gas and electricity, the kidnappings, the flight of middle-class professionals -- flows from not having gone into Iraq with the Powell Doctrine of overwhelming force. 
 Yes, yes, I know we are training Iraqi soldiers by the battalions, but I don't think this is the key. Who is training the insurgent-fascists? Nobody. And yet they are doing daily damage to U.S. and Iraqi forces. Training is overrated, in my book. Where you have motivated officers and soldiers, you have an army punching above its weight. Where you don't have motivated officers and soldiers, you have an army punching a clock.
 Where do you get motivated officers and soldiers? That can come only from an Iraqi leader and government that are seen as representing all the country's main factions. So far the Iraqi political class has been a disappointment. The Kurds have been great. But the Sunni leaders have been shortsighted at best and malicious at worst, fantasizing that they are going to make a comeback to power through terror. As for the Shiites, their spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, has been a positive force on the religious side, but he has no political analog. No Shiite Hamid Karzai has emerged. 
 ''We have no galvanizing figure right now,'' observed Kanan Makiya, the Iraqi historian who heads the Iraq Memory Foundation. ''Sistani's counterpart on the democratic front has not emerged. Certainly, the Americans made many mistakes, but at this stage less and less can be blamed on them. The burden is on Iraqis. And we still have not risen to the magnitude of the opportunity before us.''
 I still don't know if a self-sustaining, united and democratizing Iraq is possible. I still believe it is a vital U.S. interest to find out. But the only way to find out is to create a secure environment. It is very hard for moderate, unifying, national leaders to emerge in a cauldron of violence. 
 Maybe it is too late, but before we give up on Iraq, why not actually try to do it right? Double the American boots on the ground and redouble the diplomatic effort to bring in those Sunnis who want to be part of the process and fight to the death those who don't. As Stanford's Larry Diamond, author of an important new book on the Iraq war, ''Squandered Victory,'' puts it, we need ''a bold mobilizing strategy'' right now. That means the new Iraqi government, the U.S. and the U.N. teaming up to widen the political arena in Iraq, energizing the constitution-writing process and developing a communications-diplomatic strategy that puts our bloodthirsty enemies on the defensive rather than us. The Bush team has been weak in all these areas. For weeks now, we haven't even had ambassadors in Iraq, Afghanistan or Jordan. 
 We've already paid a huge price for the Rumsfeld Doctrine -- ''Just enough troops to lose.'' Calling for more troops now, I know, is the last thing anyone wants to hear. But we are fooling ourselves to think that a decent, normal, forward-looking Iraqi politics or army is going to emerge from a totally insecure environment, where you can feel safe only with your own tribe.

HEADLINE: A Crossover Hit For a Global Star

BYLINE: By JOAN NATHAN

 BODY:
AT 8 a.m., Elly Hushour hoists a bright blue flag with a white goat over her Greenmarket stand.
 Until last year, Ms. Hushour, 47, a farmer from Nazareth, Pa., sold cheese and yogurt made from the milk of her Saanen goats, the same breed that Heidi of the storybook tended for her grandfather in the Swiss Alps. Then she recognized a growing market for goats themselves, or rather, goat shanks, shoulders and so on. 
 At first she drew customers from the various immigrant neighborhoods around her stand at the Fort Greene market in Brooklyn, where she is open on Saturdays. Then the crowds at the Union Square Market, where she goes on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, started buying too. 
 ''I have been quite surprised and pleased at the response to goat meat from the general public,'' she said. ''It has been a learning experience for me.'' 
 Driven mainly by the growing number of immigrants for whom goat was the everyday meat in their home countries, demand for fresh goat increased threefold from 1991 to 2002, said Dr. Tatiana Stanton, a expert on goat husbandry at Cornell University. According to the Agriculture Department, the number of goats slaughtered in the United States annually quintupled from 1980 to 2002, growing to 500,000 animals in 2002, the most recent year for which full figures are available.
 Goat is just beginning to be found in some mainstream supermarkets here. But it has been showing up more and more on restaurant menus. Zak Pelaccio, chef at 5 Ninth in the meatpacking district, stops by Ms. Hushour's stand for goat shoulder, which he braises in goat's milk that he also buys from her. 
 Lydia Ratcliff, a Vermont farmer whose co-op delivers goat meat to restaurants in New York, including L'Impero, San Domenico and Chanterelle, said she has learned to provide for different styles of cooking. 
 ''Greeks and Italians like small nursing kids,'' Ms. Ratcliff said. ''They are especially interested in having goats at Easter night. Jamaicans buy bigger, older goats, which they cut up and turn into curry.''
 Steve Bogart, chef at the Single Pebble, a Chinese restaurant in Burlington, Vt., and one of Ms. Ratcliff's customers, serves young goat leg braised with soy sauce, ginger, star anise, cinnamon bark and rice wine. 
 ''This is a very popular way of cooking in northern China, where the climate is colder and people like heartier food,'' he said. ''The texture is similar to young lamb, has more flavor than veal, doesn't have that lamb-y taste, and it sells out every time I have it on the menu.'' 
 In East Los Angeles, birrierias del chivo, which serve goat, have become as established as hamburger stands in other neighborhoods. A birria is technically a stew or slow roast made of goat, but here tortillas are stuffed with slowly roasted goat, chopped onion, cilantro and a hot red sauce from Jalisco in central Mexico. 
 ''Birrierias have gone from being novelties to real institutions,'' said Jonathan Gold, a writer for Gourmet and L.A. Weekly. ''In the 80's there were one or two of these birrierias. Now there are hundreds.''
 Scott Conant was the first New York chef to make goat a signature dish at a high-end restaurant when he served capretto -- roast baby goat -- at L'Impero three years ago. The capretto was a dish his Italian grandmother made when he was growing up in the Bronx.
 ''I would roast the whole kid the way she did,'' Mr. Conant said. ''But it's tough to cook a whole goat in a New York kitchen.'' 
 L'Impero is in Tudor City, near the United Nations, and his international clientele made goat liver a best-seller. ''At first Americans came to taste for the novelty,'' Mr. Conant said. ''Now they come because they like it.'' 
 At Maestro, in the Ritz-Carlton in Tysons Corner, Va., which has many Muslim customers, the chef, Fabio Trabocchi, receives four whole baby goats every week from a farmer in Lakewood, Pa., who uses a halal slaughterhouse, which kills animals according to Muslim law. Mr. Trabocchi butchers them at his restaurant.
 He marinates the upper legs in rosemary, garlic, wine and olive oil, then braises them in the oven, after briefly smoking them over hay in the pot.
 ''The meat has to be cooked gently to tenderize it,'' said Mr. Trabocchi, who grew up on the Adriatic coast of Italy, where goat meat was common. Like many of his dishes, his traditionally braised goat is elevated from its humble origins -- foie gras is stuffed between slices of the tender meat.
 Sue Torres features goat wrapped in avocado leaves, rubbed with chili, and steamed in beer at her restaurant Suenos in Chelsea. 
 ''The first time I ate goat was in Oaxaca,'' Ms. Torres said. ''It was the most succulent dish I had ever tasted. The goats were wrapped in all kinds of corn husks, banana and avocado leaves, with anise.'' Then they were steam-roasted for 12 hours, she said.
 Most of the goats for markets on the East Coast come through the New Holland Goat Auction in Pennsylvania, the second largest in the country after the one in San Angelo, Tex. Farmers from Tennessee, Kentucky and the Carolinas sell their sheep, cattle and goats at New Holland.
 ''Goats used to be a novelty, only for sale as pets at Easter,'' said Barb Riehls, who has been working in the office at the auction house for 38 years. ''Now we auction over 1,000 a week.''
 At a recent auction, held in an old wooden ring encircled by bleachers, bearded Amish workers in black hats herded in goats and sheep while Caribbean, West African and Middle Eastern brokers from New York bid on the animals.
 ''Every year there are more requests for goats,'' said Jimmy Ziyadah, of ZD Quality Meat, a wholesaler in Paterson, N.J. Mr. Ziyadah makes the five-hour round trip to the auction twice a week, buying about 200 to 250 lambs, 25 cows, and 60 to 70 goats per week. He slaughters them in Newark, then takes them to halal markets in the metropolitan New York area. 
 When he can't get all that the demand requires at the auction, he will travel as far as livestock auctions in Leesburg, Va., or Greencastle, Pa. 
 ''My customers want whole, fresh meat that they can cut up themselves,'' he said.
 Vinny Ahluwalia gets goat for Tandoori Hut, his restaurant in Richmond Hill, Queens, from the nearby Atlantic Halal Meat on Atlantic Avenue. His most popular goat dish is goat kadhi, a stew of baby goat, tomatoes, chopped onions and green pepper. 
 ''We've been eating it since we were small kids.'' Mr. Ahluwalia said. 
 But many Indian chefs at more mainstream restaurants are more cautious with goat.
 Rajesh Bhardwaj, an owner of the Cafe Spice chain of Indian restaurants, makes a delicious goat stew, fragrant with coriander, cinnamon and tomatoes. 
 ''If my clientele were 100 percent Indian, I would put it on the menu, but I have an American clientele,'' Mr. Bhardwaj said. ''It just doesn't work, so we substitute lamb.'' 
 Although Mr. Bhardwaj, like most chefs, prefers young goat or kid, many Indians prefer older goats for their flavorful, long-simmering stews.
 Today most American farmers raise the Boer goat, first bred in the 1930's by South African farmers, and first imported to the United States in 1992. Before that, the few Americans who ate goat ate buck dairy goat kids or a breed of Spanish origin that entered Texas from Mexico. 
 Some goat breeds are raised for mohair and cashmere. But an end to federal subsidies for farmers raising goats for fiber, beginning in 1993, led many of those farmers to switch to meat goats.
 Most of the goats eaten in the New York area are raised in Texas, North and South Carolina, Oklahoma and Tennessee, but many more come from farms throughout the Northeast. 
 And as the market for tobacco shrinks, some tobacco farmers have been encouraged to convert their fields into grazing land for goats. ''It has been a cooperative effort to wean farmers off the tobacco production,'' said Jean-Marie Luginbuhl, associate professor of crop and animal science at North Carolina State University. ''We can use goats instead of pesticides to remove noxious vegetation from our land. They eat the best of everything that is nutritious for us. And they will always be free range because they are climbers.''
 Inna Kinney, president of the Economic and Community Development Institute of Columbus, Ohio, has used goat to ease the transition for a large group of Somali immigrants who have settled there by building a halal slaughterhouse.
 ''The leaders of the Somali community came to us and said that the mainstay of their diet is goat and they can't get it,'' she said. 
 And while those long accustomed to goat have helped drive its appeal, newcomers have their own ideas. ''My customers have come back and told me how to cook it,'' Ms. Hushour said. ''They have given me recipes, which I share with my customers.''

BRAISED GOAT WITH HERBS
Adapted from Fabio Trabocchi
Time: 3 1/2 hours plus overnight refrigeration

1 to 2 goat legs, about 7 pounds total

For the marinade:
Salt and pepper to taste
2 cups white wine
1 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 head of garlic, split from root to stem
3 large stems rosemary
1/2 cup fresh thyme leaves
2 bay leaves

For the braising liquid:
4 tablespoons butter
1 large onion, peeled and diced
Remaining half head of garlic, unpeeled
2 cups dry white wine
5 cups veal or beef stock
3 large stems rosemary (about 1/2 cup)
1/2 cup fresh thyme leaves.
 1. Lightly season legs with salt and pepper. Place legs with other ingredients for marinade in a sealed plastic bag or bags and leave in refrigerator overnight. 
 2. Remove from marinade and pat dry; discard marinade. Heat butter over medium high heat in a Dutch oven or other casserole large enough to hold goat meat until it starts to sizzle. Add goat legs and brown slowly over medium low heat, basting frequently for about 10 minutes until golden brown on each side. Remove legs and drain off all but a few tablespoons of butter. 
 3. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Put onion and garlic in Dutch oven. Saute over medium heat until onions are soft and translucent, adding more butter if needed. Pour in wine, bring to a boil and reduce by half, about 10 minutes. Add enough stock to almost cover meat. Add rosemary and remaining thyme. Turn heat to high, bring to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer. Add meat, cover and place in oven for about 3 hours, basting occasionally. 
 Yield: 6 to 8 servings. 

GOAT STEW WITH GINGER, CARDAMOM AND CORIANDER

 BODY:

What Is Life Worth?
The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11
By Kenneth R. Feinberg
213 pages. PublicAffairs. $24.
Less than three months after the World Trade Center collapsed, a Washington lawyer, Kenneth J. Feinberg, was handed a highly unusual job. In an effort to prop up the airline industry, Congress had passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act. Along with loan guarantees, the new law called for a special fund to compensate victims of the 9/11 attacks. The amount of the compensation, and who qualified for it, would be decided by an all-powerful official known in legal language as a special master. Mr. Feinberg, a mediator best known for resolving the Agent Orange class-action suit, got the nod. 
 In ''What Is Life Worth?'' Mr. Feinberg offers a valuable first-person account of the 9/11 compensation fund and its workings. He makes clear, for the first time, exactly how peculiar the law governing the fund was, and the enormous difficulties, ethical and practical, that resulted from its ambiguous language and hastily written guidelines.
''Never before had a government offered individuals millions of dollars in tax-free compensation for a tragic loss,'' Mr. Feinberg writes. ''And never before had government funds been so unregulated. There was no earmarked congressional appropriation limiting the size of awards or constraining my discretion. My budget was unlimited; the payouts would be determined only by my personal judgment and experience.'' In the end, Mr. Feinberg would award more than $7 billion to 5,560 victims and family members.
 The compensation fund was a strange blend of compassion and cold calculation. Washington's lawmakers wanted to express, in dollars, the nation's sense of outrage and grief. Thousands of innocent people had died on the front lines of a new war. 
 But the government also wanted to head off an onslaught of personal injury lawsuits that could throw the airline industry into turmoil. The compensation fund was a giant bet, with public money, that most victims would forfeit their right to sue, and avoid the uncertainties of a court case, if offered the certainty of a reasonable award. It was up to Mr. Feinberg to make the bet pay off.
 It was not easy. Legal precedent offered little help because, as the book's subtitle suggests, there had never been anything quite like the 9/11 fund. Mr. Feinberg, in casting about for useful guideposts, consulted the Bible. At one point he talked things over with a prominent rabbi, who offered sage counsel: sometimes life offers no easy answers. 
 The wording of the statute put Mr. Feinberg in an ethically difficult position. By law, he was required to calibrate awards according to the financial worth of the deceased victim. Unavoidably, the special master, in carrying out the law, would appear to be making morally repugnant distinctions, telling the wife of a fireman, for example, that her husband was worth less than a stockbroker.
 Mr. Feinberg created his own ethical difficulties, too. The fund, in his mind, should be ''compassionate and generous but not profligate.'' Only those victims who received hospital treatment within 72 hours of the Sept. 11 attacks, and who received their injuries in the vicinity of the World Trade Center or the Pentagon, could apply for compensation. ''If we permitted Jersey City residents who inhaled the dust and debris to be eligible, we could anticipate millions of additional cases,'' Mr. Feinberg writes.
 Spouses and children, but not parents, would be eligible for compensation. No money would be awarded for mental injury or emotional trauma. This, Mr. Feinberg says, was a tough call but a necessary one to head off a run on the United States Treasury. ''I envisioned five million New Yorkers filing claims, as well as the millions of additional Americans and foreigners who watched the disaster unfold on television,'' he writes. Heroism, even when well documented, would not entitle anyone to extra money. ''My goal was to minimize distinctions among claimants, not maximize them,'' Mr. Feinberg explains. ''Heroism by all was presumed.'' 
 Not surprisingly, Mr. Feinberg took a lot of heat (especially in New York), even though he accepted no pay for his work. Outraged family members attacked him in public meetings. ''I spit on you and your children,'' a fireman's widow shouted at him at one meeting. Some accused him of administering a program of hush-money payments. The fund, in this view, was intended to head off lawsuits that might lead to embarrassing revelations about the government's failure to anticipate 9/11. A class-action lawsuit was filed by families of employees at Cantor Fitzgerald accusing Mr. Feinberg of arbitrarily shortchanging high-income victims. The suit was dismissed.
 Mr. Feinberg took the high road. The most engaging, emotionally rewarding pages in ''What Is Life Worth?'' describe his grueling efforts to make the seemingly inscrutable, arbitrary compensation process transparent and accessible by holding endless public meetings around the country and arranging private meetings, sometimes as many as a dozen a day, with victims and their families. 
 Mr. Feinberg confesses that he was unprepared for the emotional experience of counseling angry or grieving relatives. Often he was thrust into bitter family squabbles. In the early days of administering the fund, he addressed audiences in a lawyerly, just-the-facts style that struck many listeners, he writes, as ''brusque and callous.'' 
 With time, he relied more on his powers of sympathy. Mostly, he listened, and he has included moving accounts of the stories he heard. He explained and he encouraged, and gradually, he won the day. Thanks to a last-minute flood of applications, the 9/11 fund, which seemed to be teetering on the edge of failure, attracted 97 percent of those eligible for compensation. 
 That does not make it a good idea. ''Despite its success, I would not use the fund as a model in the event of future attacks,'' Mr. Feinberg concludes. The 9/11 attacks were a special case, he argues. It is bad public policy to hold out the promise that the government will compensate citizens for misfortunes -- to act, as he puts it, ''as an insurer of last resort.'' If Congress decides to hand out awards in the event of a terrorist attack, however, it should make the same payment to everyone, regardless of economic worth. Compassion is wonderful. But egalitarianism is, too.

HEADLINE: Rusty Railroad On Its Way To Pristine Park

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
Plans for the city's first elevated park -- a singular ribbon of green space stretching a mile and a half along an abandoned railroad viaduct 30 feet above the streets of Chelsea -- have taken a major step forward with a favorable ruling by a federal transportation board.
 The ruling, on Monday, essentially cleared the way for the city to begin negotiating use and development of the High Line, a weed-overgrown railroad bed that has not been used since the late 1960's and that, seen from above, looks like a painter's thick stroke of brilliant green along the gritty Lower West Side of Manhattan, between 34th Street and Gansevoort Street, in the meatpacking district.
 If the plans materialize, the project would become one of only two elevated parks in the world; the other, also carved out of an abandoned railroad viaduct, is the Promenade Plantee in Paris.
 ''This is one of the most unique open spaces in the world,'' said Amanda M. Burden, chairwoman of the New York City Planning Commission and an outspoken advocate of the High Line project. ''You will be able to walk 22 blocks in the city of New York without ever coming in contact with a vehicle. People will see the city from a completely unique perspective.'' 
 The project has had a long gestation, beginning in 1999, when some neighborhood residents, organized as Friends of the High Line, first intervened to block plans for demolishing the viaduct. 
 Property owners along the right of way, just east of the Hudson River, sought to develop their land beneath the elevated tracks.
 The administration of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani supported those efforts. But Michael R. Bloomberg, a year after taking office as mayor, reversed the city's position to support preservation.
 In 2004, with the enticement of a promised $50 million city investment in the park and other incentives to satisfy local businesses, the property owners withdrew their opposition to the city's plans to develop its first midair park.
 On Monday, the federal Surface Transportation Board issued the city what is called a ''certificate of interim trail use.'' That, in effect, permits the city to remove the segment of unused rail line from the national railway grid.
 Under the terms of a federal rail-preservation law, such an ''interim'' use could be revoked in the future should the Surface Transportation Board decide the rail line is again needed, though such revocations are rare.
 ''Just six years ago, saving the High Line seemed like an impossible dream, and now it's a reality,'' Robert Hammond, a co-founder of Friends of the High Line, said in a statement.
 Along 10th Avenue yesterday, some neighborhood residents were upbeat, if somewhat cautious.
 ''I think it's going to be great, as long as they make it so the kids don't fall off,'' said Maribel Vega, 40, holding her 5-year-old son, Pedro, by the hand. ''The railings are nothing, you could go right over them.''
 The iron railings along the viaduct -- some of them plain and some with ornate Art Deco designs -- would indeed be flimsy protection for 5-year-olds playing 30 feet above street level; but plans call for many improvements, not least of them in safety and security. ''They better think about kids throwing stuff down on people, too,'' said Ms. Vega's sister, Marisol Vega, 33.
 ''Any green space that we can get in this neighborhood is very welcome,'' said Jerri Prescott, a 38-year-resident of Chelsea walking her dog on 24th Street. ''Terrific.''
 From the street, the High Line presents itself only intermittently, a stab of rusty gunwale gray appearing at street crossings, then disappearing behind giant movie billboards, or sometimes hidden behind ivy and weed growth that drapes its railings. The line once rumbled with the traffic of freight cars, but now its presence is wistful, mainly invisible, and almost imaginary.
 Public access is prohibited, and until the city negotiates terms with the owner of the line, the CSX Corporation, one can only imagine what a walk along this new boulevard might look like. But along 10th Avenue, glimpses are possible:
 One will see billboards and fire escapes along some stretches, catch glimpses of crosstown traffic every block, and then, along those patches where no buildings interfere, see a river, and beyond that a lot of sky, possibly a sunset.
 The next step is to negotiate a trail use agreement with the railroad, said Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff. Gary Sease, a spokesman for CSX, said no problems were foreseen for the negotiations.

HEADLINE: OPEC Considers Doubling Previous Plan for Quota Increase

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: VIENNA, June 14 

 BODY:
On the eve of an OPEC meeting here, members said they were considering doubling a proposed increase in oil production quotas, as a spike in crude prices this week underscored growing concern about the recent volatility in energy markets. 
 Crude oil for July delivery fell 62 cents, to $55 a barrel on Tuesday, after a 4 percent surge on Monday. Several OPEC representatives have grown worried in recent weeks over their inability to push oil prices below the threshold of $50 a barrel. Oil is 40 percent more expensive than it was a year ago. 
 Edmond Daukoru, Nigeria's presidential adviser on petroleum, told reporters here on Tuesday that OPEC was considering increasing the group's production quotas by one million barrels a day-- or twice what was discussed over the weekend before delegates began arriving in Vienna. OPEC's production quotas stand at 27.5 million barrels a day. The 11-member group produces about 4 out of every 10 barrels of oil in the world each day.
 Although large oil-importing economies in the Northern Hemisphere have been surprisingly resilient to the higher fuel costs, the drag on economic activity because of costlier oil is causing their patience with OPEC to wear thin. 
 Samuel W. Bodman, the United States energy secretary, said this month that his department was in constant communication with OPEC members to emphasize the need to increase the oil supply. 
 ''Obviously we would encourage, have encouraged, and will encourage increases in production to the extent that it's possible,'' Mr. Bodman told reporters in Washington.
 Yet as OPEC reacts to such sentiment in the United States and Europe, the organization appears confused on how to bring stability to oil markets. To maintain the flow of money into its members' treasuries, OPEC needs to keep oil prices high, but not so high as to encourage governments to provide incentives for energy sources other than oil. 
 Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah of Kuwait, the president of OPEC, confirmed that a proposal to raise the production ceiling by one million barrels a day was under discussion, but other delegates expressed concern about going beyond the increase of 500,000 barrels a day that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's most powerful member, had already endorsed. 
 ''If we agree on the 500,000, then we don't need to do anything else,'' said Hammouda el-Aswad, a Libyan OPEC representative, according to Bloomberg News. 
 Whatever OPEC decides, oil prices are expected to remain high. The refining capacity for the type of additional oil that might come into the market, which is rich in sulfur, remains scarce around the world. And analysts warn that it may take months for some OPEC members to secure access to the drilling rigs necessary to expand production.

HEADLINE: A Self-Imposed Ban on Drug Ads

BYLINE: By Stephanie Saul

 BODY:
THE drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb said yesterday that it had imposed a ban on advertising its new drugs to consumers in their first year on the market, adopting voluntary restrictions that go further than what is anticipated in an industrywide advertising code to be announced next month.
 The company said it wanted to give doctors time to understand new products before patients begin asking for them.
 ''We want to make sure that before we start mass media -- television, radio and print branded advertising -- that physicians have a level of comfort about the treatment and which patients are appropriate for it,'' Brian Henry, a spokesman for Bristol-Myers, said. 
 The 12-month ban is part of a new advertising code the company posted on its Web site yesterday. 
 Despite the growing backlash against direct-to-consumer advertising of pharmaceuticals, Mr. Henry said the company is not aware of any similar codes in the industry.
 In the eight years since the Food and Drug Administration lifted a prohibition on consumer advertising, drug ads have become a $3.8 billion business. The constant drumbeat of spots, mostly on television, is so effective that patients demand prescriptions from their doctors, and some critics accuse the physicians of obliging even though the drugs might not be best for the patient. 
 The practice has become particularly controversial in the last year in the wake of disclosures that the prescription painkillers known as cox-2 inhibitors were linked to cardiac problems. Advertising and marketing played a role in the widespread use of two of the drugs, Vioxx and Celebrex, by many patients who would have done just as well with less expensive over-the-counter remedies, critics have said.
 The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade group, is expected to adopt its industrywide code next month, but apparently will stop short of embracing anything like the 12-month moratorium on advertising new drugs.
 ''We believe passionately that patients have a right to know about new drugs which may save their lives or improve the quality of their lives,'' said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the trade group, known as PhRMA. Mr. Johnson said that the ''finishing touches'' were being put on the new code, but he would not divulge its contents.
 The chief executive of Bristol-Myers, Peter R. Dolan, is slated to become chairman of the industry trade group next year. Mr. Dolan's company has been working to improve its image in the wake of investigations of its accounting practices by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Direct-to-consumer advertising became an issue in last year's presidential campaign, with the Democrats holding drug advertising partly responsible for ever-increasing prescription costs and inflation in the nation's health care bills. Lawmakers, both at the federal and state levels, have also embraced the issue. 
 One bill pending in Congress, sponsored by Representative James P. Moran, a Democrat from Virginia, would ban the broadcast of all erectile dysfunction ads from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., a measure partly aimed at limiting the exposure to children of the suggestive content of ads for Viagra, Cialis and Levitra. 
 In addition to placing a 12-month moratorium on consumer advertising of new drugs, Bristol-Myers' code calls for advertising to ''appropriate audiences at appropriate times of the day'' -- a section apparently influenced by ubiquitous erectile dysfunction advertising.
 The code also said that all company ads will inform poor patients that assistance programs are available to help them get medications. Bristol-Myers is based in New York.

HEADLINE: G.M. Board Gives Union A Deadline

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 14 

 BODY:
The board of General Motors has given the United Automobile Workers union until the end of the month to agree to cuts in its members' health care benefits, union officials said Tuesday. 
 Many local union leaders have said they were willing to make concessions, but not to the extent that G.M. was seeking. If the union and the company cannot agree by the end of the month, G.M. is threatening to make the cuts on its own. Such a step could lead to a breakdown in G.M.'s relations with the union and possible strikes. 
 ''I think they're making a mistake,'' said Eldon J. Renaud, the president of a union local in Bowling Green, Ky., where G.M. has a plant that makes the Chevrolet Corvette. ''It's hard enough for us to agree to concessions without forcing something down our throat. It takes time to do this.''
 Asked if a strike was a likely response by the union to a unilateral move by G.M., Mr. Renaud said, ''I don't think it leaves us any other option.'' 
 Shares of G.M. rose 4 percent, or $1.42, to $35.87, on Tuesday after a report on the deadline appeared in The Detroit News; it was first mentioned by a local union official in a Bloomberg article on Friday.
 The move appears to be a more assertive step by a board that has been invisible during G.M.'s financial crisis of the last three months, while Rick Wagoner, the board's chairman and G.M.'s chief executive, has been revising his strategy. 
 The directive appears to have come out a board meeting last Tuesday that followed a contentious annual meeting where shareholders questioned Mr. Wagoner's game plan and the qualifications of G.M.'s board. 
 At the annual meeting, Mr. Wagoner suggested that he would press for health care cost cuts with or without the union's approval. 
 ''Our strongly preferred approach is to do this in cooperation with the U.A.W.,'' he said, adding, ''but either way, it's crystal clear that we need to achieve a significant reduction in our health care cost disadvantage and to do so promptly. We're committed to do that.'' 
 Toni Simonetti, a spokeswoman for G.M., said the board was playing a role in the health care talks but would not say whether there was a deadline or detail its involvement. 
 ''The board would be engaged in critical issues of the company such as this particular one,'' she said. ''Everyone involved in this process within the company and outside the company acknowledges that time is of the essence, but I would have no comment on the characterization of an ultimatum or a deadline.''
 ''I think it's safe to say that, yes, the board is engaged on this issue, as the board should be on a strategic issue like this,'' she added. 
 Paul Krell, a spokesman for the union's leadership in Detroit, said, referring to G.M., ''I'm not going to comment on their internal deadlines.'' 
 But local union leaders, who gathered in Detroit last Thursday, said they were told about the deadline. 
 Since G.M. spends nearly $6 billion a year on health care, many investors and financial analysts see cutting back on benefits as an important step in restoring the company to financial health. G.M. covers 1.1 million Americans, including workers, retirees and family members, making it the nation's largest private provider of medical benefits. Its hourly workers and retirees pay modest co-payments for prescription drugs, but they do not pay monthly premiums or deductibles. Salaried employees pay both, and G.M. has said it would like hourly workers to have the same benefits as managers. 
 Such a change would require reopening the company's labor contract, which does not expire until 2007. Ron Gettelfinger, the union's president, said in April he would not do so but would agree to make changes allowable within the contract. Such changes could include compelling more members to purchase drugs by mail, or taking a step similar to one the union took for Chrysler this year. Because costs of preferred provider organizations, known as P.P.O.'s, have risen sharply, Chrysler workers who use those plans will have to pay annual deductibles ranging from $100 to $1,000.
 ''Right now, we're doing everything possible to help G.M., because it helps us too. We don't want G.M. to go under,'' said Don Swegman, president of an Indiana local whose workers build pickups. ''At the same time, we do have a labor agreement.''
 In a note to investors, Stephen J. Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said, ''The fact that the U.A.W. appears to be willing to negotiate and that some type of deadline has been set is an incremental positive.''
 ''However, we would caution that the deadline may just be hypothetical and other deadlines have slipped in the past,'' he said. 
 Mr. Swegman said, ''They can make all the deadlines they want.'' He went on: ''We have a four-year labor agreement and as long as what they want to do is laid out within our agreement, it's quite all right to do. If it's not, we're not going to be too happy about it.''

HEADLINE: Demand for Natural Gas Brings Big Import Plans, and Objections

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
Just as the 19th century was shaped by coal and the 20th century by oil, people in the energy industry say, this century will belong to natural gas. But to judge by the battle over energy legislation that began yesterday in Congress, it will not happen easily. 
 International energy companies, the Bush administration and governments in gas-rich countries are aggressively championing the creation of a global market for natural gas, with the United States at its center as the largest importer. They are promoting the fuel as more plentiful and less polluting than oil and needed to sustain economic growth. 
 But in the same way that American oil output began to fall short in the 1960's and has steadily diminished as a source of energy, the United States is already running low on its own production of natural gas. To fill the gap, vast amounts of gas will have to be imported -- in liquefied form, arriving by tanker on the coasts of the United States or elsewhere in North America. 
 Like oil, large reserves of natural gas are found far from the big markets for the fuel, in countries like Qatar, Iran, Russia, Angola, Yemen and Algeria. Competition for gas projects in these places has prompted a frenetic race among international oil companies to meet demand for the fuel in rich industrialized countries. 
 These ambitions in the United States face strong resistance. Officials in some states where energy companies plan to build terminals that would receive the gas tankers -- including Alabama, California, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island -- say they could fall victim to a catastrophic explosion, either accidental or set by terrorists.
 President Bush, trying to maneuver past the objectors, has endorsed legislation, which is currently being debated in the Senate, that would allow the federal government to overrule the states.
 ''Congress should make it clear to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission its authority to choose sites for new terminals, so we can expand our use of liquefied natural gas,'' Mr. Bush said in April. 
 But he faces a fight in Congress too. Several senators, including Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, are sponsoring an amendment to oppose greater federal authority.
 The federal commission's chairman, Patrick Wood III, told energy industry officials in Houston in February that he expected at least eight new terminals for liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., to be built in the United States by 2010. There are now four terminals -- in Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland and Massachusetts -- built during an earlier foray into L.N.G. in the 1960's and 1970's.

Some Object to Terminals
 Energy companies want to construct more than 40 such terminals at a cost of $500 million to $1 billion each. The emerging conflict is taking place as some scientists and environmentalists say that the nation is once again placing too little emphasis on improving energy efficiency and making investments in other methods for producing power and heat, including wind, biomass and nuclear energy. 
 Meanwhile, utilities that buy gas warn that in becoming ever more reliant on natural gas from abroad, the United States would be running the same risk it made when it came to depend on oil from unstable sources in the Middle East.
 Natural gas is expected to overtake coal and rival oil as the leading fossil fuel in the world by 2025 -- sooner if the largest energy concerns get their way. They are pursuing more than $100 billion in projects to create a global market for gas that will be increasingly vital to generate electricity, heat and cool buildings, manufacture the fertilizers that help feed the world and even run some vehicles. 
 Natural gas accounts for 24 percent of the nation's energy consumption. Plentiful and less polluting than oil, natural gas, whose consumption still emits greenhouse gases, has become much more popular over the last decade after it was prized as a fuel for new power plants. 
 The rising consumption of natural gas comes with a significant cost, however. ''We're at a similar stage with natural gas as we once were with oil,'' said Donald E. Felsinger, president of Sempra Energy of San Diego, which plans to import natural gas from Russia to Texas, Louisiana and northern Mexico. ''We're not self-sufficient anymore, and we're going to depend on imports to allow people to keep consuming it.''
 The price of natural gas has doubled in the United States in the last five years, exposing a vulnerable reliance and the possibility of higher prices if supplies are not increased. Indeed, even with the global gas market in its infancy, some nations want to act as a cartel to control the price of natural gas much as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has at times manipulated the oil market.
 Efforts to import more natural gas have already touched off a political dispute in California where resistance has mounted to plans to build several L.N.G. terminals, including one in Long Beach and two off the coast, one close to Oxnard, north of Los Angeles, and the other near Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego.
 Energy companies, including Chevron and BHP Billiton of Australia, are financing a group called Californians for Clean Affordable Safe Energy to persuade people of the need for L.N.G. The group is part of a $1 million campaign supporting L.N.G. created by a Republican political strategist, Mike Murphy.
 But skepticism persists. ''If you jump-start an industry this way and bring in an abundance of natural gas, you're creating an addiction to something that wasn't there,'' said Susan Jordan, director of the California Coastal Protection Network, an environmental group in Santa Barbara campaigning against L.N.G. terminals. ''This is happening without any mention of conservation and with little regard for the renewable alternatives.''
 Unlike oil, natural gas can be devilishly difficult and expensive to ship around the world. To create a liquid, natural gas must be cooled to 260 degrees below zero, squeezing its volume by a factor of approximately 600. Once it reaches its destination, it needs to be reheated before it can be used in the power grid.

Half the Cost of Oil, or Less
 But natural gas has many advantages, particularly in terms of convenience and cost. A typical barrel of oil commands roughly $50 on the world market today, while 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas, its energy equivalent, is much less expensive. Even delivered from a pivotal Middle Eastern country like Qatar, it would probably cost $18 to $24, according to Bernard J. Picchi, a senior energy analyst with Foresight Research Solutions in New York. 
 Natural gas, once scoffed at by oil companies as a nuisance when found alongside reserves of oil, is also thought to be more plentiful than oil. BP, the British energy giant, estimates global gas reserves at 67 years of supply at current production rates, compared with global crude oil reserves equal to 41 years of annual supply.
 Plaguing the L.N.G. boom are comparisons to the scramble for oil in the last century and the transfer of wealth and financial leverage to a handful of nations in the Middle East.
 The United States, for much of the 20th century, was the world's largest oil producer, easily satisfying its own needs. But, with a fast-growing economy and increased reliance on the automobile, the nation began to import more oil than it exported after World War II. In 1973, when the Arab oil embargo pushed prices sharply higher, oil imports amounted to only 36 percent of domestic oil consumption. Now they account for nearly 60 percent.
 As with oil, American production of natural gas is no longer enough to meet domestic demand. Reliance on natural gas in the United States increased sharply after electricity companies designed more than 90 percent of the power plants in the 1990's to run on natural gas. Meanwhile, imports from Canada, whose large natural gas fields are connected by pipeline to the United States, have started to run short as well.
 Strong demand for natural gas is occurring not just in the United States, but in the fast-industrializing economies of China and India, which are set to compete for supplies. The United States is expected to emerge as the world's largest L.N.G. market, with imports forecast to account for as much as 20 percent of natural gas consumption in the United States by 2015, up from only about 2 percent today. Before that happens, however, the United States will need to build the terminals able to receive L.N.G.
 So energy companies watched with interest in March when a small Houston company, Excelerate Energy, completed the first such project in the United States in more than 20 years, off the coast of Louisiana, near Cameron, a sleepy parish seat. 
 The terminal is welcomed by many residents there as a source of jobs. But Cameron's embrace of L.N.G. stands in contrast to the positions in communities in California and along the east coast, where demand for natural gas is the strongest and most L.N.G. ports have been proposed. These include proposals for Long Island Sound, nine miles off Rocky Point, N.Y.; Providence, R.I.; Logan Township in southern New Jersey; and Harpswell, Me. Concern over the possibility of damage from an accident or terrorist explosion involving a terminal or tanker has prevented such projects from getting off the ground in these coastal communities. 
 A recent report by Sandia National Laboratories concluded that terrorists blowing a hole in an L.N.G. tanker could produce a spill of liquefied natural gas that could reheat and set off a fire that would cause second-degree burns on people nearly a mile away.

Industry Cites Safety Record
 The L.N.G. industry responds that the safety record of its tankers far exceeds any other sector of the shipping industry. Only a few relatively small accidents have occurred in the last three decades, and industry groups contend that an accidental spill or a suicide bomb attack is extremely unlikely. Japan and South Korea, currently the top L.N.G. markets, have never experienced a major accident or attack.
 Yet considerable apprehension persists. In an analysis in May for the attorney general of Rhode Island, Richard A. Clarke, the former counterterrorism adviser to the Clinton and Bush administrations, concluded that terrorist groups could easily attack an urban L.N.G. port or tanker, exposing the areas around Providence and Fall River, Mass., to ''a high risk of generating catastrophic damage'' from explosions and fires.
 Responding to the energy industry's urgency, Congress included in the broad energy legislation approved this spring in the House, and given clearance in May by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, a provision that would effectively usurp the authority of states to block L.N.G. terminals.
 Six governors from coastal states, including Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, wrote to the Senate committee, asking for states to remain on equal footing in L.N.G. reviews. 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said this month that he opposed an L.N.G. terminal in Long Island Sound, citing security concerns.
 Those officials are opposing senators like Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, who are pushing to bolster federal authority. 
 Meanwhile, foreign governments that are pinning their hopes on exporting L.N.G. to the United States are investing in ventures to build terminals. One West African supplier, Angola, has acquired part of a venture called Gulf LNG Clean Energy that is planning a port in Mississippi.
 Qatar, the Connecticut-sized nation in the Persian Gulf that is expected to become the world's largest L.N.G. exporter over the next decade, has shown keen interest in the L.N.G. provisions in the energy bill before the Senate.
 Qatar and 12 other gas-rich nations, including Iran, Egypt, Nigeria and Venezuela, met in April to discuss ways to keep L.N.G. prices satisfactorily high. The group, called the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, is still in its infancy and for now is incapable of modeling itself after OPEC, but its members agreed to establish a liaison office in Doha, Qatar.
 Daniel Yergin, an energy analyst and author of ''The Prize,'' a history of the quest for oil over the last century, argues that it would be difficult for a confrontational cartel of gas producers to take hold over the next several years. He said that is because L.N.G. producers will be competing with each other for market access and relying heavily on Western energy companies to shoulder much of the multibillion-dollar risk of large L.N.G. projects.
 ''Managing price would be negative for an industry set to grow rapidly over the next 10 years,'' Mr. Yergin said. ''There is more pronounced interdependence of consuming and producing countries for natural gas than for oil.'' 
 Others view the growing reliance on imported natural gas in the United States more ominously.
 ''We accept having L.N.G. as part of the energy solution, but we're very concerned about making the same mistakes we made with imported oil,'' said David Schryver, vice president for Congressional affairs at the American Public Gas Association, which represents municipal gas utilities that would consume much of the imported L.N.G. ''Facing the prospect of another OPEC for natural gas is alarming.''
 Despite such concerns, L.N.G. imports to the handful of terminals that exist in the United States soared 29 percent last year and are set to increase rapidly throughout this decade.
 ''Going without L.N.G. requires making some difficult lifestyle changes in the way we consume our energy,'' said Charif Souki, chief executive of Cheniere Energy, a Houston company with plans to build three L.N.G. terminals in Louisiana and Texas. ''If you have a better alternative, then please pursue it.''

HEADLINE: First Face-Off For Corzine And Forrester

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: WEST WINDSOR, N.J., June 14 

 BODY:
With tight smiles, a firm handshake and relatively restrained attack lines, the two main candidates for New Jersey governor made their first joint appearance on Tuesday, with each telling a group of business leaders that he had the best qualifications and proposals to improve the state's economy.
 The Republican nominee, Douglas R. Forrester, and the Democratic candidate, United States Senator Jon S. Corzine, each promised to reduce property taxes, cut spending and clean up the political corruption that has soiled the state's reputation. Both also pledged to restrain New Jersey's spiraling debt, which has reduced its bond rating and cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in annual interest payments. 
 But Mr. Forrester said that he was more closely attuned to the needs of business owners, chiding Mr. Corzine for voting against a proposal that would allow employees of small businesses to establish health care savings accounts. He also said that the tax increases and regulations imposed by New Jersey Democrats during the past four years had made many businesses view state government as hostile, and he insisted that only an outsider could offer a sweeping overhaul.
 ''Businesses are leaving, they are turning out their lights because they are crushed by overregulation and overtaxation,'' Mr. Forrester said in his 15-minute address to about 600 at the New Jersey Business and Industry Association's Biennial Dinner. ''That is unacceptable.''
 Mr. Corzine firmly brushed aside the suggestion that he was to blame for the state's poor fiscal health, saying that for years leaders of both parties had indulged in a policy of ''tax, borrow and spend.'' He said that only he had offered voters a detailed plan to trim the state budget, and he chastised Mr. Forrester for promising property tax reductions without providing specific examples of what programs he would cut to pay for them.
 ''Our property tax mess won't be solved by slogans or sound bites by me or my opponent,'' he said.
 Still, the tone of remarks was relatively mild, especially given the feisty exchanges their surrogates have had during the first week of the general election campaign.
 Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Forrester held a press conference to remind voters that last year Mr. Corzine considered buying the New Jersey Nets basketball team with Charles Kushner, a developer and Democratic contributor who later pleaded guilty to witness intimidation by hiring a prostitute to videotape a sexual encounter with his brother-in-law. 
 In the past four days, labor and environmental groups working with state Democrats, have held rallies to criticize Mr. Forrester's position on offshore oil drilling and preservation and his support for the partial privatization of Social Security.
 On the podium Tuesday evening, Mr. Forrester and Mr. Corzine exchanged cordial greetings but few other pleasantries.
 ''Doug, I wish you good health during the next five months,'' Mr. Corzine said as he opened his speech. ''But not good fortune or good luck.''

HEADLINE: Yankees' Stadium Plans Stepping Up to the Plate

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
For the second time in a week, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will unveil plans today for a new baseball stadium in New York City: an $800 million home for the Yankees that will replicate the team's original ballpark in the Bronx, from the limestone walls and distinctive copper frieze to the placement of the bullpens.
 The team plans to build an open-air stadium with 51,800 seats -- although it could be expanded to 54,000 seats -- and 50 to 60 luxury suites in Macombs Dam Park, across 161st Street from the team's historic home. It will be smaller than the existing stadium, which has 56,937 seats and about 18 luxury boxes.
 The design, by the architectural firm of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, would restore many of the signature features of the original 82-year-old stadium that were wiped out by the 1976 renovation, and it would retain the same field dimensions and dugouts, according to two executives who have seen the plans. 
 The announcement, to be made jointly by Bloomberg and George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees, comes only three days after a similar proclamation by the mayor and the Mets concerning plans to build a new stadium in Queens for about $700 million. That stadium would also be used for the Olympics if the city wins its bid for the 2012 Games.
 The Yankee Stadium project is part of a broader redevelopment plan, initiated by the Bronx borough president, Adolfo Carrion Jr., that includes a hotel, conference center and high school for sports-related careers.
 ''It's exciting,'' Carrion said yesterday. ''With the plan for Jets stadium falling out of the equation, it presented an opportunity to take care of two New York teams. I'm glad the administration has stepped forward and supported the Bronx community plan. We need to create a win-win situation, and I think this will do that.''
 The Yankees, one of the most valuable franchises in sports, have agreed to pay all construction, operating and maintenance costs for the stadium. The city and state will spend an estimated $220 million on work related to the stadium, bringing the total cost to more than $1 billion.
 The state has agreed to spend up to $75 million to build three or four parking garages, which will add up to 5,000 new spaces, and to do some road work. The team says that the cost of the garages will be more than covered by game-day parking fees.
 The city is expected to spend about $140 million to replace the roughly 17 acres of Macombs Dam Park and Mullaly Park that the new stadium will occupy with a 28-acre waterfront park along the Harlem River. The Parks Department will replace the running track, soccer field and tennis, handball and basketball courts that were in the parks with new and additional fields, some of which will be atop the garages.
 The Jets' plan to build a $2.2 billion stadium on Manhattan's Far West Side collapsed last week, but the Yankees have chosen to follow a different route in their attempt to build a stadium. They have put their project through the city's lengthy land-use review process, rather than attempt to bypass it. Unlike the Jets, the Yankees have yet to encounter opposition.
 In their new stadium, the Yankees plan to place about 30,000 seats on the first level and 20,000 in the second level, giving more fans a closer view of the field than the current stadium provides.
 Most of the current Yankee Stadium will not fall to the wrecking ball. The city plans to preserve at least the existing baseball field, the dugouts and the first level of the stands for Little League and high school use.
 ''I'm sure they'll have limos or vans to take the ghosts over to the new ballpark,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said.
 Although the new stadium, like the old one, will go up on city-owned land, the team will not pay rent or property taxes under the terms of the deal with the city and the state. The Yankees and the Mets have existing leases with the city that are widely regarded as especially favorable to the teams. From 2000 through 2004, the Yankees paid a total of $26.43 million in rent, or a little more than $5 million a year.
 To finance the construction, the city and the state would create a local development corporation that would issue tax-free bonds, which would be paid off by the Yankees. That allows the team to save an estimated $12.8 million a year in financing costs, although it reduces tax revenue.
 The announcements are a remarkable postscript to Bloomberg's declaration in 2002 that the city could not afford to build sports stadiums, given more pressing municipal needs. Today, the New York area is awash in plans for stadiums and arenas, with new homes planned for the Mets, the Yankees and the Nets in New York City, and the MetroStars, the Devils, the Giants and, maybe, the Jets in New Jersey.
 A 1996 report by the city comptroller estimated that professional sporting events account for only 0.7 percent of the region's economy.
 The deals for the Yankees and the Mets are far less generous today than in 2001, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani came to a tentative agreement with the two teams. Giuliani agreed to pay half the cost of building $800 million stadiums with retractable roofs for the Yankees and the Mets. Each team, in turn, agreed to pay the city 4 percent of the annual gate receipts.

HEADLINE: Central American Trade Pact Passes First Congressional Test

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14 

 BODY:
The Central America Free Trade Agreement narrowly passed its first Congressional test on Tuesday, winning a preliminary vote in the Senate Finance Committee after a last-minute administration promise to discuss concessions for the sugar industry.
 Historically, the Senate favors trade agreements more than the House. But what once might have been a routine session to offer amendments to the Central American pact turned into a heated argument over the effect of trade agreements on American workers, the sugar industry and the ballooning United States trade deficit.
 Committee members endorsed Cafta in a nonbinding vote of 11 to 9, but only after Robert J. Portman, the United States trade representative, gave written assurances to Senator Craig L. Thomas, Republican of Wyoming, that the agriculture secretary would meet with the sugar industry to discuss ways to help it make up for what it considers losses it will suffer under Cafta. 
 ''I've gotten more recognition than I had hardly thought possible,'' said Mr. Thomas after casting the final, and deciding, vote for the pact. 
 Sugar producers are some of the strongest opponents of the accord, which would open the American market to increased sugar imports. Unions are also against the agreement, saying Cafta weakens previous commitments to ensure that in return for access to American markets, foreign countries respect basic labor laws and compete fairly.
 An amendment to apply the same penalties for breaking labor laws as for violating intellectual property rights was defeated on a tie vote by the committee. It was sponsored by two Democratic senators, John F. Kerry of Massachusetts and Charles E. Schumer of New York.
 Even though the agreement is with the small, mostly impoverished countries of Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, both parties have viewed it as a template for future accords.
 Cafta faces unusually strong opposition from Democrats and some Republicans who are asking for a moratorium on agreements until the administration figures out why the United States has compiled a trade deficit of over $600 billion.
 Mr. Portman said after the vote that he was ''very pleased with the results.''
 ''The Senate Finance Committee was a challenge for us,'' he said.
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, one of two Republicans to vote against the measure, said the United States had yet to see ''the upside of these trade agreements.''
 ''How many more jobs are we going to lose?'' she asked. ''The reluctance now and resistance is because of our experience with Nafta. It's breathtaking the number of jobs we've lost yet nothing has come of the promises to get trade right.''
 Two Democratic senators, Blanche L. Lincoln of Arkansas and Ronald L. Wyden of Oregon, voted in favor of Cafta, which was signed last year by the countries involved. Mr. Wyden offered the only amendment that passed. It seeks to extend aid to workers who lose their jobs because of trade but it would not be part of the Cafta accord, at the suggestion of Senator Charles E. Grassley, the chairman of the committee.
 Supporters of Cafta said the pact was a crucial part of America's security strategy. Senator Jon L. Kyl, Republican of Arizona, said it was necessary for Central American countries to remain allies at a time when President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, ''are potentially creating a lot of problems in the region.''
 Republican senators concerned about the sugar provisions will meet with a White House official on Wednesday, according to Mr. Thomas. 
 ''If the secretary can do something about the sugar program, then the sugar people won't be so worried about Cafta,'' Mr. Thomas said. If the sugar industry was unhappy with any compromise, Mr. Thomas said he would vote against final approval of Cafta.
 Democrats, who are unusually united against Cafta, said they could still defeat the measure.
 Senator Harry M. Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, said in a statement that Cafta did not reflect the real trade problems facing the country and that the close vote ''shows an almost unprecedented level of opposition to this Administration's misplaced trade priorities.''
 In another sign of growing concern over jobs, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, and Senator Lindsey O. Graham, Republican of South Carolina, announced a new Senate Manufacturing Caucus to study how to preserve the country's dwindling manufacturing base.
 In the last seven years, the United States has lost three million manufacturing jobs, leaving the country with the lowest level of manufacturing employment since the end of World War II.

HEADLINE: Bush Aides Report 'Increasing Doubts' North Korea Will Give Up Nuclear Arms Program

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Richard W. Stevenson contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's top negotiators with North Korea said Tuesday that they harbored ''increasing doubts'' that President Kim Jong Il's government was ready to give up its nuclear weapons program in return for security guarantees and economic incentives.
 The envoys, noting that there had been five sessions of talks between an American and a North Korean official at the United Nations in the last 10 months, rejected the idea that more incentives or one-on-one talks would be likely to revive serious negotiations. 
 ''I think the real issue here is not that they don't know the benefits, but they simply haven't made the fundamental decision whether they want to give up on being a nuclear state,'' said Christopher Hill, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, speaking at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
 Mr. Hill appeared with Joseph DeTrani, special envoy to the talks with North Korea. The talks, which are sponsored by China and also include Russia, Japan and South Korea as participants, have been boycotted by the government in Pyongyang for nearly a year. 
 Led by Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, several Democratic senators asked whether it was time to shift tactics and offer direct economic incentives to the North -- energy and economic assistance have been discussed, but only from Japan and South Korea -- or to hold direct talks between the United States and North Korea.
 Both Mr. Hill and Mr. DeTrani argued that they did not think either tactic would work, based on their analysis of the North's thinking and the fact that there had been repeated one-on-one contacts in New York. But they also said the administration was willing to consider various unspecified options to revive the talks.
 In separate comments, Mr. Hill appeared to express more frustration than other administration officials have in the past over China's refusal to exert more economic leverage on North Korea. Pressed by the committee's Republican chairman, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, to talk about China's role, Mr. Hill said, ''Mr. Chairman, I agree with you that China has been reluctant to use the full range of leverage that we believe China has.'' 
 He noted that China's trade and investment with North Korea had actually gone up in recent years, in part because North Korea's trade with Japan had gone down. South Korea has also increased its trade and investment.
 He acknowledged further that without support from South Korea and China, it would be very difficult to impose economic or political penalties on North Korea to get it to change its behavior. Neither nation has supported imposing such penalties.
 Mr. Hill and Mr. DeTrani also clarified the issue of security guarantees for North Korea, disputing a suggestion by Mr. Biden that the Bush administration withhold such guarantees if North Korea did not improve its human rights record.
 ''As I understand your proposal, security assurances are only, quote, 'provisional' until other issues are addressed, right?'' Mr. Biden asked.
 ''Once their nuclear program's eliminated, they will get permanent security assurances,'' Mr. DeTrani replied. He added, however, that ''we are not prepared to have a fully normalized relationship in the absence of movement on these other issues,'' referring to North Korea's authoritarian practices and brutal suppression of dissent.
 Mr. DeTrani's comments were significant, because although President Bush has said the administration has ''no intention'' of attacking North Korea, many conservatives in the administration and in Congress oppose any security guarantees without progress on human rights or even an ousting of Mr. Kim's government.
 Underscoring the importance that the administration attaches to North Korea's human rights record, the White House said Tuesday that Mr. Bush met Monday with a defector from North Korea, Kang Chol-Hwan, whose memoir, ''The Aquariums of Pyongyang: Ten Years in a North Korean Gulag,'' recounts his suffering at the hands of the North Korean government.
 Imprisoned with his family at age 9 in 1977, Mr. Kang was released a decade later, and subsequently escaped to South Korea, where he now works as a journalist and is a vocal critic of the Kim government. Mr. Bush has read Mr. Kang's book and wanted to meet with him in person, said Frederick Jones, a spokesman for the National Security Council.
 Mr. Lugar, among others on the Senate committee, pressed Mr. Hill and Mr. DeTrani to put pressure on China and South Korea to allow more refugees into their country, especially those escaping punishment for political reasons. Both nations have been reluctant to do so for fear of security problems in their countries and out of concern about angering North Korea.
 Mr. DeTrani said the administration had made ''some progress'' on that issue.

HEADLINE: Homeowners Take Risks in a Bid for Lower Mortgage Payments

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT and MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
American homeowners have made a trillion-dollar bet that mortgage rates will remain near record lows for at least a few more years. But with some interest rates already rising, economists worry that the bet could turn bad.
 The problem is that new types of mortgages that hold down monthly payments for families -- helping many buy homes that they would not otherwise be able to afford -- also require potentially far higher payments in future years.
 The bill will soon start to come due in a serious way, as the initial period of fixed payments, typically set at artificially low rates, expires for millions of homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages.
 This year, only about $80 billion, or 1 percent, of mortgage debt will switch to an adjustable rate based largely on prevailing interest rates, according to an analysis by Deutsche Bank in New York. Next year, some $300 billion of mortgage debt will be similarly adjusted. 
 But in 2007, the portion will soar, with $1 trillion of the nation's mortgage debt -- or about 12 percent of it -- switching to adjustable payments, according to the analysis.
 The 2007 adjustments will almost certainly be the largest such turnover that has ever occurred. 
 The impact is not likely to derail the economy on its own, economists predict, but it will probably slow growth. For individual families, the problems could be significant. 
 ''I'm not sure that people are being counseled on really how big of a risk they are taking,'' said Amy Crews Cutts, deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac, the mortgage company.
 Consider a typical $300,000 interest-only mortgage with fixed payments for the first five years. 
 The homeowner would start by paying about $1,250 a month. If interest rates rise modestly over the next few years, as many forecasters expect, the payment will jump to almost $2,100 in 2010, according to Stephen Barrett, the owner of Redmond Financial, a mortgage business near Seattle.
 With the help of new computer models, lenders have brought out newer and riskier mortgages to attract borrowers and increase their buying power during the long housing boom. The traditional 30-year mortgage with guaranteed payments is increasingly a loan of the past. 
 The hot loan of 2004 -- the interest-only mortgage -- allowed home buyers to pay no principal for the first few years of the loan, substantially lowering their initial payments. 
 It has remained popular this year, accounting for at least 40 percent of purchase loans over $360,000 in areas with fast-rising home prices, like San Diego, Washington, Seattle, Reno, Atlanta and much of Northern California, according to LoanPerformance, a mortgage data firm.
 This year's fashionable model, known as an ''option ARM,'' allows borrowers to make payments with monthly rates starting as low as 1.25 percent for the first five years of the loan; the average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan is about 5.6 percent.
 During the first quarter of 2005, 40 percent of mortgages over $360,000 issued to people with good credit were option ARM's, said David Liu, a mortgage strategy analyst with UBS in New York. Very few borrowers used option ARM's before 2003.
 Many borrowers stand to benefit from these creative loans. On option ARM's, buyers with variable incomes, like the self-employed, can also make smaller or larger payments depending on their take-home pay in a particular month, without incurring penalties. With the average homeowner moving every six years, any loan with lower initial payments can substantially reduce housing costs.
 ''As a rule, I would prefer the 30-year fixed mortgage,'' said Alejandro Brown, 31, a technical trainer for Nissan, the automaker, who refinanced the mortgage on his 1,700-square-foot house in Auburn, Wash., with an adjustable-rate loan last year, reducing his monthly payments. But, he said, ''I knew I wasn't going to be in my house more than three years; I was very confident.'' 
 All of these loans come with the risk of a spike in payments sometime in the future. In particular, borrowers who have taken out an interest-only loan will see a jump in payments simply because they will start to owe principal after the interest-only period lapses. If rates rise, the payments will go even higher. 
 Borrowers whose incomes have not risen enough or who have not planned for the higher payments could find themselves shocked.
 ''The apparent froth in housing markets may have spilled over into mortgage markets,'' Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said while testifying to Congress last week. ''The dramatic increase in the prevalence of interest-only loans, as well as the introduction of other relatively exotic forms of adjustable-rate mortgages, are developments of particular concern.''
 The lure of such loans is obvious. Because of the lower initial payments, buyers can purchase bigger and more expensive houses.
 With her daughter leaving for college this summer, Linda Thompson decided to sell her four-bedroom house in the Seattle suburbs and move to a town house in the city's Lake Union neighborhood. But prices were so high that she had to go beyond her ''level of comfort,'' she said, and spend $619,000.
 She signed an interest-only mortgage that cut her monthly payments by about $500 compared with a conventional mortgage. Seven years from now, the bill will rise as she starts paying principal, and the size of the increase will be determined by interest rates at the time. But she may have moved by then, she said. And because the house is in an up-and-coming neighborhood, she expects the value to rise.
 ''The risk factor -- of course it's always there,'' Ms. Thompson, 49, who runs a small marketing company, said as she was preparing to watch her daughter graduate from high school yesterday. ''But to me, real estate is a better investment than the stock market.''
 ''Just sitting there,'' she said of her new house, ''it's appreciating right now.''
 Still, even some mortgage brokers are concerned by how much their clients are stretching their spending power using creative mortgages. 
 One possible warning sign is that a growing share of those taking out the aggressive loans is made up of lower-income families living in expensive areas, according to Economy.com, a research company. Another is that variable-rate mortgages have stayed popular even as long-term, fixed rates have gone down and rates on adjustable mortgages have risen. 
 ''There are people who are buying homes that they shouldn't buy,'' said Eric Appelbaum, president of the Apple Mortgage Corporation in Manhattan. ''People are saying, I can afford it on interest-only but I can't afford it'' with a traditional mortgage, Mr. Appelbaum said. ''It doesn't make any sense.''
 Since borrowers with interest-only mortgages are not yet paying down their debt, they are hoping to build up equity through an increase in home values. If house prices fall, as they did during the early 90's in some cities, borrowers will be forced to bring money to the table when they sell.
 Even if home prices rise a little, borrowers who have taken out option ARM's and made only minimum payments for five years could find themselves in a hole. Such loans, which are typically based on rates that adjust monthly, give homeowners four payment options each month. In the first quarter of 2005, 70 percent of option ARM borrowers made the minimum payment, according to UBS. 
 In doing so, those borrowers effectively added more debt to the back of their loans. 
 On a $400,000 loan, for example, a buyer who made only minimum payments over the first five years would add more than $27,000 to the end of the loan, assuming short-term rates increase by one percentage point over the course of the loan, said Robert Binette, a mortgage broker with Hamilton Mortgage in Ridgefield, Conn. The monthly payment would jump from $1,718 in the final month of the fifth year to $2,580 after the loan was reset, a difference of more than 50 percent.
 Borrowers who expect to cover the larger debt by refinancing could be in trouble if rates have increased. Thirty-year fixed-mortgage rates are near their lowest level in a generation. 
 Nationwide, the increase in monthly payments as more mortgage rates start to float will cost families about an extra $40 billion over the next two years, according to estimates by Credit Suisse First Boston. That is the rough equivalent of a 40-cent increase in gas prices over the same span, which would pinch incomes but would not be likely to create a recession.
 The biggest concern, many economists say, is that the new mortgages have come onto the market at a time when low interest rates and rapidly rising home prices are the only reality many people can imagine. Families might be making decisions assuming that combination will last forever.
 In a speech to bankers in New York, Donald L. Kohn, a Federal Reserve governor, said yesterday that he expected a strong economy over the next few years. 
 ''My message this morning, however, is that this is not a time for complacency,'' he said.
 There is ''significant uncertainty,'' he added, because some recent financial innovations ''have not yet been rigorously stress-tested.''

HEADLINE: Fraud Case Filed Against Ex-Officers Of Bristol

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
Two former executives of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company were indicted yesterday on conspiracy and securities fraud charges related to a wholesale inventory manipulation that artificially inflated company revenues by millions of dollars.
 Bristol-Myers, meanwhile, agreed to pay $300 million in penalties but avoided indictment in connection in the case. 
 The accusations, filed in Newark, charge that Frederick S. Schiff, the company's former finance chief, and Richard J. Lane, who ran its worldwide medicines group, misled investors by concealing the excess inventory held by Bristol-Myers wholesalers, a result of an aggressive program of rebates and discounts offered by the company to meet its sales targets.
 The $300 million will compensate shareholders financially harmed by the manipulation as part of a ''deferred prosecution'' agreement. In addition, Bristol-Myers agreed to establish an endowed chair in business ethics at the Seton Hall University Law School in Newark. 
 With the $300 million, Bristol-Myers will have paid a total of $839 million in penalties related to the scheme, involving a practice called channel stuffing, which occurred from 1999 to 2001. A spokesman for Bristol-Myers, Tony Plohoros, said yesterday that it planned to take a charge of $249 million in the current quarter to cover the settlement. 
 Also as part of the agreement, the chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, will give up his title as chairman. That job will be filled by the former American Express chief, James Robinson III. The agreement, which was reached between Bristol-Myers and Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney in Newark, lifts a cloud that has hung over the company since April 2002, when Mr. Dolan announced that sales would be sharply lower than expected because wholesalers had been stocking excess inventories of its products.
 The company, based in New York, later restated results, lowering revenue by $2.5 billion and profit by $900 million.
 Mr. Dolan's announcement led to investigations, both by Mr. Christie's office and by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as investor lawsuits. 
 The case also had a profound impact on the pharmaceutical industry, essentially bringing to an end a common practice known as speculative buying in which wholesalers held excess inventory in advance of price increases. Speculative buying was the way wholesalers made much of their profits. With the elimination of the practice, manufacturers have been forced to enter agreements to compensate wholesalers in other ways. 
 Inventory practices at Bristol-Myers went beyond those of other companies, Mr. Christie's office charged, employing accounting and bookkeeping gimmicks to mask the increasing rise in wholesaler inventory levels. 
 In announcing the agreement and related indictments yesterday, Mr. Christie said the scheme reflected a corporate culture at Bristol-Myers at the time that emphasized higher sales at all costs as the company strove to meet Wall Street profit forecasts. The inventory manipulation made it appear that demand for Bristol-Myers's products was greater than it actually was, raising the company's sales and outlook.
 ''These people had knowledge which they should have disclosed to the investing public, which they did not,'' Mr. Christie said. ''It's not a channel-stuffing case. It's a failure-to- disclose case.'' 
 Mr. Schiff, 57, of Manhattan and Mr. Lane, 54, of Doylestown, Pa., were expected to appear in United States District Court in Newark today to answer the accusations, which could result in up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million.
 The indictment accuses both men of misleading investment analysts. 
 In October 2000, the indictment said, Mr. Lane responded to an analyst's question about wholesaler inventories by saying, ''I don't think there was any significant wholesaler inventory activity in the quarter.'' 
 In April 2001, Mr. Schiff responded similarly when asked by an investment analyst, the indictment charged, saying, ''There are no unusual items that we see in the inventory levels.'' 
 A lawyer for Mr. Schiff, David M. Zornow, issued a statement yesterday that his client vigorously denied wrongdoing and accused the government of ''overreaching.'' 
 ''Mr. Schiff did not operate in a vacuum; his conduct was appropriate at all times and known to many others, both inside and outside the company,'' the statement said.
 Mr. Lane's lawyer, Richard M. Strassberg, said his client was ''innocent of all charges'' and ''intends to fight them.'' 
 At one point, it was believed that Mr. Dolan and his predecessor, Charles A. Heimbold Jr., were under investigation. Mr. Christie said yesterday that he would not comment on any individuals who were not charged.
 Under the deferred-prosecution agreement, Mr. Christie's office filed a criminal complaint against Bristol-Myers, but agreed not to prosecute it for two years. If the company complies with its obligations to the government, the criminal charges will be dismissed.
 In addition to the $300 million fine, the chair at Seton Hall, and the appointment of Mr. Robinson as a non-executive board chairman, the company agreed to continue employing a former United States district judge, Frederick B. Lacey, to monitor its operations. 
 The company is also required to appoint an additional nonexecutive director acceptable to Mr. Christie's office. 
 Deferred-prosecution agreements are becoming increasingly common in corporate prosecutions. While some have criticized them as slaps on the wrist, the arrangements were defended by Mr. Christie yesterday in a statement. 
 ''We balanced the need for punishment with an acknowledgement that this company provides great value and that its work should continue,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Indian Casino Revenues Grow To Sizable Segment of Industry

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

 BODY:
Indian casino revenues continued to grow rapidly last year, reaching $19billion, a sum that makes the casinos two-thirds as big as all the commercial casinos, according to a report released yesterday by the Analysis Group, a consulting firm.
 With revenues generated by Indian casinos climbing 12 percent last year, compared with 6.7 percent for commercial casinos, the gap between the categories continues to shrink and is quite likely to become smaller, the report said. As recently as 2001, the revenues of Indian casinos were half those of commercial casinos, the report found. 
 The conclusions by the Analysis Group, based in Los Angeles, are important because Indian casinos have become a hotly debated issue in many regions as their revenues have exploded. The findings in the fourth annual report are similar to those in a report this year by the National Indian Gaming Association, a group that represents tribes with casinos. The Analysis Group underscores the growing economic effects of Indian casinos, not only for the tribes' welfare, but also for nearby communities, businesses, taxpayers and politicians.
 The report said 228 tribes operated 405 casinos in 30 states compared with 443 commercial casinos. The Indian casinos supported 539,000 jobs and paid $19.4billion in wages last year, the report said.
 Although Indian casinos are exempt from state and local property and profits taxes under federal law, they accounted for $6.2billion in tax revenue generated from employees and other businesses, the report said. In addition, with more tribes splitting part of their profits with state governments to gain permission to open casinos, such revenue sharing reached $900million last year, up from $733million in 2003.
 Alan Meister, the manager of the Analysis Group who wrote the report, said some Indian casinos' growth rates were beginning to slow as ''local markets mature'' with many casinos being built. But, he said, ''Indian gaming is continuing to grow at a fast pace.''
 Mr. Meister estimated that Indian casinos had revenues of $19billion last year, compared with $28.3billion for commercial casinos. In 2001, Indian casinos had $12.8billion in revenues, compared with $25.5billion for commercial casinos.
 The executive director of the National Indian Gaming Association, Mark Van Norman, said Indian casinos were highly likely to keep growing, especially in Florida, where Gov. Jeb Bush decided on Tuesday to allow the Seminoles to install slot machines in their casinos. The tribe now operates just electronic bingo games.
 More Indian casinos are also likely in the Catskill region near New York City as part of a land-claims pact proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki.

HEADLINE: Plan to Connect Rural India To the Internet

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 15 

 BODY:
An international consortium, including Indian and American companies as well as the World Bank, is planning to establish thousands of rural Internet centers in India to bring government, banking and education services to isolated villages.
 The project, to be announced Thursday, is intended to bring Internet-based services to individuals who must often travel long distances to conduct banking or business with the government. It is being undertaken by Comat Technologies, an Indian provider of Internet services; ICICI Bank, India's second- largest commercial bank; and Wyse Technology of San Jose, Calif., which makes computer terminal equipment. 
 The goal is to serve rural villages with populations of more than 5,000. Ultimately the plan calls for centers or kiosks in 5,000 villages in the state of Karnataka; Bangalore, the Indian high-technology center, is the capital of Karnataka. 
 The project, subsidized by the state government, will include money to train residents in computer skills. It comes after some disappointing results of earlier efforts to bridge the digital divide, which separates the Internet-connected world from less-developed areas.
 The centers, connected to the Internet by either land lines or satellite links, are each to consist of 5 to 10 inexpensive ''thin clients,'' simple computer displays that are more rugged and less expensive than personal computers. 
 The project will begin with a technical demonstration in 4 villages, and then be extended to 20 others, according to Andi Dervishi, an investment officer at the Global Information and Communication Technologies division of the World Bank. 
 He said the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank would act initially as a nonfinancial partner but was hoping to be able to finance the growth of the project if the early trials go well.
 John Kish, the president and chief executive of Wyse, said thin clients, also called network computers, have long been held out as a promising low-cost way to deliver Internet content and computer services. The falling cost of PC's has until now made them financially unattractive.

HEADLINE: Gas Prices Increase in New York Region as They Fall in Rest of U.S.

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Gasoline prices in the New York region hit a 27-year high last month, according to the federal government. Like so many economic trends, the price increase placed the city out of sync with the rest of the nation, where gas prices fell slightly last month after a year of startling increases.
 Retail prices in the New York area fell .5 percent in May. The price New Yorkers paid to stay overnight in other cities dropped, pushing housing prices down 1.3 percent last month compared with May 2004. (In figuring the cost of shelter, the federal government includes how much New Yorkers spend on out-of-town lodging.) 
 But falling out-of-town lodging prices were offset by increases in the cost of rent, clothing and other items. And the biggest increase was at the gas pump.
 In May, gas prices in the region rose 11.8 percent over the same month a year ago, to the highest level since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking gas prices in the area in 1978. Gas prices in the region rose .6 percent from April to May alone, while dropping 2.9 percent nationally during that same period, possibly signaling that New Yorkers have not felt the level of sticker shock at the pump that has hit other Americans over the last 18 months.
 ''The rise in gas prices in the city started later, and the increases were initially not as great,'' said Michael L. Dolfman, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which oversees the Consumer Price Index, a measure of consumer spending for a variety of goods and services. ''What we might be seeing now is catch-up.'' 
 The Consumer Price Index, which is not seasonally adjusted, measures spending in New York City and northern New Jersey. Overall consumer prices have risen 3.4 percent since January, according to the index. 
 ''The month-to-month movements tend to be erratic,'' said Jason Bram, a regional economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
 In May, New Yorkers continued to hit the streets in search of four walls and a window, and real estate remained a sellers' market. For instance, rents on primary residences rose 4.5 percent in May compared with May 2004, and 5.3 percent in New York City alone. Prices for housing sales rose 4.1 percent in the region from May 2004 to May 2005. 
 The commercial real estate market remained especially sinewy in Midtown Manhattan and northern New Jersey, according to the Federal Reserve, which released its own report yesterday on the region's economy. 
 But the bank noted weaknesses in the local economy. For instance, rainy days and cold nights hampered retailers, who reported disappointing sales for May. ''People were trying to sell bathing suits when people were still looking for their sweaters,'' Mr. Bram said. 
 Also among the bank's findings were weaknesses in April and May in the financial sector, which tends to drive the local economy. Many firms reported weak trading volume and softening profits, and Mr. Bram said ''the concern is that hiring in the securities industry will slow in the second half of the year.''

HEADLINE: Exploring a Maligned Region So Many Think They Know

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
''The Appalachians'' is an elegant film about a people and a region that are rarely examined beyond stereotypes. The writer and producer, Phyllis Geller, and the West Virginia-born executive producer, Mari-Lynn C. Evans, want the world to know that the people who live in the Appalachians from West Virginia to Alabama have a proud heritage and have gotten a supremely raw deal from the news media.
 The film, which begins tonight on Channel 21 with the first of three one-hour episodes, goes back centuries to tell its story. The original Appalachian people were American Indians, of course, dominated by the Cherokees. In the early 17th century, they were joined by a few European settlers. Then, in the 1730's, ancestors of today's Appalachians began arriving in greater numbers, from Germany, England, Wales and Northern Ireland (the Scotch-Irish, already part of a hybrid culture). 
 Like any smart documentary, ''The Appalachians'' puts scholars and celebrities on camera. They include professors from the Universities of Pennsylvania and Kentucky, Tennessee State University and Appalachian State University, in Boone, N.C. The celebrities are musicians, including Loretta Lynn, Ricky Skaggs and Johnny Cash, in his last film interview, two months before his death in September 2003. Mr. Cash even sings a little.
 Music is a mainstay of Appalachian culture and a satisfying aspect of the film, which describes today's country music as having begun with the Irish fiddle, the German dulcimer, the Italian mandolin and the African banjo.
 Mr. Cash tells of an Irishman who insisted that the Cash song ''Forty Shades of Green'' was an old Irish folk tune. Mr. Skaggs had a similar experience when a member of the Chieftains, the Irish band, heard his music and said, ''That's the way they play in Donegal.'' 
 By the time of the Great Depression, music had come to play a restorative emotional role in Appalachian life. The Grand Ole Opry had its beginnings one day in 1925 when a preacher who was supposed to speak on WSM Radio didn't show up and an elderly fiddler, Jimmy Thompson, who happened to be nearby, went on in his place.
 Gospel got its start, the film's narrator says, when whites and blacks mingled at tent revival meetings. Religion was, in its way, diverse (''over 40 varieties of Baptists''), but war and big business had just as much influence.
 Young Appalachian men helped win the Revolutionary War and afterward found their region's most important product, whiskey, heavily taxed by George Washington's federal government. Thousands of young mountain men died at Antietam in the Civil War, a conflict that left ''a climate of fear and mistrust'' of authority and outsiders. 
 Chronologically, the next major event was the infamous feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys. This was a dispute more about economics than folkways, though. Both families were in the timber business, but the Hatfields were far more successful. Their battles were fought with lawyers as well as with guns.
 As railroads grew, coal mining became important but the Appalachians never got rich from their land. They were tricked into selling the mineral rights to their land by Northern and Midwestern investors, who made a point of depicting the locals as feral, backward and obstructionist. The Appalachians ended up working as miners for the outsiders, who paid low wages and hired trigger-happy ''security forces'' to squelch efforts to unionize. 
 There were signs of hope, when Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced the New Deal. Running for president in 1960, John F. Kennedy brought attention to the poverty in the area, but ''The Appalachians'' questions his motives. By the time Charles Kuralt made his television documentary ''Christmas in Appalachia,'' the locals were sick and tired of being condescended to. And many still are. This film is a welcome first step toward a new image for a population apparently still unprotected by political correctness.

HEADLINE: How Some Popular Bills Die Slowly and Quietly in Albany 

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 15 

 BODY:
For more than a year, consumer groups have been seeking to push through a law to make it easier to lease cars in New York. Last week, it looked as if the measure just might squeak through the little-known Assembly Transportation Committee, despite opposition from trial lawyers, a powerful lobby in the Capitol.
 Just as the bill was poised for a vote with the potential of embarrassing the Assembly leader, a few curious things happened. The committee's chairman abruptly pulled it from the agenda. A freshman lawmaker, who said he was leaning toward supporting the measure, said he could see good points ''on both sides.'' And a veteran Long Island lawmaker who had co-sponsored the legislation was reassigned from the committee after Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver offered him a seat on a more desirable one. 
 A result was that the legislation stalled, leaving unchanged a law that makes it quite hard to lease a car in New York. 
 The problems the measure encountered as lawmakers began wrapping up their business for the end of the session was a textbook case, critics say, of how a proposal that has wide support can die a quiet death if it faces opposition from powerful legislative leaders. 
 But it was not the only case of a popular bill's dying as lawmakers wind down their affairs. In the Senate, lawmakers have been trying since last year to close a legal loophole that environmentalists say has left many small, isolated wetlands around the state vulnerable to unregulated development. 
 The measure has the support of Gov. George E. Pataki, and Assembly Democrats, too, have backed the effort to better govern wetlands under 12.4 acres in size. But one man, Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate's Republican majority leader, has consistently resisted it, saying it is an unnecessary burden on businesses and would hurt a struggling upstate economy and cost jobs. 
 Several government watchdog groups have pointed to the failure to act on those two issues as prime examples of the continuing legislative dysfunction in Albany, the passage of the state's first on-time budget in two decades notwithstanding. Specifically, the groups say, the cases illustrate how well-meaning legislation meant to fix a problem can get stuck in the gears of government even though they have the support of most rank-and-file lawmakers.
 It is a story that cuts across ideological and partisan lines, whether it is the Republican-led Senate, the Democratic-led Assembly or the governor's office that sidelines legislation, said Rachel Leon, the executive director of Common Cause New York, a nonprofit organization that monitors state government. ''It is true that in the high-pressure end-of-session climate, powerful leaders have a lot of say in what goes forward and what doesn't,'' Ms. Leon said. ''You are talking about an environment where three men, either in a room or out of a room, spell victory or failure for many issues.''
 To Mr. Bruno, the wetlands proposal would create a costly impediment to a state regulatory system that is already among the ''most stringent and protective'' in the nation, said his spokesman, John E. McArdle, who also said several Republican senators besides Mr. Bruno were opposed to it. 
 ''It's a bad bill,'' Mr. McArdle said. ''We have, particularly here in New York State, a problem upstate; it's called an economy that's hurting, and this bill would inhibit the ability of this state, particularly the upstate economy, to go forward. It places unreasonable limits on the ability to construct or the ability to invest and the ability to create jobs.''
 On the Assembly bill, many in civic groups as well as some Democratic legislators said they detected Mr. Silver's hand in the Transportation Committee proceedings. Mr. Silver, a trial lawyer, opposes changing the present law, which holds the owners of leased vehicles responsible for any accidents, even if the car is not in their possession. That law has deterred auto leasing in New York. 
 Eileen Larrabee, a spokeswoman for Mr. Silver, vehemently defended the process by which the measure was moving through the Assembly. She said that no Assembly rules were violated and that the bill would come up for a vote sometime in a two-year period, a standard she said was more stringent than in the Senate. Individual Assembly members on Wednesday resisted any criticism of Mr. Silver or the process. 
 In fact, Assemblyman David F. Gantt, the committee chairman, said it was not clear that the measure would pass and that the item was pulled from the agenda because ''it was a tie vote'' among the 24 members. Assemblyman George S. Latimer, a freshman Democrat on the committee who said he had leaned toward supporting the measure, said the speaker was one of many members who tried to influence him. He said, however, that he had not taken an official position yet, despite contentions by lobbyists that he now opposed it.
 Assemblyman Robert K. Sweeney, the Democratic co-sponsor of the bill, said he left the Transportation Committee because Mr. Silver's offer to go to the Rules Committee was too good to pass up. He refused to speculate on Mr. Silver's motives. ''I'm not going to question that,'' he said. His move creates a vacancy that has not yet been filled, and takes away a crucial vote for the measure. Assemblyman Ron Canestrari, the other cosponsor, said: ''Well, I'm very happy with Bob Sweeney. It's a good opportunity for him, he's moving up.''
 Dick Dadey, the executive director of the Citizens Union, a nonprofit civic group, said the Assembly's behavior was unusual but not alarming. ''The speaker controls the agenda, the committee assignment, the flow of legislation, the vote and the eventual outcome of all of it, and nothing in the Assembly happens unless the speaker wants it to,'' Mr. Dadey said. ''And this is a very strong example of the raw power he has and how he can exercise it to affect the outcome he wants.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Decline for First Time in 10 Months

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15 

 BODY:
Consumer prices edged down in May for the first time in nearly a year, helped by lower energy prices.
 The Labor Department reported Wednesday that prices declined 0.1 percent last month, the first drop in 10 months, as gasoline and oil prices fell sharply.
 More important, the core rate of inflation -- excluding the volatile prices of food and energy -- was almost flat for a second consecutive month and lower than Wall Street analysts had expected.
 The report provided new evidence that inflationary pressure may have peaked for the year -- and peaked at the lowest level of any business cycle since 1960. 
 The report also indicated that the big run-up in oil prices this spring has had only a limited impact on inflation in the rest of the economy. 
 The figures were good news for the Federal Reserve, which has been nervous about inflationary pressure for months and is ratcheting up interest rates.
 But Fed officials are still worried about rising labor costs, which account for more than two-thirds of total business costs. 
 Hourly compensation for nonfarm business workers increased 6.3 percent in the first three months of the year, more than twice the increase in productivity, the Labor Department estimated this month.
 ''It's very early to be calling a peak on inflation,'' said Ethan Harris, chief economist at Lehman Brothers. ''Labor is roughly 70 percent of total costs, so the most important component of business costs is going up.''
 The Fed is all but certain to nudge rates again at its policy meeting on June 30, and probably again in August. But if inflation remains low, policy makers could feel more comfortable about pausing in the fall.
 Energy prices, which had risen rapidly since January as a result of soaring oil prices, declined 2 percent in May. Gasoline prices fell 4.4 percent, though they were still 10 percent higher than a year earlier.
 Food prices were almost flat in May, with fresh fruits, vegetables, meat and eggs all rising much more slowly than in previous months.
 The core measure of consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose 0.1 percent in May after staying flat in April. Compared with a year earlier, the core measure of consumer prices was up 2.2 percent in May.
 Prices for clothing were flat, with heavy discounting for women's and girls' apparel. 
 Transportation costs were also flat, mainly because of lower fuel costs, but higher airline prices pushed up the cost of public transportation 0.7 percent.
 The cost of shelter rose 0.1 percent, mainly because of a big drop in prices for hotels and motels. The price of rental housing increased 0.2 percent.
 Analysts said the Fed was still all but certain to raise the federal funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, at its next two policy meetings. The Fed has raised the overnight rate eight times in the last year, to 3 percent from 1 percent. 
 Fed officials still think rates are below an undefined ''neutral'' level that does not promote inflation.
 Donald L. Kohn, a governor on the Federal Reserve Board, repeated the central bank's standard line on Wednesday that monetary policy is still ''accommodative,'' a signal that the rates need to keep rising.
 Mr. Kohn also warned more urgently than before that the United States is plagued by major imbalances, led by an extremely low rate of savings and a soaring level of foreign debt. 
 ''We are buying far more than we produce,'' Mr. Kohn said, ''and the extra purchases come from importing more than we export, financed by net borrowing from abroad.''
 Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, gave the same message last week to lawmakers on the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, repeating the Fed's intention to raise rates at a ''measured'' pace.
 In a separate report on Wednesday, the Fed reported that industrial production climbed 0.4 percent in May, twice as fast as many analysts had expected and a rebound from sluggish activity in previous months.
 That report also estimated that factories were running at about 79.4 percent of capacity, up slightly from the month before but still below historical averages.
 Most forecasters say that economic growth slowed in the second quarter of this year, to a bit more than 3 percent from 3.5 percent in the first three months of this year.
 That could set the stage for inflationary pressure to keep receding in the months ahead, or at least for prices to stabilize. 
 David Rosenberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said the core level of inflation might have peaked earlier this year at an annual pace of 2.4 percent. That would be the lowest peak in any business cycle since 1960, he noted, and could be a prelude to new signs of deflation, or declining prices, in commodities and manufactured goods.
 Other analysts were more cautious, but supported the idea that the underlying pace of inflation may have peaked.
 ''Prices are stabilizing,'' said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America. ''The Fed has been very successful in restraining inflation expectations, and expectations are the key to the whole process.''

HEADLINE: Same City, Same Night, Different Opinions About Music

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
Two different jazz festivals gave traditionally different views of jazz in New York on Tuesday night: uptown and downtown, corporate and grassroots, trimmed hedges and wildflowers. It was both opening night of the JVC-New York Jazz Festival and opening night of the Vision Festival. 
 JVC arranges its many shows over the next two weeks in different theaters. The first show was ''100 Years and a Day,'' a tribute to the trumpeter Doc Cheatham, in Jazz at Lincoln Center's Rose Theater. It had soul, if not a lot of sparks. 
 Cheatham, who would have turned 100 this year (he died in 1997) valued musical economy, and the eradication of cliche (or of glibness, at least) settled in as the theme of the night. A downside of the tribute-concert tradition in jazz is an overload of notes, but this one managed to save its breath while exuding a shared history.
 Five trumpeters (or fluegelhornists) were on hand: Clark Terry, Warren Vache, Randy Sandke, Jimmy Owens and Theodore Croker, who is Cheatham's 19-year-old grandson. They took their places, singly or in groups, in front of Cheatham's old Sweet Basil rhythm section. Special care was taken to present Cheatham's favorite songs, like ''I Want a Little Girl'' and ''Way Down Yonder in New Orleans,'' as well as others by Ellington and Eubie Blake, Gershwin and Monk.
 It was sweet, bright, lyrical music, with swing's sharpening edge, and Louis Armstrong, Cheatham's prime influence, hovering over everything. The singer Catherine Russell joined the band for ''I Cover the Waterfront'' and some others, and the saxophonists Jimmy Heath and Frank Wess played as well, with the 83-year-old Mr. Wess particularly authoritative on ''The Man I Love.'' 
 The show worked partly because George Wein, the head producer of the JVC festival, has an emotional stake in Cheatham. (He first saw him in the 40's, and later hired him to play at his Boston club, Mahogany Hall, in 1952.) He appeared as the festival's presiding conscience, playing piano and singing ''Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams'' in his soft, flutey voice, adding trills to the end of each line. 
 Down at the Vision Festival, which continues through Sunday at the Angel Orensanz Foundation for the Arts on the Lower East Side, other memories were being relived: the underground, do-it-yourself, free-jazz scene that has persisted since the early 1960's. The house was packed for a walloping, effective set by group of elders, an ad-hoc band called WARM, which stands for the bassist Reggie Workman, the drummer Pheeroan Aklaff, and the saxophonists Sam Rivers and Roscoe Mitchell. Mr. Aklaff, who emerged in the late 1970's, is the junior member, while the other three have been crucial to various kinds of avant-garde jazz since the 1960's. 
 The two saxophonists snaked through a unison line, and then the band was off, with rhythm based on consensual intuition and arrangement based on the process of building waves and making them recede.
 Mr. Mitchell, as he often does, revved up the music by playing a long, unbroken alto saxophone solo with circular breathing, colliding scales and registers; bass and drum solos followed that mirrored the same desire, to express the totality of the instrument with each stroke. 
 A second piece started slow and balladlike, with Mr. Rivers (on tenor saxophone) and Mr. Mitchell piping against bass alone, and Mr. Aklaff gradually filtering in a swing rhythm that ballooned into house rocking; it subsided, then built up again, like the tide. Near the end, Mr. Mitchell played the opening line from John Coltrane's blues ''Chasin' the Trane''; it may have been the only direct quotation of the set, but the form of the music itself, following old, deep conventions of American avant-garde jazz, was a kind of long quotation, too.

The JVC-New York Jazz Festival continues through Saturday, June 25, at various places in Manhattan and Brooklyn; www.festivalproductions.net. The Vision Festival continues through Sunday at Angel Orensanz Foundation for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side; www.visionfestival.org.


CORRECTION-DATE: June 22, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A jazz review on Thursday about the JVC-New York Jazz Festival and the Vision Festival misidentified the song on which the saxophonist Frank Wess was ''particularly authoritative'' at the Rose Theater. It was ''Oh, Lady Be Good!'' (not ''The Man I Love'').

HEADLINE: 5 Top Unions Join Forces, Raising the Threat of a Labor Rift

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The likelihood of a schism in organized labor increased yesterday when five major unions formed a growth-oriented coalition and the presidents of four of the unions hinted strongly that they might quit the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
 The presidents of the Teamsters, the United Food and Commercial Workers, and Unite Here yesterday joined an earlier threat by the Service Employees International Union to end their affiliations because they are so unhappy with the labor federation.
 ''We believe that this labor movement needs to be born again,'' said Bruce Raynor, president of Unite Here, which represents hotel, restaurant and apparel workers. ''The labor movement as personified by the current A.F.L.-C.I.O. structure has been unsuccessful in standing up for working families.'' 
 The four unions represent nearly one-third of the members of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., a federation of 57 unions and 13 million workers, and if they quit it would greatly weaken the federation, hurt its budget and cause fighting within labor.
 At a news conference in Washington, the leaders of the five unions forming the new coalition -- the fifth is the Laborers' International Union of North America -- said they were banding together to promote aggressive union organizing because they believed that the federation and most of its unions had done too little to organize nonunion workers.
 ''The basic principle that brings us here today is that American workers cannot win a better life unless more workers belong to unions,'' the union presidents said in a statement. ''If the labor movement doesn't adopt dramatic changes today to cope with the new economy, it will find itself marginalized into oblivion. We come together today to prevent that.''
 The statement was signed by Mr. Raynor; John W. Wilhelm, president of Unite Here's hotel and restaurant division; James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters president; Joe Hansen, president of the food and commercial workers; Andrew Stern, president of the service employees; and Terence O'Sullivan, president of the laborers' union. 
 Several union leaders said the threats to quit were largely meant to pressure John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. for the last decade, not to seek another four-year term. Mr. Sweeney has expressed confidence that he will be re-elected next month at the federation's convention in Chicago.
 In an unusual move, Mr. Sweeney issued a statement yesterday criticizing the coalition before the union presidents had announced it. The new group, called the Change to Win Coalition, will have its own bylaws, constitution, budget and staff. 
 ''Workers are under the biggest assault in 80 years,'' Mr. Sweeney said. ''Now more than ever we need a united labor movement. The clearest path to growing the union movement and helping more workers form unions is by exercising our greatest strength -- solidarity. Now is the time to use our unity to build real worker power, not create a real divide that serves the corporations and antiworker politicians.''
 The five union presidents said the issue was not personalities or Mr. Sweeney, but rather principles to help unions grow. Several union presidents said they would press the Chicago convention to adopt accountability standards, like requiring all member unions to do a specific amount of organizing and to have the capacity, in terms of money and trained organizers, to grow.
 Mr. Sweeney said there are few differences in principle between the sides. He said he was getting the federation and its members to spend more than ever on organizing.
 But Mr. Hoffa, of the Teamsters, said Mr. Sweeney's organizing efforts did not go far enough. The five unions, he said, have called for using $72 million of the federation's budget for organizing, versus the $22.5 million that Mr. Sweeney has proposed. Mr. Sweeney has said that many of the federation's other activities would be crippled if it spent so much on organizing.
 A Sweeney supporter, Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, criticized the new coalition. ''Forming this coalition is a step in the wrong direction because it's the first step toward a truly divided labor movement,'' he said. ''Splitting the A.F.L.-C.I.O. will mean less power for workers.''

HEADLINE: Long Island Tops the Docket For Dishonesty Among Lawyers

BYLINE: By JULIA C. MEAD

DATELINE: RIVERHEAD, N.Y. 

 BODY:
For 35 years, Richard Kops enjoyed a respectable though modest career as a lawyer, handling mostly real estate transactions and dispensing free advice to local churches. Then, in the late 1990's, as his wife of 24 years was dying of cancer, he crossed the line.
 Faced with medical bills not covered by insurance, Mr. Kops dipped into client funds held in his escrow account, according to his lawyer and the Suffolk County district attorney's office. He stole a second client's money to pay back the first. Helping to support a grown daughter and her twin sons, another daughter in graduate school, and an elderly aunt, he took a third client's money, then money from a fourth. 
 The dodge went on for years, prosecutors said, until the amount of money his clients clamored to get back exceeded his escrow balance. By 2004, when the police went looking for him, he was living with a daughter in North Carolina and bagging groceries in a supermarket. 
 On Monday, wearing a threadbare jacket and no tie, Mr. Kops, 71, appeared in Suffolk County Criminal Court, a disbarred lawyer pleading for mercy. ''I've committed grievous wrongs against God and mankind,'' he said.
 As a dozen of Mr. Kops's supporters wiped away tears, Justice Robert W. Doyle sentenced him to one and a third to four years in prison.
 Cases of lawyers stealing from their clients are on the rise in New York, state figures show, and most of the lawyers implicated in recent years were middle-aged men who, like Mr. Kops, practiced alone.
 And, like Mr. Kops, a growing number were from Long Island. 
 At the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection, the state agency that reimburses victims of dishonest lawyers, the overall number of clients seeking reimbursement from New York lawyers jumped to 627 last year from 442 in 1999. The fund paid out $5.1 million last year, including $3.7 million stemming from real estate transactions in which lawyers, including Mr. Kops, absconded with escrow funds. Nassau and Suffolk lawyers accounted for 41 percent of the thefts and other losses in real estate deals statewide during that period and half of the reimbursements made by the fund to clients, an analysis by the fund showed.
 An increasing number of Long Island lawyers ended up behind bars for other reasons, too. Since 2002, Suffolk prosecutors have convicted 16 lawyers of crimes ranging from drug possession to theft. Since 2001, Nassau prosecutors have convicted 21. Together, the two district attorney offices have recovered about $3.1 million in stolen funds and obtained another $3.5 million in judgments.
 Edward Heilig, the chief of the Suffolk district attorney's economic crimes bureau, said a dozen other lawyers were under investigation there.
 ''These guys, they start taking a little bit, thinking they're going to put it back before anyone finds out,'' Mr. Heilig said. ''They're usually middle-aged because it takes that long to build up a practice and get a lot of clients to trust them with money. On the other hand, they have big egos, convince themselves they know what they're doing.''
 Roy D. Simon Jr., a professor of legal ethics at Hofstra University, called it the ''bust-out factor.'' A midcareer lawyer with an established practice could have more than $1 million in escrow on any given day, he noted. ''As long as there's a conveyor belt of new cases coming in, it'll look for a while like everything is O.K.,'' Professor Simon said, agreeing that this is also the flawed logic behind a pyramid scheme.
 Although the overall number of dishonest lawyers represents less than one-third of 1 percent of the 215,000 in New York, the fund trustees are pushing leaders on Long Island for explanations and solutions.
 ''At this point, we just can't say with any certainty what causes it,'' said Timothy J. O'Sullivan, the executive director of the fund. He said theories include substance abuse, gambling or other personal crises.
 The tough competition may also be a factor, some lawyers said. Long Island has about 14,000 lawyers, more than Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx combined, according to the New York State Bar Association.
 Another reason is that the majority of lawyers on Long Island are solo practitioners with no oversight from partners or co-workers. Professor Simon said those lawyers often had access to considerable amounts of cash, given the region's competitive real estate market and large down payments, but there is often no one double-checking the books.
 And, he added, the overall economy has not helped.
 ''A lot of lawyers got rich in the late 90's, then found themselves overextended,'' he said.
 The Nassau and Suffolk bar association presidents said they were dismayed, but stressed that the overall incidence of misconduct by lawyers was low.
 The Nassau president, Judge Susan T. Kluewer of Nassau District Court, said her executive board was doing its own study of the problem. Scott M. Karson, her counterpart in Suffolk, wrote to the fund on May 24, noting that dishonesty is not exclusive to the legal profession.
 ''Simply put, the profession suffers substantial damage -- even if it is caused by a minuscule number of its members -- in terms of maintaining the trust and confidence of our clients, our standing in the community and our collective self-esteem,'' he wrote. Despite that, he concluded that the best deterrent was criminal prosecution, and the best remedy was the fund itself.
 The grievance committee for the 10th Judicial District, a separate agency charged with investigating complaints of lawyer misconduct in Nassau and Suffolk, saw grievances against lawyers increase to 2,979 in 2003 from 2,238 in 1994. In 2003, the committee recommended that the Appellate Division suspend eight Long Island lawyers and disbar four; in 1994, the panel urged that 17 be suspended and 15 disbarred. Faith Lorenzo, the committee's executive director, declined requests for an interview.
 Last year, the state's chief judge, Judith S. Kaye, created a 28-member commission to study solo practitioners and small firms. The panel is not discussing Long Island specifically, and its report, due out by the fall, will address only statewide issues, said June Castellano, the commission's chairwoman.
 But some lawyers on Long Island, speaking from experience, contended that competition was indeed a contributor.
 ''I personally think there is a glut, and competition for clients creates temptations,'' said Joan McNichol, a former president of the New York Women's Bar Association. ''But I don't honestly understand the temptation. It's not my money and never think of it as my money.''
 She said the Appellate Division's Second Department scrutinized lawyers in its jurisdiction, but stiff competition, high caseloads and costly overhead translate into irresistible temptation.
 ''These midcareer attorneys, they may be feeling squeezed out of the market, so that's the effect that all those new, young attorneys are having,'' she said.
 But Eric Schultz, chairman of the Nassau bar association's real property law committee, said: ''We are in business to make money, but we're not just selling groceries or sweaters. We take an oath to uphold the law. And an escrow account is not a line of credit.''

HEADLINE: 3 Accused Of Fraud In Newspaper Circulation

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Three former circulation employees of Newsday, the Long Island newspaper, and Hoy, the Spanish language paper, were arrested yesterday in connection with schemes to inflate circulation figures at the newspapers and cheat advertisers out of millions of dollars. Two of them pleaded not guilty, while the third is to be arraigned within the next 10 days.
 The United States attorney's office in Brooklyn, which announced the arrests, said they were the first in an investigation into fraudulent circulation schemes at Newsday and Hoy from 2002 to 2004. All three executives were fired by the Tribune Company, which owns both publications, after its own internal investigation last year. 
 Those arrested were Edward Smith, former administrative manager of circulation at Newsday and a consultant to both Newsday and Hoy; Robert Garcia, Newsday's former circulation manager for New York City and former sales and distribution manager for Hoy; and Richard Czark, a former circulation employee at Newsday and former national circulation manager of Hoy.
 All were charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud, which carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison, fines of $250,000 and five years' probation.
 Mr. Smith and Mr. Garcia, who were arrested in New York yesterday morning, were released on $250,000 bail, according to Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for the United States attorney's office. Prosecutors now have 30 days to bring an indictment. Mr. Czark, who was arrested in South Carolina, is being extradited to New York.
 ''The schemes uncovered to date cheated advertisers out of millions of dollars paid for ads in papers that were dumped or never paid for,'' the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Roslynn R. Mauskopf, said in a statement. She said the arrests were intended ''to restore transparency and fairness to the newspaper and magazine advertising marketplace.''
 Stu Vincent, a spokesman for Newsday in Melville, N.Y., said that the paper had cooperated fully with the federal investigation and that the government's findings were consistent with those of the company's internal investigation. He also said Newsday expected more arrests.
 ''We don't anticipate that this is it,'' he said. More than a dozen of Newsday's circulation employees were fired or took early retirement after the schemes were uncovered in 2004. ''How many are in the sights of the U.S. attorney, we can't say,'' Mr. Vincent said.
 Prosecutors said the schemes involved payments to an agency to make sham purchases of Newsday copies, which were dumped. They also said Newsday managers, whom they did not identify, at one point invited representatives from the Audit Bureau of Circulations to observe their sales staff and then ''recruited numerous bogus customers, including Newsday employees, to buy multiple copies of the newspaper every day for a period of several days.'' 
 After the schemes were uncovered, the Tribune Company set up a pool of $90 million to compensate advertisers who had paid inflated rates. Mr. Vincent, the Newsday spokesman, said the paper had settled with more than 30,000 of the 40,000 advertisers who had been defrauded.
 The scandal also took a toll on the morale and the economics of the newspaper, he said. Since last year, more than 172 jobs at Newsday have been lost, some of them connected to the circulation scandal and some because of economic problems within the newspaper industry, where advertising has been weak.
 ''When the scandal broke in the spring of last year, we lowered our rate cards, and the new lower rates are in effect until the end of this year,'' Mr. Vincent said. Newsday's circulation as of September 2004 was 459,000 daily and 521,000 on Sunday, both down about 100,000 since the scandal.
 He said management was in the process of ''trying to change the culture'' at the paper. This has included rebuilding the circulation department, having the publisher conduct forums with employees and encouraging the reporting of unethical behavior.
 Mr. Vincent also said the newspaper was considering hiring an ombudsman. ''It is certainly something we're considering to help regain the trust of readers,'' he said.

HEADLINE: OPEC Increases Quotas By the Expected Number

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: VIENNA, June 15 

 BODY:
OPEC said on Wednesday that it had agreed to lift its oil production quotas by 500,000 barrels a day, a sign of its unease with soaring worldwide energy demand.
 The decision, which was largely expected, failed to prevent another increase in oil prices. Crude oil futures for July delivery rose 57 cents on Wednesday, to $55.57 a barrel in New York. The price reached a record in April, exceeding $58. The quota increase officially puts the output of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries at 28 million barrels a day, but was considered mostly symbolic because its 11 member nations are already producing about that amount of oil in a rush to cash in on high prices. 
 OPEC also authorized its president, Sheik Ahmad Fahd al-Sabah of Kuwait, to increase the production ceiling by another 500,000 barrels if oil prices remained at current levels or rose further before the group's next meeting, in September.
 The decision by OPEC comes as its members remain perplexed over how to deal with galloping international oil consumption, particularly in China. Representatives from Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, repeatedly said here this week that a lack of refining capacity in industrial countries, instead of a lack of oil supplies, was responsible for the recent surge in prices. 
 Other factors, however, are also clearly pushing oil prices higher. The British oil concern BP, in its annual review of energy trends, said this week that global oil consumption climbed 3.4 percent, or 2.5 million barrels a day, in 2004, the fastest growth rate since 1978. China was responsible for much of this demand, with its overall energy consumption growing 15.1 percent last year, according to Peter Davies, chief economist at BP. 
 Demand is growing at a time when oil production is declining in several regions. For instance, in the United States, daily oil output fell by 160,000 barrels a day last year in a continuation of a long downward trend, BP said. The United States, the world's largest oil consumer, accounts for almost a quarter of the 84 million barrels of oil consumed worldwide each day.
 Saudi Arabia is the only nation with much spare oil production capacity, an anomaly that originated in the 1970's when the American owners of Aramco, the energy concern now controlled by the government in Riyadh, invested heavily in drilling. But that excess oil is not finding buyers because few refineries have been built to process it in recent years, said Ali al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia's oil minister.
 Some of OPEC's own members, meanwhile, are grappling with their own declines in oil production. Output in Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC and recently one of the most vocal supporters of keeping world oil prices high, fell 40,000 barrels a day in May, to 2.12 million barrels, according to the International Energy Agency. Venezuela's oil production has been falling as its national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, struggles to recover from internal strife. 
 Oil production is also down in Iraq, falling 80,000 barrels a day in May, to 1.75 million barrels a day, according to the energy agency, largely because of technical problems in its southern oil fields. Iraq, which is thought to possess the second-largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia, does not have a fixed production quota within OPEC, unlike the group's 10 other members. 
 International oil companies hoping to enter Iraq have had to put their ambitions on hold because of instability in the country more than two years after the removal of Saddam Hussein. Iraq's oil minister, Ibrahim Bahr al-Ulum, said investment contracts with foreign oil concerns would not be signed until the end of 2006 at the earliest, according to Reuters. 
 Increasing oil production is not easy even in countries with political stability and ample oil reserves. Demand for drilling rigs around the world is brisk, with utilization rates of deepwater offshore platforms rising above 90 percent in recent weeks. Building new rigs is also becoming considerably more expensive because of increases in the cost of raw materials. 
 ''Drilling costs are going up faster than cash flow,'' said Edward L. Morse, an executive adviser at Hetco, a New York-based oil trading company. 
 OPEC's members, while certainly benefiting financially from expensive oil, are still concerned that the volatility of the market could portend a collapse in oil prices if alternative fuels become more attractive. World demand for oil shows few signs of contracting, though growth might slow somewhat this year and next.

HEADLINE: Not-Giants Seek Relief From Cost of New Audit Rules

BYLINE: By ELLEN ROSEN

 BODY:
Bluefly, the online discount retailer based in New York that has about 75 employees and $43.8 million in annual sales, has yearly auditing costs of about $150,000. 
 But when a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requiring documentation and auditing of internal controls, known as Section 404, becomes effective for smaller companies in 2006, Bluefly's chief financial officer, Patrick Barry, expects the company's audit costs to triple or even quadruple.
 That could put a major financial burden on the company, which has not yet made a profit despite a sales increase of more than 35 percent in May. 
 It seems that Sarbanes-Oxley, enacted to clean up corporate accounting after the collapse of Enron, could instead clean out many small publicly traded companies. Because of that, the Securities and Exchange Commission has appointed an advisory committee to evaluate ways to ease the regulatory load. That committee will begin a series of nationwide hearings today in New York. 
 Bluefly, which is listed on Nasdaq, says it has no plan to go private to escape Sarbanes-Oxley's stringent financial disclosure rules the way hundreds of other companies have. But Mr. Barry hopes the S.E.C. will alter its interpretation of the law ''so that the same rules don't apply to $50 million companies that apply to the G.E.'s of the world.'' He suggests a set of guidelines with less stringent requirements than a larger company. 
 ''We don't, for example, have an internal audit committee,'' he said. ''Like other small companies, it's just me.''
 Big corporations are complaining about Sarbanes-Oxley, too. But there is little question that the financial burden of compliance falls more heavily on smaller companies. A study by Nasdaq released in April found that, as a percentage of revenue, ''companies that have revenues less than $100 million spent 11 times more than companies with revenues of $2 billion or more.'' Another study, released in March by Financial Executives International, a professional association for corporate financial officers that is based in Washington, said costs averaged $824,000 for companies with annual revenues under $100 million, compared with $1,572,933 for companies with sales of $100 million to $500 million. 
 Those costs and other regulatory rules led the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish an advisory committee for smaller public companies, said Gerald G. Laporte, who heads the agency's Office of Small Business Policy.
 Mr. Barry is one of the committee's 21 members, including lawyers, accountants, venture capitalists and corporate executives. 
 Those who will testify at today's hearing, at the Columbia University School of Law, include Edward S. Knight, Nasdaq's general counsel; Neal L. Wolkoff, chief executive of the American Stock Exchange; Wayne A. Kolins, chairman of the accounting firm BDO Seidman; and banking executives, lawyers and others. The committee's agenda and witness list can be found at www.sec.gov.
 While the scope of the committee's examination will include other regulatory hurdles faced by small businesses, most of the attention will be focused on the S.E.C.'s interpretation of Sarbanes-Oxley. 
 ''Everybody likes Sarbanes-Oxley from the 30,000-foot level because it gives an aura of protecting the investor,'' said Richard D. Brounstein, a committee member and the chief financial officer of the Calypte Biomedical Corporation in Pleasanton, Calif. ''But look at how it's applied. Is it being applied cost effectively? Is there a way to protect the investor in a way that makes more sense for a smaller company?'' 
 The overarching goal of the committee is regulatory streamlining, the members say. ''Our mantra is to keep it simple,'' said Herbert Wander, the committee's co-chairman, who is a veteran securities lawyer and partner in the Chicago firm of Katten Muchin Rosenman. ''We hate to add more requirements, but we need to have more practical standards.'' 
 With more small public companies returning to private status and untold numbers of start-ups questioning whether the cost of going public is worth it, an air of urgency surrounds the proceedings.
 ''Small businesses are the innovators -- the ones that can act quickly and create jobs,'' said Mr. Wander, who shares the chairman's job with James C. Thyen, the chief executive of Kimball International, a maker of furniture and electronics assemblies based in Jasper, Ind. ''There is a fear or suspicion that if they are highly regulated, you won't have publicly held smaller companies.'' 
 A November 2004 study by Christian Leuz, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and Alexander Triantis and Tracy Wang, professors at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, found that of the 380 companies had deregistered their securities with the S.E.C. from 1998 to 2003, with about 200 of those deregistering in 2003 alone. In another study, by a law professor at Emory University School of Law in Atlanta, William J. Carney, found fewer overall deregistrations but nonetheless found a nearly threefold increase in them from 2000 to 2004. The biggest question for small public companies -- there is no widely accepted definition of what qualifies a public company as small and there is no definition in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, either -- is the impact of Section 404 in the act, which requires chief executives and chief financial officers to evaluate the adequacy of a company's financial controls. While many of the nation's big companies have filed these reports, many small companies have qualified as ''nonaccelerated filers'' under S.E.C. rules and received a reprieve until 2006 or 2007, depending on when their fiscal years end. 
 But complying with Section 404, has, as Mr. Wander put it, ''gotten everyone jittery.'' Mr. Barry of Bluefly estimates that the company, which must comply next year, ''will need to hire a third party to document and test our controls, so that I can opine when our auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers comes that our controls are adequate.'' 
 For Mr. Brounstein of Calypte Biomedical full compliance is equally daunting. His company, whose stock is traded on the American Stock Exchange, qualifies as an ''SB filer'' because it had less than $25 million in market capitalization when the stock was issued. He estimates that with no changes in the S.E.C.'s interpretation of the Sarbanes-Oxley rules, Calypte will have to pay at least several hundred thousand dollars more to comply in addition to the $220,000 the company paid in audit fees in 2004. 
 Furthermore, ''some businesses are more complex even though they are relatively small in size,'' which could also add to costs, says Richard M. Leisner, a partner in the Tampa, Fla., law firm of Trenam Kemker, who is a member of the advisory committee. For example, ''the costs may be cheaper if the company is centralized, but if there are plants overseas, which a lot of companies have, it may add to the costs because of multiple systems,'' says Joseph Dennis, another committee member and the executive partner at the McGladrey & Pullen accounting firm in Minneapolis. These expenses may not be the best use of a small company's revenue. ''At the end of the day, what do shareholders do with that information -- that we have documented our billing systems? It may be better to reinvest the capital back in the company,'' Mr. Barry said. 
 Committee members are also concerned with the overall issue of the access to capital on the nation's markets. ''There are many companies that would have considered becoming public but are saying the hell with it,'' says a committee member, James A. Connolly, the president of IBA Capital Funding in Perrineville, N.J. 
 He fears that ''if we don't nurture our microcap space, the farm team space, we are not doing ourselves any favors in our global economy.''
 Mr. Laporte, of the S.E.C., says that capital formation issues and analysts' coverage of the stock of small companies are important to the agency. What is needed, he said, is to get these issues, as well as the securities regulation of small companies, back on track.

HEADLINE: One Possible Cure for the Common Criminal

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel. 
Virginia Postrel (www.dynamist.com) is the author of ''The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness.''

 BODY:
WHEN Jonathan M. Klick worked in Washington, he noticed a striking effect every time the terrorism alert level went from its usual yellow (''elevated'') to the more urgent orange (''high'').
 ''When the terror alert level went up,'' he recalled in an interview, ''you all of a sudden saw zillions of cops around the Capitol and around the Mall.''
 The pattern gave Professor Klick, now a professor of law and economics at Florida State University, an idea for how to examine a tough social science question: Do more police officers in fact reduce crime?
 The answer may seem obvious, but many social scientists have argued that the number of police officers has no effect on crime rates and may even increase them. ''If you look at the studies, particularly in the criminology literature, it's either no effect or actually a positive effect,'' Professor Klick said. 
 Cities with more police officers have more crime. That is probably because cities with high crime rates hire more officers. But it is hard to separate cause and effect, and, assuming that the officers do deter crime, to figure out how big the effect is.
 ''We spend a huge amount on police,'' Alexander Tabarrok, an economist at George Mason University, said in an interview. ''So we want to know not simply do police reduce crime, but by how much. Should we have more police?'' 
 He and Professor Klick examine the question in a study published in the April 2005 Journal of Law and Economics, ''Using Terror Alert Levels to Estimate the Effect of Police on Crime.'' (A copy of the article is available at http://mason.gmu.edu/atabarro/TabarrokPublishedPapers.html.)
 To separate cause and effect, researchers need a ''natural experiment'' -- in this case, an event that changes the number of police officers for reasons having nothing to do with the crime rate. The crime rates before and after the change can then be compared. 
 Changes in the terror alert level provided just the sort of natural experiment Professors Klick and Tabarrok needed, because the shifts in police deployment are big, making effects easier to spot. The alert levels -- and hence the number of officers on the street -- go up and down over time, providing multiple tests. And since the number of police officers fluctuates over days or weeks, rather than months or years, any new officers are unlikely to be there because of crime-related expansions of the force.
 The two economists looked at daily crime statistics in Washington from March 12, 2002, to July 30, 2003. During that time, the terror alert level rose and fell four times. ''On high-alert days,'' they wrote, ''total crimes decrease by an average of seven crimes per day, or approximately 6.6 percent.''
 Although the Police Department would not officially say how it responds to heightened alerts, the researchers were told unofficially that officers spend an extra four hours on duty after their regular eight-hour shifts. Patrol officers who have finished their shifts elsewhere move to District 1, the area that encompasses the Capitol and National Mall and includes the Smithsonian Institution, the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. 
 Not surprisingly, then, much of the drop in crime occurred in District 1. During high alerts, the number of crimes per day in that area fell by 2.62, or about 15 percent. ''Almost one-half (43.6 percent) of the total crime decline during high-alert periods is concentrated in District 1,'' the economists wrote.
 To make sure tourists were not just avoiding Washington during high alerts, the economists checked midday subway ridership and hotel vacancy levels, finding no significant difference. Nor did criminals appear to shift from District 1 to other parts of town. Crime was down throughout the city.
 A bigger police presence does affect some kinds of crimes more than others. The number of murders, for instance, does not change.
 ''If you think about what crimes you most expect to be affected by putting more police on the streets, well, it's street crimes,'' Professor Tabarrok said in the interview. ''Theft from automobiles and automobile theft are the classic street crimes, and we found that they fell by a whopping 40 percent during these high-alert periods.'' Burglaries were also down, by 15 percent.
 Since the terror-alert system operates nationally, this research can be replicated in any other city willing to share its daily crime statistics.
 But so far, the case for adding more police officers is strong. Using generally accepted cost estimates, Professor Tabarrok said, every $1 to add officers would reduce the costs of crime by $4. The authors did not identify a point of diminishing returns. 
 ''We estimate that if we had a 10 percent increase in police, crime would go down by about 4 percent,'' he said, adding that researchers taking other approaches have come up with similar numbers. Nationally, he said, ''that means about 700,000 fewer property crimes and 213,000 fewer violent crimes.''
 As a back-of-the-envelope calculation, Professor Klick offered an even more striking suggestion. ''It wouldn't be unreasonable,'' he said, ''based on our estimates and based on conservative estimates of the costs of crime, to say it would be cost-effective to actually double the number of people working in police forces, which is pretty amazing.''

HEADLINE: Bronx Is Up as Yanks Unveil Stadium Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
The Yankees unveiled their design for a new ballpark yesterday with a look that would be recognized by Babe Ruth or Joe DiMaggio but with amenities and moneymaking potential that will enrich the team.
 Construction of the ballpark will mean the end of major league baseball at Yankee Stadium, where Mickey Mantle roamed center field, Don Larsen pitched the only World Series perfect game, popes visited and Joe Louis beat Billy Conn.
 ''We are standing at the cathedral of baseball,'' Randy Levine, the Yankees' president, said at a crowded news conference with team executives and elected officials sitting beneath the stained glass of the Stadium Club. ''We love this place. We honor its memories.'' But, he added: ''This building is becoming nonfunctional. It can't go on for another 40 years.'' 
 George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, beamed as speakers called him King George I and praised him for having the team finance construction of the $800 million stadium.
 ''This is a great heritage,'' he said. ''We love the Bronx.'' 
 He also indicated that Steve Swindal, his son-in-law and general partner of the team, would succeed him. 
 Steinbrenner, who bought the team in 1973, can look forward to the stadium's opening in 2009, shortly before his 79th birthday. It will rise just north of the old stadium; it will seat from 50,800 to 54,000, with 50 to 60 luxury boxes and an unspecified number of high-priced club seats. About 30,000 seats will be in the lower bowl, 20,000 in the upper, the reverse of the current configuration.
 The new stadium will be reminiscent of Yankee Stadium circa 1923, with its limestone-based exterior, arches and grand entrance designed by Osborn Engineering, whose old drawings were studied by Earl Santee of HOK Sport + Venue + Event, the architect for the new venture.
 The classic rooftop frieze that endured from 1923 until it was destroyed by the 1974-75 renovation will return but will be made of a translucent material, not copper, and a restaurant will be built above a recreated Monument Park behind the batter's eye in the outfield. The field dimensions will remain as they are now, concourses will be wide, and the field will be visible from any snack bar or concession stand.
 The team's decision to pay for the stadium is a position that has changed drastically over two decades. Steinbrenner had for years looked for ways out of the Bronx to move to New Jersey or Manhattan, fulminated about crime, parking and vermin in the neighborhood, and argued with public officials like Fernando Ferrer, then the borough president, about low attendance.
 Steinbrenner stopped criticizing the neighborhood about the time the Yankees starting winning World Series again and their attendance rocketed from 2.25 million in 1996 to a team record 3.77 million last season.
 In the many stadium plans suggested to or by Steinbrenner, in the Bronx or elsewhere, to build a stadium or to renovate the old one, he sought public financing.
 By agreeing that the team will pay the cost of construction, he recognized a growing trend toward teams' paying their way if they want new ballparks.
 ''We decided to stay,'' Steinbrenner said. ''That's the cost today.''
 Levine added: ''It became evident over the past several years -- not just in New York -- that a public subsidy was not going to happen. We can afford it, and we can make the commitment.''
 The Yankees' announcement came three days after the Mets revealed that they would finance a new ballpark next to Shea Stadium, which will convert to use as an Olympic stadium if the city wins its bid to play host to the 2012 Summer Games.
 The two stadiums are scheduled to open in 2009 and in both cases will get infrastructure help from the city and the state. ''The state is helping,'' Gov. George E. Pataki said, ''but George is footing the bill. It doesn't get any better than that.''
 In the Yankees' case, the city will contribute $135 million to, among other things, replace the land that the new stadium will occupy at well-used and well-worn Macombs Dam and John Mullaly Parks. The state will spend $70 million to build three new garages with 4,000 to 5,000 spots and get all the parking revenues. 
 No mention was made of a new Metro-North rail station at the stadium, which would come out of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's capital budget
 The new parkland will include Little League fields and an esplanade along the Harlem River; a 400-meter track, and softball and soccer fields outside the old stadium; and tennis and handball courts atop two of the three new garages. The new ballpark and the old one -- which may be cut down to its lower tier for use as an amateur baseball field -- will be separated by an enlarged Babe Ruth Plaza.
 The new ballparks will use tax-exempt bonds issued by the city that will save both teams millions of dollars in annual debt payments. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg bristled when asked if doing so constituted subsidizing the projects.
 ''The government is here to facilitate development in the city,'' he said. ''We don't do subsidies.'' He added, ''The city is getting paid back at a profit.''
 Another element of the financing for the Yankees will be their ability, granted by the collective bargaining agreement with the players, to offset their revenue-sharing payments to the rest of the league by deducting their debt payments.
 Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College, described this financial practice as a type of subsidy from the other major league teams. The Yankees paid $60 million into the revenue-sharing pool in 2004.
 ''It's a subsidy, whether you're getting a check directly from Bud Selig, or indirectly, whereby you send a smaller check to the other teams,'' Zimbalist said, referring to the baseball commissioner.
 Levine stopped short of calling it a subsidy, but said, ''Clearly, the revenue-sharing rules were a factor in making the stadium affordable.'' He added that the other teams ''may be the ones who are most unhappy about this.''
 But he said the substantial new revenues that the ballpark would generate may mean that the team will share more money in the future, simply not as much as it would if not for its ability to deduct debt payments.
 Levine said that he believed the Yankees had so far convinced the Bronx community and its leaders of the need to build the ballpark, and that he did not expect significant opposition. The team will submit the project in the fall for the city's approval through the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure.
 Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor, said he did not anticipate a fight over the stadium or a campaign like the ubiquitous one mounted by Cablevision against the proposed $2.2 billion Jets stadium on the Far West Side of Manhattan that could have been the centerpiece of the 2012 Olympics. The refusal by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver last week doomed that project, forcing the city to look to Flushing in Queens.
 ''There's a small group that doesn't want everything to happen, wherever it is,'' Doctoroff said.
 That small group appears to be Friends of Yankee Stadium, whose membership of 20 has been ''waiting for something to organize against,'' said David Gratt, one of its members, who lives two blocks from the stadium. 
 The group has a Web site, yankeesstayhome.com.
 ''For 20 years, the Yankees have stated their desire for a new stadium, but never successfully stated a case for need,'' he said. ''The mayor and the Yankees say it's approaching nonfunctionality, but it processed nearly four million people last year. I'm sure there are minor structural things to be addressed, but it's not nonfunctional.''
 Gratt said he would like to see the old stadium survive the way Fenway Park has.

HEADLINE: In a World of Car Builders, Thailand Relies Heavily on a Pickup

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

 BODY:
Since starting Able Autopart Industries nearly 20 years ago, Yeap Swee Chuan has ridden the success of Thailand's bid to become the Detroit of the East. Now, after building a $176-million-a-year company that supplies every major carmaker from DaimlerChrysler to Toyota, Mr. Yeap has seen the future of Thailand's automotive industry. And, he says, it is in China.
 ''The Thai market will plateau in two to three years,'' Mr. Yeap said. Last year his company, now called Aapico Hitech, shifted with the trend, buying an auto parts company near Shanghai.
 Others agree that Thailand's automobile industry is at a turning point. 
 Using a blend of investment incentives and tariffs, Thailand lured the biggest names in automobiles to became Southeast Asia's largest vehicle producer, 15th in the world. Its industry employs 300,000 and has doubled production since 2001, with exports rising 40 percent last year.
 Central to that success has been the one-ton pickup truck. Promoting this vehicle as the workhorse of its developing economy has helped Thailand become the world's second-largest market for pickups after the United States. Its factories also export all over the world, from Britain and Africa to the Middle East and Australia.
 But the world needs only so many pickups, experts say, so even though Thailand may never lose its edge in one-ton trucks to China, its output will probably peak with global demand in five years. ''Thailand needs another product,'' said Kosaku Hosokawa, president of Nissan Motor's Thai subsidiary.
 Just how to find a niche product sheltered from China's juggernaut in a world of falling trade barriers is a riddle that faces manufacturers everywhere. In Thailand, it has also become a source of friction with Japan, whose carmakers account for as much as 95 percent of the Thai auto market -- friction that is threatening to derail bilateral free-trade talks between the countries.
 Japan's automakers have had a long relationship with Thailand, one that stretches back to the 1960's. 
 Thailand offered the Japanese companies not only cheap labor and raw materials, but also a crossroads location with a relatively stable government and good roads and ports.
 The Thai government quickly singled out the one-ton pickup as ideal for its largely rural population, a vehicle able to haul sacks of rice and large families with equal ease. To encourage Japanese automakers to produce the trucks in Thailand, the government offered tax holidays of up to eight years and virtually eliminated excise taxes on domestic pickup sales.
 It then sheltered its market behind steep import tariffs. Most important, it did not repeat Malaysia's and Indonesia's mistake of creating a domestic carmaker that would compete with the Japanese.
 ''Not only did they have volume, but they could basically run their own show,'' said John Bonnell, executive director of Automotive Resources Asia, a consulting firm in Bangkok.
 A big catalyst behind Thailand's growth was, curiously, the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. When the crisis hit, domestic auto sales collapsed, leaving automakers with unused capacity. ''Carmakers here had no choice; they had to turn to export markets,'' said Thitithep Nophaket, an analyst at Phatra Securities in Bangkok.
 While Ford, General Motors, DaimlerChrysler and BMW have made big Thai investments in the last decade, Japan's automakers have gone even further, making Thailand their global base for pickup production. Isuzu, which makes one-ton pickups for G.M.; Mazda, which manufactures for Ford; and Toyota have all relocated pickup production to Thailand. The troubled Mitsubishi Motors now exports its Thai pickups to 139 countries, accounting for 21 percent of Thailand's auto exports. Honda Motors even exports pickups from Thailand to Japan.
 The latest transplant is Nissan, which announced in March that it would invest 29 billion baht ($709 million) in Thai pickup production. ''We're transferring all pickup truck capacity to Thailand,'' Mr. Hosokawa, the Thai unit's president, said.
 But as trade barriers tumble all over the world, automakers are eliminating redundant factories and concentrating production where it can be done most profitably. So while Thailand remains the region's hub for truck exports, its sedan assembly industry is threatened by imports from Australia and from other Southeast Asia nations that have free trade agreements with Thailand.
 With most auto executives in Thailand expecting the one-ton pickup market to peak by 2010, Thailand is feeling squeezed. ''On one side are Japan and Korea, with high wages and high technology,'' said Vallop Tiasiri, president of the Thailand Automotive Institute, which advises the government on automotive policy. ''And at the low end are China and India.''
 The solution, he said, is to convince automakers to devise new products that take advantage of Thailand's existing capacity. 
 Japanese automakers are already adapting their pickup assembly lines in Thailand to produce sport utility and similar vehicles. Toyota announced in April that it would invest 18 billion baht ($440 million) to build a Thai factory to make a new ''international multipurpose vehicle'' designed for the developing world.
 Thailand also wants automakers to build high-end small cars with high fuel efficiency and low emissions that could compete in Europe.
 One obstacle to such a move, experts say, is the Thai auto parts industry. In the industry's early years, Thailand promoted its growth by requiring that vehicles use a big proportion of locally made components to maintain their low-tariff status.
 Parts makers flocked to Thailand and local companies like Aapico were joined by industry giants like Denso of Japan and Delphi, which is based in Michigan.
 Mr. Yeap of Aapico realized the need to acquire competitive technologies. After his company went public in 2002, it bought the local parts business of the Dana Corporation of Toledo, Ohio, for $50 million.
 But Aapico is the exception. ''The government didn't push these guys to upgrade technologically,'' said Richard F. Doner, an associate professor of Asian industrial development at Emory University in Atlanta. 
 As a result, Japanese carmakers have viewed Thai auto parts as inferior. Since 1997, half of the Thai-owned firms that provide top-tier parts to the industry have been replaced or bought out by Japanese companies.
 Mr. Vallop of the Thailand Automotive Institute wants the government to invest 10 billion baht ($244 million) in upgrading the Thai auto parts industry and establish an institute for research and development.
 The Japanese are seeking quicker relief. As part of the free trade agreement Tokyo is negotiating with Bangkok, they want Thailand to phase out import tariffs on large-engine Japanese luxury cars. But Thai auto assemblers, and European luxury car makers like BMW and Mercedes, say Japanese luxury imports would cripple their sales.
 Japan also wants Thailand to phase out tariffs on high-end steel for auto bodies that cannot yet be made in Thailand. Thailand's steel makers say they need time to develop capacity to make this kind of steel, time the Japanese counter they do not have.
 Meanwhile, competition from China is moving fast. Two Chinese automakers, Hafei and Chery, have already begun exporting cars to the developing world. DaimlerChrysler and Honda plan to export China-made sedans to Europe.
 Mr. Yeap is not convinced that Thailand can move in time. While Thailand will always have pickups, he said, ''China's expansion will keep Thailand out of sedan production.''

HEADLINE: France and Japan Seek Concorde Alternative

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 15 

 BODY:
Since the Concorde was grounded more than a year ago, about the only way to fly faster than the speed of sound was to become an Air Force pilot. But now France and Japan are hoping to develop a commercial jet that could cut the flight time between Tokyo and New York by more than half, to about six hours. 
 Japanese and French aerospace industry groups have agreed to cooperate on researching technologies to build a commercially viable supersonic jet, according to Japan's trade ministry. The three-year program would look for ways to overcome the flaws that ultimately grounded the Concorde, including high fuel consumption and unacceptably loud engine noise. The French and Japanese companies involved will study ways to reduce fuel costs by using ultra-lightweight composite materials, instead of aluminum, to reduce weight. 
 ''This is truly significant industrial cooperation,'' Shoichi Nakagawa, Japan's minister of economy, trade and industry, said in a statement. ''I hope that the two aircraft industries will achieve the realization of the future dream of supersonic transport.'' 
 Production of lightweight composite materials is an area in which Japanese companies are already world leaders. Aircraft makers like Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries are using those materials to make key components of Boeing's new midsize plane, the 787, including the wings and parts of the fuselage. Boeing says the jet will be as much as 20 percent more fuel-efficient than similarly sized aircraft. 
 Researchers financed by the Japanese government have already successfully tested an engine that could operate at a speed of Mach 5.5, more than five times the speed of sound. 
 The agreement to cooperate on supersonic jet research was signed by the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies and the French Aerospace Industries Association on Tuesday at the Paris Air Show, the trade ministry of Japan said in a statement. The industry groups are made up of leading aircraft developers in each country, including Mitsubishi Heavy, Kawasaki Heavy and Ishikawajima-Harima of Japan. The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, the parent of Airbus, will also take part in the project, according to the Kyodo News agency.
 Financing for the research project was fairly modest, with the companies pledging to invest a combined 200 million yen ($1.8 million) in each of the three years of the program. The trade ministry of Japan has also budgeted 110 million yen ($1 million) for the first year of research. 
 The 100-seat Concorde was a favorite form of travel for celebrities and corporate chiefs for nearly three decades before its last flight in October 2003. The Concorde's reputation suffered a serious blow in 2000 when 113 people were killed when one of the jets crashed near Paris. The sleek plane was eventually grounded by its inability to turn a profit given the large amount of fuel it needed to reach its vaunted speed. Despite one-way fares of more than $6,000 between New York and London and $5,000 between New York and Paris, the plane's operators, British Airways and Air France, decided to end the service. 
 With oil prices now hovering near record highs, a financially viable new supersonic jet must be far more fuel efficient than the Concorde and it needs the range to fly lucrative long routes, like New York to Tokyo, analysts said. 
 ''Cost is the main thing,'' said Peter Harbison, an analyst at the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation in Sydney, Australia.

HEADLINE: Shares Increase Modestly; Higher Oil Prices a Concern

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks had a small gain yesterday as investors fretted over rising oil prices and disappointing inventory data from the Energy Department. 
 The surprise decline in domestic crude supplies overshadowed a 0.1 percent drop in the Consumer Price Index. It was the first decline in 10 months for the index, which encouraged investors, but analysts said soaring energy costs -- which might contribute to inflation in the months ahead -- were a drag on stocks. 
 ''We had positive economic data across the board,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. ''The headwinds are higher energy prices.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.80 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,566.37. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 2.67 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,206.58. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 5.88 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,074.92. 
 In its weekly update on fuel supplies, the government reported an unexpected 1.8 million barrel draw on crude oil, a deeper decline than analysts expected, as well as a drop in gasoline. 
 The inventory data eclipsed the announcement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that it would increase daily production by 500,000 barrels later this year if prices do not fall. 
 Analysts said OPEC's decision was largely symbolic and would have little influence on actual output. The price of crude rose 57 cents, to settle at $55.57 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, giving up some of its earlier gains. 
 Though retreating energy prices in past months were credited for the drop in the Consumer Price Index reading, the short-term surge in crude sent stock buyers fleeing.
 Still, with market watchers worried about interest rates and inflation a primary concern of the Federal Reserve, the improved price index raised hopes that the central bank would be less aggressive with its rate policy. 
 J.P. Morgan Chase increased 11 cents, to $35.71. The bank said Tuesday that it would pay $2.2 billion to Enron investors who accused it of participating in the accounting scandal that led to Enron's collapse. 
 Bear Stearns reported that its second-quarter income rose 5 percent from a year ago, based on strength in its institutional stock trading business. Shares of Bear Stearns gained $1.01, to $101.34. 
 Viacom fell 44 cents, to $33.77, after the company, whose holdings include CBS, MTV and the Paramount movie studio, said Tuesday that its board approved a previously announced plan to split the company in two. 
 Shares of Tommy Hilfiger jumped 8.5 percent, or 96 cents, to $12.20. The clothing company said it was delaying financial statements for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2005, as a result of the previously disclosed regulatory investigation. It also said it was in discussions with the United States attorney's office about possibly resolving the investigation as a civil matter.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note gained 2/32, to a price of 100 6/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.10 percent from 4.11 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Wise Prescriptions

 BODY:
A bipartisan, Congressionally mandated task force headed by Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, and George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader, has presented a clear statement of America's national interest in a revived and effective United Nations. Their balanced and thoughtful report, prepared over six months, features an unsparing analysis of the U.N.'s current problems and weaknesses. It also offers constructive recommendations on mobilizing Washington's powerful influence to promote urgent and necessary reforms, including some already proposed by the U.N. itself. 
 Lawmakers should take the time to at least thumb through this report, especially those who have been demanding Secretary General Kofi Annan's resignation, supporting the ill-conceived nomination of John Bolton as the United States ambassador to the United Nations and backing the latest benighted attempt to withhold America's legally obligated dues.
 The task force report offers useful proposals on restraining nuclear and other weapons proliferation, and on peacekeeping and peace-building, human rights, economic development, and strengthening the U.N.'s badly discredited management systems. It offers more than 100 specific recommendations, and while we do not agree with every one, we can readily endorse most of them. 
 The most important include the creation of an independent audit and oversight board, more militarily robust peacekeeping operations, strengthened access and inspections rules for the International Atomic Energy Agency and other international bodies monitoring the proliferation of unconventional weapons, and stronger cooperation between the United Nations and the World Bank. 
 It also usefully calls for stronger measures to prevent and punish sexual abuse by peacekeepers; enhanced protection for whistle-blowers; American leadership in preventing genocide, starting with Darfur; and United States support for regional war crimes tribunals and truth commissions. 
 Along with its deserved criticism of U.N. problems, the Gingrich-Mitchell report refreshingly notes that many of the charges commonly leveled against the United Nations -- for example, its failure to halt genocide and other threats to humanity and peace -- should more properly be directed against those member states that blocked or undermined effective international action. 
 It also takes note of the ambitious reform agenda proposed earlier this year by Mr. Annan and specifically embraces some of its ideas, like replacing the morally bankrupt Human Rights Commission with a more credible Human Rights Council and creating a new peace-building commission to follow up on the work of peacekeeping missions. 
 When a United Nations summit meeting convenes in New York this summer to discuss and build on the secretary general's proposals, the United States should take a leading role. As the Gingrich-Mitchell report correctly notes, the goals and principles of the charter ''embody and reflect'' American interests today as much as they did when the United States played the leading role in founding the United Nations 60 years ago.

HEADLINE: Delta Air Raises Fares to Some Cities Above Its Self-Imposed Cap

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines raised fares to some cities yesterday above the limits it imposed on ticket prices in January, when it received enormous attention for cutting fares.
 The airline increased economy class fares to $509 each way on routes where it shares service with Northwest and other airlines under a code-sharing agreement, said Terry Trippler, an industry analyst who tracks air fares. 
 Mr. Trippler said it was the first time Delta had increased fares above limits it imposed in January, under a program called Simplifares. 
 In January, Delta cut the prices on many routes as much as 50 percent and removed the need for a Saturday night stay. In addition, it said it would charge no more than $499 for one-way economy class fares or $599 for one-way business class tickets. 
 Delta maintained that the limits were necessary so that it could compete with low-fare airlines like JetBlue and Southwest, which have captured an increasing share of Delta's strongest markets, flights on the East Coast and to Florida. Those airlines charge no more than $299 one-way.
 A Delta spokeswoman, Benet J. Wilson, confirmed that the airline had raised fares. But Ms. Wilson said Delta indicated in January that the limits did not apply to cities where it offered service with code-sharing partners, including Northwest, Continental, SkyWest or Alaska Airlines.
 Neither Continental nor Northwest, which are Delta's two main code-share partners, joined Delta in imposing caps on air fares.
 The routes where Delta raised prices to $509 one-way included Los Angeles to Wausau, Wis.; Atlanta to Aspen, Colo.; and Bismarck, N.D., to Cincinnati, Mr. Trippler said. 
 Delta's action comes as major airlines are trying to raise fares to cover sustained high prices for jet fuel. 
 But consumers and low-fare airlines have been resisting the efforts, forcing the airlines to roll back some increases. Last weekend, several major airlines raised prices $5 to $20 a ticket, only to cancel the increases a few days later.

HEADLINE: An Insider's Troubling Account of the U.S. Role in Iraq

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

Squandered Victory
The American Occupation and the Bungled Effort to Bring Democracy to Iraq
By Larry Diamond
369 pages. Times Books/Henry Holt & Company. $25.
 The failures of the Bush administration to prepare adequately for the postwar period in Iraq are by now well known, underscored by the revelation this week that a briefing paper, prepared for Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain eight months before the invasion, warned that ''a postwar occupation of Iraq could lead to a protracted and costly nation-building exercise'' and that ''little thought'' had been given by the United States to ''the aftermath and how to shape it.''It is a subject explicated in chilling -- and often scathing -- detail by ''Squandered Victory,'' a new book by Larry Diamond, a former senior adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad and a leading American scholar on democracy and democratic movements. In this book, Mr. Diamond contends that the postwar troubles in Iraq -- a bloody and unrelenting insurgency, the creation of a new breeding ground for terrorists and metastasizing ethnic and religious tensions -- are the result of ''gross negligence'' on the part of a Bush administration that rushed to war. He asserts that ''mistakes were made at virtually every turn'' of the occupation, and that ''every mistake the United States made in Iraq narrowed the scope and lengthened the odds for progress.''
 His book not only provides an unsettling account of the mind-boggling challenges involved in trying to bring democracy to Iraq (ranging from practical matters like setting up an infrastructure for the electoral process to political and philosophical issues dealing with the drafting of a constitution) but also lays out a thoughtful, pull-no-punches analysis of the missteps and misjudgments by the Bush White House and the Pentagon in the months before and after America's toppling of Saddam Hussein.
 It is a book that should be read by anyone interested in understanding why the United States' quick military victory has given way to an increasingly virulent insurgency and nearly daily reports of car bombings and suicide attacks, why even post-election hopes have been shadowed by worries about the continuing violence spiraling into a Lebanon-style civil war.
 Certainly many of Mr. Diamond's points have been made before: by reporters, by critics of the administration's foreign policy, and in recent months by several studies of United States military operations in Iraq -- including a Rand Corporation study that took the Pentagon to task for failing to adequately address stabilization and reconstruction issues, and a study by Maj. Isaiah Wilson III, the former chief war planner for the 101st Airborne Division stationed in northern Iraq, who concluded that ''there was no adequate operational plan for stability operations and support operations'' in Iraq after the combat phase.What makes Mr. Diamond's account particularly valuable is its insider's look at the day-to-day realities on the ground in Iraq in 2004 (which often stood in stark contrast to the spin emanating from Washington) and his ability to provide a historical context for the efforts to implant democracy in Iraq.
 Mr. Diamond had not been a supporter of the war, but in the fall of 2003, he says, he received a call from his longtime friend and former Stanford University colleague Condoleezza Rice asking him to spend several months in Iraq as an adviser to American occupation authorities. Because he believed that if the United States failed there ''Iraq would become what it had not been before the war: a haven for international terrorism and possibly a direct threat to America's national security'', he agreed to go. He was also excited, he says, by the challenge of helping ''to build a decent, lawful, and democratic political order'' in Iraq.
 As he began his work, however, Mr. Diamond became convinced that America's ''plan for political transition in Iraq was critically flawed,'' that there was a fundamental contradiction between ''our aspiration for democracy'' and ''our impulse for unilateral control.'' He writes that the Americans ''never listened carefully to the Iraqi people, or to the figures in the country that they respected'' -- like the Shiite leader the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani -- and that ''we never won their trust and confidence.''
 As Mr. Diamond sees it, ''blame for the early blunders'' in Iraq ''lies with the high officials of the Bush administration -- including the president himself -- who decided to go to war when we did, in the way we did, with the lack of preparation that has become brutally apparent.'' He reminds us that ''the startling mismanagement of planning for the postwar did not result from a sudden emergency and a lack of time to plan'': civilians at the Pentagon had begun pushing the case for war against Iraq almost immediately after 9/11, and a wide-ranging report known at the Future of Iraq Project had been started at the State Department in the spring of 2002. This report, says Mr. Diamond, was initially ignored by the Pentagon, which in its early certitude about ''the inevitability and speed of America's triumph,'' swept ''aside experts in the State Department and elsewhere who had described what the postwar realities in Iraq would require.'' 
 Like many other analysts, Mr. Diamond believes that one of the ''most ill-fated decisions of the postwar engagement'' was President Bush's acceptance of the plan designed by Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld -- ''to go into Iraq with a relatively light force of about 150,000 coalition troops, despite the warnings of the United States Army and outside experts on post-conflict reconstruction that -- whatever the needs of the war itself -- securing the peace would require a force two to three times that size.'' Committing more troops than the United States initially did, Mr. Diamond argues, ''would have necessitated an immediate mobilization of the military reserves and National Guard (which would come later, in creeping fashion), and might have alarmed the public into questioning the costs and feasibility of the entire operation'' -- a development that might have slowed the gallop to war.
 The lack of sufficient troops, Mr. Diamond goes on, would create a further set of problems: an inability to prevent looting and restore law and order, which would further undermine Iraqis' trust in the United States; and inability to seal the country's borders, which would allow foreign terrorists to enter and help foment further violence. ''The first lesson,'' Mr. Diamond writes, ''is that we cannot get to Jefferson and Madison without going through Thomas Hobbes. You can't build a democratic state unless you first have a state, and the essential condition for a state is that it must have an effective monopoly over the means of violence.''
 In Mr. Diamond's opinion, L. Paul Bremer III, America's civilian administrator of postwar Iraq, exacerbated an already precarious situation by making several crucial mistakes. His 2003 decision to dissolve the Iraqi army and ban all senior members of the Baath party from government employment created a vacuum in terms of both security forces and institutional expertise, and it alienated two important sectors of Iraqi society. In addition, Mr. Diamond writes, ''Bremer spurned the appeals of a wide range of Iraqis -- including many who were cooperating with us -- and of the United Nations mission to transfer authority quickly to an Iraqi interim government, and he proceeded to reshape Iraq through an occupation that he led, and over which he exerted tight, indeed almost total, control.''
 This decision to turn the American presence into a formal occupation, Mr. Diamond suggests, fueled Iraqi suspicions that the United States did not want a truly sovereign Iraq but wanted to dictate terms that would serve America's own economic (i.e. oil) and military interests.
 When Mr. Diamond returned to the United States in April 2004, he says, he wrote his old friend Ms. Rice a long, confidential memo, recommending that America ''disavow any long-term military aspirations in Iraq,'' establish a target date for the withdrawal of our forces, respond to concerns about Iraqi detainees, proceed vigorously with a plan to disarm and reintegrate Iraqi militias and send ''significantly more troops and equipment.''
 The memo concluded: ''If we do not develop soon a coherent counter-insurgency plan combining political and military, Iraqi and international initiatives, we will creep closer and closer to that tipping point, beyond which so many Iraqis sympathize with or join the insurgency that we cannot prevail at any bearable price.''
 He says he never heard back from Ms. Rice or her principal assistant for Iraq, Robert Blackwill.

HEADLINE: Delicate Chemistry Of Ballet Casting

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL

 BODY:
American Ballet Theater is not a company like most other world-class ensembles, in the sense that it can boast a centuries-old tradition renewed from within, by graduates of its own school. It is a perhaps typically American assemblage of stars, the starrier the better. In an audience survey a few years ago, one satisfied customer equated Ballet Theater with the New York Yankees: ''They just go out and buy the best they can.''
 But like the Yankees manager, Joe Torre, who with intermittent success must balance all the players lavished upon him by the front office, so must Kevin McKenzie juggle his overflowing cornucopia of ballet stars. Mr. McKenzie, a former Ballet Theater dancer and now its longtime artistic director, has to figure out the best way to deploy all the talent he has.
 But does he deploy that talent wisely? Is he too evenhanded? In an effort to appease honored veterans and flatter new additions and encourage promising youngsters, does he spread the casting of major roles too thin, in a way that shortchanges the public? Wouldn't coherent, recurrent casts, as has become the practice among singers recently at the Metropolitan Opera, mean more integrated, better rehearsed performances? And wouldn't fewer principals in leading roles help build star images and thereby augment the box office? 
 The answers to those questions are complicated, although Mr. McKenzie offered calm, plausible explanations of his casting policies in a recent telephone conversation.
 Casting can be less widespread in the company's shorter fall repertory season in the City Center, smaller than the huge Metropolitan Opera House, he explained. There, the emphasis is on choreography, often pieces new to the company, and hence each ballet must be prepared with a smaller, more focused group of dancers. Mixed bills also offer each dancer more frequent chances to shine.
 At the eight-week spring season at the Met, the emphasis must be on staples that will appeal to a broad public. Choreography remains important, but the novelties come largely from the casting. For economy (reducing stagehand costs) and marketing (''It's 'Swan Lake' time,'' as Mr. McKenzie put it), the ballets are usually grouped together, often in weeklong runs. A sequence of a single ballet with multiple casts also attracts critical attention, meaning more free publicity.
 That, in turn, means the principals must be rotated, to avoid dancing arduous roles every night. And there must be ample backups in case of injury; this is not a Broadway show, where stars are expected to tread the boards eight times a week, twice a day with matinees. Ethan Stiefel, for example, was to perform Petrouchka in the opening of the company's ''Fokine Celebration'' last night. But he hadn't fully recovered from a knee injury, and was scheduled to be replaced by Julio Bocca. Ballet Theater has that kind of luxury, with a dancer of Mr. Bocca's caliber already on hand. (He had been set for a later cast, anyhow.)
 ''I try to give as many people as I can a chance,'' Mr. McKenzie said. ''They have to be right for the role, of course. But beyond that I try to balance veterans, developing artists and younger dancers, to see if they can carry an evening.''
 For a week's run, he added, there must be at least three casts, often more. ''It goes through the ranks; it's not just the principals,'' he said. ''Every featured part is triple cast. If someone goes down, we have someone else ready.'' 
 But how does that work in practice? Do those who read a glowing review of Gillian Murphy's lead performance in the opening-night cast of ''Sylvia'' feel cheated when they find Michele Wiles, a soloist, not a principal, instead?
 There wasn't much sign of disappointment on Monday night, when Ms. Wiles delivered a glowing, confident account of the part (even after her Orion, Gennadi Saveliev, while carting her off to his lair at the end of Act 1, tripped and fell with her on top of him). 
 There are balletomanes who revel in comparing dancers in the same part, although whether they have much impact on the box office seems doubtful. Mr. McKenzie said his audiences demand variety; there is a ''market saturation'' point for any single dancer, he believes.
 As Sylvia, the assiduous ticket buyer could have seen, aside from Ms. Murphy and Ms. Wiles, Julie Kent and Paloma Herrera. It was fascinating, for example, to encounter Marcelo Gomes as the love-struck Aminta in the Monday ''Sylvia'' cast and as the fierce Orion on Tuesday: with his dark good looks and muscular frame, he was more suited to Orion, while Maxim Beloserkovsky on Tuesday made a suppler Aminta.
 For ''Le Corsaire,'' which opens next Thursday, there are four casts, headed by the same four ballerinas. ''Swan Lake'' runs from July 1 through 9 and offers the same quartet, minus Ms. Wiles and plus Veronika Part (an up-and-comer) and Diana Vishneva, the Kirov Ballet star. There is a similar variety in the leading male roles, all the more fraught a decision for Mr. McKenzie given the strength of the male contingent at Ballet Theater. The company does try to keep each cast for a given ballet more or less the same, however.
 Other companies operate under different circumstances. As with Ballet Theater's fall City Center season, most troupes, including the New York City Ballet, offer revolving repertory programs. Often two principals will be assigned a major role, but not four or five, and their assignments even in a longer ballet come up only every few days. The same is true at the state-supported European companies, with their 10-month seasons, and they often alternate their ballet performances with operas.
 When City Ballet does do a run of a single ballet, as with Balanchine's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' on Tuesday through June 26, the casting resembles Mr. McKenzie's in its variety. Darci Kistler, Kyra Nichols, Maria Kowroski and Sofiane Sylve will all be dancing Titania. Needless to say, a similar variety prevails in the company's endless holiday-season performances of ''The Nutcracker.''
 How does Mr. McKenzie's policy translate into ticket sales? Are audiences drawn to one dancer over another in sufficient numbers to make a difference at the box office? To the naked eye, Monday's ''Sylvia'' with Ms. Wiles looked a little less full than Tuesday's with Ms. Murphy. Mr. McKenzie concedes that ''some dancers do better over time.'' But like so many impecunious American companies, Ballet Theater has not done much serious study of its audiences.
 ''We just don't have the luxury of collecting that sort of hard data,'' said Kelly Ryan, the company's press representative.
 Mr. McKenzie almost seems to discourage star packages, no doubt not to slight his other dancers.
 ''We did have a 'money in the bank' pairing once,'' he said, declining to name names. ''So I split them up, and then a few years later teamed them up again, and they no longer sold.''
 Mr. McKenzie said that rotating casts had always been the policy for Ballet Theater Met seasons. In his days as a dancer, there were, among others, Natalia Makarova, Carla Fracci, Ivan Nagy and Erik Bruhn. But, he added, ''I think it's possible that I'm casting a little bit deeper.''
 He picks the principals (always bearing in mind that injuries can cause reshufflings, as with Mr. Stiefel in ''Petrouchka''). Then he sits down with Victor Barbee, his associate director, and sorts out the next level, making sure each cast fits together properly. Finally, the smaller featured parts and the corps assignments are fleshed out by staff members.
 Does all this juggling lead to dancers being miffed that they aren't adequately featured? With a group of principals that has ranged from 12 to 20, depending on the year, some jealousy might seem inevitable.
 Mr. McKenzie paints a happier picture. For him, the excitement for a dancer at Ballet Theater comes from the very presence of other fine dancers, just as Randy Johnson presumably enjoys having Derek Jeter on his Yankees team. The presence of excellence challenges them all to surpass themselves.
 ''Good dancers,'' he said simply, ''like the company of other good dancers.''

A Critic's Notebook article in Weekend yesterday about ballet casting referred incorrectly to the personnel for American Ballet Theater's ''Swan Lake'' at the Metropolitan Opera House from July 1 through July 9. Michele Wiles is indeed scheduled to perform.

HEADLINE: Flash, Dash And Now, Art

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
For the people who descend on it every summer, Coney Island is still a land that floats just offshore from reality. But like any place where escapism is bought and sold, there has always been a very real economic mooring: nobody gets something for nothing.
 So in the summer of 2003, when the artist Steve Powers became simultaneously obsessed with Coney Island and the dying art of sign painting, he had a tough time convincing many of the wary and con-wise business owners that he wanted to give them -- free, really -- brand-new hand-painted signs for their aging bumper-car palaces and clam bars.
 ''They just weren't having it,'' he recalled. ''They were like, 'You're going to give it to me? O.K. ... Then what do I have to give you?''' 
 But Mr. Powers, a former graffiti artist who has had scrapes with the law and lots of experience dealing with suspicious authority, was persistent. And now his personal mission has become a sprawling public art project that blurs the line between art and commerce in a way that perhaps could happen only on Coney Island. Since last summer, when the project began in earnest, Mr. Powers and Creative Time, the nonprofit arts group, have signed up dozens of artists with gallery credentials and international followings to paint signs for businesses and arcades. 
 Mr. Powers painted the cars on the Cyclone, the famous roller coaster, which he said he considered a high point of his artistic career. Nicole Eisenman, who joined the project last year, made a slightly menacing cartoon sign for a game called Skin the Wire, in which a contestant tries to move a hoop along a revolving wire spiral without letting the hoop touch the wire. Rita Ackermann painted a 50-foot-long carnival mural on Jones Walk, an arcade lane that had become an eyesore in recent years but is experiencing a rebirth largely because of the new signs.
 Most of the signs painted last year remain, like the popular one known as ''Hey Joey!'' at the clam bar on the Boardwalk at West 12th Street, created by a Los Angeles duo who call themselves the Gents of Desire.
 This year more artists have created signs and murals, including a sweeping, surreal mural near the Stillwell Avenue subway stop made by identical-twin graffiti artists from Brazil who call themselves Os Gemeos (the Twins). In addition to the signs made for businesses, Mr. Powers and a group of artists and professional sign painters will also open a rented storefront tomorrow at 1206 Surf Avenue, called the Dreamland Artist Clubhouse, in which customers can buy ready-made signs or commission artists to make personalized ones. And some lucky contestants at arcade games will be able to win artworks instead of anemic goldfish in plastic bags. 
 Sign painting flourished on Coney Island for decades during the amusement kingdom's heyday and often attracted struggling artists trying to make a living with a brush. Probably the most famous example is George Herriman, the creator of the legendary comic strip ''Krazy Kat,'' who painted signs and also worked as a barker for a snake act.
 Walking today through the carnival maze and fried-sausage smoke between the Boardwalk and Surf Avenue, it is not always easy to tell which signs were painted by the artists and which are true Coney Island relics, and Mr. Powers said he felt that was one of the strengths of the project.
 ''What separates this from most public art projects is that it is commerce first,'' he said, explaining how he and other artists had to enter into sometimes hard-nosed negotiations with grizzled arcade owners who wanted nothing to do with any post-modern artistic winks and nods. They simply wanted their game's name in brighter colors than the sign on the guy's game next door. Many artists, in turn, would push for something a little weirder or more conceptual. Sometimes they prevailed, but sometimes they didn't, and the result was a highly traditional sign. 
 ''In the end it's good,'' Mr. Powers said recently, at work on a new sign in his studio in Lower Manhattan. He smiled and wiped the sweat from his forehead. ''They're too free, these artists. They need a little structure, damn it.''
 Interviewed one recent sweltering afternoon, some business owners agreed and were not delicate about their views. 
 ''You don't have a clue what that says, do you? -- Come on, be honest,'' asked Bernard Furmansky, who owns a bustling food stand at one end of Jones Walk, pointing to a decidedly nontraditional artist-made sign for a cigar stand nearby. Then he pointed up to the eye-catching signs ringing his own business, which were painted a few weeks earlier by Ronnie Cutrone, a well-known artist and onetime assistant to Andy Warhol.
 ''What's that -- a butterfly or a shrimp?'' he said, gesturing toward one of the slightly abstracted paintings. (It appeared to be, in fact, a seahorse, which was accompanied elsewhere on the sign by a fish with legs and a monkey holding a hot dog.)
 But then Mr. Furmansky smiled and threw an arm around Alexa Coyne, a curator from Creative Time who has become a fixture around the Boardwalk over the last few months. ''It's better than what was there,'' Mr. Furmansky said, and then corrected himself, remembering that he had not had much of a sign up before. ''I guess I should say it's better than what was not there.''
 Ms. Coyne, who recently moved to New York from Dublin, said that Coney Island and its faded grandeur had offered her a kind of crash course in the stranger aspects of American culture.
 ''I've seen people on Surf Avenue with briefcases full of live snakes,'' she said. ''You wouldn't believe the things I've seen down here.'' 
 Over the last several months, she and the crop of new artists have learned how to navigate the alliances, partnerships, ancient feuds and invisible territorial boundaries that make up Coney Island, where many business owners have long existed in a state of perpetual near-legitimacy. As she gave a reporter a tour recently, she explained which business owners would probably agree to be interviewed, which would not and which were better not approached at all.
 One veteran arcade owner, who spoke only on the condition that his name not be used, said that he was suspicious of the project at first, but had watched as the signs had brought customers back to Jones Walk.
 ''This place used to not be lighted,'' he said. ''It was shabby. It was a place you weren't sure you wanted to come to.'' But now, he said: ''We're getting city people who never came here before, and they're bringing their cameras, and I guess they're trying to find subliminal things somewhere in these signs.''
 Joey Pesca, the manager of the popular clam bar, also known as the Gyro Corner, at the Boardwalk and West 12th Street, said the wall sign painted for him by the Gents of Desire -- otherwise known as Jonathan Bleser and Alexis Ross -- has made his business a destination for art lovers and has given him a new appreciation for artists.
 ''They were actually a joy to be around,'' Mr. Pesca, also known as Joey Clams, said of the Gents. ''And at the end they added this little thing that says, 'Hey Joey!,' which has made me a little famous around here.''
 Mr. Powers said he hoped to keep the project alive in coming summers, especially as development plans loom that could scrub away much of the trademark Coney Island patina and bring more of what he described as an art abomination: factory-made vinyl and plastic signs.
 The only problem now, he said, was that business owners have completely overcome their former reluctance and have been clamoring for signs in such numbers that the project cannot keep up with the demands.
 ''At first no one wants one,'' Mr. Powers said. ''And now, they're like: 'Oh great! Now you're here to paint my sign. Where were you yesterday, when I really needed it?' ''

HEADLINE: In Litchfield County, a $25 Million Explosion

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH MAKER

 BODY:
WITH the lifestyle of the super-rich pulling away noticeably from that of the merely well off, there's expensive property, and then there's the stratospheric. Real estate in Litchfield County, Conn., seemed to fall comfortably within the first category -- this has been a place where a multimillionaire movie star might live down the road, but a modestly prosperous buyer could still hope to find a charming weekend retreat. The record-high price for a residence in Litchfield, set in 2001, is $6.3 million, which was paid for a newly built 7,000-square-foot house on 75 acres in Washington, one of the county's 26 towns.
 Now, seemingly overnight, longtime Litchfield County residents have awakened to find three properties in their neighborhood -- an estate, an over-the-top horse facility and a 373-acre family farm -- for sale with price tags near or at $25 million each.
 Even with economists shouting ''Bubble!'' as real estate prices escalate across the country -- and even though the $25 million values are only asking prices -- that leap has jolted Litchfield newcomers and longtime locals alike, prompting inevitable questions: What's happening to Litchfield? Is it approaching the point passed a decade or two ago on the South Fork of Long Island, when the potato fields and the middle class of the Hamptons finally capitulated to the play farms and designer mansions of wealthy urbanites? 
 ''More and more wealthy echo boomers are taking their new money to Litchfield County,'' said Stanley Gniazdowski, an adjunct assistant professor at the Real Estate Institute at New York University and a real estate consultant to developers. (Echo boomers are the children of baby boomers.) 
 ''This is a place that people are discovering is not only beautiful, but you can get there from here,'' Mr. Gniazdowski said. And, he predicted, once one property sells at or near $25 million, ''you're likely to see many more going in that range.'' 
 To some in Litchfield, the $25 million price tags seem unrealistic. Grace Franjola, an agent with Elyse Harney Real Estate in Salisbury, attributes them to ''Realtor competition.'' Elyse Harney, the agency's owner, said that she, too, was surprised at the high listings, but noted that values were rising over all. A house in Salisbury that sold for about $900,000 in 2000 had just come on the market at $2.4 million, she said, and a Roxbury property that went for $4 million in 2001 was listed at $7.5 million.
 Nationally, $25 million price tags are no longer startling. Among the highest-income families, the trend is toward ever more gigantic and lavishly appointed mansions -- the kind that may cost tens of millions of dollars to build.
 One such showplace, the best known of the three properties that now have the county buzzing, is Ivan Lendl's estate in Goshen, a 43,000-square-foot stone house on 450 acres. Mr. Lendl decided to sell after he was unable to get permits to build a high-end golf course in Goshen. He bought the land for his estate in the late 1980's for $4.2 million, had the mansion built in 1992 and now has it on the market for $25 million, which includes a half interest in an additional 230 acres that are jointly held with a neighbor.
 Behind the estate's gated entrance are views from its elevation of 1,300 feet. The house has 10 bedrooms, 12 full bathrooms and three half bathrooms, an 1,872-square-foot gymnasium with 25-foot ceilings, a separate spa and workout room with his-and-her steam rooms, locker looms, a game room, indoor and outdoor pools, a caretaker's house, a horse barn, formal gardens and, of course, state-of-the-art tennis courts.
 The listing agent, Carolyn Klemm, of Klemm Real Estate in Washington Depot, sees the reason for the high price as self-evident. ''What's happening is that people have come here over the years and made tremendous investments in their properties,'' she said. ''These are major, important people with excellent taste and enormous resources.''
 PINNACLE FARM in Cornwall, originally listed with Klemm at $25 million and now offered at $23.8 million through the Portfolio Properties Group in Goshen, a Christie's affiliate, is another departure from local tradition, a fairy-tale home for horses that lacks one basic amenity, a main house. The farm does have a stable manager's residence, and Stephen Drezen, managing partner of Portfolio Properties, was quick to point out that a building lot is ready. What's in place now is a 65,000-square-foot structure, essentially a palatial stable, that Mr. Drezen said had ''set the standard by which all horse facilities should be measured.'' The farm is on 140 acres on Mohawk Mountain, just up the hill from the actor Sam Waterston's house.
 On a recent morning, after walking past emerald pastures where 42 glistening black Friesian horses grazed in the sun, Mr. Drezen entered the three-story, slate-roofed barn. Its 50 teak box stalls have Palladian windows. The entrance has a giant stone fireplace flanked by fountains and a two-story circular foyer with a 40-foot ceiling and an iron balcony. Also included are horse training facilities, a breeding area, a video-equipped foaling area and a veterinary laboratory. There is, however, no riding ring; these horses are not ridden. 
 The owner, who lives in Miami and asked not to be named for fear of being besieged by phone calls and attention from the media, said during a conference call that she had scrapped plans to build her 40,000-square-foot dream house on the site after her husband's unexpected death. But she still had good things to say about Litchfield. ''I traveled from North Carolina to Virginia to Newport looking for the perfect place to build,'' she said, ''and I finally found it in Cornwall.''
 Some longtime residents are alarmed by the influx of big money and fancy properties. ''I think it's horrible, what's happening,'' said William Cooper, who is 95 and since 1939 has lived in a small home on 18 acres spanning Washington and New Milford. ''They're building these palaces, and they're ruining the natural, New England character of the area.''
 Others disagree. ''I think we deserve this popularity,'' said the playwright and activist Larry Kramer, who bought a 1970's ''dump,'' as he put it, overlooking Lake Waramaug in Warren a dozen years ago, and has been making improvements ever since. ''A lot of us have worked hard for a long time making our places beautiful, and now we're getting recognition for it.''
 Some ascribe the rise in prices to the recent arrival of prestigious real estate companies like Christie's and Sotheby's, which can market Litchfield to a large and wealthy clientele. Others say the big numbers began with Ms. Klemm, who acknowledges that she woos wealthy people with lavish dinner parties at her home in the town of Washington. 
 ''These are huge people moving in here -- I mean, huge -- and they're looking for a certain level of sophistication,'' she said. ''I do what it takes to make them happy. Sometimes I find homes for them that aren't even on the market,'' she said, citing a house in Kent that she had sold to Henry Kissinger. ''I make the owners offers they can't refuse. Everything's for sale at the right price.''
 Litchfield's greatest asset seems to be the land itself -- its restored old houses and charming villages sit amid long scenic stretches of fields and forests. Many owners have sold their development rights to land preservation groups, ensuring the land will stay open. ''People do pay for the view,'' said Nicolas Retsinas, a director at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard. ''The knowledge that these views will stay that way forever is extremely valuable.'' 
 Open land is a large part of what gives the third big listing, Spring Hill Farm in Washington, its $24,250,000 price tag, said its listing broker, Seymour Surnow, director of Sotheby's International Realty for Litchfield County. Of the farm's 373 acres, 320 are protected from development under a state farm preservation program. It borders 650 acres of the Hidden Valley land preserve. On the farm are a 5,000-square-foot 1789 farmhouse and a 2,500-square-foot 1810 house, several horse and cow barns, and a seasonal cabin overlooking a spring-fed pond with a sandy beach along its two miles of frontage on the Shepaug River.
 ''This was a farm even before the town of Washington was founded,'' said the owner, Robert Seymour, whose family farmed hay and tended livestock there for three generations as city buyers transformed the community around them. 
 For real estate brokers, the urge to preserve the open land is a useful selling point. Ms. Klemm just made a $3.75 million sale by approaching Diane von Furstenberg and informing her that the 80-acre farm next to her estate in New Milford was going on the market.
 ''It was an opportunity not to be missed,'' said Ms. von Furstenberg, who bought her Litchfield home as a birthday present to herself in 1974. ''Litchfield County is the most beautiful place on earth, and I want to keep it that way.''

HEADLINE: For the Age of Do-It-Yourself Finance, She Wrote the Book(s) and the Programs

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN

 BODY:
Like many people who are determined to speak in epigrams, Suze Orman frequently talks nonsense. On her weekly financial-advice program, ''The Suze Orman Show,'' which appears Saturdays on CNBC, she splutters, prattles, drops words, mixes metaphors -- apparently driven to gibberish at the thought of what hapless debtors we Americans have become. 
 It's an unusually effective spiel, especially when she follows it with measured advice about improving a credit rating, getting out of annuities and cooking dinner at home more often.
 Ms. Orman, whose braying voice and bleach-and-bronzer styling can be hard to take, is not initially pleasant to watch. But she does endeavor to promote various humane themes, especially ''People first, then money.'' She also tells people, as she did recently on a PBS special, that their souls are perfect, no matter how much money they have. 
 As she continues to flog her latest book, ''The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous & Broke,'' her seventh bestseller, which she published in the spring , she is further obsessed with what financial fools people make of themselves over other people. Co-signing on loans. Covering debt. Not getting prenuptial agreements! What saps we all are.
 ''What am I going to do with these people?'' Ms. Orman wondered aloud a few weeks ago. She appeared genuinely exasperated.
 In general, she addresses the supplicants who come to her on CNBC for advice -- men and women addled about home ownership, car loans, devious insurance agents, indolent husbands and thieving moms -- as ''sweetheart,'' ''girlfriend,'' ''boyfriend'' and ''baby doll.'' These shows of camp intimacy contribute to the cacophony of her self-presentation. And in the evident rush of adrenaline that comes from confronting America's boneheaded middle class, she also hands down pronouncements that don't square with her avowed magnanimity. 
 Consider just one typical exhortation, derived by Ms. Orman from the given importance of people over money. She recently told the daughter of a mooch that she ought to leave her father to his bottomless debt, just as the woman's mother had done.
 Speaking of the mother, Ms. Orman said, ''She had the courage to look at the man that she loved and say, 'Sweetheart, you're going down the drain, but you're not taking me with you!''' This, she told the tremulous girl, is what she should also say to her father: down the drain with you.
 People first, then money. It's a lively show.
 Ms. Orman does television her own way, zooming frenetically around the dial. In addition to the CNBC show, the channel's highest-rated program of the weekend, she also presides over a QVC show, ''Financial Freedom,'' as well as five PBS specials, including the latest one, which includes a rousing lecture she gave at Concordia University, in St Paul, Minn., based on the new book. (In 2004, she won an Emmy for ''The Laws of Money, the Lessons of Life,'' which also appeared on PBS; she is among the most successful fund-raisers the network has ever had.) 
 On the PBS presentation, Ms. Orman acknowledged that in the current economic climate -- with a ''horrific'' job market and high prices for education, gas and health insurance -- young people may not be able to follow the stringent advice she regularly gives their elders. (Stay out of credit-card debt, have an eight-month emergency fund and buy a house.) 
 Instead, college graduates must learn to use credit cards judiciously and treat themselves and their educations as undervalued assets, giving them time to appreciate. They should also invest in their 401(k)'s, but not beyond the point at which companies stop matching; after that, earnings should go to credit-card debt and Roth I.R.A.'s, from which money is easier to extricate than it is from 401(k) plans.
 On the CNBC show, the least scripted of her television adventures, Mr. Orman manages to integrate a range of idioms, from the impressively technical (don't hold a tax-deferred investment in a tax-deferred vehicle) to the vaguely spiritual (credit-card debt is proof of a broken heart). 
 But there's something in her willingness to unravel emotional situations by following the money that expresses uncommon rigor in a self-help regime. And the kick she gets from divining the straits her guests are in -- ''Crossing Over''-style -- is infectious. 
 To a marine who was drowning in debt, she said, in the tone of a clairvoyant, ''Did anybody do something to you that happened to hurt you and have an effect on you and your money?''
 The marine conceded that his brother had stuck him with a bill for a computer.
 Ms. Orman looked smug; she'd read him right. ''Something usually happens that breaks our heart,'' she said. Persisting, she asked: Did that just emotionally destroy you? 
 ''Yeah,'' said the marine.
 ''Your financial problems,'' Ms. Orman concluded, ''start with an emotional, true heartbreak.'' 
 Ms. Orman clearly wants to be at the center of a spectacle of healing. On the show, she often argues that what people think is about money is actually about their feelings, which she asks them to examine. But that doesn't stop the guests from asking, over and over, about money. 
 With her hectic manner and garish appearance, Ms. Orman is television's personal-finance personality for the age of confusing health-insurance plans, do-it-yourself mutual funds, inevitable credit-card debt and online money management. She makes old finance pundits like Louis Rukeyser look as if they were only coaching the people who rip us off. Ms. Orman is here to protect us.
 But not everyone is proud to end up confessing their sins to Ms. Orman. Recently, she had a guest on ''The Suze Orman Show'' who didn't want more money; he wanted to win back people's trust. He had been busted for embezzlement, and he feared the disapproval of the people around him, including his young son. 
 Ms. Orman took the suffering of the fallen executive in stride. ''I have quite a few friends who are convicted felons,'' she told him. ''They did certain things, whether it's tax or whatever else it happened to be, in their lives, and do you know what? I think they're really good people.''
 ''Really?'' The guest seemed to brighten, though he appeared only in silhouette, so it was hard to tell.

HEADLINE: Shares Post Some Gains, Led by Commodity Producers

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose for a fourth day yesterday, led by commodity producers like Exxon Mobil and Alcoa, on optimism that an expanding economy will increase demand.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index nearly erased its loss for the year, adding 4.38 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,210.96, a level not seen since March 8. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 12.28 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,578.65, the highest close since March 18. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 14.23, or 0.7 percent, to 2,089.15. 
 Economic reports released yesterday supported the assessment by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, that the economy was on ''firm footing.'' Housing starts rose 0.2 percent last month to the fastest rate since February. Builders broke ground at an annual rate of 2.009 million housing units, the Commerce Department said. The Labor Department reported separately that jobless claims increased 1,000 to 333,000 last week, a level that economists said showed that the economy was still adding jobs.
 Five stocks advanced for every two that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. About 1.4 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 11 percent fewer than this year's daily average.
 Oil prices jumped to the highest since April 4 amid signs that surging global fuel consumption would strain the production capacity of OPEC and other exporters. Crude oil for July delivery added 1.8 percent, to $56.58 a barrel in New York. An index of energy shares gained 1.5 percent for the biggest rally among 10 industry groups in the S.&P. 500.
 ''We are not going to see oil in the low $30's, high $20's anytime soon,'' said Barry L. Ritholtz, chief market strategist at the Maxim Group in New York. ''Energy will continue to be a good sector, especially natural gas.''
 Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, added 87 cents, closing at $60.12. The El Paso Corporation, owner of the largest network of natural gas pipelines in the United States, rose 24 cents, to $11.28.
 A gauge of raw materials shares had the second-biggest increase, gaining 1.3 percent. Gold prices climbed to $437.90 an ounce, a seven-week high, and copper touched a 16-year high of $1.585 a pound in New York.
 Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminum maker, increased 37 cents, to $27.93. Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold, owner of the largest gold mine, rose $1.32, to $38. Phelps Dodge, the No.2 copper producer, advanced $2.02, to $96.54.
 General Motors slid 72 cents, or 2 percent, to $35.62, for the steepest drop in the Dow average. The automaker might not get enough union concessions on health care costs this year to justify the stock's 14 percent gain in the last week, a Deutsche Bank analyst, Rod Lache, wrote in a note to clients.
 Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, gained $1.93, or 4.6 percent, to $43.92. The company may have 20 percent annual earnings growth over the longer term, helped by expansion of its Christmas Tree Shops, a Lehman Brothers analyst, Alan M. Rifkin, wrote in a report. He upgraded the stock to overweight from equal weight.
 Goldman Sachs, Wall Street's biggest securities trader, climbed $3.46, to $102.65, even after the firm posted its first quarterly profit decline in three years. Earnings were $1.71 a share, less than the $1.87 average analyst estimate in a Thomson Financial poll.
 David A. Viniar, the chief financial officer, said on a conference call that Goldman Sachs's ''investment-banking backlog continued to increase.''
 Takeovers lifted shares of Vicuron Pharmaceuticals and Integrated Circuit Systems. Vicuron, a biotechnology company, surged $12.41, or 79 percent, to $28.21, after Pfizer agreed to buy it for $1.9 billion. 
 Integrated Circuit, a maker of timing devices for electronics, rallied $2.03, to $21.77, after it agreed to be bought by Integrated Device Technology for $1.7 billion. Integrated Device, which makes semiconductors, fell $1.02, to $11.51.
 Prices of Treasury securities rose after a report from the Federal Reserve's Philadelphia branch showed that the region's manufacturing slowed unexpectedly this month. By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year note had risen 8/32, to 100 14/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 4.07 percent, from 4.10 percent on Wednesday.

'SWIMMING IN THE SHALLOWS' Previews start Tuesday. Opens June 28. Edward Albee covered man-goat love. Now Adam Bock looks into man-shark romance in his new nonrealistic comedy about young urban types (1:30). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, fourth floor, (212)246-4422.

'TWELFTH NIGHT' Previews start today. Opens June 25. The Aquila Theater presents Shakespeare's comedy about mistaken identities, unrequited love and the threats of a puritanical zealot (2:15). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200.

Broadway

'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Though its opening odd-couple-on-a-dance-floor skit shows promising charm, this evening of three sketches from the first lady of neurotic comedy, Elaine May, mostly feels terminally torpid in the way that overworked and familiar material often does, even from comic geniuses. Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and onstage alter ego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.(Ben Brantley)

'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' (Tony Award, Best Musical Revival 2005) Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising souffle of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)

'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)

'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars, Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'MARK TWAIN TONIGHT!' In a role he has been playing over half a century, Hal Holbrook delivers a performance that is perhaps most remarkable for the energy it derives from a studied languor. Mr. Holbrook's Twain is an exhilarating master of theatrical passive aggression, while Twain's observations about corrupt journalists, politicians and religious fanatics remain soberingly relevant (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street (212)307-4100.(Brantley)

* 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary, sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the mass killings of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'FASTER' Two sides of a love triangle snap under the pressure of our speeded-up culture in ''Faster'' by London's Filter Theater, part of the Brits Off Broadway festival. Based on James Gleick's book of the same name, the play is elegiac but also an exuberant demonstration of the electrifying acceleration of modern life (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200.(Miriam Horn)

* 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)

'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30) . Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)

* 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz gets himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300. (Isherwood)

'RAIN' Wild, witty, wet and altogether winning. Those words sum up Rain, the new Cirque Eloize show that is ending the season at the New Victory Theater with a figurative and literal splash. This Quebec-based troupe, which opened the New Victory in December 1995, combines high circus arts and ingratiating self-mockery with nostalgic costumes, eclectic music and song, evocative lighting and creative choreography in two hours of fun calculated to please children and adults alike (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'SENECA'S OEDIPUS' In the new production of Seneca's ''Oedipus'' by the Theater by the Blind, the iconic story of the king of Thebes who unknowingly murders his father and marries his mother is performed in modern dress. The poet Ted Hughes's masterly 1968 adaptation is vividly alive, contemporary and shocking (1:30). Mint Space, 311 West 43rd Street, (212)868-4444. (Honor Moore)

'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs. Goldsmith's 1773 comedy mocks the snobbery of the London upper class, while piling on the slapstick, mistaken identities and farce (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Genzlinger)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)

'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Presnyakov brothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)

* 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)

'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters and affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.(Anita Gates)

Off Off Broadway

'DISCONNECT' Plant four witty, intellectually stimulating people around a dinner table and you might have an engaging play. Plant four uninsightful, insipid people around a dinner table and you have ''Disconnect,'' a new work by Rob Ackerman that lets some self-absorbed 30-somethings whine for two hours about lost friends and parental beatings of long ago (1:45). The Working Theater, at the East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.(Genzlinger)

* 'DISPOSABLE MEN' James Scruggs, who wrote and performed this collection of character pieces, engages issues of race in the button-pushing satirical style that Spike Lee was aiming for (yet failed to pull off) in his film Bamboozled. This multimedia show compares the way African-American men are portrayed in the media to images of monsters in classic horror films like Frankenstein and King Kong (1:10). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, one block below Spring Street, (212)868-4444.(Jason Zinoman)

'FLAT' This happily crass send-up of a BBC family drama is perfectly pitched for fans nostalgic for the self-parodying vulgarity of the sit-com ''Married With Children.'' Twelve episodes, quick scenes, stock characters and an opening montage sequence with a jingle that will lodge itself in your cranium, like it or not (1:00). Part of the Moral Values Festival. Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212)868-4444. (Zinoman)

'KICKER' What happens when a star journalist mistakes a seven-hour interview with a celebrity novelist for the beginning of a beautiful friendship? This premise is better than this would-be comedy, which doesn't manage to make its characters or situations credible enough to answer its own question. Best: the send-up of the Hollywood star spewing out the same old quotes -- and, true to the title, the last line. Connelly Theater, 220 East 4th Street, (212)868-4444. (Anne Midgette)

'LITTLE MARY' William S. Leavengood's parable about faith, politics and conservatism in the Roman Catholic Church can sound more like a position paper than a play, but the author's strong storytelling instincts can't be denied (2:10). Sanford Meisner Theater, 164 11th Avenue, at 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)352-3101.(Andrea Stevens)

'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101. (Brantley)

'TRAILERVILLE' Here in the age of baby-boomer angst about unwell parents, stages and bookshelves and movie-of-the-week schedules are full of old people and those who care for them, which means that the those who would visit the subject today need to make sure they're bringing some fresh insights. John Dufresne, a novelist trying full-length drama, doesn't in ''Trailerville,'' an unruly play with a respectable supply of nicely turned phrases but nothing new to add to the growing eldercare genre (2:15). Blue Heron Arts Center, 123 East 24th Street, (212)868-4444, (Genzlinger)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)

Last Chance

'THE ARGUMENT' Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of the post-9/11 play ''Omnium Gatherum,'' aims to personalize another hot-button issue here, but it's not likely that any serious thought, old or new, is going to be provoked by this whiny debate between two uninteresting types about the ever-sensitive topic of abortion. He wants the baby; she doesn't. It is hard to care (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)353-0303, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'MARATHON 2005, SERIES B' The second installment in this annual festival of short plays, which includes lively sketches by David Mamet and David Lindsay-Abaire, allows theatergoers the pleasure of hearing famous voices practicing scales, as it were, and of discovering that no matter what key they're singing in, they still sound like themselves (1:45). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

'MISS JULIE' Anders Cato directs a new adaptation by Craig Lucas. Marin Hinkle, as Miss Julie, and Reg Rogers, as her father's uppity valet, Jean, spar and flirt, humiliate each other and humble themselves as expected, in the traditional kitchen, with the designated disastrous results. Chances are you won't believe a word of it (1:35). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'RICHARD AND ANNE' That idiot Shakespeare had it all wrong, according to ''Richard and Anne,'' an unknown script by Maxwell Anderson that is being energetically brought to light by the young actors of Mirror Repertory's training program. Tired of being maligned in productions of ''Richard III,'' the real Richard, no hunched back evident, comes back from the grave to set things straight (2:15). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street, Manhattan, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)

'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Slight but pithy, this humorous revue of 18 songs with lyrics by Mark Campbell and music by 18 different composers takes a sardonic and explicit look at gay life in New York: ''Sex with an actor. What was I thinking?'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. ( Midgette)

'WORK: A MADCAP TRAGI-PARODY OF CORPORATE AMERICA' Unless you've been living in a cave, Charlotte Meehan's play ''Work: A Madcap Tragi-Parody of Corporate America'' should sound familiar, starting with its title. But when real life tops fiction, what's left to say? Not much, in this case. And that's the problem (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)226-2407, closing on Thursday. (Stevens)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'THE ADVENTURES OF SHARKBOY AND LAVAGIRL IN 3-D' (PG, 94 minutes) There's a reason that children aren't allowed to vote, drive, or make movies with multimillion-dollar budgets. Lively and imaginative as their inner worlds may be, the very young still lack the discipline and maturity to shape their dreamworlds into coherent and compelling stories -- a task the director Robert Rodriguez (''El Mariachi,'' ''Sin City'') also fails to accomplish in this muddled quest narrative based on characters and themes created by his 7-year-old son, Racer Max.(Dana Stevens)

* 'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Manohla Dargis)

'THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY' (PG, 120 minutes) The best efforts of the blue-ribbon cast cannot save this hopelessly stuffy, muddled screen adaptation of Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel set in Peru in the early 18th century. (Stephen Holden)

* 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left-wing and bohemian, the other right-wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured, and entertaining.(Holden)

'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best part of Ron Howard's ingratiating, Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, two actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renee Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)

'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism.(A.O. Scott)

* 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)

'5x2' (R, 90 minutes, in French) A couple's relationship unravels backward, from divorce through the birth of their child to their first meeting. Interesting but chilly. (Scott)

* 'THE HOLY GIRL' (Not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)

'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)

* 'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott)

'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)

* 'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) A film about a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)

'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)

'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)

'THE LONGEST YARD' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In this crummy remake of the 1974 film of the same title, Adam Sandler stars as the former N.F.L. quarterback Paul Crewe, who years earlier was booted out of the league for shaving points and is now charged with leading a team of prisoners against a team of guards. In the original film, directed with seriocomic facility by Robert Aldrich, Crewe was played by Burt Reynolds with effortless charm and the tightest pants this side of Tony Orlando. The Aldrich version was recently released on DVD and makes for a nice evening in. (Dargis)

'LORDS OF DOGTOWN' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Southern California skateboarders in the 1970's, when a hobby became a full-blown (and lucrative) subculture. Scruffy, loose and reckless, in the spirit of its time and place. (Scott)

'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo -- expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)

'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott)

'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)

'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)

* 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)

'THE NINTH DAY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in German) A somber, thought-provoking moral thriller, in which a Roman Catholic priest from Luxembourg, temporarily released from Dachau, finds his conscience tested when the Nazis try to co-opt him. Interesting ideas, insufficiently dramatized. (Scott)

'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Stevens)

* 'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)

'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (Not rated, 45 minutes) A choppy tour of South African flora and fauna. Youngsters will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful for this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity.(Ned Martel)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

BAD PLUS (Tonight) This piano-driven power trio's adventurous spirit straddles the boundaries of jazz and rock, and their exuberant forays are way more fun than their sketchy decision to cover Nirvana's ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' would suggest. The players, native Midwesterners all, throw themselves into live shows with prairie-fire earnestness. 7:30 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Ninth Street & Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn, free. (Laura Sinagra)

BETTIE SERVEERT (Tomorrow) In the mid-90's, these Dutch bohemians' combination of bright, twisty guitar work and the breathy yet plucky voice of Carol Van Dyk became a college-rock mainstay. They remain resolutely quirky, continuing to deliver honest grownup pop dispatches. 8:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $15, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)

BILAL (Thursday) Bilal has huge ambitions, spanning jazz and soul, funk and gospel, hip-hop and pop. Even when his material doesn't live up to those ambitions, he has musicality to spare. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston, South Village, (212)243-4940, $22, $25 at the door.(Jon Pareles)

BOYZ II MEN (Tuesday) The smooth, if extravagantly produced, harmonies of this R&B quartet made the breakup anthem ''End of the Road'' and their duet with Mariah Carey, the epic after-death apology ''One Sweet Day'' blockbuster radio singles in the mid-90's. Recently, they have been sticking to greatest hits and cover projects. 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305, $39 to $49. (Sinagra)

BRAVE COMBO (Thursday) Can every rock and pop style be reduced -- or elevated -- to the fast bounce of a polka? Brave Combo has been making polka hybrids since 1979. 10 p.m. Satalla, 37 West 26th Street (212)576-1155, $15, $18 at the door. (Pareles)

JOHN BUTLER TRIO, WOOD BROTHERS (Tuesday) John Butler is an Australian guitarist who, like Ben Harper, turns thoughtful songs into guitar and slide-guitar excursions. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $16, $18 at the door (sold out). (Pareles)

LAURA CANTRELL (Tuesday) With her old-timey country radio show on WFMU and real Southern roots, the guitarist and songwriter Laura Cantrell has a deep alt-country resum. She writes clever ditties about the urban romantic experience. 7 p.m., Virgin Megastore, Union Square, 52 East 14th Street, (212)598-4666, free. (Sinagra)

VANESSA CARLTON (Tuesday) The Wayans brothers' ''White Chicks'' poked fun at the pianist and songwriter Vanessa Carlton's daintily petulant 2002 hit ''A Thousand Miles,'' while acknowledging that it's a truly infectious sinagalong. Her recent efforts reveal charming lyrics, though the her piano playing is still rather fussy. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770, $20. (Sinagra)

* DERRICK CARTER (Sunday) Count on Mr. Carter to spin an exciting, unpredictable set. He loves to enliven his thwacking house beats with squiggles and squelches, and he gravitates toward robotic bass lines, disembodied voices and scrambled snippets of disco and jazz. With Miss Honey Dijon. 10 p.m., Cielo, 18 Little West 12th Street, near Greenwich Street, the Meatpacking District, (212)645-5700, $15. (Kelefa Sanneh)

CJ CHENIER (Sunday) This son of Clifton Chenier, who was the undisputed king of zydeco, picked up his father's accordion and his Red Hot Louisiana Band in the 1980's, carrying on the family tradition of bayou dance music laced with blues. 6:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212)576-1155, $22. (Pareles)

THE COMAS (Tomorrow) Like a lot of indie rock bands, the Comas seem tentative about ''really trying.'' But when they do, as on the best cuts from last year's dreamy ''Conductor'' (Yep Roc), their portrayals of wage slavery and lolling slacker lust exude an intriguing passive-aggression. 10 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, rothkonyc.com, $10. (Sinagra)

COMETS ON FIRE (Thursday) As epic as the Grateful Dead in its late 60's ballroom era and as noisy as its distant forebears Sonic Youth, this band conjures dark granduer with guitars and organ creating a swirl of heedless squall. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $14, $16 at the door. (Sinagra)

ELYSIAN FIELDS (Tomorrow) With Jennifer Charles's smoky voice and Oren Bloedow's electric guitar, Elysian Fields conjure a haunted, late-night atmosphere in songs full of love and trouble. 9:30 p.m. Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200, $15. (Pareles)

FREE BLOOD (Tomorrow) This trio, a side-project of the dance-punk band called !!!, is the headliner at this concert devoted to discordant (and sometimes danceable) post-punk. The charming venue (long may it last) sells sweet confections, used records and beer, in three rooms on two levels. 9 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212)253-0036, $6.(Sanneh)

ROBERT FRIPP (Thursday) The King Crimson guitarist and master of the spacey, droning combination of tape loops called ''Frippertronics'' performs selections from his ongoing ''Soundscapes'' project in this newly renovated space. 8 p.m., Concert Hall at the Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, 212874-5210 and 212712-7171, $37.50. (Sinagra)

DAVID GRUBBS (Tonight) The good parts of progressive rock -- its willingness to embrace complexity and eccentricity, its determination to avoid formulas -- have meant a lot to David Grubbs. He has been central to Gastr del Sol and Bastro, two bands known for heartfelt, wayward songs and excursions to the edges of rock. 8 p.m., the Project Room, 400 Carroll Street, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, $10. (Pareles)

LALAH HATHAWAY (Thursday) The daughter of the songwriter Donny Hathaway made a loving rhythm-and-blues album in 1990 and has since turned up as a jazz singer. This is a chance to hear what she's been up to lately. She plays this outdoor concert as part of BAM's R&B Festival. 12 p.m., MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, downtown Brooklyn, free. (Pareles)

MICHAEL HURLEY, THE PLACES (Sunday) Mr. Hurley is one of the most fertile-minded of all the unreconstructed folkies. Though he's had his ups and downs, the humor and grooves of his detailed, offhandedly existential songs about talking porkchops and growing pot deserve a place in the American songbook. The Places are led by a Portland Americana artist, Amy Annelle. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503, $10. (Sinagra)

IRON & WINE (Tonight) The modern rustic Sam Beam takes a whispery, almost Chet Baker-like approach to folk vocals. Sung atop delicately plucked guitar, his lyrics speak to the sensitive male's concerns about intimacy and mortality. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, $18 , $20 at the door. (Sinagra)

JUNIOR SENIOR (Thursday) This Danish duo hit big in 2003 with the euphoric, semi-campy dancefloor dictum ''Move You Feet.'' Its exuberant thumps and shouts rang bells with dance-music and rock fans. Their new single, ''Itch U Can't Scratch,'' slows things down a bit, mixing disco and peppy old-school rap. 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $15. (Sinagra)

JORMA KAUKONEN (Saturday) One of the original psychedelic blues players, Jorma Kaukonen brought the Jefferson Airplane both searing electric guitar lines and old-fashioned blues. He then founded Hot Tuna, a band built on spiky, ragtimey blues. His own songs contemplate death and loss, holding his gentle voice in a lattice of fingerpicking. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd, (212)997-4144, $32.50, $36 at the door. (Pareles)

CYNDI LAUPER (Thursday) The new waver and activist Cyndi Lauper retains the zany streak that made her jumpy pro-girl pop songs and emotional synthesizer ballads favorites on MTV in the 1980's. She performs as part of Lincoln Center's Gay Pride salute lineup. Show time is 7 p.m., Rose Theater at the Time Warner Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212)721-6500, $85 to $135. (Sinagra)

LITTLE RICHARD (Wednesday) Rock 'n' roll wouldn't be the same without the whoops and hollers, the pounding barrelhouse piano chords and swooping glissandos that Little Richard hurled onto his singles in the 1950's. Preaching from the piano stool and belting songs like ''Tutti Frutti,'' he's still a force for creative anarchy. 8 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144, $60 (Pareles)

M2O PLAY PIAZZOLA (Tomorrow) Accomplished tango musicians, the violinist Machiko Ozawa and the pianist Makia Matsumura interpret the roiling, fluid music of Astor Piazzolla, 10 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village , www.thestonenyc.com, $10. (Sinagra)

HUGH MASEKELA (Thursday) The South African flugelhornist Hugh Masekela has more to offer than his international hit ''Grazing in the Grass.'' For decades, he has brought together the three-chord lope of South African pop with the zig-zagging possibilities of jazz. 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; $3 suggested donation. (Pareles)

MODEST MOUSE, CAMPER VAN BEETHOVEN (Monday) The Modest Mouse frontman Isaac Brock uses his guitar to evoke creepy, lonely Northwestern expanses, but his rhythmic yen sometimes produces disco hybrids like the recent ''Float On,'' which unfurls bright guitar ribbons over a stomping beat. 80's college rock jokesters Camper van Beethoven recently reunited to release a concept album about a dystopian California. 6 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Field, 72nd Street, (212)360-2777, $30, $35 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra)

THE NATIONAL (Tonight) These Brooklynites play a kind of countryfied glowering rock that underplays its hand enough to seem modest. But even if the self-deprecating relationship woes of its frontman, Matt Berninger, recall those of the Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo, his renderings have yet to make his gripes as interesting. 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $12 (sold out). (Sinagra)

THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS/GREEN MILK (Wednesday and Thursday) This revved-up Vancouver outfit's tight power-pop grandeur builds with a sort of time-release tension, until the voice of Neko Case cuts through like a triumphant skywriter. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)798-0406, sold out. June 25 at 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; $3 suggested donation.(Sinagra)

NORTHERN STATE, SUPAGROUP, JASON LOWENSTEIN, DJ EUGENE HUTZ (Wednesday) Hipster luminaries coming together in a benefit for a union representing Village Voice employees include Northern State, the female rappers from Long Island whose buoyant and self-aware rhyming tickled funny bones a couple of years ago; the raucously sloppy heavy metal act Supagroup, the energetic former Sebadoh member Mr. Lowenstein; and Gogol Bordello's self-proclaimed Gypsy-punk frontman Eugene Hutz. 8 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, rothkonyc.com, $10. (Sinagra)

OASIS, JET (Wednesday) No one ever accused Manchester's football-loving Gallagher brothers of originality or humility, and Oasis, their brash Beatlesque steamroller of a band, stands by their proven formula: simple, epic riffs, melodies arrogant in their inevitability and lyrics so dim they become profound. The one-hit rock 'n' rollers Jet open. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, (212)465-6741, $34.50 to $75, (sold out). (Sinagra)

DON OMAR (Tomorrow) One of reggaeton's biggest names is a headliner at the ''2005 Latin Fest,'' an amusement-park concert where other performers include the salsa singer Victor Manuelle, the rapper Cuban Link and Hector el Bambino, another reggaeton star. 3 p.m., Northern Star Arena, Six Flags Great Adventure, 1090 King George Post Road, New Jersey Turnpike Exit 7A, Jackson, N.J., (732)928-1821, $53. (Sanneh)

TOM PETTY & THE HEARTBREAKERS+BLACK CROWES (Tuesday) The rocker Tom Petty's slightly technophobic 2002 ''The Last DJ'' (Warner Brothers) righteously lamented corporate greed and radio blandness. But it contained no especially radio-worthy songs. Nothing like the raw scrape of ''Refugee,'' the rousing ''Free Fallin''' or the darkly hyper ''American Girl.'' 7:30 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, (516)221-1000, $39.50 to $67.50. (Sinagra)

TOSHI REAGON (Sunday) Singing about both love and politics with the same sense of independence, Toshi Reagon applies her gutsy voice and syncopated guitar playing to songs steeped in blues and funk. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette, East Village, (212)539-8770, $20. (Pareles)

JONATHAN RICHMAN (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) Recent albums haven't added much to this whimsically nuerotic rock 'n' roll livewire's stream-of-consciousness classics, but the live ritual remains a goofy joy. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $15. (Sinagra)

KENNY WAYNE SHEPHERD (Tomorrow) For young blues guitarists like Kenny Wayne Shepherd, the blues has as much to do with the Allman Brothers and Jimi Hendrix as it did with Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson. With a baritone howl that's somewhere between Gregg Allman and Robin Trower and a guitar style that looks to Stevie Ray Vaughan, Mr. Shepherd treats the blues as a muscular cry of desperation. 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., Garden State Parkway, Exit 116, (732)335-0400, $20 to $45. (Pareles)

SLEATER-KINNEY, DEAD MEADOW (Thursday) The incisive yet expansive guitar soloing lately preferred by Carrie Brownstein is the best reason to check out Sleater-Kinney, the enduring trio of grown-up riot grrrls who reach new melodic heights with each album. Dead Meadow plays heavy and somehow pastoral hard rock. 6:45 p.m. Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, (212)247-0200, $21. (Sinagra)

* RICHIE SPICE (Sunday) This fiery roots-reggae singer released one of 2004's best reggae albums, ''Spice in Your Life'' (www.fifthelementrecords.com). He loves midtempo reggae grooves, but he's a restless singer; the album includes ''Earth a Run Red,'' his fiery and exhilarating protest song that makes the apocalypse sound like the world's best (and last) party. With Chuck Fender, Anthony Cruz and Spanna Banna. 10 p.m., Wild Palm, 1601 Bronxdale Avenue, the Bronx, (646)539-0749, $30. (Sanneh)

EMILIANA TORRINI (Wednesday) Though she's of Italian and Icelandic descent, Emiliana Torrini was raised in Britain. Her first material was produced in the trip-hop vein, but her latest effort ''Fisherman's Woman'' showcases her haunting voice in a more acoustic setting. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770, $12.(Sinagra)

TRACHTENBURG FAMILY SLIDESHOW PLAYERS (Wednesday and Thursday) In this familial performance art project, Jason Trachtenburg plays lo-fi pop tunes inspired by slides found at yard sales and flea markets, while his wife, Tina, runs the projector. Their 9-year-old daughter, Rachel, who has become something of a girl-power poster child, plays drums. 8 p.m., Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212)575-0300, $15. (Sinagra)

TRINIDAD & TOBAGO WORLD STEELBAND MUSIC FESTIVAL (Sunday) When Trinidad and Tobago opened their biennial steelband competition to the world in 1988, it drew competitors from Venezuela, Guyana and Sweden. In 2004, bands hailed from Europe, the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. The competition, which requires that a classical composition be played, highlights the full range of steel-pan sonics. 4 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street at Seventh Avenue, (212)465-6741, $44.50 to $59.50. (Sinagra)

DAR WILLIAMS (Wednesday) This adorable coffeehouse singer-songwriter augments her sweet voice with that rare quality of seeming like a real person. If her acoustic musings about a favorite babysitter or the romance of Spring Street can seem impossibly hopeful, they rarely slip into treacle. 7 p.m., Madison Square Park, Madison Avenue and 26th Street, free. (Sinagra)

Cabaret

Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

BARBARA CARROLL (Sundays at 2 and 8 p.m.) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan; (212)419-9331. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $42 at 8, plus a $15 minimum; an $80 dinner-and-show package is available. (Stephen Holden)

* BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212)265-8133. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available. (Holden)

* EARTHA KITT (Tuesdays through Saturdays) The godmother of golddiggers, still glamorous as ever at 78, remains in full command of a voice that can tear into a song with a ravenous ferocity, and the personality to go with it. Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan; (212)744-1600, through July 2. At 8:45, with an additional show on Saturdays at 10:45 p.m. Cover: $85 Tuesdays through Thursdays, $95 Fridays and Saturdays; no minimum. (Holden)

Jazz

Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

PECK ALLMOND KALIMBA COLLECTIVE (Sunday) This unusual ensemble finds Mr. Allmond augmenting his usual arsenal of horns with a handful of kalimbas, or African thumb pianos; the group's other timbres include violin (Jenny Scheinman), marimba (Kenny Wollesen) and Haitian hand drums (Bonga Jean-Baptiste). 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, between North Third Street and Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934, no cover.(Nate Chinen)

Museums

* AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times is used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Smith)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizzazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'etre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)

COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)

* EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustin Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272. (Holland Cotter)

* GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)

* JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterfully composed landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)

MET: 'DEFINING YONGLE,' through July 10. This show of imperial art in early-15th-century China is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)

MET: 'MAX ERNST,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.)(Cotter)

MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)

* MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,' through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)

STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: CHRIS OFILI, 'AFRO-MUSES,' through July 3. More than 100 delirious watercolors by this familiar British artist, warm-up exercises for his daily routine. They depict imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, in African garb, and in deep, swimmy colors -- portraits as modest and charming as the work that made Mr. Ofili famous is outsize and occasionally over the top. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Kimmelman)

* STUDIO MUSEUM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art or music that this country has produced. (See above.) (Smith)

UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)

WHITNEY AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, the artist's ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)

Galleries: Uptown

HUBERTUS GOJOWCZYK: 'THE BOOK AS OBJECT' If Joseph Cornell had been a librarian, he might have produced sculptures like the fantastically altered books that this Polish artist creates. Glass eyes stare out from the pages of one old tome; the corner of another morphs into a waxy brain. Achim Moeller, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through June 24. (Johnson)

Galleries: 57th Street

DON COLLEY: 'FALL GUYS & ZEITGEISTS' Whether or not you like his images of thuggish clowns and romantic skies, you have to admit that Mr. Colley's new pieces are technically remarkable. They appear to be small, beautifully worked encaustic paintings, but they are, in fact, kiln-fired glazed ceramic tiles. George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212)644-5665, through June. (Johnson)

THOMAS SCHUTTE: 'ONE MAN HOUSES' Models of small, modernistic houses meant to be built full-size by collectors, who buy them and furniture made from hollow-core doors, reflect on design and consumerism but with less formal interest and conceptual wit than do the works of Andrea Zittel or Jorge Pardo. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212)977-7160, through July 2. (Johnson)

'OK/OKAY' This entertaining two-gallery exhibition introduces 14 European artists whose works in nontraditional media tend to read like overproduced one-liners. Swiss Institute , 495 Broadway, (212)925-2035; and Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212)998-6780, through July 16. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

BENJAMIN BUTLER: 'FOREST'S EDGE' Abstracted landscapes made with a brusquely sensuous touch in finely tuned colors toy with conventions of early Modernism to visually exciting effect. Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212)279-9219, through June 18. (Johnson)

SOPHIE CALLE: 'EXQUISITE PAIN' Ms. Calle's complicated, two-part installation telling the story of the painful end of a love affair in words and pictures is absorbing but her programmatic intellectualism muffles the emotional dimension. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212)255-1105, through July 22. (Johnson)

CHAN CHAO: 'ECHO' Tension between the clinical and the voyeuristic animates high-definition portraits of attractive nude woman by a photographer known for portraits of young Burmese rebel soldiers. Yancy Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, through July 2. (Johnson)

* GREGORY CREWDSON: BENEATH THE ROSES Narrative and theatrical craft have overtaken art and visual form in these dreary mural-size color photographs, which are so freighted with props, contrivances and omens, and so monotonously joyless that their sense of foreboding turns into parody. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street (212)206-6100, through June 18. (Smith)

JASPER JOHNS: CATENARY Paintings and drawings less mandarin in their personal iconography only by comparison with the clotted art of the 1980's and 90's. There is a series of stupendously beautiful prints. The redeeming through line is touch, whose eloquence nearly salvages the works from their own oppressive claustrophobia. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)243-0200, through June 25. (Kimmelman)

'SCULPTURE' This judicious small selection of three-dimensional works includes a rustic dream house by Vito Acconci; videos showing through an antique Asian iron gate by Nam June Paik; big, smooth white birds by Hiraki Sawa; and an amazing, life-size stainless steel tree by Roxy Paine. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through June 25. (Johnson)

HIROSHI SUGIMOTO Photographs of antique mathematical and mechanical models, evoking Brancusi, Arp and Man Ray, turning their subjects into big-screen cinematic presences, curvaceous and potent. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, (212)627-1018, through June 25. (Kimmelman)

TIP TOLAND: 'CYCLE OF LIFE' Comically humane and technically impressive painted clay sculptures by this West Coast ceramicist include a life-size, nude, octogenarian lady in a sexy, standing pose and twin gray-haired women realized with remarkable realism from the waist up. Nancy Margolis, 523 West 25th Street, (212)242-3013, through June 30. (Johnson)

KARIN WEINER: 'FRONTIERA' A camp site of cardboard logs, stuffed fabric stones and a rag rug around a television set; suspended stuffed clouds like ornate patchwork mattresses; a mound of stuffed antlers; and collages of countless flowers comprise this industriously zany artist's second solo. ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212)229-1088, through July 29. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

* MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)

* 'ALBERTO CASADO: TODO CLANDESTINO, TODO POPULAR,' This young artist uses a technique involving painting on glass and aluminum foil to create shimmering, faux-kitsch works about politics, religion and ordinary life in Cuba. Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-0473, through June 25.(Johnson)

MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, who have meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith)

'GLASS, SERIOUSLY' This fine selection of artworks in glass includes teardrops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained-glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson)

JUDY LEDGERWOOD: 'SPRING FEVER' With a boldly insouciant touch and vibrantly dissonant colors, this Chicago-based artist makes grid-based pattern paintings using heraldic overtones and punchy mandala compositions of squished balloonlike shapes. Tracy Williams, 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212)229-2757, through June 24. (Johnson)

MAKE IT NOW: NEW SCULPTURE IN NEW YORK This survey of work by nearly 30 young and youngish artists is overly cautious but nonetheless gives an interesting account of the diffuse field of sculpture (which includes photography, video, ceramics and painting in this case); tracks the current cross-fertilization between assemblage and appropriation art and offers enough glimmers of new talent to be worth a visit. Sculpture Center, 41-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718)361-1750, through July 31. (Smith)

MALCOM MORLEY: THE ART OF PAINTING After 30 years, Malcolm Morley returns to the Photo Realist painting style he helped found in the mid 1960's, further exploring the tensions between reality, the art of painting and the act of looking and demonstrating that fidelity, taken far enough, turns into something else. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)999-7337, through June 25. (Smith)

Last Chance

DEAN BYINGTON Skillfully blending the handmade and the mechanical, the paintings of this San Francisco artist use patterns suggestive of lacy wallpaper and images from 19th-century engravings to evoke landscapes and their not always peaceful inhabitants. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)255-8450, closing tomorrow.(Smith)

ROBBERT FLICK: 'TRAJECTORIES' With the cinematic idea that successive views give a dynamic sense of place, Mr. Flick mounted a video camera in his car window. He packs the results in grid formation on big sheets that give off the vibes of a country road, a city street, a desertscape. The whole is more than the sum of its tiny parts. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)989-7600, closing tomorrow. (Glueck)

CORNELIA FOSS Graceful, mature, modest paintings full of light and a subtle geometry: views of the beaches and salt marshes on Long Island and of Central Park. DFN Gallery, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman)

* JULIO GONZALEZ This small but illuminating 43-piece exhibition surveys the career of a sculptor who, late in life, taught Picasso how to work with metal and then went on in the 1930's to create playful, Cubist-style, welded iron assemblages that transformed modern sculpture. Instituto Cervantes, 211 East 49th Street, Turtle Bay, (212)308-7720, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

JACQUELINE HUMPHRIES Gestural abstractions made with fluorescent paint, lighted by black lights, campy and eloquent. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212)995-1785, closing tomorrow.(Kimmelman)

RINKO KAWAUCHI: 'AILA AND THE EYES, THE EARS' In her second New York show this young Japanese photographer is showing large pale close-ups of natural phenomenon -- fish eggs, dead chickens, a hatching bird -- reminding us with oddly visionary effects that life's big themes are in the details. Cohan and Leslie, 138 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-8711, closing tomorrow. (Smith)

ANNETTE LAWRENCE Ms. Lawrence, who is known for abstract works symbolizing themes of African-American ancestry, here presents an airy, expansive installation of many lengths of white string stretched in horizontal lines across the gallery. It is nicely complemented by musically suggestive drawings on brown paper composed of parallel pencil lines and calligraphic blobs in black, white and blood red. Betty Cunningham, 541 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-2772, closing on Wednesday. (Johnson)

RICHARD PRINCE A well-chosen assortment of works from the past 25 years by this influential Neo-Pop semiotician includes joke paintings, car hood sculptures and photographs of scruffy upstate New York landscapes. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-9300, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

* NEO RAUCH In his familiar and fashionable vein, mixing Pop, Surrealism, Socialist Realism and a stew of 19th-century sources, these latest paintings are more tours de force of labor and oddball design, chilly and sophisticated. The work is operating at a level where the air is thin and cold. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2070, closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman)

JEFF SONHOUSE: 'THE PANOPTIC CON' As sharp visually as they are politically, Mr. Sonhouse's compact, finely painted Pop-Surrealist portraits depict masked African-American men in colorful tuxedos with hair made of real matches, steel wool and other materials. In some, subjects are shown twice, mug-shot style: face-forward and in profile. These slyly incendiary works probe the mystique of the mythic scary-sexy black dude. Kustera Tilton, 520 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212)989-0082, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

STURTEVANT: 'PUSH AND SHOVE' The artist known for copying works by Warhol, Johns and other contemporary artists presents a darkly elegant installation of fake Duchamps, including a ceiling of 1,200 scrotumlike coal bags, a urinal, two bottle racks and a snow shovel. Perry Rubenstein, 527 West 23rd Street and 526 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)627-8000, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

HIROSHI SUGITO AND ROSILINE LUDUVICO The Japan-based Mr. Sugito and the Germany-based Ms. Luduvico bring compatible sensibilities to this dual show. Painted with wispy delicacy, her small pictures of people in the woods conjure sweet, sad moods. His most imposing painting, a large luminous field of patchy green punctuated by little butterflies, projects a vigorously sensuousness fantasy of pastoral bliss. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)243-3335, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)

JEAN CLAUDE WOUTERS: 'PORTRAITS & NUDES -- SPIRIT' Through a process of re-photographing his prints, this French artist creates large, black-and-white photographs that are so pale it may take a second to see the ghostly image of a nude torso or, more hauntingly, the larger-than-life face that seems to gaze at us from an ethereal realm. Meyerowitz, 120 11th Avenue, at 20th Street, (212)414-2770, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

HEADLINE: U.S. Bank Buys Stake In China

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY and JULIE CRESWELL; Chris Buckley reported from Beijing for this article and Julie Creswell from New York.

DATELINE: BEIJING, Friday, June 17 

 BODY:
Looking to gain access to one of the hottest economies in the world, the Bank of America Corporation said Friday that it had agreed to acquire a 9 percent stake in China Construction Bank for $2.5 billion.
 For Bank of America, which has made acquisitions of several financial institutions in the United States, including last year's $47 billion takeover of the FleetBoston Financial Corporation, the deal with China Construction is another indication of its plan to expand aggressively overseas.
 ''We've been looking for some time for a way to invest in this economy,'' the chief executive of Bank of America, Kenneth D. Lewis, said Friday at the Construction Bank's headquarters in western Beijing. The Bank of Construction ''is the first to be ready for foreign investment of any size.'' 
 Despite the weak performance of China's biggest lenders, many foreign banks have expressed an interest in establishing a foothold ahead of 2007, when Beijing opens its banking sector to competition. 
 As part of the deal, Bank of America will invest another $500 million when China Construction holds its initial public offering, which is expected later this year. Bank of America will also receive an option for five and a half years to increase its stake to 19.9 percent, the bank said.
 ''The biggest goal is not to absorb more capital,'' the head of Construction Bank, Guo Shuqing, said during the news conference, ''but to absorb experience in management.''
 Mr. Guo said the American bank would help the Chinese bank to better control its risk.
 Bank of America is expected to play a critical role in offering the technical support and management skills that China Construction Bank needs to give it more credibility, something that will be crucial in attracting investors to its offering. The offering could be valued at more than $5 billion. 
 Foreign investors can buy up to 20 percent of a Chinese bank. Until now, the biggest stake bought by a foreign bank was the $1.75 billion investment last year in the Bank of Communications by HSBC.
 At first blush, reaction to the deal was muted, with analysts saying that it was likely to have a small impact on Bank of America's earnings. Even if Bank of America eventually acquired 19.9 percent of China Construction, one analyst noted that it would be only about 5 percent of the American bank's earnings. As part of its stake in the Chinese bank, Bank of America will hold a seat on a board of 16 to 19 people.
 Asked if the acquisition was a vote of confidence in China's banking system, Ivan Chung, managing director for credit ratings for Xinhua Finance, said: ''Yes, it is, but it's more for the long term. I don't think anybody expects problems in the Chinese banking system will disappear soon. But foreign investors seem confident that the potential opportunities will overwhelm the structural risks, so it makes sense to acquire a foothold in the banks.''
 Mr. Lewis is known as an astute deal maker, and in recent months, he has been telegraphing his desire to enter the Chinese market as part of the bank's overseas strategy.
 In May he told investors that ''the most likely thing we would consider would be some strategic investment in Asia,'' similar to the bank's 24.9 percent stake in the Mexican bank Grupo Financiero Santander Serfin, acquired for $1.6 billion in 2003. 
 Still, doing business in China has its challenges. Several large banks, including China Construction, have struggled amid scandals and charges of corruption. 
 In March, Zhang Enzhao, the chairman of China Construction Bank, resigned for ''personal reasons.'' But the resignation came in the wake of accusations that Mr. Zhang, who had been at the bank for 40 years, had accepted a $1 million from Alltel Information Services (which has since been renamed Fidelity Information Services) to steer business toward the company.
 Mr. Zhang had succeeded Wang Xuebing, who resigned after charges that he had accepted bribes while serving as chairman of another large government-owned bank, the Bank of China. Mr. Wang is serving a 12-year prison sentence.
 In December 2003, the Chinese government gave the bank $22.5 billion to write off unrecoverable loans from its books, and last year it received a tax break worth $1.9 billion. Even so, Mr. Chung said the bank had ''done a lot recently to clean up their balance sheet and over all, they seem better managed than the others.''
 China Construction Bank says that 4 percent of its loans are nonperforming, down from 9 percent in 2003, making it the least burdened of China's state-owned banks.

HEADLINE: As Toyota Goes ...

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
So I have a question: If I am rooting for General Motors to go bankrupt and be bought out by Toyota, does that make me a bad person? 
 It is not that I want any autoworker to lose his or her job, but I certainly would not put on a black tie if the entire management team at G.M. got sacked and was replaced by executives from Toyota. Indeed, I think the only hope for G.M.'s autoworkers, and maybe even our country, is with Toyota. Because let's face it, as Toyota goes, so goes America. 
 Having Toyota take over General Motors -- which based its business strategy on building gas-guzzling cars, including the idiot Hummer, scoffing at hybrid technology and fighting Congressional efforts to impose higher mileage standards on U.S. automakers -- would not only be in America's economic interest, it would also be in America's geopolitical interest.
 Because Toyota has pioneered the very hybrid engine technology that can help rescue not only our economy from its oil addiction (how about 500 miles per gallon of gasoline?), but also our foreign policy from dependence on Middle Eastern oil autocrats. 
 Diffusing Toyota's hybrid technology is one of the keys to what I call ''geo-green.'' Geo-greens seek to combine into a single political movement environmentalists who want to reduce fossil fuels that cause climate change, evangelicals who want to protect God's green earth and all his creations, and geo-strategists who want to reduce our dependence on crude oil because it fuels some of the worst regimes in the world.
 The Bush team has been M.I.A. on energy since 9/11. Indeed, the utter indifference of the Bush team to developing a geo-green strategy -- which would also strengthen the dollar, reduce our trade deficit, make America the world leader in combating climate change and stimulate U.S. companies to take the lead in producing the green technologies that the world will desperately need as China and India industrialize -- is so irresponsible that it takes your breath away. This is especially true when you realize that the solutions to our problems are already here.
 As Gal Luft, co-chairman of the Set America Free coalition, a bipartisan alliance of national security, labor, environmental and religious groups that believe reducing oil consumption is a national priority, points out: the majority of U.S. oil imports go to fueling the transport sector -- primarily cars and trucks. Therefore, the key to reducing our dependence on foreign oil is powering our cars and trucks with less petroleum.
 There are two ways we can do that. One is electricity. We don't import electricity. We generate all of our needs with coal, hydropower, nuclear power and natural gas. Toyota's hybrid cars, like the Prius, run on both gasoline and electricity that is generated by braking and then stored in a small battery. But, says Luft, if you had a hybrid that you could plug in at night, the battery could store up 20 miles of driving per day. So your first 20 miles would be covered by the battery. The gasoline would only kick in after that. Since 50 percent of Americans do not drive more than 20 miles a day, the battery power would cover all their driving. Even if they drove more than that, combining the battery power and the gasoline could give them 100 miles per gallon of gasoline used, Luft notes.
 Right now Toyota does not sell plug-in hybrids. Some enthusiasts, though, are using kits to convert their hybrids to plug-ins, but that adds several thousand dollars -- and you lose your Toyota warranty. Imagine, though, if the government encouraged, through tax policy and other incentives, every automaker to offer plug-in hybrids? We would quickly move down the innovation curve and end up with better and cheaper plug-ins for all.
 Then add to that flexible-fuel cars, which have a special chip and fuel line that enable them to burn alcohol (ethanol or methanol), gasoline or any mixture of the two. Some four million U.S. cars already come equipped this way, including from G.M. It costs only about $100 a car to make it flex-fuel ready. Brazil hopes to have all its new cars flex-fuel ready by 2008. As Luft notes, if you combined a plug-in hybrid system with a flex-fuel system that burns 80 percent alcohol and 20 percent gasoline, you could end up stretching each gallon of gasoline up to 500 miles. 
 In short, we don't need to reinvent the wheel or wait for sci-fi hydrogen fuel cells. The technologies we need for a stronger, more energy independent America are already here. The only thing we have a shortage of now are leaders with the imagination and will to move the country onto a geo-green path.

HEADLINE: Will Airbus Be the Next Lucent?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: Le Bourget, France 

 BODY:
THE A380, Airbus's new megajet, is an amazing sight. It is even beautiful in a sense, with curved wings that seem almost birdlike when viewed from behind the plane. But while the A380 inspires awe, its eventual success is not assured.
 That is not because Airbus lacks orders. It has plenty, even if no American or Japanese carriers have bought passenger versions. The risk Airbus is running is the same one that devastated two other industries: telecommunications and genetically altered food. In each case, companies' sales rose rapidly, only to plunge because the customers had their own business problems. 
 In telecommunications, the stock market bubble financed companies that ordered equipment based on business models that did not work. Lucent shares went from $64 to $1 as its customers defaulted and tried to unload what they had bought.
 In genetically engineered food, Monsanto produced something new that its customers wanted, only to discover that the focus was on the wrong set of customers. 
 Farmers were offered higher crop yields and better pest resistance, but there was no clear benefit for those who ate the food. In the end, scare stories about ''Frankenfood'' made the industry a pariah in much of the world. Would the story have been different if the scientists had first altered crops to make them more nutritious or less fattening?
 The most enthusiastic buyers for the A380 are airlines based in Dubai and Qatar in the Persian Gulf. Those destinations see themselves as international hubs, where people flying between Asia and Europe will happily change planes and perhaps choose to stay a few days at shining resorts. 
 John J. Leahy, the chief commercial officer of Airbus, in other words the man who sells the planes, sees those carriers as visionaries. He thinks business-class passengers will love the A380 and airlines will have to fly it to attract those customers.
 But it is possible coach passengers will not be so enthusiastic, and that the trends of recent years -- toward smaller planes that serve more cities -- will continue. There are few cities in the world that cannot be served nonstop now, if an airline is willing to do so. Airlines might find it more economical to fly large crowds in one plane, but will passengers prefer to avoid having to change planes? 
 MY thoroughly unscientific poll of frequent fliers I know shows significant hostility to the A380, a plane few have seen. There is widespread doubt that airlines will choose the spacious 550-seat version that Airbus is publicizing, rather than opt for one with something closer to 800 seats. There is fear of big delays getting onto and off the plane, and at customs. Mr. Leahy assured me such concerns are unwarranted. 
 Those issues could vanish once the plane goes into service, if airports and airlines are ready for it. But handling the plane requires big investments, and if it does not do well early on, airports that delayed the investments might never make them.
 This has not been an enjoyable Paris Air Show for Airbus. Boeing's new 787 plane is selling well, even if Mr. Leahy dismisses ''Boeing is back'' articles as ''more hype than substance.'' There are internal squabbles over who will run Airbus and the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, which owns 80 percent of Airbus. Boeing shares have recently done better than those of EADS. But those problems for Airbus will pass. The real issue is whether the A380 will be what Mr. Leahy says it is: a ''game changer'' that cuts costs for airlines while wooing passengers. Or will passengers shun it, leaving Airbus with a sudden collapse in orders as airlines try to sell planes they bought but could not fill?

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Rose in May; Pace Is Fastest Since February

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Construction of new homes rose 0.2 percent in May, the Commerce Department said yesterday, as low mortgage rates and an improved job market kept home builders on pace for their best year since 1978.
 Builders broke ground at an annual rate of 2.009 million housing units last month, the fastest since February, after 2.005 million in April. 
 Two other reports showed that new claims for jobless benefits rose slightly last week, and that manufacturing contracted in the Philadelphia region this month for the first time in two years. 
 The rise in housing starts adds to the evidence of strength in real estate as home sales head for a fifth consecutive record year and prices escalate, prompting Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to worry about speculative ''froth.''
 Building permits, a sign of future construction, fell 4.6 percent in May to an annual rate of 2.05 million units. April's rate of 2.148 million was the highest in more than three decades.
 Single-family home starts rose 4.7 percent in May, to an annual pace of 1.704 million units, the fourth highest on record. Starts of town houses, apartments and other multifamily dwellings fell 19 percent, to a 305,000 rate.
 Starts increased in all regions but the South, where they fell 12 percent, to an annual rate of 903,000 units. Starts rose 12 percent in the West, to 540,000. They rose 19 percent in the Midwest, to 381,000, and 5.1 percent in the Northeast, to 185,000.
 Residential construction grew at an annual rate of 8.8 percent in the first quarter, faster than the 3.5 percent rate for the economy in general.
 Construction has accounted for 141,000 of the 898,000 jobs added in the United States this year, and more hiring is likely. Manpower Inc. said this week that hiring expectations for the third quarter were highest among construction companies, with 43 percent planning to add workers.
 Also yesterday, the Labor Department reported that the number of workers filing initial applications for unemployment benefits rose by 1,000 last week, to 333,000. The level remains consistent with gradual improvement in the job market, economists said.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported yesterday that its regional factory index for June fell to minus 2.2. It was the first negative reading, signifying contraction, since May 2003. A report this week from the New York Fed showed expansion. The Philadelphia Fed's outlook index for six months from now rose to 30.6, the highest this year, indicating the slowdown may be temporary.

HEADLINE: Effort to Raise $3 Billion for Palestinians in Post-Israel Gaza

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is working with James D. Wolfensohn, the former World Bank president, and with Palestinian, other Arab and European leaders to assemble a large new international aid package for Palestinian areas after Israel's disengagement from Gaza, American and other officials said Thursday.
 The package, which some officials said could approach $3 billion over three years, would supplement roughly $1 billion a year already given by the United States and others for the Palestinian Authority. It would be for specific projects in Gaza, including a seaport, border crossings and other infrastructure.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who leaves for Israel on Friday, is expected to discuss the package on her tour of the Middle East and then work with Mr. Wolfensohn to present the proposal to foreign ministers of the leading industrial nations when they meet in London in a week. 
 ''This will be very much focused on the preparations for the Gaza withdrawal,'' Ms. Rice said of her trip, at a news conference on Thursday at the State Department. 
 Mr. Wolfensohn has been shuttling back and forth to the Middle East to try to bridge differences between Israel and the Palestinians on a range of logistical matters relating to the withdrawal. Among them are disputes over the construction of crossings and the disposition of Israeli-owned homes, greenhouses and other assets in Gaza.
 A senior Bush administration official said recently that Mr. Wolfensohn had achieved mixed results, at best. Some Israeli and Palestinian officials say that his work has been disappointing, but that Ms. Rice's visit could give the process a jolt of fresh energy.
 Another subject that Ms. Rice said would be addressed with Israel is its sales of military equipment to China, an irritant in Israeli-American relations for many years. But the Israeli press has been filled with reports that Washington has recently increased pressure over sales of some high-technology goods.
 ''We have had concerns,'' she said of Israeli sales. ''Israel has the responsibility to be sensitive'' to the fact that the United States provides for the defense of countries in East Asia that are alarmed by the Chinese military buildup.
 Israeli officials counter that under American pressure, Israel has drastically cut back its military sales to China and that they are very small compared with the sales of Europeans and Russia.
 Speaking about a wide range of subjects, Ms. Rice also said she would give a major address in Cairo on democratic trends in the Middle East, and she echoed President Bush's criticism, also issued on Thursday, of the Iranian presidential election scheduled for Friday.
 By contrast, Ms. Rice offered praise for steps taken by Egypt, where President Hosni Mubarak has scheduled presidential elections for later this year. The Egyptian elections, like those of Iran, are expected to place severe restrictions on who can run.
 ''Is it enough?'' said Ms. Rice, referring to the Egyptian election process. ''I think on an absolute scale, no. More needs to be done. But on a scale of the trend line here, it is a positive development, and it's one that we're going to encourage.''
 She was also asked about recent moves by Uzbekistan to curb the American use of its military airfields for transport flights and night flights in response to the United States' criticism of its human rights record. Ms. Rice said the administration would not be deflected from such criticism by pressure tactics.
 ''I'd just say it won't work,'' she said.
 Asked about what appears to be declining support among Americans for the war in Iraq, Ms. Rice suggested that she and other senior members of the administration needed to do a better job of explaining to the public that Iraq had made progress toward stability but that achieving stability would not be easy.
 ''It is work that requires that we as Americans reach down in ourselves and look for the kind of patience and generosity that we have exhibited in the past in understanding that democracy takes time,'' Ms. Rice said.
 She also acknowledged that the imprisonment of more than 500 detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which has caused rising debate, had drawn criticism from many American allies in the Arab world and elsewhere. She said that here, too, she and others needed to explain the security reasons for the detentions.
 Her comments were a contrast from those last week from Vice President Dick Cheney, who said in a speech that he thought critics of Guantanamo were largely people who did not support American policies anyway.

Israel Worries Foe Has New Friend
(By The New York Times)
 JERUSALEM, June 16 -- Reports of contacts between the European Union and the militant group Hamas surfaced Thursday and were met with protests by Israel, which said that such contacts send the wrong message at a time when efforts are being made to strengthen the moderates in the Palestinian Authority.
 The contacts were reported in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which said that the European Union had informed the Bush administration of a substantial shift in its level of contact with Hamas. It did not give a source for the report from Washington.
 Sheik Hassan Youssef, a member of Hamas's political wing, said in a telephone interview that low-level meetings had taken place. He said they were a step in the right direction after local elections in which Hamas had made a strong showing. He said the United States and the European Union should adopt a position ''to respect the will of the Palestinian people in the elections.''
 In Brussels, Christina Gallach, a spokeswoman for Javier Solana, the European Union's policy chief, denied there had been contacts. ''It is not true that the European Union has changed its policy regarding Hamas,'' she said. ''It keeps Hamas on the list of terrorist organizations. The European Union has had no contacts with Hamas.''

HEADLINE: Think Locally, Flirt Globally

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

DATELINE: LE BOURGET, France, June 16 

 BODY:
Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama had never been to Paris. The state's governor, Bob Riley, had flown over for the night. What drew the two politicians, along with a group of other prominent Alabamians, to an elegant dinner in a private Paris dining salon was the scent of foreign money and the prospect of luring some of it home. 
 The talk at the Paris Air Show, which is being held at Le Bourget airport, about 25 miles outside Paris, is not just of the latest in aerial technology, but of business. And Alabama was not the only one seeking to line up deals. A number of other states also showed up, often in splashy ways, to sell themselves to foreign companies and investors. 
 Some of the efforts are quite sophisticated. The Alabama delegation had a roster of events in Paris and a colorful booth at the airfield with the theme that Alabama was ''super pour le developpement economique.'' The state's promotional literature prominently noted that Alabama was discovered in 1702 by the French explorer Jean-Baptiste LeMoyne de Bienville. 
 Then there was the Sunday dinner for foreign business prospects in the Jules Verne restaurant high in the Eiffel Tower, provided by the airport authority of Huntsville, Ala., and county commissioners. 
 ''We want to show the international business community what is possible in Alabama,'' Governor Riley said at another dinner at the private Salon Etoile-Marceau. The invited guests that night were executives from EADS North America, the American military subsidiary of the parent company to Airbus, which is considering sites in Alabama as well as in three other states for a possible new $500 million manufacturing plant. 
 ''This is an opportunity for us to talk to all the decision-makers in a more social setting,'' Governor Riley added. 
 In strutting their stuff, the American states had the backing of some powerful American politicians. On the opening day of the air show, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, President Bush's representative at the show, and a bipartisan group of five other senators, along with Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, held a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the American pavilion, a hanger-like structure filled with booths. 
 New Mexico had marketing help from Erik Lindbergh, the grandson of the aviator Charles Lindbergh, whose 1927 trans-Atlantic flight landed at Le Bourget. Arizona's bright orange display said it had a ''perfect aerospace climate'' -- a claim also made by New Mexico. Maryland trumpeted its proximity to the Pentagon and the headquarters of the big American military contractors, which are in a position to hire small European suppliers. Other booths were run by Florida, South Carolina, Washington State and the city of Cincinnati. 
 These states are hardly innocents abroad. Maryland, for instance, has 11 overseas economic development offices, including one in Paris. Alabama has gone to air shows in London, Berlin and Singapore. The State Department also had aerospace experts from 13 of its European embassies on hand to help with the effort -- as well as to provide croissants and coffee. 
 ''The whole idea is to build business relationships so that when a foreign company thinks of a project, they think of Alabama,'' said Neal Wade, director of the Alabama Development Office, who had a staff of 75 people preparing for the show. 
 Before coming here, Mr. Wade's staff reviewed 500 international companies expected to attend. From that, they picked 50 with the best prospects for expanding in the United States. His staff put together economic development books on each of the 50, which they then contacted for meetings either at Le Bourget or in Paris.
 In marketing itself as foreign-friendly, Alabama pointed to Mercedes, Honda and Hyundai, which all have plants there. The state was also promoting an aerospace infrastructure that included the Redstone Arsenal and NASA operations in Huntsville. 
 If Alabama is a veteran, the newest kid on the block was New Mexico. At its simple booth, Frank G. O'Mahony of the state's Economic Development Department had to overcome a confusion by many foreigners who got the state mixed up with the country of Mexico or who saw it in terms of ''Billy the Kid and the Wild West,'' Mr. O'Mahony said. 
 New Mexico is promoting itself as a place for experimental aerospace. It is the home of the Eclipse project by former Microsoft executives seeking to build a low-cost personal jet. The Los Alamos and Sandia national scientific laboratories are there, as is the X Prize, a private spacecraft competition that has attracted the attention of billionaires like Richard Branson of the Virgin Group and Paul G. Allen of Microsoft. 
 ''The emerging space industry is really blossoming and that is because New Mexico is making it happen,'' said Mr. Lindbergh, vice president of the X Prize Foundation. ''We want to send a message that this state wants to be a pioneer in the industry.''
 Maryland, the home to such American military giants as Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics, had a different identity problem. While those companies are household names in global aerospace, the state itself is not. Most foreign investors associate Washington, D.C., with those companies, not realizing they are actually situated across the line in Maryland. 
 For that reason, Thomas Kingston, a senior director at Maryland's Department of Business and Economic Development, handed out a big map. It showed Washington in the center surrounded by Maryland, with dots representing the locations of aerospace and military contractors. 


CORRECTION-DATE: June 25, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day last Saturday about officials from various states who attended the Paris Air Show to court business misidentified the headquarters cities for two major military contractors. Northrop Grumman is based in Los Angeles and General Dynamics in Falls Church, Va.; neither is based in Maryland, although each has operations there.

HEADLINE: Planning for a Tax Overhaul Will Have to Wait, Bush Says

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16 

 BODY:
President Bush will delay his plans to overhaul the tax code, in part because of his mounting difficulties on Social Security and other top initiatives.
 In an announcement on Thursday, Mr. Bush said he would wait an extra two months, until the end of September, for recommendations from an advisory panel on ways to make the tax code simpler and fairer.
 The decision means that Mr. Bush is unlikely to propose a big tax measure until next year, mainly because administration officials have been bogged down far more than they expected on efforts to overhaul Social Security. 
 ''From the White House perspective, the president and the Congress have a lot on their plate right now,'' said Trent Duffy, a White House spokesman.
 Transforming the tax code was one of Mr. Bush's top two economic initiatives upon winning re-election, and White House officials had hoped to embark on a sweeping tax effort as soon as they achieved a transformation of Social Security.
 But despite months of effort to drum up enthusiasm, public support for Mr. Bush's Social Security plan has waned and opposition has hardened.
 With Congress rapidly approaching the long summer recess, Republican lawmakers have become openly pessimistic about passing any kind of Social Security bill this year.
 Mr. Bush is also mired in his effort to have Congress ratify the Central American Free Trade Agreement, an accord that the administration views as a template for bigger trade deals involving all of Latin America and other regions of the world.
 Under Mr. Bush's orders, the bipartisan advisory panel on the tax code was supposed to make recommendations by July 31 for a comprehensive overhaul. The Treasury Department was then to come up with its own recommendations, with a goal of proposing a measure to Congress before the end of this year, now highly unlikely given the new timetable.
 In a statement on Thursday, the Democratic and Republican co-chairmen of the tax panel said they could have met the original deadline but were content to extend their effort by two months.
 ''We were on track to issue our report by July 31st,'' said the chairmen, former Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, and former Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida. ''Nevertheless, we are comfortable taking additional time to complete our work.''
 The panel, made up of economists and academic experts, has held hearings in Washington and around the country and received comments from thousands of people.
 Though Mr. Bush has never specified the kind of changes he wants, administration officials have been very eager to reduce taxes on savings and investment and to focus on taxing consumption.
 The tax reform panel has been looking at a wide variety of proposals, among them ideas for a flat tax for people at all income levels and for some form of national sales tax.
 Kevin Hassett, director of economic studies at the American Enterprise Institute, said the delay on tax policy did not mean Mr. Bush had abandoned that effort or an overhaul of Social Security.
 ''If they were totally giving up on Social Security, they would just move on to tax reform,'' Mr. Hassett said. Some House Republicans have wanted to do that all along, or to combine Social Security with a tax overhaul. 
 Mr. Bush may have more political leverage on tax policy than on Social Security. Democrats are increasingly alarmed about the expansion of the alternative minimum tax, a parallel tax that was originally aimed at high-income taxpayers but is now snaring millions of middle-class families because it is not indexed for inflation.
 Because the alternative minimum tax prevents filers from deducting state and local income taxes, it has a particularly big effect on Democratic-leaning states, from New York to California, that have high taxes.

HEADLINE: For Whirlpool, High-Cost Germany Can Still Have Advantages

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: BENTON HARBOR, Mich. 

 BODY:
Who is the biggest exporter of German-made washing machines to the United States? Not Miele or Bosch-Siemens, or any other German manufacturer. It is the American appliance maker, Whirlpool, the company proudly reports. 
 Never mind the higher labor cost -- $32 an hour, including benefits, versus $23 in the United States. The necessary technology existed in Germany when Whirlpool decided to sell front-loading washers to Americans. So did a trained work force and a Whirlpool factory already making a European version of the front loader. 
 ''We were able to expand the capacity in Germany at a very incremental investment,'' said Jeff M. Fettig, Whirlpool's chairman and chief executive. ''It was the fastest way to the American market.'' 
 Globalization is often viewed as a rootless process of constantly moving jobs to low-wage countries. But the issue is more complex, as illustrated by Whirlpool's worldwide operations. What attracts Mr. Fettig and other chief executives is a relatively new form of globalization that emphasizes first-rate centers of production and design in various countries -- including the United States.
 Whirlpool's global network, a work in progress, includes microwave ovens engineered in Sweden and made in China for American consumers; stoves designed in America and made in Tulsa, Okla., for American consumers; refrigerators assembled in Brazil and exported to Europe; and top-loading washers made at a sprawling factory in Clyde, Ohio, for American consumers, although some are sold in Mexico. 
 ''The really sophisticated multinationals,'' said Diana Farrell, director of the Global Institute at McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm, ''are taking advantage of the different locations in their global networks without worrying about whether they also sell in the countries where they produce.''
 The advantage of Whirlpool's approach to globalization is that it allows the company to put the earnings of overseas affiliates to their best use anywhere in the world, Ms. Farrell argues. The larger consequence, she adds, is that parent companies ''invest in new technologies and business opportunities that will eventually create new jobs at home and abroad.''
 At the moment, the job growth and the expansion are mainly abroad. As its turns out, more than 40 percent of the nation's imports are from the overseas subsidiaries of American companies, contributing to the lopsided trade deficit, but also making companies more competitive. Whirlpool is a typical example: its employment in the United States has not risen in years while it has tripled abroad.
 The ''global production footprints,'' as Ms. Farrell calls them, draw on a growing network of first-rate suppliers in Mexico, China and elsewhere that allow manufacturers to go beyond mere assembly overseas into complex production. And the investment, once made, becomes an anchor; a sunk cost, as economists put it.
 Sunk cost figured in Whirlpool's decision to ship front-loader washing machines to the United States from its factory in Schorndorf, Germany, which Whirlpool acquired in 1991 with the purchase of the appliance operations of Philips N.V. for more than $1 billion. 
 Almost two million of the front loaders have been sold in the United States since 2001, at $1,200 apiece, and as demand rises, so do the shipments across the Atlantic. The German-made washers load laundry from a door on the front that opens into a basket that spins at high speeds. Front loaders, long popular in Europe, in part because they use less water and electricity, are gaining ground among American consumers, who have traditionally favored top loaders that circulate the laundry and water using an agitator fitted with fins. 
 The Maytag Corporation got into the front loader market first, in the 1990's, but soon stumbled. Its Neptune model, engineered and made in the United States, suffered from a high repair rate. That gave Whirlpool's Duet front loader an advantage, Mr. Fettig said; his company avoided the pitfalls by adopting the already kink-free German technology. 
 Maytag, in a statement, said that it, too, has now resorted to globalization to get back into the game. The newest model ''is made in South Korea through a technology and manufacturing partnership with Samsung,'' Maytag said. 
 Whirlpool's executives take issue with analysts who declare that low foreign wages, particularly in China and elsewhere in Asia, combined with generous subsidies from those countries, will keep the global production networks mobile. Company executives say the manpower required to make its appliances is declining, diluting the drawing power of lower wages. One hour of labor, for example, goes into each of the 20,000 top-loaders coming off the line daily at Clyde, down from 2.5 hours five years ago.
 ''We may pay $23 an hour in Clyde, including benefits, versus $3 in Mexico versus $1 in China,'' Mr. Fettig said. ''But for one hour of labor, the difference won't begin to cover the shipping costs, let alone the investment it would take to build a new factory in Mexico or a new factory in China.''
 The Clyde factory, which employs 2,000 people, is billed as a jewel in Whirlpool's production network -- an efficient, partly automated operation whose experienced workers possess a ''tribal knowledge'' of their product that pays off in quality and cost saving. But if the Clyde factory did not already exist, Mr. Fettig would not put it there. ''I'd probably put it in Mexico,'' he said. 
 Whirlpool's total of 23,000 employees in this country has not changed in a decade, while the overseas work force has tripled, to 45,000. Yet, American consumers, not foreigners, account for two-thirds of Whirlpool's annual revenue, which was $13.2 billion last year, up from $10.3 billion in 2000.
 Parts suppliers -- the small companies that mold plastic parts or machine metal ones, for example -- play a big role in determining where new factories are put, or existing ones are expanded. In the last 15 years, suppliers have set up shop in growing numbers near the new production centers in China, India, Southeast Asia and Latin America. Without their presence, Whirlpool says, it would not have been able to concentrate the manufacture of microwave ovens in southern China. 
 ''It is much more difficult to operate outside of an industrial country without that supplier base,'' said Mark Brown, senior vice president at Whirlpool for global sourcing. 
 The concentration of suppliers in northern Mexico helps explain why Whirlpool has decided to produce a less-costly front-loading washing machine at its existing manufacturing complex in Monterrey. 
 The high-end, $1,200 model will continue to come from Schorndorf. The smaller Mexican front loaders, on the other hand, will be for the majority of American consumers and will be priced several hundred dollars less, too low to absorb the $50 in freight to cross the Atlantic, the company says.
 ''We looked at making them in the United States,'' said David L. Swift, Whirlpool's executive vice president for North America, ''but since we did not already manufacture any front loaders here, this country did not have an advantaged position. Because of the shipping cost, we knew we had to make them in Mexico or America, and since the suppliers were already in Mexico, we thought we might as well go there.''
 Using Mexican workers, Whirlpool could have matched the efficiency of Schorndorf's labor force, said Roy Armes, Whirlpool's vice president for Mexico. Indeed, Mexican engineers, foremen and supervisors have gone to the German plant for 18 months of training, and line workers are also getting special instruction. 
 But Whirlpool calculated that it could afford more workers at Mexican wages, so it did not purchase the most advanced automated machinery for Monterrey. ''When you have lower labor costs, it is hard to justify that higher investment,'' Mr. Armes said. 
 Companies like Whirlpool differentiate between skills that can be taught in a few weeks or months, and those that take longer to acquire. The harder-to-acquire skills anchor the one last Whirlpool factory in Benton Harbor, where the company got its start in 1911 and still has its headquarters.
 The company closed a washing machine plant in Benton Harbor in the mid-1980's, consolidating production in Clyde, but kept open a parts factory that makes the steel gears that are the heart of the washing machine's agitation mechanism. The machining to make the gears, and the nickel plating to prevent corrosion require a skill level not easily duplicated. 
 ''You can find lots of machine shops and some plating operations, but you rarely find the two together,'' Jim F. Spicer, the plant manager, said. ''And when you do find them together, you almost never find the volumes that we require.''
 The gears are trucked to the Clyde plant, four hours away. The 208 hourly workers (many of them long-termers; there has not been a layoff in more than 15 years) earn $14 to $20 an hour. At the low end of the scale are the 178 operators of the automated machining equipment, a skill that can take up to a year to master.
 The remaining 30 employees are mechanics and electricians who repair the machinery, having acquired these skills during a four-year apprenticeship that costs $200,000, a sum that Whirlpool pays, Mr. Spicer said, when it cannot find people already trained. One apprentice is in training; three recently graduated.
 ''In my opinion, the reason we are here and not outsourced,'' Mr. Spicer said, ''is that we do excellent quality work. If we don't have that, we don't have anything.''

HEADLINE: For a Fed Governor, a Move Across Town and Into Politics

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16 

 BODY:
For years, some of his closest friends did not know that Ben S. Bernanke was a Republican.
 It is not that Mr. Bernanke has been shy about his views. As an economist at Princeton, he broke new ground on the causes of the Depression. And as a governor on the Federal Reserve Board since 2002, he spoke bluntly about weakness in the job market, the dangers of deflation, the impact of higher oil prices and the need for the Fed to reduce uncertainty by being more open.
 ''If monetary policy is like driving a car,'' he mused last December, ''then the car is one that has an unreliable speedometer, a foggy windshield and a tendency to respond unpredictably.'' 
 But now Mr. Bernanke (pronounced ber-NANK-ee) is moving directly into the political arena, taking over next week as chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. He is also on the short list of potential candidates to succeed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 The two jobs are related, if only because Mr. Bush will be looking to name a new Fed chairman that he knows well and trusts. 
 Two other possible candidates to succeed Mr. Greenspan, who has been atop the Fed for nearly 18 years, are also former council chairmen: Martin Feldstein, who served under President Reagan; and R. Glenn Hubbard, who worked for President Bush from 2001 to 2003.
 Mr. Bernanke built a sterling reputation while at Princeton, and has won widespread praise for his cogent analyses while at the Fed.
 But he has studiously avoided partisan political issues, at least in public. He has said little about issues at the top of Mr. Bush's agenda, like Social Security and tax cuts, and his economic writing betrays few hints of political ideology.
 ''If you read anything he's written, you can't figure out which political party he's associated with,'' said Mark L. Gertler, a professor of economics at New York University who has written more than a dozen papers with Mr. Bernanke. Mr. Gertler, who said he did not know his close friend's political affiliation until relatively recently, added: ''He's not ideological. I could imagine Ben working with economists in the Clinton administration.''
 Alan S. Blinder, a colleague at Princeton who has advised Democratic presidential candidates, also said he had worked alongside Mr. Bernanke for years without having any sense of his political views.
 ''We wrote articles together and sat at the same lunch table thousands of times before I knew he was a Republican,'' Mr. Blinder recalled. ''We never talked politics.''
 Mr. Bernanke enjoys enormous credibility among economists in academia as well as on Wall Street -- an advantage for him that may also pay off for Mr. Bush.
 ''I think Wall Street would be more comfortable with Bernanke as Fed chairman, if only because he isn't viewed as being ideological,'' said William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs.
 The disadvantage is that Mr. Bernanke may not be able to build close ties in the White House, where Mr. Bush's inner circle places a priority on personal loyalty and passionate support for the White House's policy goals.
 Mr. Bernanke declined to be interviewed until he starts his new job. The Senate approved his nomination in a unanimous voice vote on Wednesday and he is expected to start early next week.
 But administration officials and people who know him said Mr. Bernanke was eager to switch from the Fed to the White House.
 Ben Shalom Bernanke, 51, established his academic prowess early in life. The son of a pharmacist in Dillon, S.C., he won the state spelling bee in sixth grade, only to falter in the national championship on the word ''edelweiss.'' 
 In high school, he taught himself calculus because his school did not offer it. He earned the highest college admission test scores of any student in South Carolina the year he applied to college. He went on to study economic history at Harvard and then earn a doctorate in economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 ''I always thought I would be an academic lifer,'' Mr. Bernanke said in a speech to the American Economic Association in January, adding that his biggest complaint about the Fed was the need to wear a suit to work.
 Following on the work of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, who blamed the Depression of the 1930's on misguided Fed policy, Mr. Bernanke forged his academic reputation by arguing that the problems had been made worse because the United States and many other countries clung to the gold standard.
 The key to economic recovery, he wrote, came when Franklin D. Roosevelt let the dollar float and then reset its value at a much lower level in relation to gold.
 The ''gold standard orthodoxy,'' Mr. Bernanke remarked in a speech last year, led to ''disastrous consequences'' and highlighted the dangers of adhering to rigid but untested economic ideas.
 As a professor at Princeton, Mr. Bernanke became a tireless advocate of ''inflation targeting,'' which calls for a central bank to publicly establish a target for inflation -- perhaps no more than 2 percent -- and to set monetary policy with that target in mind.
 Mr. Bernanke, along with many other economists, contends that setting public targets would be a major step toward greater openness at the Federal Reserve and would make it much easier for investors to anticipate policy. 
 It is an idea that Mr. Greenspan adamantly opposes, on the ground that it would reduce the flexibility of the Fed and be difficult to carry out in practice. 
 But even though Mr. Bernanke openly disagreed with Mr. Greenspan, the dispute does not appear to have hampered his relations with the Fed chairman. Indeed, analysts believe that Mr. Bernanke has played a significant role in making the central bank more transparent.
 In a major departure in 2003, the Fed began giving investors what amounted to advance guidance by declaring that it would keep interest rates low for a ''considerable period.'' Over time, it gradually changed its guidance and has been telling investors for the last year that it would raise rates at a ''pace that is likely to be measured.''
 Though Mr. Greenspan clearly supported the advance guidance, the practice fit neatly with Mr. Bernanke's thesis that the Fed needed to communicate more clearly with the public.
 In moving to the White House, Mr. Bernanke appears ready to make a major career change. 
 He recently informed Princeton, where he has been on a leave of absence, that he will resign his professorship at the end of this summer.
 That is a departure from his three most recent predecessors -- Harvey S. Rosen, N. Gregory Mankiw and Mr. Hubbard -- who all returned to their academic posts.
 Mr. Bernanke also bought a house on Capitol Hill and adopted the Washington Nationals as his hometown baseball team. People who know Mr. Bernanke say he supports President Bush's economic policies. He has expressed little worry about the current budget deficit, which is expected to be about $350 billion this year, and he has supported Mr. Bush's call to overhaul Social Security.
 But that may not be enough. Lawrence B. Lindsey, director of the Mr. Bush's National Economic Council in the first term, infuriated White House officials by publicly suggesting before the war in Iraq started that it could cost $100 billion to $200 billion. He was silenced, and later forced to resign. Since then, the cost of the war has exceeded his estimate.
 Mr. Mankiw never veered from White House policy, but came under heavy attack when he described the ''outsourcing'' of jobs to other countries as a form of trade that would ultimately benefit the United States. 
 The comment was consistent with Mr. Bush's perspective, but Mr. Mankiw was forced to apologize publicly to House Republicans anyway for his politically incorrect views.
 As he moves to the White House, Mr. Bernanke's most valuable political preparation may have been earned serving on the school board in Montgomery Township, N.J., where he fought to win support for the construction of new schools.
 Mr. Bernanke recently described that experience as ''six grueling years during which my fellow board members and I were trashed alternately by angry parents and angry taxpayers.'' In the end, Mr. Bernanke and his side won the day. The last school under debate at that time was recently completed.

HEADLINE: U.S. Balks at German Chancellor's Call for Global Regulations to Curb Hedge Funds

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, June 16 

 BODY:
Germany and the United States are parting company again, this time over Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's call for international regulations to govern hedge funds.
 Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, speaking here Thursday at the end of a five-country European tour, said the United States opposed ''heavy-handed'' curbs on markets. He said that he was not familiar with the German proposals, but left little doubt about how Washington would react.
 ''I think we ought to be very careful about heavy-handed regulation of markets because it stymies financial innovation,'' Mr. Snow said after a news conference here to sum up his visit. 
 Noting that the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed that hedge funds be required to register themselves, he said he preferred the ''light touch rather than the heavy regulatory burden.''
 Mr. Schroder said this week that he would raise the issue of imposing uniform global regulations at a meeting of the Group of 8 industrial countries next month in Gleneagles, Scotland. A spokesman said the chancellor had discussed his proposals with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
 How to deal with hedge funds also came up at a meeting in Frankfurt between Mr. Snow and the German finance minister, Hans Eichel. ''We both agree we need more transparency,'' Mr. Eichel said afterward. ''Whether we need more regulations, we could look at later on.''
 Among the measures being considered by Berlin are stricter rules requiring funds to disclose how many shares they own in companies, as well as shares they borrow and sell to try to profit from shifts in prices.
 The explosive growth of hedge funds and their potentially disruptive effect on markets have become issues on both sides of the Atlantic. But in Germany, which faces a federal election this fall with a stagnant economy and high unemployment, it has taken on a sharp political edge.
 Mr. Schroder's Social Democratic Party has criticized hedge funds for their lack of transparency -- a variation on its theme that foreign investors and even some big German companies are acting dubiously. 
 Party leaders have tarred foreigners as ''locusts'' who plunder German companies and throw out their workers. In one well-publicized case, the German workers who were thrown out had been sitting in the executive suite.
 American and British hedge fund managers orchestrated a noisy public campaign against the management of Deutsche Borse, which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, because they opposed the company's proposal to acquire the London Stock Exchange. The chief executive, Werner G. Seifert, and the board chairman, Rolf-E. Breuer, were forced to resign.
 Political analysts attribute a good deal of the anti-foreign tone to an increasingly desperate effort by the Social Democrats to shore up their working-class base. Four months before the election, Mr. Schroder and his party seem likely to be ousted by the conservative opposition.
 That suggests the United States could simply brush off the chancellor's initiative. Angela Merkel, the candidate for the opposition Christian Democrats, is viewed as being more in favor of free market policies. She would also be expected to try to rekindle the German-American relationship, which has been chilly since Mr. Schroder refused to support the Iraq war.
 Yet some analysts said the concerns about hedge funds go beyond the ebb and flow of an election season.
 ''This is a popular issue in Germany,'' said Martin W. Hufner a senior economist at the HVB Group in Munich. ''I'm not sure that a new government would simply dismiss it all as rubbish from Schroder. Germany, as a financial center, does not yet understand these investors.''
 However popular it is here, a move to curb hedge funds would require support from other countries with big capital markets. American officials traveling with Mr. Snow said they believed that the United States was not the only country reluctant to rush into new regulations.

HEADLINE: Bush Aid Initiative for Poor Nations Faces Sharp Budget Cuts and Criticism of Slow Pace

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16 

 BODY:
With the United States under heavy international pressure to double aid to poor countries, one of President Bush's signature foreign aid initiatives is facing severe cuts in its proposed budget, intense criticism from African leaders and the departure of its director after only a year in the job. 
 On Thursday, a House subcommittee recommended almost halving the president's $3 billion request for next year, citing the pressures of a tight budget. 
 On Wednesday, Paul V. Applegarth, who has run the fledgling agency for the last year, told his staff he would be leaving, a decision an agency official said had been in the works for weeks. Mr. Applegarth, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on the reasons for his leaving. 
 And on Monday, leaders of five African nations complained forcefully to the president about what they saw as the extremely slow pace of grant making. Mr. Bush, in reply, publicly promised that his administration would work harder and faster. 
 This week's series of unfortunate events contrasts with the soaring hopes the president voiced when announcing plans for the Millennium Challenge Account more than three years ago. ''By taking the side of liberty and good government,'' he declared in March 2002, ''we will liberate millions from poverty's prison.''
 Over the last two years, Congress has appropriated $2.5 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account, but the corporation that oversees it has approved compacts with four nations for only $610 million. To date, the agency has spent only $400,000, an amount a senior House staff member dismissively described as ''not even chump change.'' 
 But Mr. Applegarth and some of the program's champions in Congress say the agency started from scratch only 16 months ago and has accomplished a great deal in a short time, building a staff and picking eligible countries and helping them develop antipoverty strategies.
 Proposals from 12 more poor countries are in the pipeline, and 4 worth $860 million are expected to be approved by the end of the year. Mr. Applegarth said the agency would be $1 billion short of what it needed to finance proposals it had from 16 of the 17 countries eligible for big grants, 8 of them in sub-Saharan Africa.
 ''They've gotten a bit of a bum rap,'' said Representative Jim Kolbe, the Arizona Republican who heads the Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, which on Thursday recommended an appropriation of $1.75 billion for the program, rather than the $3 billion the president requested. ''I don't think lack of speed is a fair criticism.''
 It has taken time to get things done in an innovative way, agency officials said. For example, instead of sending in a team of American technocrats to create a development strategy for the countries, the agency asked the nations to write their own proposals, a complex and challenging task for developing nations short of highly skilled technocrats.
 In effect, the Millennium Challenge Account is an experiment to test the idea that past aid has often failed because it went to corrupt, ineffective governments, while grants to nations with relatively honest governments, low trade barriers and soundly managed economies will create economic growth and reduce poverty, said Todd Moss of the Center for Global Development in Washington.
 The assumption was that success would be built on large grants that would make the United States the biggest, or one of the biggest, donors in a country. In Madagascar, which signed the first compact, the $108 million project makes the United States only the fifth largest donor, though Mr. Applegarth said a second, bigger grant lay ahead.
 Besides Madagascar's compact, the Millennium Challenge Corporation's board of directors, headed by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, has also approved proposals from Honduras, Cape Verde and Nicaragua. Increasing agricultural productivity and reforming the financial sector are recurrent themes in the grants.
 Mr. Bush initially proposed that the agency receive $10 billion in its first three years. It now looks as if it will get a good bit less than half that.
 Mr. Applegarth said the agency needed the full $3 billion that Mr. Bush asked for this year or risked losing credibility with the poor countries that the United States hoped would make hard decisions to improve their governing skills to qualify for grants.
 ''The countries are going to say, 'Where's the beef?''' he said in a recent interview. ''The United States isn't really committed to this.'' 
 Some of its most ardent supporters worry that the Millennium Challenge Account could wind up as just another disappointing development program. Representative Henry J. Hyde, chairman of the House International Relations Committee, said the account embodied what he called ''the most important development idea in a generation.''
 But he added at a hearing in April, ''We see a program struggling to get off the ground and funding levels for compacts now emerging that lack the boldness necessary to break the cycle of poverty in countries prepared to take that step.''
 Some experts and a former government official say the White House should shoulder a good bit of the responsibility for the slow start. 
 They note that it took the administration almost two years to set the agency up after Mr. Bush first announced his plans for it in 2002. In his 2002 speech, the president said he would get financing for the program in 2003, but the money failed to materialize.
 ''We had prepared the plan and greased everything to get $100 million,'' said Patrick Cronin, then a senior official in the United States Agency for International Development who headed an interagency task force on the Millennium Challenge Account. ''The White House couldn't get its act together because of Iraq planning.''
 Mr. Cronin, now director of studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said he had left the administration ''in frustration because it was taking so long.''
 A senior administration official, who spoke only on condition that he be quoted anonymously, said the problem was not Iraq, but concerns about piloting the approach with poor countries before Congress could help shape which nations were eligible. But, he conceded, ''in retrospect, the two-year delay was a problem.''

HEADLINE: BUSH'S SUPPORT ON MAJOR ISSUES TUMBLES IN POLL

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Fred Backus contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Increasingly pessimistic about Iraq and skeptical about President Bush's plan for Social Security, Americans are in a season of political discontent, giving Mr. Bush one of the lowest approval ratings of his presidency and even lower marks to Congress, according to the New York Times/CBS News Poll.
 Forty-two percent of the people responding to the poll said they approved of the way Mr. Bush was handling his job, a marked decline from his 51 percent rating after of the November election, when he embarked on an ambitious second term agenda led by the overhaul of Social Security. Sixteen months before the midterm elections, Congress fared even worse in the survey, with the approval of just 33 percent of the respondents, and 19 percent saying Congress shared their priorities.
 Despite months of presidential effort, the nationwide poll found the public is not rallying toward Mr. Bush's vision of a new Social Security that would allow younger workers to put part of their payroll taxes into private investment accounts. Two-thirds said they were uneasy about Mr. Bush's ability to make sound decisions on Social Security. Only 25 percent said they approved of the way Mr. Bush was handling Social Security, down slightly from what the poll found in March. 
 Moreover, 45 percent said the more they heard about the Bush plan, the less they liked it. The survey also found the public shared the growing skepticism in Washington about Mr. Bush's prospects for success on Social Security, with most saying they did not think Mr. Bush would succeed.
 Still, Mr. Bush continued to have majority support for his handling of the war on terrorism -- 52 percent -- one of his strengths throughout his 2004 re-election campaign. 
 Mr. Bush's approval rating is below the historical pattern for June in the first year of a second term: President Clinton's stood at 60 percent and President Reagan's at 59 percent. But that could reflect, in part, the much greater partisan polarization in modern politics, underscored by the 71 percentage point gap between Mr. Bush's approval rating from Democrats and Republicans in the recent poll. Nicolle Devenish, White House communications director, dismissed the significance of the poll, saying Mr. Bush believes that following polls is equivalent to a dog chasing its tail. ''We have advanced a broad agenda, and will continue to advocate the people's priorities,'' she said.
 On Iraq, months of continued turmoil, insurgent attacks and casualties appear to have taken a further toll on public attitudes. Looking back, 51 percent said they thought the United States should have stayed out of Iraq, while 45 percent said military action was the right thing to do. That reflects only a slight erosion from findings by CBS News throughout the spring, but a marked turnaround from 2004, when pluralities tended to think it was still the right thing to do.
 Moreover, only 37 percent said they approved of Mr. Bush's handling of the situation in Iraq, down from 45 percent in February. A strong majority of Americans now say the effort by the United States to bring stability and order to Iraq is going badly -- 60 percent, up from 47 percent in February. 
 The latest poll was conducted by telephone June 10 through Wednesday with 1,111 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 In general, the survey found Americans in a darker mood. In one key measure, only 33 percent said they thought the country was on the right track, while 61 percent said it had gone off in the wrong direction. Similar results were found by CBS News in April and May, but that measure of national optimism was markedly better last November. There was little change in the way Americans rate the current condition of the American economy -- 54 percent say it is very or fairly good. But the number of Americans who say the economy is getting worse is growing, to 36 percent from 30 percent in February.
 When asked an open-ended question about the most important problems facing the nation, Americans cited the economy and jobs, war and terrorism at the top of the list. Social Security, which has consumed an enormous amount of political energy this spring, did not make the top six, suggesting voters have a different view of political priorities than the Republican-controlled Congress and the White House.
 The public's view of Congress dropped sharply earlier this year, and has hovered at unusually low levels since March, according to CBS News Polls. 
 The sharpest drop in Congressional approval in recent months occurred among Republicans. In February, 54 percent of Republicans said they approved of the way Congress was doing its job; in the most recent poll, that had dropped to 40 percent. Some analysts suggest that Congress is paying the price for months of intense partisan struggle over judicial nominations and the decision to intervene in the right-to-die case of Terri Schiavo. 
 Christine Weisman, a 54-year-old Republican homemaker in Reading, Pa., said in a follow-up interview, ''They're not getting anything done. They don't seem to be able to come together on anything.'' She added, ''It's all a political thing and they're forgetting the basic needs of the people.''
 Representative Rahm Emanuel, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said, ''The American people know instinctively that we have major problems and we've got a Congress that is not attending or dealing with them.'' As the party in control, Republicans should be held responsible, Mr. Emanuel said, although he added that the 2006 midterms were far too distant for predictions.
 Representative Thomas M. Reynolds of New York, who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the old truism still held: ''People are not enamored, maybe, of the institution of Congress, but they love their congressman.'' He added, ''My advice to the policy makers around Congress is to continue to get the work done, and make sure that as we get the work done, people know about it.''
 Mr. Bush faces a very resistant public when it comes to his Social Security proposals. He recently embraced a solvency plan that would cushion the lowest income workers from any benefit cuts, but a majority in the survey said they still believed Mr. Bush's general plan would most benefit high income people. 
 He has spent months trying to explain the virtues of private investment accounts, but public opinion on them remains very divided. Forty-five percent said those accounts were a good idea, 50 percent a bad idea, the same breakdown found in the survey in January. 
 People like the idea that the accounts could be inherited and that they could result in more money for retirement; both arguments boost support for the accounts. But the idea that these accounts could lead to huge amounts of government borrowing -- to finance the transition costs -- resulted in a very negative response, as did the idea that the accounts would be accompanied by a cut in the guaranteed government benefit.
 Americans also recognized that Mr. Bush has a Social Security plan and the Democrats in Congress do not. A majority said they would like to see the Democrats offer a plan and not simply oppose Mr. Bush's. 
 But most said they did not think Mr. Bush's plan for private accounts would do anything for the system's long-term solvency.
 Mr. Bush's approval rating in the Times/CBS Survey is one of a series of recent national polls that registered difficulties for Mr. Bush. The Associated Press-Ipsos Poll found Mr. Bush with a 43 percent approval rating; Gallup with 47 percent, and the Washington Post/ABC News Poll at 48 percent.

How the Poll
 Was Conducted The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted June 10 through Wednesday with 1,111 adults throughout the United States.
 The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
 Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, marital status, age and education.
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
 For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger.
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Consumers More Optimistic This Month

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumers became more optimistic this month as the job market improved and gasoline prices receded from record levels, a private report showed yesterday. 
 The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for June rose to a five-month high of 94.8 from 86.9 a month earlier. 
 The report showed the biggest jump since January 2004 in one of its two components, a gauge of optimism for the next five years, an indicator economists watch for clues on demand for major purchases. 
 ''All the negatives we had before, gas prices, stock prices, inflation, are all being unwound,'' said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colo. ''The economy is doing quite well.'' 
 The current conditions index, which reflects the perception by Americans of their financial situation and whether it is a good time to buy big-ticket items, rose to 110.4 from 104.9 in May. The expectations index, based on optimism about the next one to five years, increased to 84.8 from 75.3 last month. 
 The data was in a preliminary report on the index based on a phone survey of 300 households. The final report, expected July 1, will reflect about 500 responses.

HEADLINE: Rumors Put Oil Traders On Edge

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 17 

 BODY:
A hint of a terrorist threat in Nigeria, a major supplier of crude oil to the United States, and worries about a lack of refining capacity drove energy markets into a frenzy on Friday, pushing oil over $58 a barrel, a record. 
 Crude oil for July delivery climbed to $58.60 a barrel before settling at $58.47, up $1.89. Some traders said oil might reach $70 a barrel, driven primarily by demand in China and the United States. Fears over what might affect the supply, rather than what is actually affecting it, appeared to inject anxiety into the market. 
 ''In this environment, we cannot afford to have any disruptions,'' said Thomas Bentz, senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures. ''We are still in the uptrend.'' The closing on Friday of the consulates of the United States, Britain and Germany in Lagos, Nigeria's largest city, because of reports of threats from Islamic militants put traders on edge. Nigeria supplied the United States with more than 1.1 million barrels of oil a day in April. 
 The possibility of a terrorist attack in Nigeria was enough to tap the oil market's fear that demand-driven pressure on prices might evolve into a full-blown supply-driven crisis. 
 A sudden restriction of supplies led to the oil shocks of the 1970's, and the lack of spare production capacity, particularly of the types of crude oil easy to refine into gasoline, has made the markets vulnerable to whispers of any potential disruption. 
 So do the opinions that oil is still relatively cheap. Adjusted for inflation, oil is less expensive than it was in 1981, when Iran choked off oil exports. The average cost of oil used by American refineries at that time was $35.24 a barrel, or $75.44 in current dollars, according to Bloomberg. 
 One of OPEC's concerns is that oil prices will quickly climb to a level where many car owners decide to switch from sport utility vehicles to compact cars, or possibly, to public transportation or carpooling. Such a change in driving habits, while still considered unlikely, might produce a scary outcome for oil-producing countries: a crash in oil prices.
 ''When I go to neighborhood parties, people are always asking me when gasoline prices are coming down,'' said David Pursell, a principal with Pickering Energy Partners, an energy investment firm in Houston. ''Well, I always reply, 'When are you going to start riding the bus?' There's lots of angst, but not enough to keep us from $60 oil.'' 
 Not everyone is convinced oil prices will continue to soar. Andy Xie, the greater China economist for Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, predicted a sharp decline in prices, citing signs of softer demand in China, the second-largest petroleum consumer after America; Chinese oil imports fell 1.2 percent in the first five months of this year.

HEADLINE: I.O.C. May Prefer Stadiums With Lives After the Games

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
When the organizers of New York's 2012 Olympic bid were forced to reimagine their stadium, they moved it to a new borough and cut its lifespan.
 The stadium that had been proposed for Manhattan's Far West Side would have remained essentially as it was built, a behemoth that was to house the Jets. But the stadium proposed for Queens will take Olympic form for less than a year before reverting to a smaller park for the Mets.
 On the surface, such a conversion works perfectly with the International Olympic Committee's ''no white elephants'' pledge. Because so many of its host cities are burdened with large stadiums that are largely unusable, the I.O.C. has pushed cities to plan useful afterlives for their facilities. 
 ''These buildings have got to have a legacy,'' said Rod Sheard, an architect for HOK Sport in London, who has worked on the design for the proposed stadium for London's 2012 bid. ''The Olympics need to protect their event, and it's got to be a spectacular event, but in the end, it's only two weeks.''
 I.O.C. leadership appears committed to that concept, but the 116-member I.O.C. does not change direction easily. After decades of seeing palatial Olympic shrines built, I.O.C. members may be slow to embrace a new era of design.
 When the I.O.C. selects New York, Paris, London, Madrid or Moscow as the host city for the 2012 Games on July 6, voters will also be making a choice between two eras of stadium design. 
 Paris comes ready-made with Stade de France, a 71,000-seat sports palace built in 1998 for large events. Madrid and Moscow plan to renovate stadiums; Moscow would renovate the centerpiece from the 1980 Games.
 London's stadium would be built to Games scale, then converted to a permanent 25,000-seat facility for track and field. New York's stadium in Queens would start as a 54,000-seat home for the Mets, be expanded to 80,000 seats for the Olympics, then revert to its ballpark size.
 ''When you have a choice of going to one of the greatest stadiums in the world in Paris or choosing something that's temporary, I don't know how they're going to view that,'' said Ron Turner of Turner-Meis architects.
 Turner's skepticism stems from his work on the stadium in Atlanta for the 1996 Games. He said the I.O.C. turned down his firm's initial idea to use steel, which could be removed and used afterward to build a football stadium to be shared by Atlanta's three historically black colleges.
 ''It would have cost a lot less, and you would have gotten a college stadium out of it as well,'' he said. ''It seemed like a great idea to use the material again.''
 Instead, the Olympic stadium was built with concrete, and a portion of it was torn down after the Games to convert it into Turner Field, the home of the Atlanta Braves.
 Dr. Jacques Rogge, the I.O.C. president, has declared that era over. In 2003, the I.O.C. accepted the conclusions of the Olympic Games Study Commission, which recommended using existing facilities when possible, building only what can be used afterward and embracing temporary solutions. 
 ''Of the 117 measures of the Games Study Commission, we implemented 30 percent of them in Athens, there will be improvement in Torino and Beijing, and ultimately they will be adopted by 2012,'' Rogge said in a telephone interview this week. ''This will stop the inflation of the Games and stop the spiraling costs.''
 Beijing, however, designed its stadium to be grand and permanent; it will be part of an Olympic park on the outskirts of the city. It is the same kind of park that Sydney, Australia, has found so difficult to maintain and that Athens has little idea what to do with. The Australian government, for example, pays $34 million a year for upkeep of the site in Homebush Bay, a suburb of Sydney.
 ''From an Olympic standpoint and as a visual legacy, it's really cool,'' Paris Rutherford, an architect for RTKL, which was involved in the design for the Beijing Games, said of Homebush Bay. ''As an economic legacy, it's not. It just sits out there, and it's like a cultural museum now.''
 Sydney built the largest Olympic stadium, at 110,000 seats. After the 2000 Games, capacity was cut to 80,000, a renovation that cost $100 million. 
 Rutherford argues that the ideal was the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984. It was the first Games to turn a profit, but its lessons have not stuck.
 ''That was a careful reuse of existing facilities,'' he said. ''It was based on creative logistics, not new construction.''
 Now, Olympic planners find themselves in a complex age. Stadiums are expected not only to hold events, but also to rejuvenate parts of cities. Architects must envision a structure that is grand enough for Olympic pageantry, neighborhood-friendly enough to gain acceptance and flexible enough to have a post-Olympics purpose.
 ''I was a bit sad to see New York didn't get approval for the West Side,'' Sheard, of HOK, said. ''I think it would have been a great boost to the city.''
 Instead, New York was pushed into the conversion age.

HEADLINE: What Is Google, Anyway?

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL. 
E-mail: online@nytimes.com. Links: nytimes.com/business.

 BODY:
IS Google a media company? Jon Friedman, the media columnist for MarketWatch (marketwatch.com), bristles at the notion.
 The question came up last week when the company's stock market value surpassed that of Time Warner. One answer is: Sure, Google is a media company, except when it isn't. The other answer is: It doesn't really matter anyway.
 Mr. Friedman's core argument is: ''Google doesn't create content, which informs or entertains people -- as media companies do. Instead, Google compiles facts and delivers information as well as news clips to its panting audience.'' 
 O.K., but if content creation is a prerequisite, how are we to classify King World Productions, Buena Vista Television or other TV syndicators? 
 Further, Google does create some content. Google Maps is an internal creation, as is Keyhole, which provides satellite images from around the globe. And they show that ''content'' is an increasingly amorphous term. Sure, the news articles presented by Google News were all produced elsewhere, but the combination and presentation of them creates an entirely new product. 
 Google delivers content to consumers, against which it sells advertising. That's the very definition of a media company. That Google sometimes also acts as a service (search, Google Groups, Froogle, etc.) does not change this at all. 
 Mr. Friedman thinks the question is important because he is, understandably, haunted by the specter of the AOL-Time Warner merger, the zenith of the dot-com era's insanity. He takes umbrage at the recent headline in the Web log Good Morning Silicon Valley: ''Time for a Google-Time Warner Merger!''
 Mr. Friedman writes: ''I counter by saying helpfully: Time to switch to decaf, fellas! Does anyone remember what happened the last time that Time Warner had a brainstorm about doing a really big deal and connecting the old media with the new media?''
 It seems the batteries in his irony meter may have run low. Otherwise, he might have seen that Good Morning Silicon Valley no more favors another AOL Time Warner than he does.
 GOING SOUTH -- The blog (southernstudies.org) run by the Institute for Southern Studies, ''Facing South,'' takes on all the cultural and political issues you might expect: racism, inequality, political organizing, the war in Iraq. But there is also a heavy focus on economic and business issues. It is unabashed in its political point of view, but is light on commentary, often just presenting the facts of news articles about corporate corruption and economic inequality. Sometimes, though, comment there must be, as with the recent post referring to an article about a furniture company that is laying off 1,200 workers in North Carolina. '''Labor costs' are often blamed for the loss of Southern manufacturing,'' writes a blogger, Chris Kromm, ''which implies that it's somehow blue collar plant workers who are at fault for footloose factories leaving the country. Rigged trade deals without labor standards (and corporations all too willing to take advantage of them) are better targets.''
 DESIGNS FOR LIVING -- The User Interface Hall of Shame wonders what a house designed by software developers would be like. For instance, there is no kitchen, but ''the Fridge Room, the Oven Room, the Freezer Room, the Dishwasher Room, the Food Room.'' Still, it sounds better than a house designed by system administrators. It would make you use a different key every month and lock the door every time you stepped out for the mail and would shut off the plumbing and electricity for a few hours every week or two.
 SOAPY SPOOF -- Predictably, there are several Web takeoffs of the infamous Paris Hilton car-wash ad for Carl's Jr. restaurants. Most aren't too funny. (One simply plays the soundtrack of Apple's ''Think Different'' ad over the video.) But one at accolo.com features what is probably a more-typical Carl's Jr. customer soaping up in the Paris role. It's more real, and therefore more disturbing, than the actual commercial. DAN MITCHELL

HEADLINE: Second Crash in a Week Raises Safety Questions

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The two helicopters that plunged into the East River this week had little else in common: They were built by different companies, used for different purposes and operated under different rules.
 But their remarkably similar fates sparked inevitable questions yesterday about whether helicopters are a safe enough way to move tourists and business travelers around one of the most densely packed places on the planet.
 ''It's highly unusual that you would have two of these kinds of accidents occurring in one geographic region within three days of one another,'' said Jim Peters, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in New York.
 But Mr. Peters said it was too soon to call the events anything but coincidental. He said the National Transportation Safety Board would investigate both accidents. 
 Mr. Peters said he did not know whether any aircraft of MBNA Corporation, which was operating the helicopter that crashed yesterday, had been involved in previous accidents.
 Helicopter pilots and aviation industry advocates were quick to defend the safety record of helicopters, particularly the Sikorsky S76C, the corporate model that sank in the river seconds after taking off from the heliport at 34th Street. That helicopter, which would have been worth at least $5 million, was operated by MBNA, a credit-card company in Wilmington, Del. Six MBNA executives, including the company's chief executive, Bruce L. Hammonds, were on board and escaped with minor injuries.
 ''Honestly, yes, I do think this is a coincidence,'' said Matt Zuccaro, special adviser to the Eastern Region Helicopter Council, an association of operators and pilots. ''Over the last 15-20 years, the record has been excellent.''
 According to the transportation safety board's Web site, there have been two fatal helicopter accidents in New York City in the last 15 years. One occurred in 1997, when a Eurocopter operated by the Colgate-Palmolive Company fell into the East River near a heliport at 60th Street, killing one passenger. And one passenger died in 1990 when a Bell 206L, the same model that crashed on Tuesday, fell into the water shortly after takeoff.
 Mr. Zuccaro said flying a helicopter over water was no more dangerous or difficult than flying one over land. He said New York's Economic Development Corporation had conducted a study of helicopter traffic at the three heliports in Manhattan and determined that the safety record here was significantly better than for the rest of the nation.
 The Sikorsky S76C is ''probably one of the best-built commercial helicopters on the market today,'' said Ken Jacobsen, a helicopter broker who said he flew that model to and from Manhattan for years and was familiar with the two that MBNA uses.
 Mr. Jacobsen said he was surprised to see that the helicopter's emergency pop-out floats were not deployed because, he said, almost every S76C flying around New York is equipped with them. The pilot must not have had time to inflate the floats before hitting the water, he said.
 The sightseeing helicopter that dropped into the East River off the Downtown Manhattan Heliport on Tuesday floated upside down after its pilot deployed inflatable pontoons on the way down. Federal regulations require chartered helicopters that are flown over the water to have flotation devices.
 The sightseeing operator, Helicopter Flight Services, has not flown excursions in its other helicopters since the accident on Tuesday, said Charles Sipkins, a spokesman for Lesley Taylor, the chief executive of Helicopter Flight Services.
 The safety board is still studying that helicopter and interviewing passengers and the pilot to determine the cause of its crash. 
 The same investigators who came to Manhattan from the safety board's offices in Parsippany, N.J., after that crash returned to the river's edge yesterday to start a new inquiry.

HEADLINE: It's Getting Cheaper To Tap the Sun

BYLINE: By BARRY REHFELD

 BODY:
Annette Benedict gave a party to celebrate the installation of solar panels on the roof of her Bronx home over a year ago.
 John Sunde bought three systems in three years for the two Long Island homes he owns -- two for the Brentwood house he lived in and a third for a Hampton Bays home he lives in now.
 Susan Ferraro and her husband, Nick, featured their new network in the sales ad for their summer home on Shelter Island, N.Y., earlier this year. 
 Excitement over residential solar energy may not be running this high everywhere, but providing homes with electricity and heat from the sun is getting more buzz than it has in decades. 
 In the 70's it seemed that buyers of solar systems were mostly isolated tree huggers who somehow had a small fortune to spend on panels, but now urban and suburban homeowners are looking to the sun hitting their roofs for relief from rising electricity and heating costs. 
 Higher utility bills, though, are just the stick. The carrot is the falling cost of solar systems that are lighter and more efficient and feature new designs, like solar panels that double as window awnings. Standardized installations and economies of scale for equipment production have helped drive costs lower.
 In moving toward the energy mainstream, solar expenses have dropped to around $8 a watt, from roughly $100 three decades ago; the cost is even less if a system is installed as part of a new home's construction. 
 In either case, that puts the price of a system that can reduce electric bills significantly -- like a three-kilowatt system -- in the $20,000 range. That's still a lot of money, but buyers may be able to get a lot of it back immediately, through government incentives. And with energy prices rising, the payback period for the rest is getting steadily shorter.
 State programs developed in the last few years are making it possible for homeowners to cut the cost of a system by more than half, to less than $4 a watt. These programs include rebates, tax refunds and access to utility grids, enabling homeowners to sell excess electricity back to power companies.
 ''Oil prices give people a reason to look, but then it's all about the incentives,'' says Gary Minick, president of Go Solar, in Riverhead, N.Y., who has been installing systems for 26 years. ''I get eight calls a week now. I'm all booked.'' 
 While incentives can be found across the country, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut tend to give good deals. Forty states allow selling excess power back to utilities, according to the Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy, and 19 offer rebates. 
 Typically, California led the charge when one of its utilities opened its grid to homeowners over a decade ago. Within a few years, New York was establishing itself as an East Coast solar beachhead. Now more than 700 New York homeowners have solar energy systems hooked up to utilities. New York has also licensed some 50 solar equipment installers. 
 ''We've building for the long term,'' said Adele Ferranti, who works for the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, which regulates solar installations. ''We haven't had one failure for anything installed by the people we certify.'' 
 On Long Island, Mr. Sunde's systems are working smoothly, and he expects them to keep doing so over their guaranteed 25-year life. A staunch environmentalist who had dreamed of owning solar panels since he was a boy, he now has more power than he needs. 
 He couldn't have done it without the incentives. With rebates and tax refunds, he chopped nearly 75 percent off the $115,000 bill, bringing the cost down to $30,000. With about 7.5 kilowatts for each house, he wound up paying about $2 a watt.
 He did so well because Long Island kicked off New York's incentive programs with rebates of up to $6 a watt. Now it's in line with the rest of the state, offering $4, while the newer New Jersey program, is the most generous in the New York metropolitan area, with incentives of $5.50 a watt.
 Exactly how much electricity a system provides and how long it takes for an installation to pay for itself, though, depends on many factors besides costs and incentives. Also important is the amount of shade at a house, the pitch of a roof (25 degrees is good, and typical for the Northeast except in areas that get heavy snow), and the direction the roof faces. 
 An additional factor is the amount of sunshine received, which depends on both latitude and average number of days with cloud cover. In Mr. Sunde's case, his new home has the edge over the old because its roof faces south. Over all, he calculates the payback period at a bit over 15 years.
 ''It's worth it,'' he said. ''There's nothing to break. No moving parts. When I've saved as much as it cost me in the first place, I'll have free electricity.'' 
 Irene Pletka has two different solar energy systems at her Sag Harbor, N.Y., summer house. Copper tubing panels are used to heat her swimming pool, while silicon panels provide all the electricity for her home. 
 The copper panels for the pool's heating are alongside the roof deck, and the silicon modules providing electricity are attached like awnings above a bank of first-floor windows to keep out the summer sun. Copper trumps silicon for heating. For one thing, it warms water directly, where silicon panels must first convert solar energy to electricity. While there are no rebates or tax breaks for thermal heating systems in New York, her $2,500 pool system will still pay for itself in about two seasons. 
 ''You're also not limited the way you are with oil,'' she said, ''thinking about swimming too early or late in the season because of the fuel you may use up.''
 A big challenge for solar heating comes during the winter, for the simple reason that the sun is around the least when it is needed the most. It is also difficult to heat interior space; hot air cannot be stored the way water can.
 Brian Flanagan, though, had special reasons for installing a solar heating system in the Brooklyn house he bought last year. The building had a boiler with only enough capacity to heat the commercial space he rented out on the ground floor; the upstairs was too big, with too many windows, to heat in the winter.
 Buying a small boiler and installing a roof-top solar unit with vacuum tubes (which do not lose heat the way copper tubes do) -- plus large hot water storage tanks to save heat for a cloudy day -- would, he reasoned, be more economical in the long run. The package cost $33,000 compared with $20,000 for a separate large boiler for his living space. But with lower heating bills, he expects the system to pay for itself in eight years. 
 ''I'm no longer a slave to oil prices,'' he said. ''I pay a fifth of what my tenant pays.''
 It's still too early, though, to tell if the added expense of solar equipment makes a home more valuable. Based on Susan Ferraro's experience selling her vacation home, the answer just might be: not yet. 
 ''We thought it very pioneering, and we put it in our ads, thinking people would think it was as exciting as we thought it was,'' she said of her year-old system. ''But it never even came up, even with the people who bought the house.''
 Some things will never change, though, like what got everyone interested in solar energy in the first place. 
 ''I read about it in a Sierra Club magazine,'' Annette Benedict said of her decision to install solar equipment. ''It made sense. It was good for the environment.''
 And good for her: she bought a piano with her rebate.
