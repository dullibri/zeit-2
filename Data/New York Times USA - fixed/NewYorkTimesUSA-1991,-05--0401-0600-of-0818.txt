HEADLINE: New York Restaurateur Plots A Resurrection in Budapest

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, May 13

 BODY:
George Lang, the Hungarian-born New York restaurateur, thinks of life in graphic terms. Some people, he says, have a life that goes up and down. With the purchase of Gundel's, a revered relic of Budapest's culinary belle epoque, his will have come full circle.
"Forgive me for such a horrifying cliche," Mr. Lang said one recent balmy evening as he sat out on the terrace behind the palatial restaurant, "but the whole story is like a fairy tale, complete with evil spirits and a magic wand." 
 In 1936, when Mr. Lang was 15 years old, he and his father came to Budapest from the provincial town of Szekesfehervar and stopped for a meal at Gundel's. It was his first time in a fashionable restaurant and his first taste of Gundel's famous palacsinta, pancakes stuffed with crushed walnuts and topped with hot chocolate and rum.
More than half a century later, the memory of the rum was so vivid that Mr. Lang paused while telling his story -- but only for a minute. The man who came to the United States in 1946 as a violinist, worked in a kitchen and went on to become a renowned restaurant designer, a caterer and the owner of Cafe des Artistes in Manhattan, is now consumed by a new dream: to recapture the spirit of the old Gundel's, once a centerpiece of Austro-Hungarian cuisine.
Karoly Gundel (pronounced GOON-del), son of a Budapest hotelier, opened Gundel's in 1910. Mr. Gundel turned the restaurant on the edge of City Park, next to the zoo, into an elaborate, elegant gathering spot -- big enough for banquets, balls and outdoor operas, but manageable enough to serve some of the best food east of Vienna.
When the Communists came to power after World War II, Gundel's became the property of the state and was incorporated into the Hungarhotel chain, a fate that eventually led to the virtual collapse of its old reputation. Now, on the eve of its transformation back into a privately owned restaurant, Gundel's is known as a tourist and catering restaurant, and not a very good one.
Last Thursday, touring the restaurant, with its partitioned "function rooms" and giant kitchens, Mr. Lang kept a running list of the damage done by 40 years of Communist management. "This, of course, had to be completely redone, rethought," he said of the cheap wood paneling and plastic fixtures in the Bagolyvar, an extension built to resemble an old-fashioned Transylvanian lodge.
"Of course, I will tear down all this garbage," he said, pointing to a flimsy second-floor addition done in a style he called "neo-brutalismo."
Though connected to the main restaurant, the Bagolyvar is around the corner from it, and on the street corner between the two stands a two-story building with brown-tinted windows. It was built in 1975 to house offices and the test kitchen for the Hungarhotel chain. Mr. Lang calls it a knife in his heart, and is pondering ways to disguise or, possibly, remove it.
He prefers to talk about his ideas: a crystal pavillion in the back of the garden, a Transylvanian menu for the Bagolyvar, an orchestra, an English club-style casino on the upper floor, a wine-tasting room in the cellar, a shop where Gundel products -- goose livers, wines and paprika -- will be sold.
"I can't say I can take Gundel's back to its old glory," Mr. Lang said. "But what I have to try to do is to do what Karoly Gundel would do if he were alive today."
How Mr. Lang came to take possession of Gundel's -- the formal signing ceremonies are still a few weeks away -- is a story that will no doubt become part of the restaurant's legend. It began 14 months ago, when Mr. Lang and Ronald Lauder, the cosmetics empire heir who has taken a keen interest in Eastern Europe, formed L & L Partners to bid for a half share in the restaurant. The other half was to belong to the Government.
Although Hungary, like the rest of Eastern Europe, is trying to privatize its economy with help from foreign investors, there are limits to what the state is willing to sell outright. Initially, one limit was Gundel's, a restaurant so closely linked to Budapest's glory years that as Mr. Lang put it, it had acquired status as a national treasure, ranking only behind the Crown of St. Stephen.
The first proposal by the State Property Agency, which is charged with the privatization of the Hungarian economy, called for an $8 million investment to pay for the restaurant's restoration, a sum that the American investors first thought would be split with the state. It turned out they were wrong: the entire $8 million was to come from the investors, with the state's share delivered in the form of the property itself.
"I cried, I laughed, and told them I would hang myself from the Chain Bridge," Mr. Lang said. "But they were absolutely firm. They desperately need the money, and they want to get it where they can."
Determined, Mr. Lang agreed and the final deal was all but sealed one day last February, when Mr. Lang was abruptly summoned to the telephone. "Suddenly, they were offering 100 percent ownership," he said. "I was absolutely speechless."
Mr. Lang, who had negotiated hard and unsuccessfully for at least 51 percent, immediately jumped at the offer. By the next morning, he had handed over a revised proposal, which was promptly approved by the State Property Agency.
Technically, Gundel's was open to other bids during the entire negotiations. But Mr. Lang said no other offers came in, apparently because word of his involvement had spread.
Typically, Mr. Lang works on 20 to 30 projects at one time. To bring Gundel's back to life, he dropped everything else for six months, leaving his wife, Jenifer, to run Cafe des Artists, the popular restaurant at 1 West 67th Street.
Toward the end of the final negotiations, he threw a party at Gundel's for Budapest's intelligentsia -- a group he dubbed the Gundel Regulars. The guests of honor included the Hungarian President, Arpad Goncz, Sir Georg Solti, the Chicago Symphony conductor, who had just made a triumphant return to his homeland, and the novelist George Konrad.
Dessert that night was a white-and-black chocolate crossword puzzle with the words "Gundel Regulars" in separate letters, which the guest could rearrange in sticky wordplays. The centerpieces were baskets of dough filled with grapes. The menu included goose liver in port wine aspic and miniature salmon in puff pastry. Budapest was impressed.
But for Mr. Lang, the evening was a "trial marriage" with the restaurant's 220 employees. If, perchance, he hired too many, he said, they would all be able to find jobs in his spreading Hungarian empire -- from his 58-acre vineyard in the Tokaj winegrowing region to the Gundel's delicatessen shop he hopes to open on Budapest's glamorous Vaci Street.
By the time the renovated Gundel's opens for business next year, Mr. Lang said he hopes to be able to catch part of the city's growing tourist trade, which is already stretching the hotels and restaurants to their limits. With 500 seats in the garden, 200 in the dining rooms and another 200 in the more informal Bagolyvar, the restaurant will be able to offer a range of prices, Mr. Lang said.
He is also pinning hopes on Expo 95, the world's fair that is to be held jointly in Budapest and Vienna. Mr. Lang has had experience at world fairs, doing catering for the 1964 New York World's Fair. So, too, did Karoly Gundel Jr., son of the founder, who ran the Hungarian pavillion at the 1939 New York World's Fair.
The idea of Gundel's being the showcase for another world's fair fits in nicely with Mr. Lang's schemes. "Again," he said, "the circle closes."

HEADLINE: REAL ESTATE;
A Big Swap Of Offices In Houston

BYLINE: By Lettice Stuart

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
NEARLY every weekend for the last year, a fleet of moving vans has shuttled furniture and equipment between two Houston office complexes five miles apart. Dresser Industries and its M. W. Kellogg subsidiary are swapping office buildings in one of the largest and most complex corporate relocations in this city's history.
The swap, which will be completed next month, involves more than 3,000 employees, a million square feet of office space and 90,000 pieces of equipment and furniture. 
 Kellogg, an international engineering and construction concern, has taken over 400,000 square feet of space on 16 floors formerly leased by its parent, Dallas-based Dresser. The 40-story building, part of the 3.5-million-square-foot Cullen Center complex downtown, has been renamed M. W. Kellogg Tower. Kellogg has leased an additional 250,000 square feet on 12 floors in a contiguous building in Cullen Center.
In turn, Dresser, an oilfield services company, took over part of Kellogg's lease of a 21-story building in the Greenway Plaza complex, and renamed the building Dresser Tower. Dresser is leasing eight floors with 163,000 square feet, and Kellogg, which has added 800 employees since the move began a year ago, will continue to lease six floors there.
The relocation has solved Kellogg's need for more space and Dresser's need for less, saving both companies millions of dollars in rent, said Richard T. Arnott, the Kellogg vice president who has supervised the year-long operation.
Kellogg has grown sharply since moving its headquarters to Houston from New York in 1970. The company began its operations here with fewer than 600 employees occupying half of 3 Greenway Plaza. As the energy industry boomed in the late 1970's, Kellogg, which specializes in building chemical and petrochemical plants, grew worldwide. The company eventually took over all of the building and four floors in an adjacent one.
Still in need of more space early last year, Kellogg hired Interstate Realty to study the problem. Kellogg's lease in Greenway Plaza was up for renewal on July 1, 1991, and would involve a rent increase.
Meanwhile, Dresser occupied only 8 of the 16 floors it was leasing in Cullen Center. The company's staff had been reduced by half by the oil patch downturn of the mid-1980's, but all 16 floors were leased until 2003. Dresser's rental rates are low, however, because the company owns a 50 percent interest in the building. A long-term lease at below-market rent is what made the move economically attractive for Kellogg, Mr. Arnott said. Dresser, on the other hand, is paying higher rent for its new quarters, but has less than half the space it previously had.
The logistics of the move was complicated because 36 floors in three buildings had to be renovated. What made it possible was Dresser's eight vacant floors downtown, Mr. Arnott said.
The decision to swap was made on March 1, 1990, and a construction team began renovating the vacant floors. Four months later several hundred Kellogg employees moved into Cullen Center.
Then the space they vacated in Greenway Plaza was renovated, and some Dresser employees moved in. That process has continued.
Patsy Lesley, a move consultant hired by Kellogg, said a key goal was to minimize disruptions to the companies' operations. Employees start packing belongings in boxes at 2:30 on a Friday afternoon. An hour later movers begin loading. A company moving team works through the weekend arranging the new offices and hooking up equipment. When employees arrive at their new offices the following Monday morning, they unpack and are back at work in an hour and a half.
During one weekend in the move, $20 million worth of Kellogg computer equipment was relocated. The entire computer system was disconnected and transported in special air suspension trucks accompanied by a police escort. Then it was reinstalled. The process took 22 hours.
Mr. Arnott said Kellogg had benefited from the opportunity to redesign its space for maximum efficiency. The company shuffles an average of 300 employees around each month to different work stations. To eliminate opening the ceiling to find wiring as each piece of equipment is moved, Kellogg designed a cable raceway system that runs along the baseboards so equipment can be plugged in anywhere. Mr. Arnott said the new system would save the company $800,000 a year previously spent on constant electrical modifications.
Kellogg also switched its entire filing system from four-drawer cabinets to a wall system that saves 16,000 square feet of floor space. In the process, 37 tons of paper were cleaned out, most of it recycled.

HEADLINE: ROMA JOURNAL;
A Town That's Addicted To Illegal Drug Money

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROMA, Tex.

 BODY:
Contrasts between wealth and poverty in this dilapidated outpost on the Mexican border stand out as sharply as the extravagant yellow blooms on a lowly prickly pear cactus.
A pillared mansion on a hill looms above unpainted slums with backyard outhouses and the occasional satellite dish. 
 At local high schools, children of migrant farm workers sit next to students wearing Rolex watches -- the children, officials say, of "mules," or lower-echelon drug runners.
Across Starr County's ranch and farmland the air is pungent with the scent of harvested onion. Any proud local resident will attest to the hard-working, churchgoing nature of the community. Most will also acknowledge how the drug trade distorts nearly every aspect of life here.
Much of Starr County, where smuggling of cattle, liquor and electronic equipment across the Rio Grande has been a way of life for generations, is entangled in a cocaine and marijuana industry that coils from Mexico to the hungry street markets of the United States, Federal agents say.
Remote, insulated and historically left to its own ways, Starr County more than a decade ago began attracting free-spending, privacy-hungry drug runners as well.
"You can't come any closer to cutting off the serpent's head than you do in Starr County and South Texas," says Fred Ball, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration office in the city of McAllen, in neighboring Hidalgo County.
Federal agents say their increased attention here and along the whole Texas border in recent years is paying off. The United States Marshal's Office for this region is now managing some 160 properties seized from drug suspects, more than three times the number of a huge urban center like Houston.
But the increasing tonnage of narcotics seized at South Texas checkpoints only hints at the traffic across the border. And over the years, Starr County has become addicted -- not necessarily to drugs, but to their greenback high.
While few of the county's 40,500 residents are in the drug business, many are profiting from the money spent by those who are.
In a county with the lowest per capita income in the nation, where unemployment peaked at 52.8 percent in 1990 and clinics routinely treat diseases most often found in the third world, bank deposits have soared and land values along the main business route have bloated far beyond the reach of many legitimate developers.
Local government agencies benefit by collecting the higher property taxes. Businesses that might otherwise not survive flourish on the easy flow of drug money. Others go under, unable to match cut-rate prices offered by what Federal authorities describe as money-laundering fronts.
When the Federal authorities recently auctioned off the confiscated race horses of a convicted drug kingpin, they say the money literally reeked of marijuana, showing how deeply drugs have infiltrated the cash in circulation.
Angry Starr County leaders say most of the drug "Mafiosi" are recent arrivals from Mexico who are tarnishing the county's reputation. "We're not to blame because we're located on a drug stopover between Mexico and New York City," said Eleuterio Garza, Roma's Superintendent of Schools.
Here in Roma, a town of 8,059 people, a tender spot is the new 60-acre, $11.5 million high school campus, complete with indoor pool and tennis courts -- all paid for in cash. Humberto Vasquez, principal of the school, says the district diligently saved for the school over many years, but acknowledges that the inflated property taxes helped them reach their goal more quickly.
At the school, "we haven't had an overdose or a major bust or a drive-by shooting," said Mr. Vasquez. "Instead of being praised for our efforts, everyone is suspicious. That's what hurts."
But weaning this old-fashioned community of strong loyalties and extended families off its supply of drug money will not be easy.
"When people walk in with a paper bag and pay $27,000 cash for a pick-up," said Mr. Ball of the D.E.A., "the toughest thing in the world is telling that guy, 'Sorry, I don't take drug money.' "

HEADLINE: India Wary of U.S. Relief Force in Bangladesh

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CALCUTTA, India, May 15

 BODY:
As American forces move into Bangladesh to assist in cyclone relief and rehabilitation work, hackles began to rise today in India, where there is a tradition of criticizing any United States military presence in the region as a direct threat to New Delhi.
The "foreign hand," a phrase that became a code name for the United States during the Government of Indira Gandhi, sets off a particularly high level of anxiety here in West Bengal, a state that has had a Communist-led government for 14 years.Calcutta, where the street on which the American Consulate is situated was renamed after Ho Chi Minh and where leftist radicals once sacked the American Center, still harbors the potential for quick-fire protests against the United States. Leftist columnists in the local press have begun the attack in the last two days. 
 While there has been no official reaction from India, a country in the final days of a messy national election campaign, the first indication that the foreign-policy establishment was paying attention came from the Government-controlled news agency, the Press Trust of India.
 Quoting "official sources," the news agency said there was consternation in New Delhi over the arrival of thousands of American troops in South Asia. Disaster relief, those unidentified officials said, was normally left to international organizations.
The revival of the specter of American interference follows sharp criticism from many Indians over New Delhi's low-keyed, delayed-reaction response to the Bangladesh crisis. The Indian military could have provided considerable assistance in the early days of the disaster.
New Delhi's deliberation over how to respond to the cyclone has been variously attributed to serious economic problems at home and concern over negative reactions in Bangladesh, where the presence of the Indian military provokes outrage if not fear. In the years since Indian troops intervened in 1971 to win independence for Bangladesh, which was then part of Pakistan, Bangladeshis have become very wary of their huge neighbor, whose intelligence agencies have most recently supported a tribal revolt in the Chittagong Hills.
Indians keep their grievances alive, too. Today, the unidentified sources quoted by the Press Trust of India recalled what Indians still regard as a sinister appearance of an American fleet in the Indian Ocean during the Bangladesh war in 1971.
India's caretaker Prime Minister, Chandra Shekhar, who visited Bangladesh over the weekend, said he did not want to put a strain on Bangladesh's small air force by visiting the country earlier and causing officals to divert aircraft from relief work.
Mr. Shekhar, who jeopardized his short tenure as Prime Minister by allowing United States aircraft to refuel in India during the Persian Gulf war, has been the least critical of the United States of any recent Indian head of Government. He and his predecessor, V. P. Singh, made efforts to reassure the smaller nations of the region that New Delhi would not interfere in their affairs.
In 1987, under Rajiv Gandhi, India violated the air space of neighboring Sri Lanka to drop supplies to Tamils on the Jaffna peninsula, where an armed insurrection against the Colombo Government was based.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines in Trading Paced by Buying of Marks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell broadly against major foreign currencies yesterday in trading dominated by active buying of German marks.
Gold prices fell in New York. At the New York Commodity Exchange, gold was quoted at $359.90 an ounce, down 20 cents from Tuesday. In New York the Republic Bank offered a late quote of $359.20, off 10 cents from Tuesday. 
 The mark showed continued strength despite newspaper reports that Karl Otto Pohl may resign as president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank. Traders say that even if Mr. Pohl steps down, the Bundesbank probably will not change its tight monetary policy and loosen interest rates.
"If Pohl comes or goes, the fact is they won't change their policy," said Robert Ryan, senior currency trader at the Bank of New York. Mr. Ryan said other central banks, including the Federal Reserve in the United States, have lowered interest rates recently, and added that the Japanese faced pressures to cut rates as well.
Traders bought marks on the prospect of the continued high German interest rates, a move that depressed the dollar and other currencies, analysts said.
In New York, the dollar settled at 1.68445 German marks, down from 1.6965 on Tuesday; in European dealings, the dollar slipped to 1.6895 German marks, down from 1.7010 late Tuesday.
Robert Hatcher, corporate dealer for Barclays Bank P.L.C., said the trading session over all was dominated by technical factors in the absence of any fundamental economic news.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 137.89 Japanese yen, from 139.03 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 137.85 yen. In New York at closing, it was quoted at 137.15 yen, down from 138.00 late Tuesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7475, from $1.7380 late Tuesday. In New York, it cost $1.7540 to buy one pound, more expensive than Tuesday's $1.7460.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday, included: 1.4310 Swiss francs, down from 1.4305; 5.7385 French francs, down from 5.7705; 1.9040 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9165; 1,257.25 Italian lire, down from 1,261.25, and 1.1499 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1510.

HEADLINE: PANEL VOTES DOWN RULES ON MILEAGE

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
In a victory for the Bush Administration, the Senate Energy Committee voted today against imposing higher fuel economy standards for automobiles.
Shortly before the vote, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins wrote the committee that "no feasible combination of conservation efforts, by itself, can substantially reduce U.S. oil imports." Just after the vote, Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore said, "We don't think there is any need for legislation." 
 First, the committee on a 15-to-5 vote killed a proposal that would have raised the required corporate fleet average to 40 miles per gallon by the year 2001 from the current 27.5 miles. Then it voted 13 to 7 to reject a measure proposed by Senator J. Bennett Johnston, the Louisiana Democrat who is chairman of the committee, that would have raised the standard to 34 miles per gallon by 2001.
The committee's nine Republicans opposed both proposals. The 11 Democrats were unable to agree on either proposal, with majorities of them opposing the 40 miles per gallon standard as too severe and the 34 mile per gallon rule as too weak.
 
First Major Tests on Energy Bill
 Mr. Johnston had urged passage of his measure on the ground that a bill without specific higher standards would not survive before the full Senate, where a 40-mile-per-gallon proposal by Senator Richard D. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, was beaten last year only by a filibuster.
Today's votes were the first major tests in what all sides say will be a long, arduous road toward adopting an energy bill. The committee next faces an equally contentious question, whether to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to exploratory oil drilling.
Instead of either mileage standard, the committee adopted a plan that would require the Department of Transportation to determine whether the current standard should be raised. The bill set out standards for the department to follow, although some Democrats argued that it would avoid them because of its opposition to any to raising mileage requirements.
But Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho, insisted that the department would indeed set standards -- enforced on the average mileage of all cars sold by a particular company -- based on the assumption that industry would use the best technology.
Republican hostility to higher standards was epitomized by Senator Conrad Burns of Montana. He said they were acceptable only if people "want to drive itty-bitty cars." He insisted that higher fuel-efficiency standards were useless because fuel consumption went up despite them.
Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, conceded that gasoline use increased, but only because there are more cars on the road today.
Several Republicans argued that neither they nor the committee staff knew enough about what was technologically possible to set specific standards and that it was wiser to let experts in the Department of Transportation make the decisions.
Mr. Johnston argued that his proposal would have the committee rather than the Energy Department apply the standards Republicans said they favored.

Money Market Funds Post Declining Yields in Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report fell for the week ended yesterday.
Analysts at IBC/Donoghue's said short-term interest rates were still coming down weeks after the Federal Reserve cut the discount rate on April 30, while yields on longer maturities had begun inching up after the Government's quarterly refunding last week. 
 Walter S. Frank, Donoghue's chief economist, said that money market yields could still go lower, but that that was not a given as the Fed is more concerned with long-term interest rates, which are important to business investments and mortgage rates. He said he sensed that money market yields might be bottoming, or at least stablizing and that he did not believe investors would abandon the funds as there are so few investments that can match their liquidity and yield.
Tax-exempt money fund yields declined for the week, with the average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios down a day, to 44. The assets of the tax-exempt funds increased by $96 million, to $88.2 billion.
For the week ended yesterday, the average tax-exempt compounded yield fell 9 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 4.23 percent, with the seven-day simple yield down a similar amount, to 4.14 percent. The 30-day compounded average yield increased by a basis point, to 4.31 percent, and the 30-day simple yields rose similarly, to 4.22 percent.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day compounded yield is 5.87 percent, while the equivalent in the 31 percent tax bracket is 6.13 percent.
Of the tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million that are monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the Strong Municipal Money Market fund, distributed by Strong/Cornelison Capital Managment Inc. of Milwaukee, had the best return at 5.19 percent.
Assets of taxable funds decreased by $1 billion, to $457.4 billion, while assets of institutional funds were up $300 million, to $116.5 billion. Most of the outflow centered on the consumer funds, which were down by $1.3 billion, to $340.9 billion, an indication the small investor is searching for higher yields elsewhere.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield fell 7 basis points, to 5.74 percent, while the 30-day compounded yield fell 7 basis points, to 5.86 percent. The seven-day simple yield was down 7 basis points, to 5.58 percent, and the 30-day simple was down 6 basis points, to 5.70 percent.
The taxable fund with the best return on investment this week was the American Performance Cash Management fund distributed by the Winsbury Company of Columbus, Ohio, with a return of 6.86 percent.

HEADLINE: Senate Asks Bush to Back Loan Guarantees for Soviets

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
The Senate passed a resolution today asking President Bush to approve an additional $1.5 billion in loan guarantees for grain shipments to the Soviet Union.
A request by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in March for the additional guarantees received little attention in Washington at first. But Soviet officials have contended with increasing fervor in recent weeks that the provision of additional food assistance is critical to the preservation of civil order there and a test of Soviet-American relations. 
 President Bush said on April 29 that while he wanted to help the Soviet Union, his options were limited because farm legislation passed by Congress late last year included a provision banning agricultural loan guarantees for countries that were not creditworthy. The resolution passed 70 to 28 by the Senate today calls on the President to approve the loan guarantees anyway.
The debate over the resolution in the last two weeks brought out a deep division in Washington over how to conduct relations with the Soviet Union. On one side, led by the resolution's sponsor, Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, were agricultural interests and politicians who believe that the United States must help the Soviet Union to prevent its possible descent into civil disorder.
Senator Dole said that President Bush had expressed enthusiasm for the resolution at a lunch with Republican senators before the vote.
The resolution asks the President not to intrepret the provision on creditworthiness in the farm legislation as applicable to the Soviet Union and links most of the guarantees to progress on political reform and Soviet interest payments on previous guaranteed loans. The resolution provides political cover for the President now to authorize the loan guarantees, trade officials said.
Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, led opposition to the resolution. The Soviet Union is a bad credit risk, he said, guilty of ruthless political repression and still wed to a highly centralized system of economic management that results in waste of much of the annual harvest.
Soviet officials have expressed enthusiasm for several years for putting more of their economy on a free-market footing but have repeatedly shied away from doing so, Senator Bradley said in an interview after the vote. "This resolution said we'll send the money and they'll make promises," he added.
Subsidizing grain for the Soviet Union represents interference in that country's internal politics, he said, by helping President Gorbachev at the expense of the republics. In addition, he said, the Soviet Union will further postpone its overdue debt payments to American companies if it is allowed to pile up more agriculture loans for which the United States Government, a lender with more leverage than private companies, demands repayment.
M. Ann Tutwiler, the associate director of the International Policy Council on Agriculture and Trade, a Washington-based group that promotes free trade in farm products, said that the Soviet leadership's current problems in feeding its people were a combination of a poor harvest and an inefficient distribution system. Huge quantities of food are wasted through mismanagement or diverted out of official channels because of corruption, she said.
Additional credits for the Soviet Union would help farmers in the United States who are suffering because of low whet prices and large stockpiles.
The resolution also coincides with controversy on Capitol Hill over the cost of guaranteeing agricultural loans. A study issued on Tuesday by the General Accounting Office, the Congressional research arm, estimated that foreign governments would not repay $6.7 billion of the $11.2 billion in guaranteed loans that they now owe to banks, forcing the United States Government to make up the difference.
The G.A.O.'s loss estimate included $2 billion in guaranteed loans on which Iraq has defaulted.

HEADLINE: Where Car Makers Fear to Cut

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 15

 BODY:
Auto executives traditionally do not discuss future car and truck models for fear buyers might put off a purchase until the new ones arrive. But the Chrysler Corporation took that risk by recently allowing dealers, journalists and others onto its test track to give them a glimpse of the 1993 mid-size models on which Chrysler is pinning its hopes for a recovery.
The slump in car sales and the national recession, which coincide with yet another big push by the Japanese for American market share, is squeezing Detroit and causing a torrent of cash to flow out the door. All of the auto makers are cutting costs and conserving resources. What they are struggling to avoid, though, are any deep cuts that would delay or eliminate new products.
 
A Matter of Perceptions
 Chrysler, like the others in the Big Three, does not want investors, suppliers or lenders to get the idea that it is paring spending for new models, a perception that would only worsen its problems on the showroom floor.
The pressure to spend, even when money is scarce, is a matter of market share for the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, and a matter of survival for Chrysler. All three are striving to avoid having their need to save money force them into canceling or delaying important vehicle projects. G.M. on Monday announced plans to float an issue of preference stock to raise $600 million, partly to pay for future vehicle models, among them eight new-car and thee new-truck models in the next year.
"Spending for new products must go on in good times and bad," said James B. Fitzpatrick, a G.M. vice president for communications and marketing. "It is our lifeblood." Cash generated internally at G.M. has shrunk from $10.08 billion in 1987 to an estimated $5.27 billion this year, according to estimates by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
Japanese auto makers can develop a new vehicle in far less time than Detroit can, and they are invading market niches in the United States where they have never been before. Today, for example, Nissan showed journalists its first mini-van, named the Quest. It was designed in California and will be built at a Ford plant near Cleveland starting next April. Last year, Nissan withdrew from the market its Axxess station wagon that was meant to attract mini-van buyers but was a flop.
American auto makers know they cannot compete unless they compress their normal five-year product-gestation period to three years, like the Japanese, and bring out more new cars more frequently. Indeed, the most scathing criticism that could be leveled at the American auto industry would be to say that it was mortgaging the future by scrimping on new-product development.
But new products take money. Depending on the extent of the redesign, the cost of bringing a new car to dealer lots ranges from $500 million to $1 billion.
While G.M. has been able to keep most models on schedule, it has acknowledged a few delays. Rumors among parts suppliers say G.M. has delayed its redesigned S-10 Blazer utility vehicle to 1995, from 1994.
 
Taking on More Debt
 As for Ford, it borrowed $800 million in the first quarter of the year, raising its debt to $8.2 billion; a year ago, debt stood at $4.4 billion. Ford's debt-to-equity ratio on March 31 was 38 percent, compared with 16 percent a year ago. Ford is trying to keep most future models on schedule, but analysts and suppliers say it has delayed the redesign of the Taurus and the Sable models for one year, to 1995.
After Ford announced a first-quarter loss of $884 million, David N. McCammon, vice president-finance, said projects "are basically intact, but we always are making timing adjustments" to cut costs and looking for ways "to get a dollar's worth of new products for every 80 cents we spend."
Chrysler, which has suffered critical losses and has little financial cushion, has the least borrowing power among the Big Three, the lowest relative stock price, and the least ability to put money into new products. But Chris Cedergren, an automotive analyst for J. D. Power & Associates, an automotive consulting firm in Agoura Hills, Calif., said Chrysler more than any other American auto maker might be trying to pull spending forward.
Perhaps because of its well-publicized financial weakness, the No. 3 auto maker must go to the greatest lengths to prove that its $3 billion in cost-cutting is not hampering development of new models. The company renegotiated a $1.5 billion line of credit after the lowering of its debt ratings made borrowing from the public too expensive.
"The fear is that Chrysler is cutting into muscle and bone," said Ronald Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. "But I hope not, because I love the way the L/H looks." He was referring to the code name for Chrysler's 1993 mid-size sedan, which will be sold by the Eagle, Dodge and Chrysler divisions; it will be built, starting next year, at a factory in Bramalea, Ontario.
Other Chrysler vehicles badly need replacement, too. The full-size pickup truck -- referred to by some Chrysler engineers as "Festus," the grizzled codger in the "Gunsmoke" television western -- has not been redesigned for more than 15 years. Chrysler is planning to replace it in 1993.
 
No Profits, No Cash
 In economically healthy times auto makers pay part of their new-product costs with cash from current sales. But with no profits, auto makers must increase borrowings or sell equity. In the last six months, the Big Three have been forced to trim dividends and drastically cut costs to strengthen balance sheets enough to finance new-product spending.
One-time expenses have also been a drain on cash. G.M., for example, was obligated on March 1 to buy $600 million worth of its class H stock from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as part of the renegotiated terms of the sale of Hughes Aircraft to G.M. in 1985.
The three-year labor contract negotiated in the fall with the United Automobile Workers union has become a huge financial burden as well. Under its terms, the Big Three must pay most workers even if they are laid off, a situation that makes labor costs akin to a fixed expense. In previous recessions, labor expenses went down as sales and production dropped, allowing auto makers to keep losses in check.
In 1982, under an earlier labor agreement, the industry was operating at only 62 percent of capacity, yet auto makers were breaking even. But last year, utilization was at 78 percent and still the industry lost about $5 billion in North America, according to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
 
The Cost of Competition
 Of course, foreign imports and transplants -- Japanese cars made in America -- were not as much of a factor during the last recession. Vicious competition is hurting the Big Three's ability to maintain prices. Even with much lower production, the auto makers have been forced to continue offering large rebates on most car and truck models -- another drain on cash.
Shorter development cycles for cars like Chrysler's L/H model should help to cut costs, analysts say. Chrysler will have brought the L/H out in 42 months, a 30 percent reduction in the typical development time, helping produce a 25 percent cut in development costs, according to an estimate by Sanford C. Bernstein.
Chrysler believes the length of the cycle will be about 39 months, said Glen Gardner, who heads the project; that compares with the Japanese average of about 36 months. "The trick is going to be to get the rest of our projects on this schedule," he said.

Congress Moves On Price-Fixing

BYLINE: By Stephen Labaton

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
CONGRESS is moving quickly to adopt significant antitrust legislation that its supporters assert will encourage price competition by making it more difficult for manufacturers and retailers to fix prices.
Last week the Senate approved legislation that would essentially codify some court rulings, making vertical price-fixing by manufacturers and retailers automatically illegal. The measure, approved on voice vote, would also roll back decisions by the United States Supreme Court and Federal appeals courts in the last decade that have made it increasingly more difficult for plaintiffs to bring such actions. 
 Proponents of the measure say it would make it easier for discounters like K Mart and Toys "R" Us to sue a rival that persuades a manufacturer to try to dictate price levels. Consumer groups estimate that the legislation could save customers up to $20 billion annually.
The bill is sponsored by Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio. After years of unsuccessful attempts to change the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, Mr. Metzenbaum broke a deadlock in the Senate by agreeing to amendments offered by Senator Hank Brown, Republican of Colorado, that would make the legislation slightly less onerous on manufacturers. That move won the support of some Republicans whose opposition had blocked the measure.
Similar legislation sponsored last year by Representative Jack Brooks, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, was approved overwhelmingly in the House. Mr. Brooks is expected to reintroduce his legislation shortly. If, as expected, his measure is adopted, it would have to be reconciled with the Senate measure before proceeding to the White House.
But the Justice Department has expressed opposition to the measure, saying that it would create an inference of unlawful conspiracy in many cases where none existed. At this point, it is expected that the measure will be vetoed by the President, and both the measure's supporters and its critics say it is not clear whether there are sufficient votes to override a veto.
The measure was adopted largely in response to decisions by the Reagan and Bush Administrations not to bring any civil price-fixing cases between retailers and manufacturers. Justice Department officials have maintained that "price maintenance" agreements improve service to customers and are therefore not harmful to competition.
Nor has the Supreme Court felt the need to encourage such lawsuits.
In 1984, the justices decided that plaintiffs bringing such cases must provide evidence showing that the manufacturer and another party consciously intended to maintain resale price levels. And in 1988, the Supreme Court elaborated on the ruling by holding that there was no violation of antitrust laws unless the manufacturer and retailer actually agreed on a specific price. As a result of those decisions, retailers have been discouraged from filing lawsuits.
The legislation approved by the Senate would ease the standards of evidence for plaintiffs bringing such suits. The measure has drawn widespread support from an array of consumer groups and representatives of discounters and has provoked criticism from manufacturers and other business interests.
"It's happening for everything from tennis racquets to Passover products," said Kristen Rand, counsel to Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "The state attorneys general say it is endemic to the economy."
But the manufacturers, whose most vocal supporter on Capitol Hill is Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, are fighting to block the legislation.
James P. Carty, vice president for government affairs for the National Association of Manufacturers, said the measure would result in scores of new legal actions.
"Any time a retailer is terminated by a manufacturer, counsel will immediately threaten to file a treble damages antitrust lawsuit," he said. "The system right now is working well. You and I don't have a problem getting discounted products."

HEADLINE: Israel Rejects Baker's Plan for Mideast Peace Talks

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 15

 BODY:
Israel today rejected Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's proposals for bridging the differences between Israel and Syria on how a Middle East peace conference should be organized and on what role the United Nations should play in it, American and Israeli officials said.
President Hafez al-Assad of Syria had rejected virtually the same proposals from Mr. Baker when the two met in Damascus on Sunday. 
 Mr. Baker will meet again with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Thursday before returning to Washington, and some Israeli officials hinted that Mr. Shamir might show a little more flexibility at the 11th hour to give Mr. Baker something to go back to the Syrians with and to avoid any suggestion that Israel and Syria were equally to blame for holding up the conference. But American officials said Mr. Baker received no such proposals from Mr. Shamir today.
Mr. Baker is expected to return to Washington later Thursday and sit down with President Bush to decide what their next move should be in their effort to follow up the Persian Gulf war with some kind of Arab-Israeli peace negotiation.
 
Document on Peace Terms
 Since American officials believe that some of the other Arab states and the Palestinians are prepared to be more flexible than Syria, they are beginning to think more seriously about trying to convene a smaller Arab-Israeli conference in which the Syrians would not be involved, at least initially. But American officials say they still very much want to see the Syrians take part and have not given up yet.
After spending much of the day in talks with Mr. Shamir, Foreign Minister David Levy and Defense Minister Moshe Arens, Mr. Baker suggested that the two sides draw up an informal document spelling out the terms for a peace conference on which they had already agreed and spelling out those areas where they still disagreed.
Mr. Baker wanted to do that, officials said, for several reasons. To begin with, Mr. Shamir, Mr. Arens and Mr. Levy are all political rivals. Mr. Baker has often in the past had to negotiate with each one separately, and, officials said, he wanted to nail down what all three agreed on today, so that if the negotiations resume in a few days he will not find himself having to start all over again with three different ministers.
"This is just an informal understanding between Baker and the Israeli ministers," said an American diplomat. "It won't be used for anything other than to make sure that positions don't change. We don't consider it a formal Cabinet decision, but an informal understanding."
Both sides, though, intend to use the document for their own purposes. The Americans hope that it will highlight to the world how insignificant are the procedural issues on which Israel is refusing to compromise in order to make a peace conference possible.
The Israelis, for their part, are expected to point to the other part of the document -- all the areas they agree on with Washington -- in order to emphasize that they are being much more flexible than the Arabs.
As Mr. Levy said today: "I am optimistic about peace because that is the center of our political activities and Israel, in fact, was the one to float the peace initiative. It is the Arabs that are making it difficult."
Israeli and American officials said differences remain over what role the United Nations should play in any conference and whether the conference should be a one-day session or have a permanent status.
 
Length of Conference
 The Israelis believe the United Nations has a long record of bias against them and they refuse to have it play any role, even as an observer. The Syrians want the United Nations to play a major role, so that United Nations resolutions will be sure to apply during the negotiations.
Mr. Shamir also insisted that the conference be simply a one-day ceremonial opening to direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians and Israel and its Arab neighbors, while the Syrians demanded that the conference be an ongoing affair and that the cosponsors, the United States and the Soviet Union, be able to intervene to help the parties overcome obstacles.
Mr. Baker had proposed as a compromise that the Israelis and the Syrians agree that the United Nations be represented by an "observer" who would have no functional role in the talks, and that the conference reconvene periodically, provided both sides were amenable, to hear reports of progress but not to interfere in the talks in any way. It was that compromise that was rejected by Mr. Shamir and Mr. Assad.
The areas where the United States, Israel and the Arabs agree are that there should be a peace conference to promote direct bilateral negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, and Israel and the surrounding Arab states.
The terms of reference for that conference will be United Nations Resolutions 242 and 338, but each side is free to interpret those resolutions as it sees fit. Those resolutions call on Israel to return territories occupied in the 1967 war in return for security and recognition from the Arab side. The Arabs interpret that as meaning that Israel must trade the West Bank, the Golan Heights and the Gaza Strip for peace, while Mr. Shamir insists that Israel, having already given back the Sinai desert to Egypt, has fulfilled all of its territorial obligations.
There also appears to be a general understanding among parties on how the Palestinians will be represented, most likely in a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation, but the details of that are not yet clear.
Assuming that Mr. Baker leaves here on Thursday with the two key differences still outstanding, the Bush Administration is understood to be considering other alternatives.
One is to give this approach a little more time, in hopes of bridging the differences between Israel and Syria. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt is going to Damascus later this week in an effort to soften Mr. Assad's stand.
Another alternative is to try to convene a peace conference without the Syrians, but with just Israelis, Palestinians, Jordanians and Lebanese and with the Arab Gulf states taking part as observers in side negotiations on issues like water use, arms control and economic development.

HEADLINE: Weicker Income-Tax Plan Dying As Bipartisan Opposition Grows

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 15

 BODY:
Three months after Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. proposed that Connecticut resolve its fiscal crisis by adopting an income tax, his budget plan appears to be heading for defeat.
The income tax is dying in part because of Mr. Weicker's status as an independent governor without a single party member in the General Assembly, which increasingly seems not to need him very much nor care what he thinks. 
 But it is also the result of this state's deep antagonism to a tax on wages, and the determination of a growing majority in the legislature to patch together a budget and close a $2.7 billion revenue shortfall in a more traditional way for Connecticut: by expanding its 8 percent sales tax, already the highest statewide sales tax in the nation. Connecticut is one of only 10 states with no broad-based tax on wages.
 
Fate Linked to Tax
 In a budget address to legislators today, Mr. Weicker said, "I don't have the troops to ram the truth home, and I don't have the will to execute the duties of my office in a neck-saving way."
Mr. Weicker proposed an overhaul of the state's tax system in February, after only a month in office, linking the fate of his administration with that of the income tax, for decades the single thorniest issue in Connecticut politics.
Without legislators of his party behind him, Mr. Weicker said from the outset that he would have to sell his income-tax plan to the public, and so convince lawmakers that they could vote for the tax without fear of voter reprisals.
Politicians in both parties and on both sides of the income-tax question now say the campaign flopped, as far as allaying legislators' fears. At the same time, a coalition of newly aggressive Republicans and moderate Democrats opposed to an income tax has emerged, more than prepared to push Mr. Weicker to the margins.
The group is strongest in the Senate, which is expected to throw out the Weicker plan as early as next week, in favor of a "conventional" package relying on the sales tax, deeper cuts in state spending and more borrowing.
One result is that Mr. Weicker no longer seems able to arouse even hostility.
In his speech today before the House and Senate, he made another impassioned if familiar argument in favor of the income tax, promised to meet with lawmakers through the weekend to work out a budget compromise, and said he would accept the coalition's plan to impose controls on the growth of state spending. Lawmakers responded with indifference.
"It was a nice gesture, and we're certainly going to try to meet with him -- be happy to do that," said the Senate majority leader, Cornelius O'Leary, a Democrat from Windsor Locks. "But I'm not sure he contributed a great deal. We're very close to a conclusion that would solve the deficit problem along the traditional lines."
Coalition leaders say that with the 16 Republicans in the Senate largely united against an income tax, the 20 Democrats are deeply divided just about down the middle. That a majority exists ready to vote down the income tax is unchallenged. The only question is whether there is a two-thirds to override a veto.
 
Lawmakers Unmoved
 In the House, where the Democrats have a stronger majority of 88 votes, against 62 Republicans, the numbers are softer, but most lawmakers still cast the question as whether the sales-tax plan can be defeated, rather than whether an income-tax plan can pass.
"I don't think he moved two votes," said the Republican Party chairman, Richard Foley Jr., a representative from Oxford.
Income-tax advocates and administration officials, while conceding that the income-tax plan is threatened, denied that Mr. Weicker's role in the debate was over. They said that in these last few weeks before the legislature's mandated June 5 adjournment, and through the long weeks of summer, if there is a stalemate, almost anything can happen.
The co-chairman of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, Representative Richard T. Mulready, a Democrat from West Hartford who supports an income tax, said he remained convinced that Connecticut would have an income tax in 1991.
Only when the full implications of a non-income-tax plan are brought to light, he said -- especially the effect of a huge sales-tax expansion on the state's already weak business climate -- will the true gravity of the choice emerge.
Connecticut faces a projected revenue shortfall of about $2.7 billion over the next 14 months in a preliminary budget of about $8.6 billion, caused primarily by declines in collections on the sales tax and corporate-profits tax -- the two largest tax sources -- and by rising expenses related to the recession, especially in medical assistance to the poor.
"There are enough people who are sufficiently spooked by the idea of voting for an income tax that they'll want to believe anything and will vote for anything other than an income tax," Mr. Mulready said.
But once those anxieties and energies are exhausted, he said, Mr. Weicker may yet emerge with a pivotal role, and his speech today was simply an effort to keep the door open and set the stage.
"He's trying to reinsert himself into the process: 'I'm here and you can't ignore me,' " Mr. Mulready said.
The tone of Mr. Weicker's speech was also markedly different from his last appearance before the jointly convened General Assembly -- when he proposed his budget -- and speeches elsewhere since. The gruff manner, and the suggestion that opponents to an income tax were somehow craven or lacking in spine, were absent.
But leaders of the bipartisan coalition said that short of abandoning the income tax, Mr. Weicker really has nothing to bargain with to get himself fully back into the debate. The spending controls he proposed, for example, have already been endorsed by every leader across the spectrum and would have been almost certain to be included in any budget plan, whether it included an income tax or not.
"His next decision is going to have to be whether to veto the conventional package," said Senator James H. Maloney, a Democrat from Danbury who has emerged as one of the bipartisan leaders. "I would hope he doesn't because I think that plunges the state into fiscal chaos, and I think as a result he won't make that decision."
Mr. Maloney said that as long as the income tax is still firmly on the Governor's agenda, Mr. Weicker and his views will largely be irrelevant.
"He doesn't have to be," Mr. Maloney said. "If he will drop his insistence to the income tax, I think the General Assembly would rally very quickly to a reopening of every consideration and every issue and would very much like to have his point of view on all of them."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Agencies Are Urged to Revitalize Industry

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

DATELINE: WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va.

 BODY:
SOME people in advertising think their industry needs another David Ogilvy. Others think their industry needs another William Bernbach. But Keith Reinhard thinks the industry needs another Ted Turner.
"The Ted Turner of our industry has yet to identify himself," Mr. Reinhard, outgoing chairman of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, said in an interview before the group's 73th annual meeting opened here yesterday. "Yet we better get about reinvigorating our industry before someone else does it for us." 
The wake-up call from Mr. Reinhard, chairman and chief executive of DDB Needham Worldwide, echoed meaningfully as advertising industry leaders gathered for the meeting. As the industry struggles to cope with a plethora of internal and external problems, Mr. Reinhard offered some thoughts about the issues that concerned him during his 14 months as the 4 A's chairman. As planned, he was succeeded yesterday by Alex Kroll, chairman and chief executive of Young & Rubicam Inc.
"Can we as an industry transform ourselves quickly enough to convince our market that we are once again as relevant as we were in simpler times?" Mr. Reinhard asked last week during an interview at his New York office. Failure to do so, he said, could result in clients eliminating their agencies from any meaningful role in advertising decision-making, thus "relegating agencies to just filling in orders for the ads."
To avoid such a fate, the industry must intensify its efforts to rethink itself, Mr. Reinhard said, not just providing clients with advertising, but with "integrated, custom-made marketing communications programs." These would cover the spectrum from sales messages carried by traditional media like newspapers to "contact opportunities" with consumers, like shopping-mall displays. Within DDB Needham, staff members unofficially use other terms for the words "advertising agency," he said, to "get people to expand their horizons." Among them: "sales creation agency" and "marketing consultancy."
Mr. Reinhard's verbal exercises fit well with the theme of this year's 4 A's meeting: "Advertising must be redefined to comprise all marketing communications to the consumer." That expands on a topic examined during the 1990 meeting, "The New Advertising," which has become industry shorthand for agencies' involving themselves in the total marketing communications needs of their clients.
These days, with the national economy in recession and the industry's own financial woes dragging into a third year, many might consider the issue of whether advertising is "new" or "old" less important than whether clients are advertising at all. Mr. Reinhard acknowledged the dislocation caused by the economy but hoped neither that nor "other business problems, like the threat of taxation and the threat of regulation," would distract agencies from addressing their serious long-term problems.
Among the subjects to be discussed at the meeting, which continues at the Greenbrier resort through Saturday, are the results of research into what clients think of the new advertising, as well as a look at consumer behavior.
In the group's election, Robert L. James, chairman and president of McCann-Erickson Worldwide, New York, was elected vice chairman, putting him in line to succeed Mr. Kroll as chairman of the 4 A's in 1992.
In a brief speech accepting his new post as chairman, Mr. Kroll acknowledged that the industry was passing through "a very difficult year," but urged members of the 4 A's to redouble their efforts to sell clients on "what a valuable potion we brew" in creating advertising.
And, as usually happens when advertising executives gather, awards are on the agenda. One, the Advertiser Recognition Award, was presented to Carillon Importers Ltd. of Teaneck, N.J., for its Absolut vodka print advertising created by TBWA Advertising Inc., New York. A second prize, the A+ Creative Excellence Award, is to be presented tomorrow night to one of 15 agency finalists.

HEADLINE: Bush Backs China Trade Status, Reopening Conflict Over Rights

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
In a move that immediately reopened a conflict with Congress over relations with China, and surprised even his staff, President Bush said today that he wanted to extend China's favorable trading status for another year despite misgivings about its human rights record.
Within an hour, as members of Congress began attacking the President's remarks, the White House tried to back away from Mr. Bush's comments. Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said the President had not yet made a formal decision to extend China's trading privileges, known as most-favored-nation status, for another year. 
 Mr. Bush's statement today highlighted not only the basic conflict between the White House and Congress over how to handle relations with China but also the highly secretive and personal way in which the President operates when it comes to relations with the authorities in Beijing.
 
Calls It a 'Big Pitch'
 Mr. Bush considers himself an expert on China after serving as envoy to Beijing in 1975 and generally makes all decisions on Chinese-American relations with one or two advisers in the Oval Office. He disclosed his intentions about China's trading status today without waiting for the normal option papers from Government agencies. His comments took his own staff and other departments by surprise.
Despite Mr. Fitzwater's efforts to mitigate the political impact of Mr. Bush's statement, the President's intentions seemed clear when he told reporters on the White House South Lawn that he had made a "big pitch" for renewing China's trade status during a Capitol Hill lunch with Republican lawmakers. Under Federal law, the President has until June 3 to recommend the extension formally; the trading privileges expire on July 3.
Mr. Bush acknowledged that "there are major problems in China" on human rights, arms exports and other issues, but added, "I want to see M.F.N. for China continue."
Most-favored-nation status fixes tariffs on imports at the lowest prevailing rates and is not normally granted to Communist countries, including the Soviet Union.
 
Reward for Support on Gulf
 The President said he did not want to isolate Beijing and indicated that he was trying in part to reward China for not blocking American actions at the United Nations during the Persian Gulf crisis. Mr. Bush said today that he was considering asking the Security Council, where China has veto power, for a new resolution that would send a United Nations police force to northern Iraq.
"I look at the big picture," he said. "I look at the support we got from China back in Desert Storm, the importance of China as a country. And I don't want to see us isolate them. I do want to see them come forward more on some of the things that we've been asking."
He argues that diplomatic pressure will be more effective with Chinese officials than economic pressure. But many lawmakers, who want to squeeze China financially, say the diplomatic efforts have failed so far.
"We've had far too many high-level contacts and not much result," said Representative Don J. Pease, Democrat of Ohio, who tried to tie China trade to human rights issues last year.
Other lawmakers zeroed in on the quid pro quo suggested by Mr. Bush in his comments today. "It's unfortunate that the President sees China in such a different light from any other country," said Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California. "He makes the argument about China's cooperation in the Persian Gulf war and yet we don't have most-favored nation with the Soviet Union, which was even more cooperative."
Ms. Pelosi is sponsoring a bill that would extend China's trading status for this year but make the 1992 extension contingent on human rights improvements and other conditions. Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, the majority leader, plans to introduce a similar bill on Thursday.
 
Limited Requirements Now
 Under current law, Mr. Bush need not consider human rights and other issues in deciding on trade with China. Under a provision of law known as the Jackson-Vanick Amendment, the granting of favored trade status is tied only to emigration.
China, which sold $15.2 billion in goods to American companies last year, is the eighth-largest exporter to the United States. But its purchases of $4.8 billion made it only the 18th-largest importer of American products.
Administration officials said the options papers on extending Chinese trade privileges had not even been completed, much less sent to the White House, when Mr. Bush spoke today. The President had received only a strategy memo from Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d that did not discuss the pros and cons of extending the trading privileges but merely outlined ways to sell the idea to Congress, one official said.
It was not entirely clear why the President chose to reveal his position on China trade so precipitously in an unscheduled question-and-answer session on the White House South Lawn.
But some officials said the President felt the pressure of time because of two coming events that would make such an announcement particularly inappropriate. On May 23, China plans to unveil a monument to its absorption of Tibet, which is not recognized by the United States, and June 4, a day after the deadline for the trade decision, is the second anniversary of the violence on Tiananmen Square.
Congress has been pushing Mr. Bush to punish Beijing for that crackdown on political dissent, while the President has always sought to balance those pressures with economic pressures from American companies that do business with China and his strong personal penchant for maintaining relations with Beijing.
"I go back to the days when I was in China as the equivalent of Ambassador and though there are major problems in China, things we don't like about their system, things are an awful lot better than they were back in 1975," Mr. Bush said.
 
Envoy Dispatched
 Last month, Mr. Bush blocked the sale of satellite parts to China because of concern about its sale of missiles and other weapons to Pakistan and other nations. Earlier this month, Robert M. Kimmitt, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, was sent to Beijing for what American officials called a candid discussion about human rights, trade and weapons sales.
But since the Tiananmen Square violence in 1989, Mr. Bush came under steady fire from Capitol Hill for not speaking out more strongly against Beijing or taking tough action, like cutting off China's favorable trade status.
The pressure dramatically increased when it was disclosed in December 1989 that Mr. Bush had sent his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and the Deputy Secretary of State, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, on a secret mission to Beijing that the President later admitted was a failure.

HEADLINE: ROHATYN DROPPING BID TO AID DINKINS

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
In a setback for the Dinkins administration, Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, yesterday abruptly dropped his plan to give the city $1 billion after a bond rating agency said the plan could lead to an immediate downgrading of city bonds.
Mr. Rohatyn canceled a meeting of the M.A.C. board scheduled for today after learning that the Standard & Poor's rating agency had warned that his plan would probably hurt the city's credit rating. The corporation would have provided the city with $1 billion over four years by cashing in M.A.C. bonds, giving the city the proceeds and issuing new bonds that the city would have to pay off later. 
 He said the assistance corporation would reconsider the plan only if the city satisfied the bond-rating agency's worries over the plan's being simply a scheme to allow the city to continue living beyond its means.
 
Cornerstone of Strategy
 The bond-refinancing plan was a cornerstone of a negotiating strategy laid out by Mayor David N. Dinkins since January to avert the worst of thousands of layoffs and deep service cuts he proposed to close a $3.5 billion gap in the city's budget for the fiscal year that begins on July 1.
Its rejection left the Mayor's strategy, at least temporarily, in shambles, with union leaders who had agreed in principle to make concessions now balking, making the imposition of the worst of the cuts ever more likley.
"Regardless of what they do, we will close our gap and control our destiny," a resolute Mayor Dinkins said in Washington yesterday, on a trip with other big-city mayors to lobby for more aid. The mayors, who met with Congressional leaders, asked for money for mass transit, kindergarten programs and other proposals they said would help shore up sliding revenues.
Both Mr. Dinkins and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo sought to discount the importance of Mr. Rohatyn's actions yesterday, suggesting that he would probably find a way to help the city after the City Council adopts the budget next month.
Other officials saw Mr. Rohatyn's decision to postpone any consideration of the plan as a warning that the city's bonds were likely to be downgraded anyway because of the city's fiscal troubles and that Mr. Rohatyn did not want to be associated with that.
Mr. Rohatyn's action upsets delicate behind-the-scenes maneuvering by the Mayor, the Governor, union leaders and Mr. Rohatyn, all trying to find some way out of the city's fiscal problems, which have raised concerns in financial markets and could eventually lead to a takeover of the city's finances by the State Financial Control Board.
 
A Reluctant Participant
 Mr. Rohatyn, who has been deeply skeptical of the city's efforts to close its budget gap since last October, when the Mayor granted a substantial pay raise to teachers, was a reluctant participant in the process, but agreed to help out after he was lobbied heavily by officials in Albany and from City Hall.
Union leaders then insisted that Mr. Rohatyn provide cash to the city before they would consider making cost-cutting concessions sought by the Dinkins administration.
"We prepared a plan that we believe is a good plan that is fully justified by the economic problems in the city right now," Mr. Rohatyn said.
Earlier this month, Mr. Dinkins offered a vision of a city devastated by cuts, with libraries and swimming pools closed, thousands of workers laid off and services slashed. He offered hope that the worst of the cuts could be forestalled through union concessions, increased state aid and surplus cash from the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was set up in the 1970's to borrow money on the city's behalf.
But yesterday municipal union leaders said they too would hold off making concessions unless others shared the scarfice too. "This has been a terrible shock to us," said Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the teamsters union. "We have said all along that all of the players have to share the pain. In this process there is no pain except to the workers."
Under the plan, the M.A.C. would refinance bonds so as to postpone principal payments until after 1995, in effect shifting the cost to future taxpayers. To assure that the administration spent the funds wisely, Mr. Rohatyn proposed that the payments be made only if the control board certified that the administration's plans would bring the city into a permanent balance betweeen spending and revenue.
Mr. Dinkins has steadfastly resisted suggestions that he cede any powers to the control board. "I'm looking for M.A.C. assistance, but that does not mean I'm willing to say I'll take M.A.C. assistance and yield control of the city to the control board," the Mayor said yesterday.
Richard P. Larkin, a managing director at Standard & Poor's, said the city's current bond rating of A- could be in jeopardy if it gets $300 million from the assistance corporation next year. Earlier this year, another rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, cut the city's credit rating to Baa1.
"An A- situation assumes that the city's budget challenges are manageable, within their means to accomplish," Mr. Larkin said. "We are talking about a different credit rating if their situation is managing them."
Some city officials are concerned that even without the corporation's funds, Standard & Poor's will lower the rating when the city sells $600 million in long-term bonds in June. But Mr. Larkin said that Mr. Dinkins's budget had "few surprises" in it and that it "should be a manageable situation."
Mr. Rohatyn, who acknowledged having "concerns" about some city policies, said he was still committed to helping the city out, but only after the city and the state adopt their budgets. "We tried to get ahead of the train," he said. "Now we will have to go back to our usual place at the caboose."

HEADLINE: The Feature-Length Cartoon Returns

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 15

 BODY:
Inspired by the success of movies like "The Little Mermaid" and by a continuing baby boomlet, Hollywood studios are energetically plunging into the production of feature-length animated films, a realm both they and movie audiences have long regarded as a monopoly of the Walt Disney Company .
Warner Brothers' "Rover Dangerfield," starring a canine cartoon version of the comedian Rodney Dangerfield, is scheduled to arrive in theaters this summer. And later this year, in what studio executives say is a sign of things to come, Disney's "Beauty and the Beast," Universal's "An American Tail: Fievel Goes West" and 20th Century Fox's environmentalist fantasy "Ferngully: The Last Rain Forest" will all be competing for the approval of family audiences. 
 At the moment, in fact, all seven of Hollywood's major studios have at least one animated film scheduled for release this year or production next year, leading to intense competition for the services of top animators. "It's a very exciting time," said Charles Solomon, the author of "Enchanted Drawings: The History of Animation." "There are probably more features in production right now than there ever have been."
 
Money: Root of All Imitation
 Like so much else in Hollywood, the renewed interest in animated films after decades of general neglect stems largely from a hunger to duplicate some very impressive box-office numbers. The $154 million made by "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," the $84 million that "The Little Mermaid" earned, the $53 million taken in by "Oliver and Company" and the $47 million performance of "An American Tail" have awakened in movie makers a desire for a foothold in what is seen as an increasingly lucrative specialized market.
"It's very simple," said Roger Birnbaum, the head of production at 20th Century Fox, said when asked why his studio had plunged into animation. "We saw that animated films, when made well, were working in the marketplace, and felt that we also wanted to be in that ballgame."
The studio plans to follow "Ferngully" with another environmentalist cartoon feature, called "The Endangered"
Studio executives are further encouraged by what they see when they study demographic data. Baby boomers, who tend to have fond memories of childhood cartoon characters, are in their prime reproductive years and children ages 5 to 12 are emerging as an important market. Movie makers have visions of attracting both parents and children to theaters with a single product, a formula that worked to the amount of $267 million with 20th Century Fox's live-action comedy "Home Alone."
"We're in an era in which a lot of children are being born and will continue to be born for the next 10 to 15 years," said Gary Lucchesi, the head of production at Paramount Pictures, which recently signed a three-year agreement with Tom Wilhite, the maker of "Rover Dangerfield," in hopes of being able to release an animated feature annually starting in 1992. "Right now that market is dominated by one company, and we believe that doesn't make any sense."
The Disney model, however, is precisely what inspires other studios. They too hope to make animated movies whose popularity is such that they can be rereleased whenever a new generation of children comes along and that are not overexposed through repeated showings on cable or network television.
"There's a general feeling that animated product does tend to be evergreen," said Jean MacCurdy, the vice president for animation at Warner Brothers, which has revived production of its Bugs Bunny cartoons as well as moving into animated features. "You can not only rerelease them theatrically, but in video," where Disney has had tremendous success with such classic titles as "Bambi" and "The Jungle Book," which generated 6.4 million advance orders from video shops when it was offered last month.
 
New Ways to Profit
 Studios have also learned that the merchandising of cartoon characters in stores or at theme parks can be just as lucrative as a theatrical release. "The tail is not only wagging the dog, it's larger than the dog," Mr. Solomon, the film historian, complained. "A film is seen as a great big commercial for a character that has been created with merchandising and licensing rights in mind."
In a time of rapidly escalating film production costs, animated movies are also attractive because they are relatively cheap to make. Though the Motion Picture Association of America calculated the average movie production cost at $27.5 million last year, the director and producer Steven Spielberg said his company was able to make "Fievel Goes West" for about $16.5 million.
Mr. Spielberg said his company, which is also involved in production of the "Tiny Toon" cartoons for television, plans to follow "Fievel Goes West" with animated versions of "Cats" and Rudyard Kipling's "Just So" stories. His only concern is that the vogue for animated movies comes at a time when there is a limited pool of talent, which helps to drive up salaries and add to production costs.
"What we have already discovered, and what other studios will discover, is that there is not exactly an army of animators waiting for employment, but a complete shortage," Mr. Spielberg said. "Within their own little world, they are beginning to attain the status of Kevin Costner and Julia Roberts, and studios are starting to steal from studios."
To cut down on costs, Hollywood animation companies are farming out much of their less complicated work, such as the inking and painting of the thousands of cels that make up an animated movie, to Europe or Southeast Asia, where labor costs are less than half those in the United States. Movies like "Fern Gully" have also been quick to take advantage of recent advances in technology, especially computers.
"We never could have done this film without them," said Bill Kroyer, the former Disney animator who directed the movie. "We use our computer to animate reptiles, vehicles, trees and plants, to save our artists from having to draw them. Our computer has touched almost every phase of the project."
The current combination of market and technological forces makes it possible to imagine a time when studios will regard animated features as a genre that must be represented on their production schedules, several studio executives said. The people actually making the movies hope that forecast proves to be correct.
"In the golden era, every studio had an animation department," Mr. Spielberg said. "There's no limit to it, unless bad stories and bad animation resurface because of economic pressures."

HEADLINE: Baby Beckons. Why Is Daddy at Work?

BYLINE: By CAROL LAWSON

 BODY:
"THIS is Gordon Rothman at 'CBS This Morning,' but you can call me Mr. Mom."
You can also call him an exception. Mr. Rothman, a field producer who left that message on his answering machine at work, is doing what a great many men in corporate America say they dream of, but dare not do for fear of wrecking their careers: he is on a leave of absence to take care of his infant daughter. 
 "I always wanted to share as much as I could in the raising of a child, and my wife and I want Hannah to spend as much time with her parents as possible in her first year," said Mr. Rothman, who began his nine-week leave when his wife, Faith Justice, finished a three-month maternity leave from her job at Pitney Bowes .
Mr. Rothman's employer, CBS , is one of a growing number of companies that allow fathers to take leaves to care for babies. But Mr. Rothman, who lives in New York City, is one of the relatively few men who have taken advantage of that dramatic change in corporate policy. Indeed, he said he knew of no other new father at CBS who had gone on leave.
"The few fathers who take a couple of months off from work tend to end up on the covers of magazines," said Fran Rodgers, the president of Work/Family Directions , a consulting firm in Boston. "So it looks like a trend, but it isn't. There is no company where very many men are taking months off."
The numbers are low even at companies that are leaders in this area. "There is something in the corporate culture that says to men, 'Don't do it,' " said Allen W. Bergerson, the director of personnel policy development at Eastman Kodak , one such employer. Kodak says that since its family leave policy began in 1987, offering employees up to 17 weeks of unpaid time off, 42 men and 624 women have used it to care for infants. Seventy-five percent of Kodak's employees are men.
Researchers also say men usually take off less time than women because they think they look more serious about their jobs if they do not take a full leave.
Besides the worry that time off from work with a baby could shift a man's career off the fast track and onto the "daddy track," financial considerations discourage fathers who might consider taking a leave, especially those who are primary breadwinners. Such leave is unpaid at most companies that offer it.
But as Ms. Rodgers said, "This is more than just an economic issue."
Mr. Rothman agreed: "Five years from now I'm not going to look back and say I wish I had the money instead."
To Richard J. Salls, who lives in Cranford, N.J., the need to spend time with his children outweighed the need for a paycheck when his second son was born in January 1990. He resigned as a finance manager at Ciba-Geigy , the drug manufacturer, to spend at least a year with his children. His wife, Nansie, who took a three-month leave from her job as an accounting manager at Centercore , a maker of office furniture, has been supporting the family.
Mr. Salls's company offered a three-month leave following childbirth, but he did not consider it an option. "There was nothing in the policy that said men could not take the leave," he said, "but there was an unwritten rule that men do not do it."
Parental leave for fathers has been a subject of much public discussion in this era of equal-opportunity parenthood. But it has failed to take hold, say researchers who study the behavior of men in corporations, because men generally fear that it would make them appear soft in their commitment to work and prevent advancement. For some new fathers who have temporarily traded desks for diapers, they add, that is exactly what has happened. Women note that taking time off to care for babies does not advance their careers either, but that does not stop them from doing it.
Advocates of parental leave say that if a family and medical leave bill sponsored by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, becomes law, it would do a great deal to legitimize the concept of time off for new fathers. The bill, which Congress is expected to vote on this summer, would require companies with 50 or more employees to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for various important family situations, including the birth or adoption of a child.
Similar legislation was passed last year and vetoed by President Bush, who said the Government should not order companies to provide certain benefits. The White House has threatened to veto the bill again.
"The bill would legally open opportunities for men, but it would also have a psychological effect," said James A. Levine, director of the Fatherhood Project at the Families and Work Institute in New York, which does research for companies. "It would help to normalize the notion of parental leave."
Although the number of employers offering leaves for new fathers has risen in recent years, a majority of American men are not covered. A survey of 521 large companies conducted in 1988 for the Conference Board found that 60 percent offered a leave beyond routine disability following childbirth for mothers; 44 percent offered a leave for fathers.
The survey asked the maximum length of the leaves. The averages: 56 days for mothers; 18 days for fathers.
While few men make use of formal leave policies, researchers say it has become common for new fathers to arrange short unofficial leaves. Men take an average of six days off when a child is born by using vacation days or calling in sick, said Joseph H. Pleck, the Luce Professor of the Family at Wheaton College. "Men are very careful not to have this labeled as time off with a child," Dr. Pleck said. "It is a quiet revolution."
Proponents of extended leave for men say that research shows that babies benefit greatly from time spent with fathers, and that the experience helps strengthen families. Moreover, they argue, the opportunity should be available equally to mothers and fathers. But those ideals tend to dissipate in the face of corporate and family realities.
Mr. Levine said he recently met a man at a large company "who had been regarded as a high-potential candidate, but after he took parental leave his career stalled." A man at another company, he said, was advised by his boss not to go on leave because "it would be a bad sign of his commitment and would be held against him."
At a time of recession and widespread layoffs, parental leave without pay is unthinkable for many fathers who worry that taking time off could increase their vulnerability. In addition, at many companies that offer parental leave, men are unaware of it. Researchers say that some companies have parental leave policies for both men and women, to protect themselves against charges of sex discrimination, but that they make no effort to tell men about the policies.
Mark Moreland, a senior engineer at Corning who took a month's leave this year, said he knew nothing of his company's policy for new fathers before his wife, Nancy, became pregnant. Mr. Moreland, who lives in Elmira, N.Y., said his supervisor, whose approval was required, did not know about the 13-year-old policy either.
For some men, the changing nature of family life has given the issue of parental leave a new urgency. For example, if the mother's income is larger than the father's, a couple might decide that it makes economic sense for the father to stay home with a baby. And some couples find that the father's employer is more generous with parental leave than the mother's. For men who are single parents, the issue is especially acute.
Some working parents look to parental leave as a child-care solution for an infant. Raymond St. Francis, an architect on the corporate real estate staff at International Business Machines, and his wife, Susan Peterson, an architect with GTE , took back-to-back leaves to take care of their son. Mr. St. Francis began a six-month leave in February, when his wife's three-month leave ended.
"We felt that at 3 months, Adrian was much too young for day care," said Mr. St. Francis, who lives in Stamford, Conn.
Mr. Salls, who is looking for a job, described his 16 months as a full-time father as "a great experience and an unbelievable risk."
"You worry that the person interviewing you for a job might not fully understand what you did," he said. "I wish corporations would realize that some parents don't want better day-care centers. They want time with their kids."

Parcells Courted By TV

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
Despite Bill Parcells's protestations yesterday that he has no plans for his post-Giants future, he has laid the groundwork for at least two possible career moves -- to NBC and the Madison Square Garden Network.
In March, Robert Fraley, Parcells's agent, initiated talks with NBC that led to an audition for an analyst's job and with MSG about being host for a weekly program about the National Football League. 
 NBC Sports's executive producer, Terry O'Neil, said: "Fraley called and asked, 'If Bill were to leave coaching, would you be interested in him?' I said, 'Yes we would,' and then, 'To help answer the question, would Bill audition?' "
O'Neil brought Parcells together with play-by-play announcer Don Criqui on March 23 to make a tape of last season's American Football Conference between the Raiders and Bengals divisional playoff game. Bill Walsh tested in the same studio before he was hired by NBC.
O'Neil said there have been no formal negotiations with Parcells and no offer has been tendered. "The talks have been informal," he said. "We'll give him a week and get in touch after that. There's no deadline except the start of the preseason."
O'Neil said unequivocally that there is room in the crowded NBC football booth for Parcells if he wants the job -- despite the presence of Walsh, Todd Christensen, Paul Maguire, Bob Trumpy, Ahmad Rashad and Joe Namath. "You can't have enough good analysts," O'Neil said.
A prime consideration in having room for Parcells is the arrival of Notre Dame football on NBC. Walsh will leave the N.F.L. booth for six Irish games this fall, and Rashad will also draw Notre Dame duty in the booth and studio.
NBC's economics makes it possible to pay Parcells upwards of $500,000 because it doesn't have analysts earning more than Walsh (about $575,000), the way that CBS's high-priced booth does, with John Madden leading the way at more than $1 million. In essence, money is a more important consideration to NBC than adding to the analyst head count.
Walsh's contract locks him into being the undisputed top football analyst for the next two years. Asked about the possibility of being joined by Parcells, Walsh said: "I look forward to having him at NBC. Neither of us have the kind of ego where we'll feel we're in competition with each other."
Parcells's talks with the MSG Network have gone considerably further than those at NBC. He has been speaking to the cable network since March -- and as recently as a week ago -- about a weekly N.F.L. show. MSG is speaking to the Prime Sports Network about making the program a national venture.
"This show would have no bearing on going to NBC," said Bob Gutkowski, president of the Madison Square Garden Communication Groups, parent company of the cable network. "I think he wants the MSG thing to be the first piece in his puzzle and then he'd make other decisions."
Gutkowski said that Parcells has qualities that make a show on MSG viable. "I've liked his ability to handle the media, his candor and his honesty," he said. "He's got a lot of credibility."
Parcells could probably earn about $200,000 from the MSG program and will probably have to decide soon whether to sign on to allow the network to plan its fall programming without him.

T.W.A. Acts To Buy Debt Below Value

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Trans World Airlines yesterday offered to buy back debt securities from creditors far below face value, arguing that the creditors faced even larger losses if the airline was forced to file for bankruptcy protection.
The airline also threatened a Chapter 11 filing if its three unions did not agree to major concessions and if creditors did not resolve lawsuits that could result in the courts allowing them to repossess aircraft and spare parts. 
 The airline said the offer to creditors was a "first step in a restructuring designed to enable T.W.A. to survive."
The various steps signaled that Carl C. Icahn, the chairman, was preparing for a long and difficult attempt to cut the carrier's costs and make it viable or attractive enough to be bought by another airline.
The airline said it would use the proceeds of the $445 million sale of London routes to American Airlines to buy back the bonds.
 
Impact of the War
 Mr. Icahn this week sold his 13.5 percent interest in USX Corporation for $1.02 billion, but in the annoucement yesterday there was no mention of the sale or indication that any of the proceeds would be used to buy back T.W.A. debt.
T.W.A. also issued earnings yesterday, reporting a loss of $88.2 million for first quarter compared with a loss of $143 million in the first quarter of 1990. Much of the loss came from a decline of traffic as a result of the war in the Persian Gulf and the recession in the United States.
The airline's revenues in the first quarter totaled $820.2 million, down 19.2 percent from revenues of $1 billion in the first quarter of last year.
Several analysts said that the offers for the various debt securities would prove attractive to creditors even though they would be asked to swallow considerable losses.
"It's an interesting offer that is definitely worth considering," said Ray Neidl, an airline industry analyst for Dillon, Read & Company.
 
Opening Move Is Seen
 However, one bondholder, Mel Ehrlich, the vice president of corporate bond trading at Halpert & Company, said he saw Mr. Icahn's offer as an opening move and would hold on.
He said that the mood was similar among other bondholders he had talked to and that they all expected Mr. Icahn to sweeten his offer. He said that his firm held the subordinated notes for which Mr. Icahn was offering 17.5 cents on the dollar. He added that he had bought more of the notes yesterday at 15 cents on the dollar.
Mr. Neidl also said that the airline's argument that creditors would get much less if T.W.A. was forced into bankruptcy carried weight since it would be difficult to get good prices for assets when other carriers were also seeking to sell assets.
 
Concessions Offered to Outsider
 Still, Mr. Icahn would save more than $700 million in debt if creditors accept his offer. Mr. Neidl estmated that it would cost Mr. Icahn about $500 million to buy back $1.236 billion worth of debt.
The T.W.A. creditors who choose not to accept the cash tender offer would get equity and new debt.
 The airline said that Mr. Icahn owned a total of $188.6 million in subordinated notes and about 90 percent of the common stock of T.W.A. Mr. Icahn has estimated that he will lose more than $40 million in the buyback of debt securities.
If the debt is retired, T.W.A. would save more than $150 million a year in interest costs.
Even if most of the creditors go along, T.W.A. would face a major battle with its unions, which have backed an effort to buy the airline by Kirk Kerkorian, the West Coast investor. The unions have agreed to a package of concessions that they would offer to Mr. Kerkorian who has promised to inject $250 million into the airline if he can aquire it. Mr. Icahn has spurned the buyout effort so far.
The airline has also resorted to withholding payment on debt and equipment leases to conserve cash. It has defaulted on about $200 million in principal and interest payments.
Some creditors have been able to get a court decision that they could seize aircraft and spare parts if payments were not made.
In the tender offer, T.W.A. said it was offering 73 cents on the dollar on its equipment trust certificates; 65 cents on the dollar for its 15 percent senior notes; 35 cents on the dollar for its unsecured notes, and 17.5 cents on the dollar for its subordinated notes.
 
Less Debt, Less Cash
 William Compton, the chairman of the negotiating committee of the pilots' union at T.W.A., said that there was concern that Mr. Icahn was depleting the airline of cash in retiring the debt.
"You've got less debt, but there is a lot of cash leaving the company," he said. "How do you make this thing work afterward?"
He added that the holders of the subordinated notes should get equity instead of cash since the notes were issued when Mr. Icahn took the carrier private and withdrew $469 million in cash for himself.
He said that Mr. Icahn was a major holder of the subordinated notes, which had traded as low as 9 cents on the dollar. By offering 17.5 cents on the dollar, he said, Mr. Icahn increased the value of the notes on the open market.

HEADLINE: Malpractice Victims: Ignored

 BODY:
Medical liability insurance premiums are rising by more than 20 percent a year, forcing some physicians to practice defensive, and therefore costly, medicine and to withdraw from risky service altogether. What can government, which pays some of the bills, do about it? Yesterday the Bush Administration issued its answer.
Make that half an answer. The Administration plan addresses cost, finding ways to insulate doctors and hospitals against outlandish settlements. But it virtually ignores the pain of thousands of victims of malpractice, people who don't sue and don't collect a dime.
 
 According to the American Medical Association, malpractice insurance premiums add $5.6 billion to patient bills and about $15 billion to defensive practices. Because fees are high and physicians have been forced to withdraw from high-risk services like obstetrics, the Administration contends that an attack on malpractice awards will improve access to quality care.
The Bush proposal would encourage states to adopt the reforms by reallocating a small percentage of Federal medical reimbursements. It would place a $250,000 cap on non-economic damages like pain and suffering. States would be required to set up dispute-resolution mechanisms and strengthen medical boards to establish treatment guidelines.
The Administration is right: Many doctors are sued inappropriately. And many states lack guidelines to help juries make awards reasonable and consistent. The system often looks more like a crapshoot than reasonable recompense.
But there's another dimension: Thousands of malpractice victims get no compensation at all. Paul Weiler, a Harvard law professor, cites a study of New York hospitals in 1984 of which he was co-author. It found that only one in eight victims ever sued -- and only half of them received compensation. Correcting this problem would add billions to medical insurance premiums, perhaps explaining the Administration's silence.
Another, more recent study of which Mr. Weiler was co-author, for the American Law Institute, offers evidence challenging different points in the Administration plan. Fixed caps on non-economic damages would only affect the most extreme and expensive injuries. A better way to handle arbitrary rewards would be for states to create guidelines for all types of injuries.
This report also recommends that attorney's fees be included among recoverable damages -- essential if jury awards are scaled back as the Administration recommends. The Bush plan is silent on this point, just as it is silent, and surprisingly so, on a larger philosophical point of presumably strong interest to conservatives especially: On what ground does the Federal Government intrude into what heretofore has been a matter for the states?
Medical malpractice needs serious reform. President Bush offers half a plan. Congress could wisely turn to the well-crafted Law Institute report for the rest.

Small-Business Agency Gives Award to Woman

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Joann R. Schulz has been named the National Small Business Person of the Year by the Small Business Administration. She is the first woman so honored in the 27 years that the Federal agency has presented the award.
Mrs. Schulz, who is 45, was cited for her work as president of DGR Inc. of St. Petersburg, Fla., a maker of ophthalmic products for eye surgeons. Mrs. Schulz took over the company in 1986 after the death of her husband, Richard, who had been president. His death came only a year after the company was founded and it was struggling. 
 "The company could not afford to put all founders on the payroll," she said. "My husband was president, heading operations; another founder headed manufacturing. We also hired an assembler."
When her husband died of a heart attack at 44, Mrs. Schulz thought her new position was temporary. She already headed a consulting firm, Regtech, which helped companies to obtain Food and Drug Administration approvals.
"I planned to stay for three months, which became six months and then five years," she said.
In 1990, sales totaled $4 million and pretax profit was $1 million. "This year, sales will be about $6 million and pretax profit about $1.5 million," Mrs. Shultz estimated. She said the company now had 75 employees.
In March, Mrs. Schulz resigned as head of DGR to become president of a larger company, Phoenix Laser Systems Inc., a San Francisco optical products concern. She said she hoped to merge Phoenix with DGR, where she still owns 17 percent of the stock.
Mrs. Schulz, who majored in chemistry and biological science, received her undergraduate degree from the University of California in 1973. She added a master's degree in biochemistry in 1977.
Her first professional job was with an ophthalmic unit of American Hospital Supply. "I left in 1979 to work in the technical area, for Coburn Optical, then a division of Revlon and based in Florida," she said, adding that she took the job even though she did not like the general manager. "A year and a half later, in 1980, I married him," she said.

HEADLINE: Nomination To Fed Seat Is Expected

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
President Bush is expected to name Susan M. Phillips, a former chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to a vacant seat on the Federal Reserve Board.
Administration officials said this week that Ms. Phillips's nomination had been tentatively approved by President Bush on the basis of a recommendation from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, but would not be announced until the Federal Bureau of Investigation had completed its background check. 
 The background investigations required of top Presidential appointees often take months. Because Ms. Phillips has been out of the Government for only four years, hers could take less time.
Meantime, the assumption throughout the Administration is that Alan Greenspan will be given another four-year term as chairman of the Fed when his term expires in August, but officials said no high-level discussions had yet been held on the chairmanship.
Ms. Phillips, who is 46 years old, is now vice president of finance and university services at the University of Iowa. She was a member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from 1981 to 1983 and its chairman from 1983 until 1987. Her office in Iowa City said she was traveling today and could not be reached.
Her academic speciality is finance and financial markets. Her views on monetary policy, the main responsibility of the Federal Reserve Board, are not widely known.
That is characteristic of Mr. Bush's other nominations to the seven-member board of the central bank. The first person he put on the board, David W. Mullins Jr., was an Assistant Treasury Secretary who specialized in banking matters. Mr. Bush's next nominee, Lawrence B. Lindsey, was a White House economist whose academic expertise is tax policy. Mr. Lindsey's confirmation is pending before the Senate.
Ms. Phillips would replace Martha R. Seger, who resigned in March, in what seems to have become the woman's seat on the Federal Reserve Board. Ms. Seger succeeded Nancy H. Teeters, who in 1978 became the first woman to sit on the board.
Mr. Greenspan's renomination, said one Administration official who works on economic policy, "is a foregone conclusion." Reconfirmation by the Senate would be required, but he would face little opposition, if any. Officials said a final decision on the chairmanship would be made in a month or two.
 
Viewed as a Loyalist
 Although Mr. Brady, and to a lesser extent President Bush himself, have been critical of Mr. Greenspan, accusing him of retarding economic growth by keeping interest rates unnecessarily high, the Fed chairman is generally viewed as an Administration loyalist.
Mr. Brady and Mr. Boskin are especially fond of him and are expected to vigorously advocate his renomination. The only question is the opinion of John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff. Some officials suggested that Mr. Sununu might favor replacing Mr. Greenspan, but they said they did not know Mr. Sununu's position with certainty.
In the one publicly known instance when Mr. Brady and Mr. Sununu disagreed over an appointment, the President sided with the Treasury Secretary. That was late last year when Mr. Brady wanted to keep Robert L. Clarke as Comptroller of the Currency and Mr. Sununu wanted to remove him.
According to several middle-level officials, two important factors make Mr. Greenspan's renomination likely. The first is that there is no obvious candidate to replace him. When the Reagan Administration decided in 1987 that it did not want to keep Paul A. Volcker as Fed chairman, Mr. Greenspan was widely seen as waiting in the wings.
The other factor is the potentially adverse reaction in Congress and in the financial markets if Mr. Greenspan is not retained. He is unusually popular among both parties in Congress and is widely respected on Wall Street, where he spent most of his professional career as an economist.

HEADLINE: Let's Borrow More Money

BYLINE: By John Kenneth Galbraith; John Kenneth Galbraith is emeritus professor of economics at Harvard.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
One cannot but marvel on encountering an issue of major popular concern on which, as now, there is a broad unity as to response. That issue is the recession and what to do about it. The truly complete agreement by all levels of government is on measures designed to make it worse.
Everywhere across the country governments are tightening budgets, curtailing services, reducing payrolls, furloughing workers -- or promising to do so. Individuals immediately affected, needless to say, have their spending -- and resulting support to the economy -- promptly reduced. Many under threat of unemployment are impelled to retrench. So also those in receipt of welfare and other payments now being curtailed or threatened with curtailment. 
 The depressive effect goes on -- to those people from whom all these formerly purchased goods and services and to their employees. It is what my technically more elegant professional colleagues call a multiplier effect, this one being in reverse.
President Bush and numerous official and volunteer spokesmen have advised that the recession will be shallow and brief. The third or fourth or some slightly later quarter will see the automatic recovery. Better home sales and the small improvement in retail sales announced this week surely point the way. All those who so speak should be regarded with restraint. They divide as between those who do not know and those who do not know they do not know.
Similarly suspect are those who speak confidently of the magic of monetary action, the therapeutic marvel of a modest reduction in interest rates. On all this, there are warnings from the past. So many optimistic predictions were made in the early months of the Great Depression that Simeon D. Fess, chairman of the Republican National Committee, was led to suspect an exceptionally devious plot to discredit Herbert Hoover's Administration. "Every time an Administration official gives out an optimistic statement about business conditions, the market immediately drops," he said.
It is better and safer that all levels of government reverse course and unite in making things better. Accepting the conservative conviction that recessions are soon over, let us have short-run borrowing to sustain services and thus to cover the recession-induced shortfall in revenues. Then if automatic recovery is not assumed, this becomes even more important.
If there are constitutional barriers to borrowing, let there be steps to have them relaxed temporarily. More important, let the Federal Government, from its far greater fiscal resources, now establish a special fund, a latter-day Reconstruction Finance Corporation, with borrowing power on a scale in keeping with the savings and loan bailout. This would provide grants and low-interest loans to states and localities in the months ahead. Thus would the deflationary effects (and human costs) of the present course of events be arrested or reversed.
There is something bizarre in an Education President urging educational reform when school districts are curtailing the school term, freezing or cutting teachers' pay and, in some extreme cases, threatening to close schools for lack of money, and students in state colleges and universities are reacting in despair to higher tuition, curtailed scholarship funds and reduced course offerings.
The financing corporation should invest in repair and improvement of roads and bridges, urban transport facilities, airports and other, as it is called, infrastructure. We are now seeking through lower interest rates to encourage private investment; why not proceed with greatly needed public investment?
As a bow to fiscal conservatism, perhaps we should have a higher- bracket tax increase to cover interest and amortization on the borrowing by this corporation. The expansive effect of the large immediate expenditure would far offset the small restraining effect of the more enduring tax.
The important thing is to get all levels of government off their present deflationary track. They are supposed to be the guardians of the public well-being. Presently, they are united in making it worse.

Tribune Co.'s Bleak News

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 16

 BODY:
The Tribune Company's 1991 earnings will fall far short of last year's earnings, even excluding losses at The Daily News in New York, according to Charles T. Brumback, the president.
The Chicago-based media company had taken a one-time charge against earnings of $295 million in the fourth quarter last year related to the sale of The Daily News to the British publisher Robert Maxwell on March 20. The company lost $63.5 million in 1990, but would have shown income of $191.5 million, or $2.64 a share, without the New York paper. 
 Earnings likely will be "well below" that in 1991, Mr. Brumback said at the company's annual meeting Wednesday. He blamed declines in advertising and a sluggish economy.
"But assuming modest improvement in the economy, the trends should be in the right direction and we are looking for better results in 1992," Mr. Brumback said in a statement.
At the meeting, outside directors defended the company's handling of a long strike at The Daily News.
"All Mr. Brumback and management were trying to do was run the business for the shareholders in the most efficient way," said Frank W. Considine, a director who is honorary chairman of American National Can Company.

HEADLINE: HOUSING IN MASSACHUSETTS;
Brokers and Lenders Join To Push Cape Cod Sales

BYLINE: By SETH S. KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HYANNIS, Mass., May 16

 BODY:
Anyone interested in buying property on Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard this summer can get a quick one-stop look at what's available on Sunday when 22 real estate brokers, two mortgage loan companies and a Cape Cod bank will display their wares in a Hyannis hotel showroom.
The showcase has been organized by Premier Productions, a small promotions firm based in Brookline, Mass. Andrea Dale, a partner, said each broker and lending company would have a booth with pictures and fact sheets on the properties they are handling in a large meeting room at the Tara Hyannis from 10 A.M. until 5 P.M. Admission is $2.50 for adults; children will be admitted without charge. 
 "With New England real estate prices at their lowest levels in nearly four years and with the usual great interest in property on Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard, we thought this would be a great time to give possible buyers a chance to get an introductory look at what's available right now in the two areas," she said.
The azaleas, forsythia and beach plums are not the only source of great swatches of yellow, red and white this week. There are also the myriad for-sale signs stretching like ceremonial flags along all the major roads and streets.
It is truly a buyer's market: Near-record numbers of residential property and condominium units are listed for sale, average prices are at or near the bottom of the trough, interest rates have been slowly slipping down for six weeks and the Cape and Martha's Vineyard have just come through one of the worst winters of sales on record.
As of April 12, the latest counting period of the Cape Cod Board of Realtors, there were 4,340 residential units and 861 condominium units listed for sale on the Cape and Martha's Vineyard, one of the highest totals on record.
According to the figures released last week by the Massachusetts Association of Realtors, the average selling price for detached, single-family homes on the Cape fell by 14.3 percent, to $153,099, in the first quarter of 1991 from the period a year earlier. The Cape's average was well below the state's, which was $172,122, a decline of 10.3 percent.
According to the Banker & Tradesman, an independent publication that charts each sale recorded at local registries of deeds, residential sales on the Cape in the first quarter of this year fell to 689 from 936 last year, a drop of 26 percent. Condo unit sales fell to 75 from 142, a decline of 47 percent.
As of last Sunday, 15-year fixed-rate mortgages ranged from 8.87 percent to 9.25 percent, while 30-year fixed-rates ranged from 9.12 to 9.62 percent.
Some real estate brokers say they are certain prices have hit bottom and are turning up.
Charles F. Lockhart, executive vice president of the Board of Realtors, said that in the last two months there had been a clear rise in the number of houses under contract but not yet closed.
There has also been an increase in buyer interest, he said, and most of this was in asking prices of $150,000 to $160,000.
"One reason for this," he said, "is that our brokers are handling an unusually large number of properties taken over by the banks. Many of these are on the market at excellent prices for a buyer."
Egerton Homes Massachusetts is another believer in the upturn theory. For the last year, this development company managed to keep its large Stratford Pond condominium development in Mashpee alive by selling units through an equity sharing plan. Under this plan, a buyer borrows half of the purchase price and occupies a unit (average full price about $180,000). The other half of the price would be dormant for five years, after which the buyer would borrow the remainder.
Egerton no longer uses this plan, said Carl A. Grassetti, its president, because sales are beginning to pick up. "All of last year, only 15 to 18 units were sold and built at Stratford Pond," he said. "But now, with regular financing, we're averaging a sale a week."

HEADLINE: More Economic Pain Seen for Soviets

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
The economy of the Soviet Union faces a decline in output of 10 percent, an inflation rate exceeding 100 percent and the likelihood of a "radically worse" year, American intelligence agencies said today.
Those forecasts were included in the annual report to Congress on the state of the Soviet economy by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency. 
 In an appendix, the C.I.A. notes that over the years it has been much more conservative than the official Moscow analysis of Soviet economic conditions, but it adds that lately Soviet and Western estimates seemed to be converging in several categories as a result of sharp, downward revisions by Soviet statisticians.
In an accompanying presentation to the Technology and National Security Subcommittee of the Joint Economic Committee, C. Patrick Duecy of the Defense Intelligence Agency said that "despite much fanfare," the Soviet Government had made little progress in converting military industries to civilian production.
 
Best Case: 10% Decline in Output
 The analyst said that while the Pentagon expects the Soviet Union to continue modernizing its forces and weapons systems, "military programs will likely have to be cut further."
The intelligence agencies envisioned various scenarios in which the Government of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev either succeeded in mediating the worst differences between the central Government and restive Soviet republics or failed and turned to more repressive measures. Even in the best case -- with improvement in relations between the central Government and the republics and a renewal of reform efforts -- the study says Soviet output would "probably still fall some 10 percent."
In the worst case, repressive steps "to control the republics, to enforce state orders and to stabilize the economy" would speed "the downward spiral," it says.
In that case, the study says, "the decline would eventually equal or exceed the 30 percent drop in G.N.P. and the 25 percent unemployment rate experienced in the United States during the Great Depression of 1930-1933."
That mirrors the view of the general trend of the Soviet economy voiced by some Soviet analysts, among them Vladimir M. Mashchits, one of the young economists who helped draft a "500-day plan" of drastic revisions commissioned and then rejected by President Gorbachev last year. "We are in a classic slide, which nothing can stop," Mr. Mashchits said a month ago. "It may take another year to reach bottom."
Describing various elements of "an economy in turmoil," the study speaks of "a breakdown in the distribution system" and "the twin threats of rising unemployment and accelerating consumer inflation." It notes that republic authorities have deliberately held back deliveries of such commodities as grain, fruit and livestock products -- preferring to barter them. Republics producing oil, coal and cotton have similarly ignored central delivery orders in favor of barter deals.
It attributes the current economic problems in part to "a progressive loss of control over financial flows, a mismanaged shift of resources from invstment and defense to consumption and rising political and social tensions."
Productivity declined in 1990 in considerable part because of a loss of 10 million worker days due to strikes.
 
Foreign Trade Suffers
 While it is still the world's leading producer of oil, output continues to decline after a 6 percent decrease last year, cutting into the Soviet Union's vitally needed hard-currency earnings.
Soviet foreign trade is also suffering, the study says, with record deficits arising from a surge in the import of consumer goods to meet ballooning domestic shortages. Despite the imports, the situation of the ordinary Soviet citizen "has worsened since the beginning of the year," the study says -- partly a result of a decrease in the domestic manufacture of consumer goods.
The C.I.A.'s chief Soviet analyst, George Kolt, acknowledging past criticism of his agency's estimates of Soviet economic performance in comparison with that of the United States, said that the Soviet gross national product was probably overstated because, for example, it was impossible to adjust completely for inferior goods and services.
The agency said, for instance, that the Soviets concluded there was a 3 percent growth in the economy in 1989, while the C.I.A. concluded the percentage change was only half that.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Light Activity In Advance of Trade Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose slightly against most major currencies yesterday in light trading as the market awaited a report on the nation's balance of trade.
The market all but ignored the news that Karl Otto Pohl resigned as president of Germany's Bundesbank. Traders said they were reassured by comments from Mr. Pohl and other German officials that the central bank would not change its policy of controlling inflation through tight money. 
 In addition, Mr. Pohl's departure had been rumored for several days and so was not a surprise, said Lorenzo Troni, vice president of foreign exchange trading at Paine Webber.
"The market believes the Bundesbank policy will not change with or without Mr. Pohl," Mr. Troni said.
The currency market also had little reaction to comments by a Treasury official that the dollar's value was about right. The Under Secretary of the Treasury, David C. Mulford, told a Senate subcommittee that the upward move of the dollar since the end of the gulf war had not adversely affected United States exports.
Mr. Troni said similar comments had been made earlier by other Bush Administration officials. He said the market was marking time ahead of today's release of merchandise trade figures for March.
In New York, the dollar settled at 1.6968 German marks, up from 1.68445 marks on Wednesday. In European trading the dollar rose to 1.6965 German marks, up from 1.6895.
In Tokyo, the dollar ended the day at 137.30 Japanese yen, down from 137.89 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 137.50 yen. The dollar was quoted at 137.45 yen in late New York trading, up from 137.15 late on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7465, from $1.7475 late on Wednesday. In New York, the pound cost $1.7595, up from $1.7540.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.4374 Swiss francs, up from 1.4240; 5.7460 French francs, up from 5.7145; 1,261 Italian lire, up from 1,252, and 1.1500 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1490.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Bonn's Contrasts With Washington

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
A COALITION of top Administration officials and business executives has been pushing the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates, and thus far Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, and a majority of the Fed's policy makers have been cautiously going along. The Economist last week read the riot act to both the Administration and the Fed: "Not only has the Bush Administration shown itself incapable of exercising wise economic leadership but, much more disturbing, it seems that the Federal Reserve stands ready to do its bidding."
In Germany, however, the Bundesbank has been acting like Horatio at the bridge, defending its strong anti-inflationary policy and interest-rate structure against any and all threats from the Eastern provinces of Germany, Brussels, Bonn or Washington.
Does this contrast in German and American central-bank style simply reflect a difference in the personalities of the fiery Karl Otto Pohl, the president of the Bundesbank who announced his resignation yesterday for personal reasons, and the mild Mr. Greenspan? Or does it represent a difference in politics? (Mr. Pohl is a Social Democrat, unlike the Christian Democratic Chancellor, Helmut Kohl; Mr. Greenspan a Republican, like President Bush.) But the Bonn Government proclaims its own anti-inflationary fervor, and the mark has risen on the market's expectations that when Mr. Pohl leaves he will be replaced by an equally orthodox keeper of the Bundesbank's faith and integrity.
The difference in German and American monetary policies may represent contrasting national cultures, with Germans giving their highest priority to avoiding inflation and Americans to avoiding depression. The greatest economic trauma of Germany was the hyperinflation of the early 1920's, which wiped out the value of money, undermined the middle class and prepared the soil for Nazism. The worst economic trauma of the United States was the Great Depression and mass unemployment of the 1930's, which transformed capitalism and gave the state the responsibility of insuring high employment.
Yet there is still another way of interpreting recent Federal Reserve vs. Bundesbank behavior: as a reflection of their different reactions to the respective political and economic dangers facing both countries. In the United States, both the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index rose in April by a modest two-tenths of 1 percent. Since December, under the impact of the recession, producer prices have declined at an annual rate of about 3.5 percent. And since February, consumer prices have risen at an annual rate of only about 1 percent. In 1990, consumer prices rose by 6.1 percent and producer prices by 5.6 percent.
As a result of the sharp decline in inflation, there has been little or no decline in real interest rates, measured as nominal interest rates minus the current or prospective rate of inflation. Since the recession began last July, the Treasury bill rate has come down to 5.57 percent from 7.66 percent.
Without a cut in real, rather than just nominal, rates, the economic recovery is likely to get no help from monetary policy. How much should real rates come down to help the economy overcome its sluggishness? At a recent conference at the Jerome Levy Economic Institute of Bard College, Prof. Benjamin Friedman of Harvard said, "I don't know and I don't pretend to know exactly how much real interest rates would have to come down, but I do know they haven't come down that much."
He calculated that the one-year Treasury bill rate has come down "visibly less" than the decline in the average inflation rate in seven of the last eight recessions. "What recovery we have in the next year," Professor Friedman said, "will be recovery not because of monetary policy but despite monetary policy.
But as inflation eases in the United States, inflationary expectations are rising in Germany. Though the Consumer Price Index for the whole of Germany has been rising at an annual rate of about 3 percent, up only slightly from the 1990 rate of 2.7 percent, inflation has soared at an annual rate of 20 percent to 30 percent in what was formerly East Germany, said Adolphe J. Warner, chairman of Global Assets Management Associates and the retired senior adviser to the Deutsche Bank Capital Corporation.
The East Germans have been unable thus far to rid themselves of the incubus of their Communist past, with its inculcated habits of high but concealed inflation, low or negative productivity growth, widespread underemployment and (often concealed) unemployment, a lack of initiative and subservience to political masters.
The threat to inflation in the Federal Republic of Germany stems not just from the Eastern provinces but from the Government's huge expenditures on the East, big budget deficits and potential membership on the Bundesbank board of political hacks from the East.
Thus, the contrasts between German and American monetary policy stem not just from cultural or theoretical differences but from real differences in the political and economic problems confronting each country. This may be becoming a global economy, but nation-states and national currencies still matter.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Backs Expanded I.R.A.'s

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Legislation that would make tax-deductible individual retirement accounts available again to all Americans won a lukewarm endorsement today from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
But despite Mr. Greenspan's support, the popularity of I.R.A.'s among taxpayers and the sponsorship of more than three-quarters of the Senate, the measure is not likely to be enacted this year because of budget constraints. 
 In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Greenspan called the low rate of savings "the key domestic economic policy problem of this country." After studying the matter carefully, Mr. Greenspan said, he found the evidence inconclusive that expanded retirement accounts would increase savings, but he added, "It's probably worth a chance, because even if it doesn't turn out to have any major net addition to national savings, there's probably very little damage that is done."Restrictions Put in Place
From 1981 through 1986, taxpayers could put up to $2,000 a year into retirement accounts and deduct the amount on their Federal tax returns. Since then, such deductions have been disallowed for taxpayers covered by other pension arrangements who have incomes above $25,000 for single people and $40,000 for couples.
In March, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, and Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, a senior Republican on the committee, introduced legislation that would make the I.R.A. rules even more generous than those in the early 1980's. Seventy-five Senators joined them as co-sponsors.
Under the Bentsen-Roth plan, taxpayers would have the option of taking the deduction when they put money into their retirement account and paying taxes when it is withdrawn or of forgoing the immediate deduction and enjoying tax-free income on all money left in the account for more than five years. In addition, money could be withdrawn without penalty to buy homes, pay tuition or meet large medical bills.
In times past, when the budget rules were more lax, such a measure would have sailed through Congress. But the budget law enacted last year requires any tax cuts to be offset dollar for dollar by a tax increase elsewhere or by reduced spending.
 
Cost of Legislation
 The Congressional tax staff has estimated that the Bentsen-Roth legislation would cost about $4.5 billion in lost revenue in the first year and more than $25 billion over five years.
Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Roth have not said how they would raise that, and whatever they propose is likely to generate significant opposition. "The co-sponsors are going to start dropping like flies as soon as the talk about the offset starts," said a Congressional staff expert.
The Bush Administration opposes the measure on budget grounds, as do key figures in the House. A spokesman for Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee, characterized Mr. Rostenkowski's view this way: "I love I.R.A.'s, but where does Lloyd think the money's going to come from?"
Meanwhile, Mr. Rostenkowski said today in a speech to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants that he would introduce a tax "simplification" bill next month. The chairman's spokesman said the bill would not change tax policy or the amount of revenue raised but would simplify arcane parts of the tax code, mostly involving corporations, that accountants find especially complicated and burdensome.
 
Called as First Witness
 Mr. Greenspan is the Government's most important economic policy maker, but he has no direct influence over tax policy. He was called nonetheless as the first witness on the I.R.A. bill in part because of the Bush Administration's opposition to the measure and in part because the Fed chairman is so widely admired in Congress as an economist that the measure's sponsors thought his endorsement, even a weak one, would add impetus to their drive.
Mr. Greenspan said that increasing the amount Americans save was cru cial to the country's long-term economic prospects. That is the only way to expand private investment and guarantee an increasing standard of living for Americans, he told the lawmakers.
Even reviewing the experience of the 1980's in hindsight, economists differ over whether I.R.A.'s increase private savings significantly or merely result in a tax break for people who shift money from a taxable account to a deductible one. They agree, however, that the wealthier the taxpayers, the more likely they are to save in a retirement account.

Japanese Parent to Aid Bridgestone/Firestone

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 16

 BODY:
The Japanese parent of Bridgestone/ Firestone Inc. said today that it would inject $1.4 billion into the debt-ridden United States tire maker.
The Bridgestone Corporation, Japan's biggest tire company, said the infusion, which it will make by the end of the month, would be used as a capital reserve and to cut the subsidiary's heavy debt. The wholly owned United States unit, based in Akron, Ohio, owes $3 billion. 
 "Bridgestone/Firestone has been investing to upgrade its facilities and everyone has been working to improve quality," said Akira Yeiri, president of the Bridgestone Corporation. Because of these capital expenditures, he said, the company has taken on a large amount of debt. But he said Bridgestone wanted to "revitalize" its American operations in order to become "the world's leading tire company."
The added debt, coupled with a severe downturn in the industry, has left Bridgestone/Firestone hard-pressed to pay its bills.
The tire maker is also struggling with lower sales as a result of the recession. Bridgestone/Firestone lost $350 million in 1990 and dismissed 500 managers last month. More cutbacks in facilities and personnel are expected.
Bridgestone, which controls about half the Japanese market, bought the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company three years ago. The merged company is the world's No. 2 tire maker after France's Groupe Michelin.
But foreign competition is intensifying, as the world's top companies consolidate. Earlier this week, Continental A.G. of Germany and Pirelli S.p.A. of Italy announced that they had opened friendly discussions to form an alliance.
On top of tougher competition, the pool of customers is shrinking. Tire prices are plunging as auto makers cut back production, reducing the need for original equipment tires.

HEADLINE: New York Workers Accept a Film Pact, Ending a Shutdown

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Reversing an earlier vote, members of a film-crafts union local accepted an accord yesterday with leading Hollywood producers to end a bitter stalemate that had virtually shut down major-studio film making in New York City since November.
The acceptance came at a crucial time of year for New York's film industry, a vital part of the city's economy that is estimated to generate from $500 million to $2.3 billion in business as well as an abundance of ancillary jobs. Commitments can still be made to bring some big-budget productions to the city for summer filming, and one production that had left New York is coming back next week.
 
Terms Make City Attractive
 The settlement is viewed as a breakthrough that will bring substantial savings to producers for night and weekend shooting in New York, which had previously entailed substantial overtime penalties. The agreement will make New York more competitive since it will bring the city's film workers' rates into line with rates in Los Angeles, Chicago and other locations. 
 "The new contract terms are going to be a magnet for producers, and make New York an extremely attractive location," said Joel Grossman, vice president for labor relations at Columbia Pictures, who was the producers' chief negotiator with the film union local.
"On behalf of all New Yorkers I welcome the return of movie makers and movie making to the city where they belong," Mayor David N. Dinkins said at a news conference yesterday afternoon. He added that the city would "move forward with an aggressive marketing strategy that will win back this multibillion-dollar industry."
In mail ballots counted yesterday, the rank and file of Local 52 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators voted 801 to 449 to accept the tentative settlement, which was reached on March 18. The 2,000-member union had stunned New York's film community by rejecting the same settlement on April 15 by a vote of 606 to 393.
The union decided to put the proposal to a second vote on April 25 after Local 52 came under intense pressure from members of other film unions and from the president of the union's international, Alfred W. DiTolla.
Walter Stocklin, president of Local 52, said the agreement was accepted "because a lot of our people must have had second thoughts, because if there is no work in the city, it doesn't matter what kind of contract you have."
The April 15 vote had caused a further exodus of feature films from New York, which was shunned by producers who had been planning to shoot movies in the city. In the last month, at least 10 films were steered away from New York City, including "Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune" and "The Babe Ruth Story."
Thanks to yesterday's vote, "Frankie and Johnny," a film starring Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer that spurned New York for California in April, will start shooting in New York next week, said the Mayor's Office for Film, Theater and Broadcast.
"We hope that this vote means that some films will be here in July, and more by late summer," said Amy O. Sultan, an assistant director of the Mayor's film office. "We know a lot of people are anxious to start filming here, but have been holding off until the vote."
She estimated that, as a result of the boycott, the city had lost $100 million worth of film business so far this year.
The agreement offered the film producers money-saving changes in overtime and weekend pay in return for greater health and pension benefits. At the time of last month's rejection of the settlement, many union members had been out of work for as long as five months. But they were opposed to provisions that would have reduced their wages about 30 percent, Mr. Stocklin said.
Local 52 provides behind-the-scenes workers for movies in New York, including sound people, electricians, shop crafts workers, prop people, camera grips and set dressers.
The March agreement was reached in Sherman Oaks, Calif., between the producers and the bargaining committees of Local 52 and another film union, Local 644 of the International Photographers of the Motion Picture and Television Industries. Members of Local 644, film cinematographers and camera crews, had, like members of Local 52, been working without a contract. Local 644 accepted the tentative agreement on May 3 by a vote of 478 to 30.
The major producers involved in the negotiations are five Hollywood studios: Columbia Pictures, the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, Paramount Pictures and Warner Brothers, MGM-United Artists. A sixth, Orion Pictures, participated as a distributor.
 
Local Pressed to Settle
 "I'm delighted that the Local 52 membership has ratified the agreement, and I hope we can put the rancor behind us, and so what we do best -- make movies," said Mr. Grossman of Columbia.
Before the tentative settlement in March, the 19-week stalemate had halted major-studio movie making in New York City. Mayor Dinkins had pressed for a settlement along with the city's film office, the state's film office and the New York Commissioner of Labor, Thomas F. Hartnett, who met with the unions' executive boards.
In 1989, 110 films were shot partly or totally in New York City, the film office reported. In 1990, 139 films were shot in New York City. Since January, 48 feature-film permits, primarily for low-budget movies, have been granted by the film office, compared with 59 by this time last year, many of which were big-budget studio projects.
After Local 52's contract expired on Oct. 31 -- a month after Local 644's contract expired -- the producers promised to steer films away from New York City until an agreement was reached, amounting to a boycott of New York movie making other than independent productions, which have continued.

A Service Is Dropped By Prodigy

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Prodigy, which provides computerized services to nearly a million subscribers, dropped its grocery shopping service on Wednesday in a cost-cutting move that is part of its continuing attempt to become profitable after three years of operation.
One analyst said the cutback of the service, which allowed people to order groceries using their home computer, illustrates Prodigy's problems in creating compelling services for its membership. Several analysts said the company must make further changes in its offerings and rein in costs in order to become profitable. 
 "They are going to have a major cutback," predicted Joshua Harris, president of Jupiter Communications Company, a research firm.
Using home computers and telephone lines, Prodigy Services Company, a joint venture between the International Business Machines Corporation and Sears, Roebuck & Company, connects nearly a million subscribers to games, electronic banking and shopping services. Analysts said I.B.M. and Sears have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Prodigy, buying mainframe computers and hiring 1,200 employees to run the service.
 
Prodigy's Response
 Prodigy charges a flat fee of $12.95 a month to belong to the service, but the bulk of its revenue comes from charging companies to display electronic advertisements along the bottom portion of subscribers' computer screens.
A Prodigy spokesman, Brian Ek, played down the demise of the grocery shopping service. He said the grocery service was halted because it was available in only a limited number of cities and was used by just a fraction of Prodigy's members.
Mr. Ek said the company had spent a "significant amount of money" trying to make the grocery service work, but he declined to be more specific.
D'Agostino Supermarkets in New York had tried the service but dropped out last year, citing delivery problems and a lack of response.
Mr. Ek said Prodigy was on target for achieving profitability in the early 1990's. He said Prodigy's home banking, travel and discount brokerage services are enjoying steady growth.
He added that no other major cutbacks were planned, but said that, "in the current economic environment, everybody is looking for ways to cut costs."
Richard Adler, a long-time Prodigy watcher in San Francisco, said Prodigy needed to make substantial changes in order to become viable. "They have not found the secret of making people buy things through the service."

HEADLINE: With the Royal Visit, Britain Signals a New Reality

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
The appearance of Queen Elizabeth II on Capitol Hill this morning, like her participation in the Bicentennial celebrations in 1976, had the unmistakable whiff of history about it. But it also had a practical, modern purpose: to symbolize and shore up the enduring 20th-century alliance between the two countries, by emphasizing the values, traditions and experiences they share, the latter most recently in the Persian Gulf.
The very setting for the speech was a reminder that Congress, like so many other deliberative bodies, is the offspring of the mother of parliaments in Westminster. The Queen was introduced by Representative Thomas S. Foley, who is called the Speaker of the House, just like the presiding officer in London; she gazed out at legislators who sit in party blocs, also as in London. 
 In case anybody missed the point, she called the two bodies "the twin pillars of our civilizations and the chief among the many treasures we have inherited from our ancestors."
Through all the long history of the American republic, no British sovereign had ever appeared before a joint Congressional session until today. For many and many a year, senators and representatives would hardly have welcomed a speech by a descendant of and successor to George III, the 18th-century king whom Thomas Paine once called "the Royal Brute of Great Britain."
 
'Our Common Enterprise'
 Few if any Americans hold the sins of George III against modern British rulers. Few even recall that most of the Declaration of Independence is directed against him personally ("He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people," it states.)
The Queen spoke of "our common enterprise throughout this turbulent century," making it sound as if the United States and Britain are permanent allies, always on the same side -- as they often are but were not, for example, in the Suez crisis of 1956.
Her words were those of an anonymous draftsman in the British Embassy here, officials said, approved by the Government of Prime Minister John Major, which has every reason to seek to strengthen the ties between London and Washington. They seemed to be loosening quite a lot only a few months ago, with Germany, reunified, assuming an ever more powerful role in an integrated Europe in which Margaret Thatcher's Britain appeared reluctant to play a leading role.
Now Mr. Major, less reluctant about Europe, is in power, central Europe is in some disarray and the German economy looks slightly less awe-inspiring. President Bush, who had described Germany as America's partner in European leadership, has now dispatched Ambassador Raymond Seitz to London. He said in his first interview there that it was "silly" to suggest, as many had, that the special relationship between Britain and the United States was waning.
Obviously Britain would like to keep the new trend going. It has many weapons in its arsenal as it tries to influence American policy and attitudes, and most of them were in use this week -- shared memories of World War II, which the Queen mentioned today, and the grandest ambassadorial residence in Washington, the great brick pile on Massachusetts Avenue designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, where she entertained 1,500 people for tea on Wednesday, and the common language, celebrated at a luncheon at the Library of Congress.
The most potent is the Queen herself. France may have Lafayette, and Germany may have the crucial geopolitical position, but she is arguably the most famous person in the world -- a woman famous not for Andy Warhol's 15 minutes or for 15 years but for almost five decades. She is incalculably wealthy, a living link with the Britain of Chaucer and Shakespeare and Wellington and Churchill, who has herself been privy to the deepest secrets of the West since 1952, when Harry S. Truman lived in the White House and Joseph Stalin lived in the Kremlin.
She created a fuss in Washington this week that no other national leader could match, not even Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the height of Gorbamania, though there is a minority, here as in Britain, that views the whole institution of monarchy as anti-democratic or anachronistic or boring or all three.
 
Building Good Will
 Much of what she did was simple good-will-building, like her visit to a ball game and her trip to Mount Vernon. She deftly managed such unscripted moments as a most irregular hug from a woman whose house she visited and a podium on the White House lawn that made her seem to be wearing a talking hat.
But her celebrity also assures her words a wide audience, so this morning she talked substance. She sent a signal of the new reality, as London sees it, by making two main points about the Atlantic alliance. She asserted, "Britain is at the heart of a growing movement toward greater cohesion in Europe" -- not something she would have said during the Thatcher era -- and argued, "The best progress is made when Europeans and Americans act in concert." Not long ago, she might have said "Britons and Americans."
Finally, she mentioned three points that find their way onto every Western agenda, hoping, evidently, to move them just a little closer to the top of the list: the environment, the importance of the United Nations and the need for greater tolerance among ethnic and cultural groups.
The capital, which prides itself on its world-weariness the way New York prides itself on its aggression, seemed to enjoy it all. Not for the first time: after Elizabeth's first visit in 1951, while she was still a Princess, President Truman wrote to her father that she "went to the hearts of all the citizens of the United States."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Clears Way for Indian Casino

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 16

 BODY:
The last barrier to an Indian tribe opening Connecticut's first gambling casino fell tonight when the state House of Representatives rejected Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s emergency request to repeal the legal basis for the casino, a law allowing nonprofit groups to run "Las Vegas night" fund-raisers.
The 84-to-62 vote preserves the right of schools and church groups to conduct occasional casino nights for fund raising. But it also removes the state's last possible legal avenue to stop the tribe, the Mashantucket Pequot Indians, from building their own profit-making casino on their reservation in Ledyard, in eastern Connecticut.The Pequots have used Federal Indian gaming laws to argue that the state's Las Vegas night statute opened the door to a profit-making casino, and the Federal Court system has agreed.
 
Social Ills Argument
 The United States Supreme Court refused to take the case last month, and Mr. Weicker, arguing that the advent of casino gambling would bring organized crime, prostitution and other social ills to the state, asked shortly afterward that the underlying law be revoked, despite the pain that might be felt by the nonprofit organizations. 
 Repeal, he said, would allow the state at least to try and persuade the Federal Department of the Interior not to issue the final casino approval. Mr. Weicker, an independent governor with no members of his own Connecticut Party in the General Assembly, said in a terse statement after the vote that the House had "decided the appropriateness of casino gambling in the state of Connecticut," and that he would cooperate with the tribe in carrying out operating guidelines from the Federal Government.
The Senate approved the repeal measure last week in an 18-to-17 vote, but the House's reversal today was unquestionably the final step.
Friday marks the last day of a public comment period under which objections to the casino could be forwarded to the Secretary of the Interior, Manuel Lujan Jr.
Even if the repeal had passed, the legislature would have had to suspend its rules to get the legislation to Mr. Weicker's desk in time to make the Federal deadline.
For many lawmakers, it was clearly a painful issue. On questions of economics, morality and the state's quality of life, the vote divided conservatives and liberals alike. There was also an emotionally articulated issue of race and justice: that repealing the law and blocking the casino at the last second would be a slap at Indians everywhere.
"One of the things that will never be rectified is what we have done to the Indians," said Representative Edna Negron, a Democrat from Hartford who opposed the repeal bill. "It's an issue of justice. They went through the process. They went through the courts. They did it right, they won."
Some of those seeking repeal tried to evoke the issue of Connecticut's quality of life, describing in detail the sordid characters and practices that surround gambling centers in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Others portrayed the vote as an opportunity for the state to reassert its autonomy in the face of a Federal court system that they argued had overreached itself in clearing the path for the Indians.
Some lawmakers said they would vote for repeal even if they felt it would make no difference, simply to make their voice heard against the idea of casino gambling.
"I would prefer to go down kicking and screaming all the way," said Representative Sally Bolster, a Republican from Rowayton who voted for the bill.
The tribe, which has about 200 members, has already broken ground for the casino complex on its 1,800-acre reservation in Ledyard about an hour from the capital. Tribal officials said the casino plus the hotels and restaurants to be built in conjunction, would employ almost 2,000 people, and could open as early as this fall.
They also projected that it could bring as many as 500,000 tourists to a part of the state that is heavily dependent on defense spending and battered by the recession and by recent cutbacks in defense contracts. Local business groups in southeastern Connecticut have also endorsed the casino specifically in part because it will help diversify the economy.

HEADLINE: Debt Issue By Chrysler

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation yesterday priced $400 million in floating-rate certificates backed by loans of its auto dealers, through underwriters led by Bear, Stearns & Company.
The certificates, which were priced at 99.75, pay interest monthly at 25 basis points above the one-month London interbank offered rate. The Libor rate, as it is known, is the basic short-term rate of interest in the Eurodollar market and the rate to which many Eurodollar loans and deposits are tied. Eurodollars are United States dollars held in banks outside the United States. 
 Traders had speculated that the certificates would probably float at 23 basis points over the one-month Libor. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The certificates are being sold as Carco Auto Loan 1991-1 by the Chrysler Auto Receivables Company and have an average life of 3.3 years and an expected maturity of Dec. 15, 1994, and a legal maturity of June 15, 1996.
Part of the financing includes some subordinated class B certificates that are backing the class A issue, as a cushion against losses.
Underwriters said the issue had been rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service, the Standard & Poor's Corporation, Duff & Phelps and Fitch Investors Service.

HEADLINE: New Unemployment Claims Up Slightly in Early May

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
The number of people filing their first claims for unemployment benefits rose a slight 4,000 in the week ended May 4, to 459,000, the Labor Department said today.
While the small increase was a sign the job market may be stabilizing, economists said the report also showed a recovery that was far from robust.
The only states that showed a significant deterioration in the job market were California, where the recession has arrived more recently, and Iowa.
 
Layoffs at Deere
 The department said California processed 3,660 new claims for jobless benefits in the week ended May 4 because of retrenchment in the retail, entertainment, aerospace and manufacturing sectors.
Layoffs at a Deere & Company subsidiary in Dubuque, Iowa, pushed up that state's new claims by 2,900, the department said.
The increases were offset by fewer first-time claims in some of the Middle Atlantic States and the Midwest, which had contributed to the sharp rises in unemployment claims in recent months.
The number of people receiving unemployment benefits expanded more sharply, showing that those already claiming benefits are staying on the lists longer.
The department said 3.5 million people were receiving state unemployment benefits in the week ended April 27, the latest period for which the figure was available, a 38,000 increase from the previous week.
"The claims data tell us that the rate of layoffs has slowed, but people are still getting laid off," said Matthew Alexy, an economist at Deutsche Bank.
But Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said there was some cause for optimism because the small increase in initial claims came after a big decline in the previous week. Initial claims fell 45,000 for the week ended April 27.
Cindy Ambler, an analyst at the Employment and Training Administration, said a decline in continued claims for unemployment benefits usually lagged behind any drop in first-time claims as a recovery began.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
The Industry Tries to Laugh in the Face of Hard Times

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

DATELINE: WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS , W.Va.

 BODY:
THE leaders of the country's advertising industry might not be smiling through the apocalypse, but as their annual meeting continues here they are trying at least to chuckle their way through their two recessions.
Loud laughter greeted John O'Toole, president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, when at yesterday's general session he quoted from a spoof of graduation speeches by Woody Allen. "More than any other time in history mankind faces a crossroads. One path leads to despair and utter hopelessness. The other to total extinction. Let us pray we have the wisdom to choose correctly." 
 Despite that good humor, association members interviewed at the meeting are still expressing concern over the recessions -- the nation's, in its 10th month, and their industry's, in its third year.
"Over all, you couldn't say you see any improvement coming," said Richard (Bink) Garrison, chairman and chief executive of Ingalls, Quinn & Johnson, in Boston. While "a lot of our national business is up minimally," he said, citing clients like the clothing retailer T. J. Maxx and the CVS drugstore chain, what are missing are new opportunities that would stimulate increases in ad spending the way computer and other high-technology companies did in the 1980's.
In New England, "we're still looking for our next engine of growth," Mr. Garrison added.
"I see a lot of folks continuing to hang back," said Robert Kroyer, president of Ketchum Advertising USA, Pittsburgh. "Instead of looking forward, they're looking over their shoulders." Even so, Mr. Kroyer said he was now starting to glimpse "glimmers of light on the horizon . . . glimmers that weren't there before." Among them are campaigns Ketchum has created for two large clients' product introductions: a personal computer from the Digital Equipment Corporation and the Vigor luxury car from Honda's Acura division.
The Vigor campaign in particular heartens Mr. Kroyer because it is being rolled out "full steam ahead, no cuts, in spite of the down auto market and the down economy," he said.
Also sounding optimistic was Sam Chisholm, president and chief executive of the Mingo Group, New ork. "I'm hoping this will begin to remedy itself in six or eight months," he said. "If we have the year we are anticipating, we will end the year on a good note." While Mr. Chisholm's agency's clients, like the General Motors Corporation and the Miller Brewing Company, are maintaining their advertising budgets, he said, "it's an interesting thing to see how clients are spending." He went on: "Normally, a client comes in and says, 'Here's your budget for the year.' Now, they're parceling out the budget on a quarter-by-quarter basis."
One of the most cheerful executives was Pat McGrath, president of Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor, New York, perhaps because on Wednesday his agency was selected as one of the six finalists on Subaru of America's review of the company's $60 million account.
"My feeling is that the economy has reached bottom and is about to turn around," Mr. McGrath said. "All of the excesses that characterized the incredible 80's, all of the fat, have been squeezed out. I see slow but steady growth, so I'm optimistic right now."
Also squeezed out has been a sizable chunk of the attendance at the group's 73d annual meeting. Registrations, usually a reliable barometer of the industry's economic outlook, plunged to around 420, from 627 last year and 670 in 1989.
If misery loves company, those attending will be reassured to learn that the annual meetings of many other trade associations are suffering through a similar slump. For example, attendance at the American Newspaper Publishers Association's annual convention last week in Vancouver, British Columbia, was reported to have dropped to fewer than 1,500 from 2,176 in 1990.
Also reassuring were some unscripted remarks in Mr. O'Toole's address yesterday. While there are "unique and frightening aspects" to the current economic uncertainties, "this is not the end of the world," he said, adding, "This, too, shall pass."

HEADLINE: SOVIET REPUBLICS ARE SAID TO AGREE ON CRISIS PROGRAM

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 16

 BODY:
The Soviet Government announced today that 13 of the nation's 15 republics had agreed on the details of an emergency plan to steer the nation out of economic crisis. The plan includes a new effort to ban strikes, budget cuts and fresh assurances for skeptical foreign investors.
"We let down many of our partners and punished ourselves most of all," said Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov, who resolved to revive the tattered economy now that greater agreement had been reached with most of the balky, sovereignty-minded republics. 
 He said only Georgia and Estonia did not take part in this week's negotiations. Even independence-minded Lithuania found the talks inviting enough to retain "observer" status, he said.
 
Wage Increases Planned
 Details are not expected to be published until next week, and while Soviet officials at a news conference conceded that past plans had gone awry, they insisted that this one was different for the level of input from the republics.
[The Soviet economy faces a decline in output of 10 percent, an inflation rate exceeding 100 percent and a "radically worse" year, American intelligence agencies say. Page A6.]
Soviet officials promised fast steps toward building economic credibility. Among those are an executive order with a strong strike ban counterbalanced by a plan for wage increases tied to higher worker productivity in some industries, including energy, chemical and metals. Manufacturers would have greater freedom to sell a minor part of their products on the open market.
 
Sensitive Issue of Strikes
 The banning of strikes is especially sensitive. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has already sought to outlaw them by decree, only to find his wishes ignored. Siberian coal miners recently ended a two-month stoppage that left equipment badly damaged, along with the President's prestige.
As described by Mr. Pavlov, the present state of the consensus plan does not answer critical questions like how the nation might deal with the privatization of property as the underpinning of a move to a market economy. He said the parties had agreed to begin in some fashion with properties at the republic level.
But the negotiations at least signaled progress, if only in terms of basic planning and common resolve, on the heels of the "dacha summit" compromise of last month, when President Gorbachev reached a surprise agreement with most of the republic leaders over an outline for economic planning and power sharing. Mr. Pavlov conceded that the past year had seen a cascade of economic disasters, including the mine strike and the Government's failure to meet international trade payments.
"Our left hand reached further than our right one," he said, vowing fast repairs, including accelerated parliamentary approval next week of a multinational measure to reassure foreign investors by guaranteeing protection of their investments here and repatriation of their profits.
Economic officials also said the new plan, whose precise timetable was not announced, would demonstrate fresh resolve by aiming for a 30 percent cut in the central Government's administrative budget and by speeding plans to convert the defense industry to civilian uses and permit share-holding and outside investment.
"The defense complex cannot exist as an oasis when the entire country is moving in another direction," said Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Scherbakov. He referred to the military-industrial complex, long tied to Communist Party hard-liners, that is fighting to maintain its cold-war-era dominance.
 
A More Flexible Attitude
 Prime Minister Pavlov, considered something of an alumnus of that hard-line school, clearly sought to display a more flexible attitude than he showed a few months ago on taking office. Then, he alarmed international investors by talking of a capitalist plot to destroy the ruble.
Today, he talked much more of free-market hope, saying the Government's more ambitious plans envisioned an elaborate swap of Soviet energy resources for farm technology within a pan-European plan. He also repeated the Kremlin's ambition to have a role at the annual summit meeting of economic powers.
Mr. Scherbakov said other features of the plan included strengthening the battered ruble internally by backing it with state buildings, land and other properties, as well as shrinking the Kremlin ministries that long have ruled the nation's life.
Elsewhere, Kremlin officials were repeating today the goal of making the ruble strong enough to be floated within two years on the world market. But Prime Minister Pavlov eschewed such timetables as guaranteeing "the free market by next Christmas," saying the task was too complex.
Mr. Pavlov insisted that the negotiations contradicted skeptics' doubts that Mr. Gorbachev's Government changes were strong enough to produce an effective plan for economic resurrection.
"Today, the joint agreement of the Union and the republic governments is a reality," he declared, saying that after rounds of negotiations by deputy ministers, the final basic decisions had been settled by the national Government's Council of Ministers.
The council is the new advisory panel created by Mr. Gorbachev to allow the republics a greater voice in Kremlin decisions. The council's final few issues, Mr. Scherbakov said, included determining that there should be financial and credit policy for the nation at large, rather than a principle to be specified differently by each republic.
Also agreed to, he said, was that there should be a federal system of taxation and that the privatization issue was to focus initally on industries "that should be under the republics."
It was noted of this latter question that the republics include a crosscurrent of views on this most sensitive area of Communist hegemony and that some republic representatives are outright opposed to denationalization of properties.
Speaking of bolstering the invitation for foreign investment, Mr. Pavlov said: "We are not naive people. Of course investors need some profits." He added, however, that this "should be a mutually beneficial action."
President Gorbachev made the same point on Wednesday in declaring that the nation would not be a "Klondike" waiting to be stripped by foreign investors. Once the plan is finally set, presumably with the publication next week and a final blessing from Mr. Gorbachev, it faces consideration in the Parliament, where the concern will be over possible pain to the Soviet public.

Soviet Emigration Bill Fails Again
 MOSCOW, May 16 (Reuters) -- The Soviet Parliament failed today for the third time in a week to approve a key emigration bill giving most citizens a right to travel abroad.
Approval of the law -- viewed as important in insuring Soviet compliance with international human rights agreements -- has been made a condition for United States granting of most-favored-nation trade benefits and credit guarantees to the Soviet Union.
The bill fell two votes short of what was required in one of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet. The vote was to approve the law in principle and have details of putting it into effect worked out by the Government.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Rose by 6.2 Percent in April

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
The Government said today that builders increased construction of new homes and apartments by 6.2 percent in April, a report seen by analysts as evidence that the housing industry is making an erratic, rather than brisk, recovery from the recession.
"It's kind of staggering along," said David F. Seiders, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders. "Hopefully, it will smooth out, but it will be a gradual affair." 
 Martin Regalia, an economist with the National Council of Savings Institutions, concurred. "There may be some months where it doesn't improve or actually declines a little bit," he said. "But, in general, we'll see a gradual improvement throughout the year."
The Commerce Department said housing starts totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 957,000, up from 901,000 in March.
Most analysts believe the housing recession bottomed in January, when starts plunged 12.8 percent, to an 847,000 annual rate. That was the lowest level since construction plummeted to an 843,000 rate in the previous recession in January 1982.
While construction rebounded 17.1 percent in February, it fell 9.2 percent in March.
"We're convinced that January was the low, but we're off to an erratic start to the recovery," Mr. Seiders said.
Applications for building permits, an indicator of future activity, fell 3 percent in April, to an annual rate of 865,000, after rising the previous two months. But applications for single-family homes, which represent 75 percent of the housing industry, edged up seven-tenths of a percent.
Sales of new homes also rose in both February and March, the department reported earlier, and Thomas Holloway, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, said that should stimulate more starts.
 
Weakness in Multifamily Sector
 But applications for multifamily buildings fell 15.8 percent, reflecting high vacancy rates in some parts of the country as well as an inability by builders to obtain financing, analysts said.
Construction of single-family houses shot up 5.7 percent in April, to a 778,000 rate, nearly erasing a 6.6 percent loss a month earlier.
Multifamily housing starts were up 8.5 percent, to a 41,000 rate. But starts of buildings with five or more units slipped seven-tenths of a percent, to 138,000 -- the lowest level since the department began keeping records in 1963. Apartment construction plummeted 19.1 percent in March.
 
25.3% Gain in West
 In the West, starts increased 25.3 percent, to a rate of 238,000, wiping out a 12 percent loss in March. In the Midwest, starts were up 3.1 percent, to 231,000 units. In the South, starts rose eight-tenths of a percent, to 392,000 units.
But in the Northeast, construction fell 2 percent, to a 96,000 rate. The Northeast has been the weakest region for some time.

HEADLINE: Dow Climbs 28.63 Points, To 2,894.01

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Buyers moved back into the stock market yesterday to pick up a few bargains, with Wall Street apparently concluding that it had overreacted the day before to the bad news from Compaq Computer.
Trading, though, was slow, and some technology stocks gave further ground. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which slid 21.47 points on Wednesday, rebounded 28.63 yesterday, to 2,894.01.
 
Volume Posts a Decline
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange dropped to a weak 154.5 million shares, from 193.1 million the previous day. But advances led declines by almost 2 to 1.
More important, the Nasdaq composite, which sank the equivalent of more than 60 Dow points on Wednesday, recovered a third of the loss yesterday.
The selloff started when Compaq, the big producer of personal computers, said its second-quarter profits would drop to less than a fourth of the year before.
Compaq had plunged 13 1/4 in heavy trading on Wednesday and dragged the rest of the market down with it. By yesterday, though, investors thought better of the entire technology group and began nibbling again.
 
Compaq Stock Most Active
 Compaq, the most active Big Board stock again yesterday, fell 1/4, to 35 3/4, with 7.2 million shares changing hands. During the day it traded between 37 7/8 and 34 3/8.
The Compaq news, said Peter J. Canelo, chief investment strategist for County NatWest Securities in New Work, "created a panic in Intel, Sun Microsystems, Microsoft, Borland and others that went down more than they should have."
Unlike Compaq or Apple, which previously forecast weak profits, these stocks, he said, were "not likely to be hurt as much."
Moreover, Mr. Canelo said, "investors have sold down these stocks to where they have more than adequately discounted the foreseeable earnings risk."
Even so, Intel, which dropped 4 on Wednesday, fell 3/4 in heavy trading yesterday, to 48 1/2. Sun Microsystems, which fell 2, slid 7/8 more, to 34. Borland, which fell 3, declined 2 1/2 more, to 44 1/2, and Microsoft, which fell 3 1/4, actually recovered 1 3/8, to 99 3/8.
While other technology stocks continued to weaken, the overall tone of the technology market was upbeat. The Pacific Stock Exchange's high-tech index of the top 100 technology stocks in the country rose nearly 1 percent.
Among them, I.B.M. rose 1 3/8, to 104 1/8, after losing 3 1/4 on Wednesday. Hewlett-Packard, which had lost 1 3/4, rose 2, to 48. Trading in both was heavy.
Commenting on Hewlett-Packard, which reported a 25 percent jump in profits for the April quarter, Laszlo Birinyi Jr., president of Birinyi Associates, said it was "a good piece of news and showed that the technology weakness is not consistent, that it's not a one-way street for technology stocks."
As for I.B.M., he called the recovery "another piece of good news," representing "real buying, rather than sellers stepping away."
Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said program buying continued strong and lifted the Dow 20 points.
County NatWest's Mr. Canelo said the selloff in technology stocks reflected "a stall in the economy -- it isn't going down but it isn't recovering as fast as people hoped."
He noted that several economic indicators had started "a nice recovery into the first days of this quarter," but had subsequently fallen.
He speculated, though, that the "technology slaughter," as he put it, might not cut prices more than an additional 5 percent, which, he felt, might bring the Dow industrials down to around 2,850, below which the index has not fallen since early March.
Drug and biotechnology stocks also advanced. Amgen rose 3 1/2, to 119 1/2; Centocor 2, to 61 3/4; Chiron 1 1/2, to 50.

HEADLINE: Sea Turtles Put New Friction In U.S.-Japan Trade Quarrels

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
With its hooked beak, scaly neck and stubby legs, the yard-long hawksbill sea turtle will win no beauty contests. But this homely creature, an endangered vestige of the dinosaur age, is suddenly at the center of a squall in United States-Japanese relations.
It does not have the grace of a dolphin, the majesty of a whale or the mournful appeal of a baby harp seal. But the hawksbill may well prompt the first use of an American law authorizing curbs on imports of fish and other wildlife products from countries that contribute to the disappearance of an endangered species.
 
Sanctions Seem Near
 Barring a last-minute breakthrough in negotiations, President Bush is likely to inform Congress by Sunday that the United States will impose trade sanctions on Japan for the sake of this rare turtle, senior Administration officials said today. It would be the first time the United States has used trade sanctions to help protect an endangered species. 
 About 2,000 people in Japan are employed in a $125 million-a-year cottage industry that fashions expensive eyeglass frames, combs and jewelry from imported hawksbill shell, inaccurately known as tortoise shell. The raw material for these products is often gathered by ripping the shells from living turtles that are being slowly barbecued alive.
The dispute over trying to persuade these people to abandon their livelihood has highlighted the difficulties of accommodating environmental concerns in international trade.
Imposing sanctions on Japan to help large green reptiles with lustrous shells is a relatively easy political move for the Bush Administration. It wins friends in the environmental movement, costs no money, shows toughness on trade and cannot be labeled protectionist because the United States does not have a tortoise-shell industry.
It is illegal in the United States to sell tortoise-shell products made from hawksbill turtles. Plastic substitutes are commonly used.
Members of the Economic Policy Council, a Cabinet-level panel composed of President Bush's inner circle on economic issues, have already reviewed the question of the turtle, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said. "They've decided absolutely that these sanctions will go into place" unless Japan agrees to close the industry quickly, he said.
A Japanese official in Washington said that no negotiations were under way, but that ways to avoid the sanctions were being explored informally.
Mr. Mosbacher said in a brief interview this morning that progress had been made, particularly this week, but not enough yet to avoid sanctions. Regardless of the Economic Policy Council's recommendation, the final decision would be up to President Bush, who has expressed no opinion.
The sanctions would impose duties on or ban imports of some or all fish and other wildlife products from Japan. There has been speculation in Washington that high duties might be placed on Japanese products that use wild pearls. Administration officials today declined to discuss what form any sanctions might take.
American imports of Japanese fish totaled $353.8 million last year, the Commerce Department says, and imports of other wildlife products were far smaller.
 
Centered in Nagasaki
 Most of the hawksbill-shell workers are in Nagasaki prefecture, and they have passionately opposed all attempts by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry to shrink or eliminate their industry, said a Japanese official who spoke on condition that he not be identified.
"Some people told the MITI people that this was a second atomic bomb that the Americans are dropping" on Nagasaki, the official added.
But in the United States, turtles are becoming popular, and that has limited the Administration's room to maneuver. A recently published comic book depicts the Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles traveling back in time to confront a "Cap'n Mossback," who uses the good ship Sir Commerce to net many sea turtles.
Populations of hawksbill sea turtles are found in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and in warm parts of the Atlantic. Michael J. Bean, a senior attorney in the Washington office of the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund, said the species would face extinction early in the next century if no action was taken.
Japanese negotiators have already made a significant concession by agreeing that the tortoise-shell industry in Japan must be closed instead of simply made smaller, the Japanese official said. But while Japan wants to phase out imports over four or five years, the United States wants them eliminated by early next year.
The harvesting of hawksbill turtles is often cruel, said Dr. Michael W. Klemens, a specialist in turtles at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. People in developing countries commonly net or spear the turtles, or gather them on land.
Turtles caught in nets are dumped on their backs on ships' decks to keep them from crawling away. "Sea turtles in general, when they're put on their backs, tend to gasp and sigh because they are heavy and have trouble breathing," Dr. Klemens said.
The turtles also appear to be weeping. Special glands near the eyes secrete liquid to protect the eyeball from salt water. These glands continue working when the turtle is out of water.
The live turtles are placed on burning coals and heated until their top and bottom shells become malleable enough to rip off. The naked living turtle is then thrown back into the water in the belief that it will regrow its shell and can be harvested again.
But turtle shells do not regenerate, and turtles that have lost their shells typically die in a few weeks from infections, Dr. Klemens said.
In dealing with products from endangered species, environmental policy makers constantly face the choice of whether to attack the demand or the supply. Much of the hawksbill hunting now is the direct result of merchants seeking shells in poor countries for shipment to Japan, so American officials have focused their attention on Japan.
 
Some Restrictions in Place
 The Japanese Government is already restricting imports of the shells. The Government authorized the importation of 20 tons of hawksbill turtle shells for a 12-month period ending in July, but is not issuing enough import quotas to allow even this amount to enter Japan, the Japanese official said.
For the next 12-month period, beginning on Aug. 1, Japan will allow imports of only five tons.
American officials have expressed impatience with the Japanese Government's reluctance to take actions that would put 2,000 people out of work. Imports of Japanese goods to the United States have caused the closing of entire American factories with many more employees, said a Commerce Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"They say, 'We can't just displace these people,' " he said. "We say, 'Yes, you can.' "
On March 20, Mr. Mosbacher and Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. certified that Japan was contributing to the disappearance of an endangered species. Under the law authorizing import restrictions on such countries, if President Bush decides to impose sanctions he must inform Congress of that within 60 days of the certification. This time limit expires on Sunday.
The United States has certified six countries on five occasions under the terms of the law, which was enacted in 1974, Mr. Bean of the Environmental Defense Fund said. All of the instances involved whaling, and in each case the nation involved made concessions rather than face sanctions.

HEADLINE: Bank Loans Still Tight But Less So

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
The ability of business borrowers to get loans from banks worsened in the latest three months but the credit-tightening was "considerably less" than in the preceding quarters, the Federal Reserve reported today.
Financing of commercial and residential real estate showed a similar pattern. And banks said they had stopped making it harder to obtain consumer loans. 
 The findings of the Fed's quarterly survey of senior lending officers suggested that the worst of the so-called credit crunch was over and that loans might soon start to become more freely available and less costly than they had been for the last year or so.
 
'Softening' Is Seen
 "We are beginning to see signs," Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Senate Finance Committee today, "that while the crunch is not easing, it's reached its maximum and there is some evidence that we may not be too far from a basic softening in it."
He added, however, that until this occurred a lack of adequate credit availability remained "our major problem."
The Fed has moved repeatedly this year to inject more money into the financial system, pushing down interest rates, but banks have been generally reluctant to lend the money because of heavy losses on earlier bad loans and because of a need to rebuild capital. At the same time, the recession that began in July has thinned the ranks of creditworthy borrowers.
As the credit tightening wanes, however, Mr. Greenspan predicted that even rates on consumer loans, like auto loans, which are costly for banks to administer, will come down and help stimulate economic recovery.
The Fed's quarterly survey of lending officers, released shortly after Mr. Greenspan spoke, showed that only 9, or 15 percent, of the 60 domestic banks surveyed had tightened standards or loan terms for large borrowers during the three months ended in early May. The other 51 banks reported that their lending policies were unchanged, and no banks were listed as either easing somewhat or easing considerably.
 
A Steady Decline
 The 15 percent listed as tightening was down from 35 percent in the three months ended in January and from 50 percent in the period that ended in Octber.
The pattern was similar for medium-sized business borrowers, but for small ones, those with annual sales of less than $50 million, only 9 percent of banks were making credit harder to get in the latest period.
The slowing pace of tightening was even more evident at branches of foreign banks, with only 28 percent of them reporting stricter lending standards, compared with 89 percent in the January survey. Still, relatively more foreign banks reported tightening than did domestic banks.
The Fed said the diminished amount of credit restriction at American banks might be related to the recent improvement in the banks' ability to raise both debt and equity capital. Of those banks that did tighten credit availability in the current survey, "virtually none mentioned pressures on capital positions or deteriorating loan portfolios as a reason."
Earlier, these had been a factor, along with the primary reasons still being cited of "concerns about the economic outlook" in general and problems with specific industries.
Looking only at tightened loan terms -- as opposed to the turning away of borrowers considered overly risky -- the change from previous periods was not as pronounced, the Fed reported.
 
Other Sources of Loans
 The Fed survey also found that as previously potential borrowers who felt the brunt of tightening moves commonly ended up obtaining money either from another bank or, depending on the borrower's size, in the credit markets or from finance companies. Only when these other sources failed did companies cut back, postpone or cancel their spending plans.
For commercial real estate, a fourth of domestic banks tightened standards for construction and land-development loans in the latest three months, down from half in the January period and two-thirds in October, the survey showed. On residential mortgages, a fifth of the banks reported tightening compared with a third in January, even as demand for mortgages climbed.
The willingness to make consumer loans was about unchanged in the latest period, compared with banks being "somewhat less willing" in January.

HEADLINE: Dinkins and the 'Invader';
His Fear of State Control Prompts Debate: Would Fiscal Intervention Be Good or Bad?

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
For months, Mayor David N. Dinkins has said New York City must keep its budget balanced at all costs -- including cuts in city services that he calls unthinkable -- to avoid sharing control of its spending with a little- understood state board that he describes as if it were an alien invader.
 The villain Mr. Dinkins despises is the Financial Control Board, which was created to oversee the city's finances in the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's and which has now receded to an advisory role. But the board would reimpose binding, sometimes sweeping, powers to approve spending if the city ended the year with a deficit of $100 million or more; or if it could no longer borrow money in the bond markets; or if the board decided that such things were about to happen. 
 As the city's fiscal problems have deepened and Mr. Dinkins has had trouble persuading a panoply of players to cooperate, a debate has developed over whether a return to power by the control board would be good or bad -- and for whom. At the heart of the issue is a not too subtle argument over whether the city's problems are so severe that Mr. Dinkins simply cannot solve them alone but should share the burdens and the blame.
Mr. Dinkins fiercely resists the idea. He explained why last week: "We give up on the dreams we hold so dear, effectively permitting others we do not elect -- individuals who are not accountable to us -- to do our dreaming for us. To me, that is simply unacceptable."
But if some see the control board as the enemy, its advocates say the enemy is "us." Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is the chairman of the board, but Mr. Dinkins sits on it, along with the city and state comptrollers and three private citizens appointed by the Governor.
 
Some Pros, Some Cons
 In general, the board could not make Mr. Dinkins do anything that he would not have to do to avoid its intervention (which is why its supporters say intervention would not be so bad). Nor could the board let the Mayor do much that he could not do by himself (which is why he says it is unnecessary).
The board could hold the city's spending within fixed limits, but it would not tell Mr. Dinkins what to cut or where. It would have power to approve future labor settlements, but not to undo those already reached. It could not allow the city to have a budget that is out of balance.
As it is, the city has flexibility to take extraordinary actions, though if it took them, it might wind up inviting control by the board.
 
'It Is Not Saddam Hussein'
 For example, the city could argue in the middle of a year that balancing a budget would cause a "material adverse impact on the delivery of essential services." But if it failed to balance the budget by the end of the year, it could fall under the board's control.
The city could float short-term notes to spread a deficit from year to year, but if it sought to finance an operating deficit of $100 million or more, it would invite control by the board.
"It is not Saddam Hussein," Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation and an architect of the city's recovery from the last fiscal crisis, said of the Financial Control Board. "I think the F.C.B. could be a very useful tool on the Mayor as leverage on the state to get more committed to the city."
On the other hand, Richard Ravitch, chairman of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by business, said: "The control board can't produce money, and the control board does not replace the Mayor as chief executive of the city. The existence of the control board simply means that the governor and the two comptrollers become implicated in the major spending and borrowing decisions that the city makes. It's a political issue. I don't think it changes the economics one iota."
Precisely because it is a political issue, it is explosive, laden with everything from Mr. Dinkins's racial sensibilities to Mr. Cuomo's Presidential prospects.
The mere suggestion that the board reimpose control implies a skepticism about Mr. Dinkins's abilities that he understandably resists, his aides say, seeing it as usurpation of his stewardship and a profound blow to his position as the city's first black Mayor.
Mr. Cuomo, City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman and State Comptroller Edward V. Regan -- while sniping at Mr. Dinkins's management of the city from the sidelines -- are just as reluctant to be drawn further into its troubles. Mr. Cuomo repeatedly says he favors "cooperation, not control," thereby reminding the world that control is always a possibility.
"My opinion, as strong as I can make it to you, you cannot have a control period without first admitting failure," Mr. Cuomo said yesterday.
 
State No Paragon
 With the state having practiced for years the sort of sloppy fiscal management that it bars the city from indulging in, Mr. Dinkins resents the idea that the Governor and state are in any position to tell him how to behave.
"One can be very sympathetic with the Mayor's view that the state's fiscal behavior has been much worse than the city's," Mr. Rohatyn said. "And I can understand that the symbolism is very distasteful to the Mayor, and I can understand his political concern about it."
At the same time some of the Governor's aides and advisers muse privately on the merits of a period of control, though not over the Mayor's objections.
"Unless the Mayor takes the lead, everyone else has to stand back," one person close to the Governor said. "I think what everybody's doing is trying to see if they can help the Mayor do it without control. He's hellbent on avoiding it."

HEADLINE: REVIEW/ART;
How Jewish Artists Found Their Place in New York

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
To a considerable degree, "Painting a Place in America" is a recapitulation of the history of early 20th-century art in New York City. In this sense, it tells a remarkable story.
The show, at the Jewish Museum in its temporary quarters at the New-York Historical Society, celebrates the work of Jewish artists from the turn of the century to the end of the Second World War. Having arrived, many of them, as part of the huge waves of Eastern European emigrants who settled here between 1881 and 1924, these Jewish artists did not take long to secure places in the city's fledgling modernist art scene. Among them were Max Weber, Abraham Walkowitz, Louise Nevelson, Ben Shahn and Mark Rothko. 
 Almost 150 paintings, sculptures, prints and drawings by these and 45 other artists, encompassing almost every major style of the period, are brought together for this ambitious, flawed, but ultimately inspiring exhibition. The works have been arranged by Norman L. Kleeblatt, curator of collections at the museum, and Susan Chevlowe, curatorial assistant, to highlight the activities of five Jewish art organizations in which these artists participated -- the Educational Alliance, the People's Art Guild, the Jewish Art Center, the Yiddisher Kultur Farband and the Ten.
This has made for a confusing and rambling display, not least because the artistic distinctions between these organizations are sometimes difficult to fathom. Many of the artists are represented by minor achievements and early works completed while studying at places like the Educational Alliance.
Yet in one important regard the meandering quality of "Painting a Place in America" serves the show's central theme by making evident the diversity and open-mindedness of Jewish culture in New York. When the Educational Alliance was founded in 1889 to "Americanize" the Jewish population on the city's Lower East Side, its progressive agenda promoted accessible realism of the Ash Can School variety yet was willing to embrace not only Walkowitz's French-inspired abstractions that were among the earliest modernist works by an American artist, but also Nevelson's Picasso-like abstractions.
And when the People's Art Guild was founded in 1915 to disseminate art to the masses and promote Jewish culture, it did not prescribe any particular style. Everything from William Meyerowitz's self-portrait, with its strange Expressionistic coloration, to William Zorach's Cubistic "Roof Playground" was promoted by the guild.
Only with the Yiddisher Kultur Farband, a branch of the Popular Front that was created by the Communist Party, did the works tend to toe the particular artistic line of Social Realism while still tolerating a plurality of styles. Indeed, if anything can be said to characterize the nature of Jewish art in the early part of the century, it is the liberalism and political involvement that became most fervent with the Yiddisher Kultur Farband during the 1930's.
The section devoted to that organization and a related section on wartime Jewish art provide several of the exhibition's memorable works. These include Arnold Friedman's "Unemployable," whose crisp realism recalls Northern Renaissance portraiture, and Aaron J. Goodelman's carved wood abstraction called "Kultur," which elegantly links the oppression of blacks and the plight of Jews in Germany.
The show is also a reminder of the accomplishments of artists like Morton Schamberg and Joseph Solman, and of less familiar aspects in the careers of better-known painters and sculptors. How many viewers would guess that the depiction of a bespectacled man in the show's final gallery is a Rothko self-portrait of 1936? Yet, once identified, it is tempting to see intimations of the artist's mature abstractions in the washes of paint and the broad areas of color that suffice to define his figure.
Rothko's encounters with anti-Semitism played a role in his work. But when he and several other artists banded together in 1935 to form the Ten, and to advocate modern art, the coincidence of their Jewishness went largely unremarked, even among themselves. Such was the measure of how rapidly Jewish artists had become assimilated.
Whether, and to what extent, assimilation was desirable remained a subject of debate in Jewish cultural groups, and this is one of the topics that makes "Painting a Place in America" timely. The show comes at a time when the issue of multi-culturalism has refueled discussions about ethnic and racial distinctions in art.
Throughout the early years of this century there were disagreements about what, if anything, was "Jewish" about Jewish art, about whether describing an artist in terms of his Jewishness ghettoized that artist, about the responsibility of Jewish artists to their community and about how to respond to racism. The same kind of issues occupy discussions of work by minority artists today. And to be put in mind of artists during the 1930's and 40's making political art and railing against what they considered to be the commercialism of the galleries is, in particular, to sense that history travels in circles.
Raphael Soyer provides the exhibition's most endearing work, a rendition from 1926 of his immigrant parents watching two of their children awkwardly learning to dance Western style. As an expression of the acculturation process that within so few decades turned Eastern European Jews into quintessential New Yorkers, "The Dancing Lesson" is also the show's emblematic painting.
"Painting a Place in America: Jewish Artists in New York, 1900-1945" remains at the Jewish Museum at the New-York Historical Society, 77th Street and Central Park West, through Sept. 29.

HEADLINE: Prejudice Is Still a Fact of Life for Blacks;
Marketers Miss

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In 1986 I wrote a marketing research presentation, "Black Power: Color It Green," which documented the economic clout blacks had attained in the marketplace. "When Blacks Shop, Bias Often Accompanies Sale" (front page, April 30) demonstrates that the presentation is still required reading.
Economically, the private sector has remained largely closed to blacks as an avenue for economic upward mobility. However, the public sector has provided a financial ladder for blacks to climb with staff positions in assistance, job training and educational programs. Renewed financing rests on continuing the public's perception that a high percentage of blacks are poor. 
 The unfortunate consequence of this is that America's marketers have discounted the black market. The Asian and Cuban stereotypes of industriousness and wealth have produced carefully crafted, precisely targeted advertising campaigns for upscale goods and services directed at these niches; in stark contrast the reinforced perception of blanket black poverty has resulted in product managers' turning a cold shoulder to the community, with the notorious exceptions of cheap wine, tobacco and "we'll tote the note" car dealerships.
I congratulate The Times for exposing racist attitudes against blacks; but the community must ask its leadership, "Why do you persist in presenting our lacks instead of our luster?"

HEADLINE: In Retail, It's Perilous at the Top

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Frank Doroff, the chairman of Bonwit Teller stores, yesterday became one more merchant without a store. After spending more than half his life in retailing, he will be on the outside looking in, probably wondering which fork in the road proved the wrong one.
After five years of takeovers, shake-ups, slow sales and now recession, retail chains have set adrift hundreds of Frank Doroffs. And continuing consolidation and store failures guarantee that more will follow. 
 Consider the latest victims:
When rivals took too big a bite out of his market, Frank Arnone, the Marshalls chairman, lost his job. After the Dayton Hudson Corporation bought Marshall Field & Company of Chicago, Burnett W. Donoho, the president of Fields, was told he was no longer needed. Bankruptcies claimed the jobs of Peter Hollis, chairman of Ames Department Stores, and Steven Goldberger, president of Hills Department Stores. Richard Van Pelt, chairman of the Jordan Marsh Company of Boston, resigned when Federated Stores Inc., now attempting to emerge from voluntary bankruptcy, decided to change course.
 
The Pressure Builds
 Mr. Doroff is leaving Bonwit on his own after just a year because the chain's parent, the Pyramid Companies, could not raise the money from banks for the expansion he wanted. He also refused to leave his New York offices for Syracuse, where Pyramid is based.
The long list of resignations and dismissals reflects the pressure in the executive offices brought on by weak sales, ill-fated takeover attempts and strategic blunders. Some bosses were fall guys for costly mistakes. Others were victims of consolidations. But many others, especially those trained as merchants, found themselves ill equipped to grapple with the swirl of financial, operational, strategic and merchandising problems that now confront retail chains.
"Just being a merchant today isn't enough to keep a chief executive in his or her job," said Joseph J. Carideo, a partner at Thorndike Deland Associates, New York executive recruiters. "Today, with all the problems in retailing, the C.E.O. also needs skills in marketing, finance and operations as well as merchandising. There are a lot of good merchants on the beach. That says something."
Mr. Doroff jumped at the Bonwit job because it gave him a chance to run the store, not just be the chief merchant. But he concedes it was one of his most serious career mistakes. But "I still love it," he added, heartily, referring to the retail business. "In relocating to another job, I want to take my time to avoid any unpleasant surprises such as the unexpectedness of my change at Bonwit. I think there are opportunities out there for me." Like the airlines and the entertainment and advertising fields, he said, "retailing is going through some tough times and significant restructuring; but I don't think it is a bad career."
There is no need to shed a tear, though, for Mr. Doroff. He won't talk about it, but trade reports indicate that he will walk away with about $4 million in a separation agreement with Bonwit Teller that was part of his contract.
 
Widely Respected
 Mr. Doroff stands out, say retailers and industry analysts who know him well. While only 42 years old, he has spent 24 years in the business and is widely respected as a savvy, instinctive merchant.
He made his strongest marks at Macy's New York and Bullock's department stores in Los Angeles, where he gained a reputation for taking risks to try to turn stores around, and achieving gains. He also held important positions at Federated Stores, where he was once considered a possible candidate to run its crown jewel, Bloomingdale's, when Marvin S. Traub, Bloomingdale's near-legendary chairman, chief executive and merchandising guru retires.
"Frank Doroff is the quintessential merchant, very astute about the business, yet he conducts himself in a very human way that makes his staff and his suppliers respect him," said Bernard Chaus, chairman and chief executive of Bernard Chaus Inc., a New York sportswear producer, who has done business with Mr. Doroff.
 
Excited by the Challenge
 But being a fine merchant may not be enough today, and Mr. Doroff may face some difficulties in finding another good position.
For one thing, recruiters say, in the tight retailing job market today there are plenty of ex-chairmen and ex-presidents of retail chains. And for another, Mr. Doroff's youthful appearance may complicate his receiving a top post with a major company.
Attracted by the new owners of the Bonwit Teller name and three remaining stores, he took the chairman's job. He was excited by the challenge of reviving Bonwit, and it did not hurt that he was offered a 45 percent equity share in the reborn chain.
Two years ago he left the presidency of Bullock's department stores to become chairman of Federated/ Allied Merchandising Services, the New York buying office. But he said he took the job only because Robert Campeau, the Canadian developer who acquired Federated, promised him a top operating post at a store.
The promise, according to persistent trade reports was the presidency of Bloomingdale's.
Mr. Doroff will not comment on that, twisting in his seat with the question because he explains that he still has many friends at "Bloomie's" and at Federated. He did not get the job, which probably would have put him in a key position to succeed Mr. Traub. Beleaguered by Federated's 1990 voluntary bankruptcy and his own debts, Mr. Campeau withdrew last year from any further connection with Federated. Along with his departure went the job Mr. Campeau had reportedly promised.
"I grew up in a retailing family," Mr. Doroff said. His father is Ben Doroff, now a consultant in Syracuse after serving as executive vice president of John Wanamaker Inc., the big Philadelphia retailer.
 
Started With Macy's
 After graduating from Washington and Jefferson College with an economics degree, and getting a master's degree from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Doroff went into Macy's executive training squad in 1972. He spent a year each in several jobs as a buyer.
Then, in 1977, Edward S. Finkelstein, who was Macy New York's chief executive at the time, tapped Mr. Doroff to be one of several senior vice presidents -- all in their early 30's -- to be groomed for major store management posts.
By 1982, he had received telephone calls from Howard Goldfeder, then chairman of Federated Department Stores, who kept telling Mr. Doroff in effect that he had nine store divisions while Macy's had only four. He talked about opportunities at Bullock's in Los Angeles and Sanger-Harris in Dallas.
In 1983, Mr. Doroff succumbed and left Macy's to join Bullock's. Four years later he was president of the chain.
 
'We Were All Tense'
 But on Jan. 25, 1988, Robert Campeau, who had already acquired the Allied Stores Corporation, made an unexpected, hostile bid for Federated. "We were all sick at Bullock's when Campeau made his bid," Mr. Doroff recalls. "We were all tense. We had had a good run. I consoled the store staff with the fact that our performance had been so good that we could be confident nothing would happen to us."
That prediction proved wrong. After Macy's tried to help Federated repel the Campeau attack, Mr. Campeau and Mr. Finkelstein, who by then was Macy's corporate chairman, agreed that Macy's would walk away from the fray if it could buy two of Federated's divisions, Bullock's and I. Magnin, for $1.1 billion.
A month later, when Mr. Finkelstein and Mark Handler, Macy's corporate president, visited Bullock's to meet the staff, Mr. Doroff learned that his stores would be run from Macy's in Atlanta instead of Los Angeles and that Macy's wanted him to remain as Bullock's president without retaining his merchandising responsibilities.
 
'The Most Exciting Business'
 "It meant that our merchandise would be bought in Atlanta and they were taking away the thing I loved most," Mr. Doroff said. "How could I go for that? I loved buying and selling clothes. Even as an assistant buyer, I loved it. It was like going to school in a school that you enjoyed. Someone hands you an order pad and tells you you have a $4 million budget. It's like having your own business. And you have almost instant feedback when the customers show up. It's the most exciting business in the world."
He left Bullock's and rejoined Federated as head of its New York buying office. But after two years, he decided he missed running stores and he opted for the Bonwit Teller job.
Just where Mr. Doroff might fit into a particular industry slot is uncertain. Robert Nesbit, managing partner of Korn/Ferry International, New York executive recruiters, thinks there are suitable opportunities for him. "But I think he would have to revert to his real forte, merchandising, rather than administration," he said. "I think he is still unproven as a president with its multifarious disciplines."

Busch Theme Park Unit Names 3 to Top Posts

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The Anheuser-Busch Companies, whose theme park business has been hurt by the recession, yesterday named the No. 2 executive at its theme park unit as president and made two other executives officers of the subsidiary.
John B. Roberts, formerly executive vice president and general manager of the Busch Entertainment Corporation, was named its president, effective immediately. Busch is the nation's second-largest operator of theme parks after the Walt Disney Company. Its nine parks include Sea World parks in Florida, Texas, California and Ohio, as well as Busch Gardens in Tampa, Fla., and Williamsburg, Va. 
 Mr. Roberts, 46, replaces W. Randolph Baker, who was reassigned in January to oversee a Spanish theme-park project, scheduled for completion for the mid-1990's. Mr. Roberts had since been acting president. He was unavailable for comment yesterday.
A 20-year Busch employee, Mr. Roberts is a graduate of Southwest Texas University, majoring in management. He joined the company as operations manager for Busch Gardens in Houston in 1970 and then became general manager of the Williamsburg park. He was named vice president for operations at the entertainment company in 1978 and, 10 years later, executive vice president. He is married and has two sons.
In its first-quarter results announced last month, Busch said its theme park business continued to be hurt by the recession and the resulting lower attendance at its parks.
In 1990, the entertainment division posted operating earnings of $58.3 million, or less than 4 percent of the total operating profit. It posted sales of $625.3 million, or less than 6 percent of total sales.
Busch also named Robert K. Gault, Jr., 47, president of the company's Sea World of California marine-life park, as vice president of operations of Busch Entertainment. Melvin L. Bilbo, 41, general manager of Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, was named vice president for marketing and product development.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Day Up Sharply on Improved Trade Deficit

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed sharply higher yesterday after the Commerce Department reported that the nation's trade deficit narrowed impressively to $4.05 billion in March, the lowest level in nearly eight years.
The Government said the recession reduced demand for imports while hefty increases in aircraft and computer sales kept exports at near-record levels. 
 The dollar's surge was also given impetus by the Swedish central bank's announcement that it was linking the value of the krona to the European Currency Unit, said Mike Faust, a foreign exchange analyst with MMS International in Chicago.
Effective immediately, the Swedish currency will be allowed to fluctuate 1.5 percent beyond the basic rate of 7.4 kronor for each ECU, the Riksbank said. Sweden made the move as a step toward membership in the European Community.
 
 Swedish Demand for Dollar
 Analysts said the move would require Swedish banks to adjust their foreign exchange holdings, increasing demand for the dollar by as much as $20 billion.
The dollar's sharp climb yesterday came despite sales of dollars by the Federal Reserve and the German Bundesbank, traders said. The dollar soared more than 4 pfennigs against the German mark in New York, closing at 1.7360 marks, up from 1.69475 late Thursday. Mr. Faust said the dollar traded as high as 1.7420 marks.
In earlier European trading, the dollar rose to 1.7355 German marks from 1.6965.
The British pound tumbled against the dollar, falling to $1.7125 in New York, from $1.7495 late Thursday. In London, sterling slumped to $1.7165 from late Thursday's $1.7465.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's prices, included: 1.4700 Swiss francs, up from 1.43735; 5.8855 French francs, up from 5.7460; 1,291.00 Italian lire, up from 1,261.00, and 1.14945 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14995.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.4670 Swiss francs, up from 1.4395; 5.8818 French francs, up from 5.7560; 1.9548 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9110; 1,293.25 Italian lire, up from 1,262.75, and 1.1506 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1488.
The dollar also gained against the Japanese yen, rising to 138.20 yen in New York from late Thursday's 137.45. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose to a closing 137.72 Japanese yen from 137.30 yen at Thursday's close, and in London, it rose to 138.45 yen.
Gold prices fell in New York, with a troy ounce dropping 80 cents on the Commodity Exchange to $355.20 a troy ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $354.75, off $1.15.Gold also fell in London to a late bid price of $355.50 a troy ounce, down from $355.95 late Thursday.
Silver fell half a cent on the Commodity Exchange, closing at $4.003 a troy ounce. In London, silver was unchanged at a late bid price of $4.04.

HEADLINE: Iraq Accepts U.N. System for Weapons Inspections

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 17

 BODY:
After an initial show of resistance, Iraq agreed today to a rigorous system of inspections of its military and scientific installations by an international commission charged with locating and destroying its most dangerous weapons.
Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, the executive chairman of the commission created by the Security Council to oversee the destruction of the Iraqi weapons, said Baghdad had now accepted all his demands. 
 That will allow the commission's inspectors nearly total freedom to investigate President Saddam Hussein's weapons programs and to fulfill the mandate to destroy or render harmless Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as ballistic missiles and nuclear-weapons-grade material.
 
Access Is Guaranteed
 Iraq has in effect guaranteed the commission's inspectors immediate access to any site or factory they want to check. It has also said they may take chemical and other samples out of the country for analysis, conduct aerial surveys inside Iraq and question Iraqi officials about their work on demand.
After Iraq had at first balked at these terms, the commission threatened to suspend operations at midnight tonight, Baghdad time, unless the Government changed its mind. Suspension of the commission's work would have placed Iraq in violation of Security Council Resolution 678, which sets out the allied coalition's terms for lifting economic sanctions and which Baghdad had accepted in exchange for a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war.
A suspension would also have ended any prospect of the Council's relaxing the trade sanctions when they come up for review on June 3.
Today the United States and the four other permanent Security Council members -- Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China -- discussed the dispute at a closed meeting.
Baghdad's acceptance of the terms today followed the failure of a team of nuclear inspectors to persuade Iraq to agree to them when the inspectors arrived in Baghdad this week.
The 34 inspectors, experts from the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency as well as from the Security Council commission, were the first such group to reach Iraq since it agreed to give up its weapons of mass destruction.
The operating procedures that Iraq agreed to today will create a precedent for subsequent inspection teams.
The United States and its allies have already accused Iraq of failing to comply properly with other parts of the procedure that the Security Council has laid down for locating and destroying Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
In letters sent to the United Nations on April 19, Iraq disclosed that it retains a substantial arsenal of chemical weapons but said it had no biological weapons or nuclear-weapons-grade material.
 
More Uranium Fuel Disclosed
 But in another letter dated April 27, Iraq acknowledged that it had nearly twice as much highly enriched weapons-grade uranium as American and atomic agency officials had indicated.
Baghdad disclosed that in addition to some 25 pounds of highly enriched uranium of French manufacture, it also had 66 pounds of enriched Soviet uranium fuel. Most previous estimates had put the amount at about 20 pounds.
In a study commissioned by the Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington group that studies nuclear proliferation, J. Carlson Mark, former head of weapons design at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said the total amount would be enough to build two atomic bombs of power equivalent to the bomb dropped on Nagasaki.
The disclosure has prompted criticism of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which had previously said Iraq did not have "a significant quantity" of enriched uranium, a phrase that means more than the 50 pounds usually considered necessary for a bomb.
The atomic agency appears to have justified this position by the fact that the highly enriched fuel was at four sites. As a result it inspected the fuel only at six-month intervals to try to insure that it was not diverted for military ends.
Iraq also acknowledged moving all this highly enriched uranium from its nuclear center at Al Tuwaitha, near Baghdad, to an undisclosed location before the United States-led coalition started air attacks on Iraq in January, raising the possibility that it may have removed and hidden equipment designed for weapons production as well.
 
Allies Question Claim
 The United States and its allies have also questioned Iraq's claim that it has not experimented with biological weapons. The Security Council has already forced Iraq to ratify the Geneva Convention banning biological weapons by making it one of the conditions imposed by Resolution 678 for lifting sanctions.
As a result, Iraq must now reveal the location of all "high-risk laboratories" equipped with advanced safety devices for handling dangerous biological substances. The commission will then inspect these sites in an effort to determine what kind of experiments were conducted there.
 
Kurd Reports Gains in Talks

BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 17 (AP) -- Massoud Barzani, the Kurdish rebel and political leader, said today that he and the Iraqi Government had agreed to major points in a peace proposal, but he declined to disclose them.
The rebel leader said he would provide details of the proposal at a news conference on Saturday. He indicated that the Kurds had dropped their demand for international guarantees to any accord with the Government, and he urged refugees to return to northern Iraq.

HEADLINE: Moscow to Ask Help From West On Reform Plan

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 17

 BODY:
The Kremlin has begun an initiative to get major Western countries to join directly in drafting and financing a far-reaching plan for economic and political reform, including creation of a market economy, political decentralization and privatization.
The initiative, details of which were made public in the weekly Moscow News, has not been formally endorsed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev or by the Group of Seven industrialized powers. 
 But extensive private contacts have produced an appeal to the West signed by Yevgeny M. Primakov, a senior adviser to Mr. Gorbachev, and Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a widely respected economist.
 
Young Aide's Second Initiative
 Mr. Yavlinsky, the 39-year-old economist who was the primary architect of the "500 day plan" of radical economic reform rejected by Mr. Gorbachev last summer, was said to be the major mover behind the new initiative.
His aides say he and Mr. Primakov are to fly to Boston on Sunday to discuss refinements for the plan with economists at Harvard University. The idea began taking shape last month when Mr. Yavlinsky was invited to a meeting of experts on the Soviet economy from the Group of Seven.
The initiative that emerged is still taking shape, and Mr. Gorbachev is said to be awaiting the reception in the West before he publicly endorses the plan. The Kremlin reportedly hopes to reach sufficient agreement for Mr. Gorbachev to be invited to the summit meeting of the Seven -- the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Japan -- in London in July.
In Moscow, the initiative is thought to come at a propitious time. On the Soviet side, Mr. Gorbachev has struck a promising truce with Boris N. Yeltsin, the head of the Russian republic and the primary champion of radical economic reform, in which the President finally recognized the sovereignty of the republics and their right to secede.
 
Growing Sense on Need for Aid
 There is also a growing sense in the Soviet Union that the "crisis program" produced by the government of Prime Minister Valentin S. Pavlov can only be a stopgap measure without extensive Western assistance. Mr. Pavlov himself in a recent interview appealed to the West not to be bystanders to the Soviet crisis.
On the Western side, President Bush has lately demonstrated a renewed interest in assisting Mr. Gorbachev, prompting a flurry of new contacts, including a telephone conversation between the leaders on May 11.
In addition, many Western experts have come to say that the West cannot sit on the sidelines if it is interested in genuine reforms in the Soviet Union. One of these, Graham Allison, former dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, helped Mr. Yavlinsky shape the proposals.
Mr. Yavlinsky is considered by many Western experts to be the most competent of Soviet economists. He has remained active as an adviser to Mr. Yeltsin and other republican leaders. Mr. Gorbachev's willingness to listen to him again was in itself viewed as further evidence that the President is retreating from the alliance with hard-line forces that he formed last fall.
 
Basic Principles Outlined
 The basic principles of the new initiative are included in an "Appeal to the Group of Seven" signed by Mr. Yavlinsky and Mr. Primakov. It calls on the Soviet Union to draft a comprehensive reform plan and asks the Group of Seven to prepare a parallel plan of economic cooperation.
The letter outlines these basic objectives:
*"A concrete distribution of powers between the center and the republics, especially in economic matters."
*Strict financial and monetary policies and liberalized prices.
*A "broad program of privatization and demonopolization."
*"The creation of conditions for the formation of an open economic system in the Soviet Union and its integration into the world economy."
*The development of legislative bases for a market economy.
These elements have been cited in most previous reform plans. The difference is that this is the first to propose an active role for the West. The financial package, the Soviets say, could include new terms for repaying Moscow's foreign debt, the lifting of trade restrictions, Soviet membership in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, long-term credits and diverse technical assistance.
 
No Cost Mentioned
 Drafters of the letter did not include a cost for the proposal. But Aleksei Mikhailov, a member of Mr. Yavlinsky's economic think-tank, "Epicenter," pointed to a recent article by Prof. Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University -- currently an economic advisor to the Polish government -- in which he said Western assistance to Moscow should be on the order of $30 billion per year for five years.
Mr. Mikhailov said the proposal resolved the needs of both the Soviet Union and the West. The West would help Moscow achieve the political and economic stability without which it cannot introduce reforms, and the Soviet Union in turn would launch the reforms that the West demands as necessary for any assistance.
In an interview with Moscow News, Mr. Yavlinsky said he was prodded to seek new solutions after Mr. Gorbachev ordered troops into the Moscow streets in March in an unsuccessful attempt to block a pro-Yeltsin rally. The stalemate, he said, proved "that nobody can win," and that the only path was through compromise and negotiation.
Then last month he was invited to attend a meeting of experts preparing the Group of Seven summit talks. Before going he consulted with Mr. Primakov and other Government officials. Mr. Yavlinsky's departure coincided with Mr. Gorbachev's meeting with the presidents of nine Soviet republics, at which they called off their destructive feuding and agreed to cooperate.
Mr. Yavlinsky said he argued his case for cooperation in Washington. The experts wanted a sign that the Kremlin shared his interest, and from this arose the idea of a joint appeal from him and Mr. Primakov.

HEADLINE: U.S. TRADE DEFICIT DROPPED IN MARCH TO AN 8-YEAR LOW

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
A jump in exports and sinking demand for imports narrowed the nation's trade deficit in March to $4.05 billion, the smallest monthly imbalance in almost eight years, the Commerce Department said today.
By comparison, the deficit totaled $5.50 billion in February and $8.62 billion in March of last year. 
 The improvement in the March trade data was another indication that strong exports may be blunting the effects of the recession. Aircraft and computer exports rose while auto and oil imports were flat. Exports hit a record level last October and have stayed strong since then.
 
 In Different Directions
 Altogether, exports rose 1.2 percent from February, to $33.99 billion, while imports fell 2.7 percent, to $38.04 billion.
Economists said the fall in imports was not surprising in a recession because domestic demand for goods and services has weakened.
But they said the growth in exports showed that many other economies were still healthy enough to buy American goods and that the dollar remained at a competitive rate against other currencies despite its appreciation early this year.
"That is a really important silver lining of this recession that many people have been too quick to dismiss," said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley. "There still is a real cushion from export demand in this recession."
 
Effect on Foreign Capital
 Just as important, the shrinking United States trade deficit reduces the need for foreign capital at a time when some experts on international finance warn of a global shortage of investment funds. The need for additional money from foreign investors is diminished as the increased sales of American goods abroad bring in enough foreign currency to cover most purchases of imports.
Such a reduced dependence on foreign capital translates into less pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high enough to stay attractive to foreign investors.
Robert D. Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, said he found the new statistics encouraging in demonstrating that the slow shrinkage of the trade deficit continued. "It confirms a trend that has been going on for some time, and that's reassuring," he said.
The annual trade deficit peaked at $152.13 billion in 1987 and has fallen steadily since then, to $101.72 billion last year. The last month in which the United States had a trade surplus was in the middle of the last recession, a $291 million surplus in April 1982, said Stephen L. Cooney, the director of international investment and finance at the National Association of Manufacturers.
The deficit reported today for March was the smallest since a $3.96 billion gap recorded in June 1983, when the economy was in the early stages of an expansion that continued until the middle of last year.
 
 Strong Showing in Europe
 The biggest gain in exports for March came in trade with the European Community, helping lift the surplus in that sector to $2.82 billion from a surplus of $1.42 billion in February and $990 million a year before. By contrast, the United States deficit with Japan showed further deterioration in March, moving to $3.58 billion from $3.16 billion in February. It was about even with the year before, at $3.57 billion.
The deficit with Japan has proved stubborn for five reasons, Mr. Hormats said. High Japanese investment in new factories, American consumer loyalty to Japanese brands and the depreciation of the yen all give Japanese companies an advantage, he said. In addition, the growing number of Japanese-owned factories on American soil and Japanese-made cars on American roads have created a strong, consistent demand for imported components and spare parts.
The ever-more controversial United States trade deficit with China, meanwhile, narrowed sharply in March, to $501.4 million, from $773.2 million in February and $554.9 million in March 1990. President Bush said on Wednesday that he would like to renew China's preferential access to the United States market, which is set to expire on July 3.
The annual renewal of the "most favored nation" status, which allows Chinese goods to enter the United States at the lowest tariffs available for each category of products, was almost rejected in Congress last summer because of concerns about China's human rights record. Since then the trade deficit with China has generally deteriorated; it totaled $10.3 billion last year as tons of textiles and apparel were shipped to the United States, mostly by way of Hong Kong.
As a result, protectionists have joined human rights advocates in criticizing a renewal of the most-favored status.
 
 A Small Gap With Mexico
 Another politically touchy trade relationship showed a small deterioration. The United States posted a $65 million deficit with Mexico, compared with a $119 million surplus in February.
Many members of Congress have opposed the negotiation of a proposed free-trade agreement with Mexico, raising fears that American companies will move factories and send back a flood of cheap imports while taking advantage of the cheap labor and less-strict environmental laws in Mexico.
The long-term trend in Mexican trade has been for the United States' deficit to shrink slowly. The deficit in March 1990 was $341.3 million.
Both houses of Congress are expected to vote early next week on resolutions that would cancel the automatic renewal of the Administration's authority to negotiate trade agreements that are then submitted for a single vote in Congress with no amendments permitted. The resolutions are not expected to pass.
Overall imports of oil and oil products, meanwhile, totaled $3.76 billion in March, little changed from $3.70 billion in February.
The total trade figure reported today was seasonally adjusted. In unadjusted terms, trade was nearly in balance, posting a deficit of only $1.84 billion. But the March deficit is usually one of the smaller ones each year, as winter demand for heating oil fades and summer demand for gasoline imports still lies ahead. So in the seasonal adjustment process, the $1.84 billion deficit was recalculated using a formula that increased it to $4.05 billion.

HEADLINE: New I.B.M. Price Cuts Expected

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
I.B.M. will reduce prices by 6 to 24 percent on Monday on some of its most popular desktop systems, according to industry executives familiar with the action. The cuts are in response to continued deep price cuts by other makers of personal computers.
The new round of price cuts -- the second such move by the International Business Machines Corporation in the last month -- follows similar actions by its principal competitors, including the Compaq Computer Corporation, Apple Computer Inc., Dell Computer, the Toshiba Corportion, the AST Research Corporation and others. On Thursday, Zenith Data Systems announced price cuts across its product line ranging from 12 to 31 percent. 
 On April 23, just a week after Compaq had cut prices as much as 34 percent, I.B.M. reduced prices on 20 models from 3 percent to 38 percent. At the same time, it introduced a number of models based on a new chip made by the Intel Corporation, the 486sx microprocessor.
 
 Surge in Apple Sales
 I.B.M. and Compaq are responding not only to the inroads made by clone makers, but also to a sales surge at Apple after price cuts in March, which have driven its market share up to nearly 20 percent in recent months.
The industrywide price-cutting epidemic may be grim news for computer makers facing new pressure on profitability, but it could be a big plus for computer buyers, analysts said.
"All these price cuts represent the best news for buyers in some time," said Dan Ness Jr., a microcomputer analyst at Computer Intelligence, a La Jolla, Calif., market research firm. "The message has now gotten to anyone who has a few dollars. It will bring people out of the woodwork and be good for software sellers as well."
 
 Price-Tracking Service
 Mr. Ness said that price cuts had come so rapidly in recent months that his company had set up a special price-tracking service for its corporate customers.
The I.B.M. price cuts, according to the industry executives, will affect 13 models, including 4 model 30's, 4 model 55's and 5 deskside model 80's. The base price for one of the model 80 systems will be reduced from $11,495 to $8,695, they said.
In announcing its first-quarter results, I.B.M. executives said that personal computer sales had fallen by 17 percent during the period and showed no immediate sign of improvement because of domestic and international economic weakness.
Industry analysts attribute the personal-computer price cuts to fundamental changes in the business, mostly the sudden broader acceptance of products from small computer makers that once were off-limits to large corporate buyers, which puchased name brands like Compaq and I.B.M. at premium prices.
"The problem facing Compaq in particular is that their distribution channel is exploding in their face," said John McCarthy, an analyst at Forrester Research, a market research firm based in Boston. "Fortune 500 companies are not buying because of the recession, and smaller buyers are shifting to mail order vendors and superstores."
The industry price war has had its nasty side. Last month, Compaq filed suit in Federal District Court in Houston, contending that magazine ads place by a mail-order reseller, Dell Computer, had improperly quoted Compaq's published list prices as actual prices, and had unfairly compared the performance of the two companies' products.

HEADLINE: Fed to Consult More Closely About Rates

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve confirmed yesterday that its top policy makers had agreed to consult more closely about changing interest rates to influence economic growth.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, appears, however, to have retained the power to change a key short-term lending rate, minutes of the March 26 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee show. 
 The Fed was reported to have had an internal disagreement over altering the Federal funds rate -- the rate at which commercial banks lend one another short-term funds -- with some members feeling Mr. Greenspan had not consulted them sufficiently.
"Members agreed that in general the existing practice" should be continued, the minutes reported, but added that "consultation among members" would be appropriate when sizable rate changes were contemplated.
 
 Governors and Presidents
 The policy-making Open Market Committee is made up of the seven members of the Fed's board of governors and five regional bank presidents. There are two vacancies on the board of governors.
The presidents -- who have traditionally been more fearful that lower interest rates will fuel inflation -- were reportedly upset over not having been more closely consulted about a cut in the funds rate.
The group, which deliberates behind closed doors, meets every six to eight weeks to discuss economic growth and set interest rates. It releases the minutes of its proceedings on the Friday after the next meeting.
The market committee last met on Tuesday, and economists said the group appeared to have left its credit policies unchanged. It voted 10 to 0 at the March 26 meeting to keep its credit stance unchanged, although some members expressed the need to "be alert" to the possibility of raising interest rates to curb inflation pressures.
 
Rates Lowered on April 30
 In an apparent reversal, however, the Fed lowered interest rates on April 30, when it cut its benchmark discount rate -- the rate it charges commercial banks for loans -- by a half-point, to 5 1/2 percent. The central bank also nudged down the Federal funds rate by a quarter-point, to 5 3/4 percent.
The minutes of the March meeting said committee members discussed to what extent changes in the discount rate should be passed through to the Federal funds rate. Some of the Fed presidents are reported to have balked at Mr. Greenspan's decision on Feb. 1 to push down the funds rate by a half-point at the same time the board agreed to lower the discount rate by a half-point.
Referring to subsequent rate cuts, the minutes singled out the more rapid growth of the nation's money supply in February and March, which supported expectations of a near-term rebound in the economy.

HEADLINE: New York Ethics Law Leads Local Officials to Quit Posts

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 17

 BODY:
Scores of municipal officials across New York State are resigning their positions on public boards and authorities rather than filing extensive financial disclosure reports required by a new state ethics law.
The law has generated a backlash across the state, in which an effort to stop corruption is threatening to stop government instead. Officials in some municipalities fear that the resignations will paralyze local government by making it difficult to convene quorums on zoning boards, community college boards and development agencies. 
 The rebellion in New York has been particularly noticeable in smaller municipalities, where unpaid appointees to local boards have balked at meeting the deadline -- last Wednesday -- for filing 20-page disclosure forms that request information on everything from property holdings to investment income for officials, their spouses and their children.
 
New Jersey Faces Similar Law
 "My objection is that I'm a volunteer; I'm not elected and I'm not paid," said Christopher H. Brown, an accountant who resigned his seat on the Niagara Falls library board on Thursday. "I wasn't going to sacrifice my privacy for the so-called privilege of giving up my family time and my free time."
A similar storm is brewing in New Jersey, where a new state financial disclosure law approved in February has generated threats of mass resignations from local governments by August, when officials must file their first disclosure forms.
The revolts in both states reflect a political environment in which government officials at all levels are complaining that increased scrutiny is driving good people from government.
 
Finances and Real Estate
 The New York law, which was passed in 1987 in reaction to the New York City corruption scandals, applies to elected officials, department heads, policy-making employees and officials who approve contracts and leases in municipalities with more than 50,000 residents. The disclosure forms vary slightly by municipality. But at a minimum officials must report their income and most investments, with amounts indicated within a range of values. They must list the location of all real estate that they own within their jurisdiction or within five miles of it. And they must describe debts in excess of $5,000 and any interest in contracts involving their municipality.
Several officials who have resigned said they had no conflicts of interest to hide. But they said they feared that such information could be used to their disadvantage by competitors in their professions and businesses.
Even Henry G. Miller, the chairman of the Temporary State Commission on Local Government Ethics, which was established in 1989 to enforce the new law, said he believes "the forms are far too burdensome and intrusive." The commission has proposed a new law that would vastly simplify the financial disclosure requirements.
 
No Statistics Compiled
 Because the first deadline for filing financial disclosure reports just passed, statistics have yet to be compiled on how many officials have submitted resignations. But Edwin L. Crawford, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties, said his organization had received reports of more than 100 resignations from county governments.
Few problems have been reported by New York City and other large governments where many of the affected jobs are full-time paid positions. In those places, officials have often filled out the forms grudgingly rather than forsake their salaries.
Some municipal officials have received extensions for the filing date from state and local ethics boards and are expected to resign if the Legislature does not pass a less onerous law before the extensions expire. In Sullivan County, seven of the 10 members of the Private Industry Council and two of the three members of a prisoner release commission have submitted resignations, said David Kaufman, chairman of the Board of Supervisors.
 
Stalls Government Decisions
 In Genesee County, three of the nine trustees of the community college have resigned, said Charles W. Meyer, the County Manager. All the members of the county's board of the Industrial Development Agency and its Board of Health have vowed to quit if a new ethics law is not passed before their extensions expire.
New Jersey's law, which requires the disclosure of all sources of income of more than $2,000 earned by officials and their family members, has already brought threats of resignation from members of the Mount Olive zoning board, for example.
Many of the issues that come before local policy boards are matters that require little more than a rubber stamp of approval. But when the boards cannot meet, even simple decisions on contracts, appointments, purchases and real-estate matters must be suspended.
In New York State, for instance, the Industrial Development Agency of Sullivan County could not gather a quorum on May 9 because of the resignation of several members. The agency had to postpone a vote to increase the size of a bond issue needed to construct a major office building in the county, said Paula Osenni, the county's economic development director.
The Temporary State Commission on Local Government Ethics has proposed a new law that would require a two-page disclosure form. The form would request only a listing of real estate owned by the official or his family within one mile of the municipality and the name and nature of any business interests of the official and his spouse.
The proposal would establish a code of ethics for municipal officials that would bar conflicts of interest and prohibit former officials from appearing before their former employers for a year after leaving government.
The executive director of New York State Common Cause, Julian S. Palmer, said his group is not yet convinced that the current forms should be scrapped. "As we see it, holding public office is a matter of public trust, and unfortunately the public has been disappointed too many times and has become too cynical not to have significant financial disclosure," he said.

HEADLINE: F.T.C. Investigating Pricing of Appliances

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
Government regulators are investigating possible price collusion among the nation's biggest makers of home appliances, officials from the companies and the Federal Trade Commission said today.
The F.T.C. apparently began its inquiry after the chairman of the Raytheon Company, manufacturer of Amana and Speed Queen appliances, called at a 1989 meeting of securities analysts for industry competitors to raise prices. 
 Kevin Arquit, chief of the F.T.C.'s antitrust division, said the agency had under way "several investigations in the area of invitations to collude."
 
 1989 Remark by Raytheon Chief
 During the 1989 meeting of securities analysts in New York, Thomas Phillips, then chairman of Raytheon, called on major manufacturers to raise prices by 6 percent to 7 percent. The remark was reported in a trade newspaper, HFD.
"I can't really characterize his statements other than as they were reported," Larry McCracken, a Raytheon spokesman, said. "He was responding to some questions that were directed toward him, and that's all I can say."
Mr. McCracken said Raytheon had supplied information to the F.T.C. in 1989 and 1990 and the company's last contact with the agency was "at least six months ago."
In addition to Raytheon, the F.T.C. asked the Whirlpool Corporation and the General Electric Company for information in conjunction with the investigation.
A Whirlpool spokesman, T. R. Reid, said his company responded to the F.T.C.'s request for information shortly after thye remark by Mr. Phillips and again last September. However, he added, "to the best of our knowledge, we're not a focus of any investigation that might be going on, nor have we been contacted by the F.T.C. again."
G.E. has supplied information to the F.T.C. "on an ongoing basis," a spokesman, Jack Batty, said. "I presume it's on pricing."
A person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified, said G.E. also was not a target of the investigation.
Mr. Arquit of the F.T.C. said a solicitation for higher prices could violate Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which forbids unfair methods of competition. "There are some arguments that this could be labeled an unfair method," he added.
Shipments of household appliances fell 2.5 percent from 1989 to 1990. The Federal Government attributed the slowdown to decreased consumer confidence and to higher unemployment and inflation rates late in the year. A slowdown in housing construction also contributed, the Government said.
Mr. Batty of G.E. said the household appliance market was "highly competitive."

HEADLINE: Tilting at Taxes in Connecticut

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell Weicker's proposal that Connecticut tax personal income has produced a menacing coalition of Democratic and Republican legislators who (1) don't like the tax and (2) don't like Mr. Weicker. Their shortsighted scrambling for a no-income-tax alternative puts politics ahead of Connecticut's long-term interest.
Mr. Weicker's election as an independent gave him latitude to press tax reforms that Democrats and Republicans have ducked for decades. But it also bred bipartisan resentment. Democrats resent his breaking their lock on the governorship. Republicans doubly resent that he quit the G.O.P. to run alone, and then beat their strong candidate. 
 With no troops of his own in the General Assembly, Mr. Weicker's tax plan needs hefty outside support. He has it from major business groups and unions, but taxpayers appear largely unconvinced. The public's suspicion is misplaced; the no-income-tax option packs more pain than Mr. Weicker's.
The Weicker plan, fair and sound, would tax all income above $12,500 ($25,000 for couples) at 6 percent, end separate taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest, slash the sales tax but apply it more broadly, and cut taxes on corporate income.
Sales taxes are inherently unfair to the poor, because they pay the same tax as the rich on every purchase. Sales taxes are also unstable revenue; collections bounce up and down with the economy. Finally, cutting the state tax from 8 percent -- the nation's highest -- to 4.25 percent would make it the region's lowest, and thus attract business.
Sponsors of the coalition alternative, including most of both parties' leaders, have not yet showed their hand. News reports indicate they want to hold the sales tax at 8 percent and apply it far and wide, cut corporate taxes, raise cigarette and alcohol taxes, make more people pay taxes on dividends and interest, raise the capital gains tax, slap a tax on large gifts -- and more.
The plan is also said to involve more spending cuts, a stretchout in debt reduction and some dubious accounting. Yet, coming so close to adjournment, it will have no proper public airing.
If the advance word is correct, the coalition package seems calculated to drive out businesses and wealth, postpone grief for politicians who don't dare vote responsibly, and land a haymaker on Mr. Weicker. But if this mischievous package prevails, Connecticut will be the injured party.

HEADLINE: France, Where the Center Holds

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis ;Flora Lewis is Senior Columnist of The New York Times.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
During the 1981 elections, which brought the Socialists to power, one of their stars, Lionel Jospin, said, "The political center in France is like the Bermuda Triangle. Whoever approaches it disappears."
Now, after Francois Mitterrand celebrated his 10th anniversary as President, the change is evident. In effect, France is governed from the center. 
 This will remain true despite the nomination this week of Edith Cresson as France's first female prime minister, replacing Michel Rocard. She is a Mitterrand loyalist and tough promoter of French industry against foreign competition. Mr. Rocard, who never got along with the President, was popular but his Socialist Party criticized him for lacking social sensitivity.
The Communists are marginalized. The far right, about equal to the far left, is more vigorous. But there is a wide consensus not so different from the one embracing most American Republicans and Democrats.
It came without fanfare, almost unnoticed until last week when the political class started adding up the results of the decade. This is a profound change for France, used to thinking of itself as clearly divided between right and left ever since the Revolution.
And it is provoking great outcries from politicians who feel they need the sharp, familiar definitions to advance their claims on an increasingly disinterested electorate.
Far from applauding the transformation to centrism of a Socialist Government that set out to "change society" and force a "rupture" with capitalism, the opposition bewails that Mr. Mitterrand has stolen their thunder. Some Socialists complain that their party has lost its soul, and settled for managing the society that exists instead of pursuing its vocation to "reinvent" it.
The major switch under President Mitterrand was imposed by necessity, after the first two frenetic years of nationalizations, expanded social welfare and Government-led enterprise brought huge deficits and threatened the franc. Austerity was proclaimed as an interlude, to restore balance before moving on again to classic Socialist goals from a sounder base.
That never happened. Some Socialist takeovers and regulations were abruptly reversed during the two years of "cohabitation" under conservative Prime Minister Jacques Chirac in 1986-88, while Mr. Mitterrand bided his time as the imperturbable "President of all the French," as he took to describing himself in place of his previous assertion of leading "the people of the left."
Europe has slowed the French pendulum. It has proved impossible for a major member of the European Community to go against the tide dominating its partners. In that sense, Margaret Thatcher was right that the community limits the choices of independent governments.
This constraint will increase with the single market and steps toward economic-monetary union and political union. It will affect the politics of all the members, perhaps not in terms of who wins and loses elections but in terms of how much difference it makes. A government change in Germany or Italy can no longer have the dramatic results it might have 10 years ago. The French experience will not be unique.
Nor is it contested. Except in the occasional reflex gesture and the increasingly empty but still sacrosanct Gaullist rhetoric, France is abandoning its insistence on singularity. From De Gaulle's limit on integration to a "Europe of states," France has moved to the forefront of encouraging emergence of a more consolidated European power.
It isn't only in the East that old habits and assumptions are abandoned. Quietly, it's happened in France, too.

HEADLINE: Separate Ethnic Worlds Grow on Campus

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif.

 BODY:
Sergio Perez lives in an off-campus apartment with other Chicano students at the University of California at Berkeley. A senior, he is majoring in Chicano studies, and participating in bilingual commencement exercises reserved for Chicano and Latino students.
Most of his friends are Mexican-American, like Jesus Covarrubias, who, one recent afternoon, was relaxing with Mr. Perez at Sproul Plaza on a section of wall marked as Chicano territory. 
 "You could say that this campus is segregated for some reasons," Mr. Perez said, looking to Mr. Covarrubias for support."But for me it was like family."
 
Separate Ethnic Worlds
 Family, yes, with the positive reassurance that implies for the members. But often a closed and exclusive family that demands loyalty and rejects outsiders.
As American campuses grow more racially and ethnically diverse, many students are creating ever more complete worlds of their own, in which they live, study and socialize only with others like themselves. Sociologists and educators warn that this phenomenon has already splintered Berkeley and many other universities around the country into ethnic encampments filled with dissonance and misunderstanding.
"Separatism and even tribalism in the old-fashioned sense are increasing," said Ernest L. Boyer, the former United States Education Commissioner who is president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
The implications are frightening, Dr. Boyer said, because the college campus, in many ways, is a crucible for tomorrow's society. "If humanism and communal understanding can't happen on a college campus, how in the world can it happen on city streets?" he said.
Such separatism has existed for decades, gaining notice with the militancy and isolation of black students in the 1960's, who banded together for support in a hostile environment. Most educators agree that student self-segregation has intensified since then as the number of minority students has steadily increased on most campuses.
 
Ethnic Growth on Campuses
 About 16 percent of all college students belong to minority groups, as against 13.5 percent in 1978, but the percentage is much higher in California and the Southwest. Black, Asian and Hispanic students and, to a lesser extent, American Indians, now have enough members to form a substantial nucleus at universities like Berkeley. Many other universities also have substantial minority populations, including Stanford, Cornell, Rutgers and Penn State as well as smaller colleges like Vassar, where black students will hold their own graduation ceremony.
The rise over the last decade of ethnic studies departments, separate dormitories and activities based on race have all made it easier for students to function within the larger campus environment without really being a part of it.
Of course, nothing prevents college students from meeting and becoming friends with students of other races, as many do. On the other hand, there may be benefits to campus Balkanization. Studies have shown, for instance, that black students who live with black roommates and belong to African-American organizations graduate at a higher rate than those without such sources of support.
 
'Stresses and Strains'
 "To me it's not a bad thing for folks to affiliate with other people they have an interest in," said Michael L. Jackson, an associate dean of students at Stanford University, where 37 percent of undergraduate students come from minority groups as against 13 percent in 1980. "The great experiment we have is to bring people together at a community like Stanford and have them live near each other and learn from each other. That will not be without its stresses and strains."
Those strains are evident on almost every campus. Incidents of racial harassment are increasing, embittered debates rage over affirmative action policies, and students and professors say there is such a heightened sensitivity to remarks that could be perceived as biased that they cannot speak freely about race.
As minority enrollment has increased, many students have developed a heightened self-consciousness of their own racial identity, beginning almost from the moment they arrive on campus, sociologists say. Whites say they are made to feel like oppressers, with any affirmation of their culture seen as "racist behavior." Minority students say they are made to feel like they do not belong on campuses where affirmative action casts doubt on their qualifications.
"I didn't want a whole layer of challenges about whether I deserved to be here," said Akinwunmi McKenzie, a sophomore from Memphis who chose to live in a predominantly black dorm during his first year at Stanford. "I figured that if I lived in a black environment, it wouldn't come up."
Mr. McKenzie said that after his first year he felt confident enough to leave the security of the black dorm. "I had been self-affirmed," he said. He now lives in a dorm with many Hispanic students.
 
Harbinger of Social Changes
 Berkeley, where minority enrollment has gone to more than 55 percent from 34 percent a decade ago, is the most ethnically and racially diverse research university in the country and is often a harbinger of social changes.
Predominantly white in the 1960's, Berkeley is now so diverse that no group is a majority.
At lunchtime, Sproul Plaza becomes an international bazaar: members of the Filipino-American Alliance are there, as are members of the Vietnamese Students' Association, the Chinese Student Association, the Asian Student Union and Tonodach: The Japanese American Cultural Club.
Resisting such alliances, and the peer pressure to join them, can be difficult. "My first semester here I took an Asian studies class that turned into a total complaining session, and I swore I would never get into a class like that again," said Chak Gaude, a Berkeley sophomore of Indian descent. "Since then I've taken some heat for not associating with the Asians, but so what."
 
New Racial Awareness
 Troy Duster, director of the Institute for the Study of Social Change at Berkeley, is finishing a two-year study on the accelerated diversity of the campus. He has found that as minority enrollment rose, racial awareness intensified and left students struggling to deal with the racial realities they had never encountered.
Dr. Duster interviewed 230 Berkeley students and found that while many wanted to experience different cultures, they had trouble understanding the actions of other groups and often segregated themselves, either for self-defense or mutual support.
Dr. Duster has concluded that campus fragmentation, if it is balanced on as many different groups as it is at Berkeley, might lead to a social transformation -- a society without a dominant group, capable of working in the multi-cultural world economy that is now forming.
"Now we have to start talking not in the old tradition of, 'How you can be like me,' " Dr. Duster said, "but, 'How can I understand you?' "
Dr. Duster is recommending in his report that the Berkeley administration do more to unite students during their crucial first six months on campus and to encourage them to interact in class and in public areas without feeling they are violating racial and ethnic allegiances.
Other institutions are trying various sorts of experiments in social engineering. Cornell has a Ujaama House for African-American students and is building a small dorm with a American Indian theme. Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, has set aside dorms for African-American, Hispanic and Jewish students.
 
Stanford Model Is Watched
 One model being watched by other universities is at Stanford, which has four special ethnic dorms, for black, Asian, American Indian and Hispanic students, but with a twist -- no more than about half of the students living in each dorm can belong to the theme group. The rest must be from other groups.
The house with the Hispanic theme is called Casa Zapata, named after the famous Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. Half its 98 residents are from Spanish-speaking cultures, primarily Mexican-American. The others either selected Casa Zapata or were assigned there in a housing lottery.
Except for boisterous murals of Latin heroes throughout the dormitory, Casa Zapata looks, smells and sounds like most other dorms. Spanish is often heard, but by no means is it used exclusively. Hispanic culture enlivens Casa Zapata's cafeteria menu and prompts some holiday observances like Cinco de Mayo. But the real tradition of the dorm is a feeling of family that embraces all cultures.
"Students of this generation talk about anything -- sex, gender, drugs -- but somehow the issue of ethnicity and race still is a foreign language," said Cecilia Preciado Burciaga, an associate dean of students and a resident fellow who lives at Casa Zapata. "Maybe now is the time to look for common ground rather than just celebrating differences."
 
Defining People's Differences
 For students, many from segregated backgrounds, such common ground usually starts with defining the differences between people.
Stacey Strong, a first-year student,with a give-away Boston accent, was randomly selected to live at Casa Zapata and at first found the transition difficult. She said she took twice as long as anyone else to remember names because they seemed so foreign to her.
"Sometimes I'd get confused because I didn't know if I was going to offend," she said. She said she finally appreciated the difference between herself and the Hispanic students when one of them asked her what it felt like to be an Anglo.
"I'd never heard anyone use the word Anglo for me before," said Miss Strong, whose home is Weymouth, Mass., a predominately white, middle-class community. "Where I came from no one was an Anglo; everyone was just Irish Catholic. But after being at Casa Zapata a while I realized that an Anglo can be an Anglo only if there's someone who's not."

HEADLINE: Dow Drops by 7.38; Loss for Week at 33.54

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
A late flurry of selling pushed the stock market into the minus column yesterday in a relatively active session.
As measured by the Dow Jones industrial average, the market closed down 7.38, at 2,886.63. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 largely blue-chip issues rose 0.20, to 372.39. For the week, the Dow lost 33.54, and the S.& P. index was off 3.35. 
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange climbed to 174.2 million shares, from 154.5 million the day before. Much of the increased volume was attributed to yesterday's "double witching hour," when the May stock options and index futures expired. Those exercising their options usually cause an increase in volume.
 
 Rumor on Discount Rate
 "The day's most important news wasn't news at all but a rumor that the Federal Reserve was about to cut its discount rate again," said William M. LeFevre, market strategist at Tucker Anthony Inc. "Until that rumor hit the street at midday, the market was on a downward bias."
After several feeble afternoon rallies, trading ended with a brief bout of pre-weekend profit taking. There were 684 issues that advanced and 813 that declined.
Compaq Computer was again the most actively traded issue, closing unchanged at 35 3/4 on a turnover of five million shares. Company projections of much lower future profits sent Compaq shares tumbling by 13 1/4 points on Wednesday. Because Compaq is a popular issue, its huge loss has depressed other computer stocks as well as the market generally.
Apple Computer, for example, was the second-most-active issue and fell 2, to 47, on a volume of 4.2 million shares. Among other actively traded issues, Philip Morris lost a point, at 64 3/4, as Congress and several European countries advanced proposals that would curb tobacco advertising.
 
Royal Dutch Down
 Environmental concerns contributed to a 2 1/4-point decline in the price of Royal Dutch shares, which closed at 80 3/8 in heavy trading. Some of the decline in Royal Dutch, one of the biggest oil companies, was laid to reports that petroleum companies with large European operations were planning to impose more stringent practices to prevent spills and other accidents that could damage the environment.
One of the day's best performers was the initial public offering of shares in Ann Taylor Stores, a chain of women's apparel shops that has done well during the recession. The offering of roughly six million shares was made at 27 and the stock closed at 27 7/8. Ann Taylor shares led the most-active list for much of the session.
Elsewhere, the American Stock Exchange's market value index slipped 0.24, to 358.01, while the Nasdaq composite index closed down by 0.39, at 481.38.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 22, 1991, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about Friday's stock trading misstated the reason for the price decline of Royal Dutch. It reflected a dividend that will be paid only to those who held Royal Dutch shares before Friday.

HEADLINE: Seville Journal;
Picture a U.S. Pavilion (Better Late Than Never)

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEVILLE, Spain, May 11

 BODY:
One year before the opening of Seville's universal exhibition, Expo '92, the large plot of land assigned to the United States is already a tourist attraction. While new pavilions are going up all around it, the American site is silent and deep in weeds.
 Beside it, New Zealand's pavilion is well advanced. The eventual shape of the British, Japanese and Soviet pavilions is already clear. Many buildings being put up by Spain are close to completion. But the first cement mixer has yet to arrive at the padlocked American site. 
Expo's organizers are perplexed. The most powerful nation on earth, the country that probably best symbolizes Expo's main theme, "Discoveries," has so far done less to prepare for the last universal exhibition of the 20th century than Monaco.
 But back in 1988, President Reagan was the only head of state who personally accepted King Juan Carlos's invitation to join this celebration of the 500th anniversary of Columbus's trip to the New World. And it was the United States that demanded the largest pavilion site after that of Spain.
 
Like a Dallas Country Fair
 So buses taking tourists around the 538-acre Expo site on La Cartuja island beside Seville often slow down near the American plot to give guides a chance to explain why it is empty. But they always reassure visitors that by inauguration day on April 20 next year, it will be filled.
 "I have faith in American ingenuity and America's capacity to recover," Emilio Cassinello, who heads the Expo state company, said. "But I cannot deny that the United States is running late, above all in terms of the expectations raised by the American presence."
In reality, work on the American pavilion should start soon. But it has been scaled back from its original striking design to something that a Spanish official said would resemble a country fair in Dallas. And the United States is still unsure what it will exhibit.
 What the United States has already demonstrated is the difficulty that government and private sector have in collaborating on a prestige project of this kind. While in most countries governments took the lead, the United States squabbled for three years over who should pay for its pavilion.
 For this same reason, in fact, Expo '92 is taking place in a southern Spanish city rather than a northern American city. As far back as 1982, private promoters in Chicago made the first bid for the fifth centenary exhibition, but the initiative collapsed after the city government withheld its support.
 
Recession Adds to Problems
 In the case of Seville, the Federal Government first proposed a $45 million budget for the American pavilion, including $15 million from the private sector. But the request for funds was delayed in a House subcommittee by legislators who argued that taxpayers should not foot the bill.
 And without a green light for official involvement, the American commissioner for Expo '92 at the time, Marvin Stone, had to struggle to find American companies, states and cities willing to take part with stands or contributions. When the recession began, his problems multiplied.
 Finally, last summer, Congress authorized the United States Information Agency to put $13 million toward Expo '92, and Spanish companies at last made bids to build the pavilion, designed by Barton Myers. But while American experts predicted bids of about $10 million, the lowest was for $26 million.
 One culprit was the inflation driven by $1.5 billion in construction at the Expo site and $8.5 billion being spent in Seville and the rest of southern Spain. The other was that the United States now needed its pavilion built in a hurry. Early this year, embarrassed American officials quietly shrank their project to match their more modest resources.
 In a nod to Seville's 90-degree summer temperatures, a wall of water, an unspecified number of cooling towers and three shade "sails" representing Columbus's caravelles have survived in the American project. But the main exhibition space will now be provided by two United States Government-owned geodesic domes that have traveled Europe for the last 20 years and will be brought here for the occasion.
 
Others Have Daring Designs
 The pavilion's original theme, "Rediscovering America," is another casualty, although General Motors will turn one of the domes into a standing-only theater and finance production of a film about the United States. Other American companies are also now showing interest, while Texas will run the pavilion's main restaurant.
 Making the best of things, the new American Commissioner for Expo '92, Frederick M. Bush, who is not related to the President, insists that the United States will still do well because the purpose of a universal exhibition is not to build architectural monuments but to display the contents of pavilions.
 That opinion, though, is clearly not shared by other developed countries who have chosen daring designs to represent them in Seville. Japan, for example, is building the world's largest wooden building. Switzerland's 80-foot-high tower will be made entirely of paper. Britain's glass pavilion will have water cascading down one side.
 Spain hopes that more than 100 countries will be represented at Expo '92. To insure the participation of small or poor third-world countries, Spain is providing them with exhibition space, although five former Spanish colonies -- Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, Cuba and Puerto Rico -- will have their own pavilions.
 With 70 percent of the main infrastructure completed and work under way at most pavilion sites, an advertising blitz starts this fall to insure that Expo '92 meets its target of 18 million visitors before it closes on Columbus Day next year. And with 500,000 visitors expected from the United States, Spain is gambling that there will be an American pavilion for them to see.

HEADLINE: Often-Ravenous Hanson Takes a Taste of I.C.I.

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 17

 BODY:
As politicians, union leaders and management prepared to fight a possible takeover of Imperial Chemical Industries P.L.C., investors waited today to see if I.C.I., Britain's third-largest company, would become the next and largest course for Hanson P.L.C., a conglomerate that has swallowed a slew of American and British corporations.
 On Wednesday, Hanson disclosed that it had purchased about 20 million, or 2.8 percent, of I.C.I.'s shares. Analysts say they think Hanson paid a total of about L240 million ($417.2 million), or about L11.94 a share.
 
Just to Hanson's Taste
 Few business executives are considered the match of Lord Hanson, the chairman of Hanson, and his partner, Sir Gordon White, chairman of its American arm, in reaping big profits by buying industrial companies, selling vast parts of them and improving the performance of what remains. With its broad array of products, which include commodity, agricultural and specialty chemicals; drugs; paint, and explosives, I.C.I. seems like the kind of conglomerate they love to devour.
 The stock, which had risen since Monday as much as 17 percent, slipped a bit today, closing on the London International Stock Exchange at L12.47 ($21.44), down 19 pence. On the New York Stock Exchange, I.C.I.'s American depository receipts closed at $84.875, down $1.75. 
 When asked in an interview today if Hanson had bought more I.C.I. shares, Martin Taylor, vice chairman of Hanson, would only say, "I haven't got anything to add to the Wednesday statement." Hanson had said on Wednesday that the purchase was for investment purposes. Mr. Taylor declined to say whether that might mean a takeover bid.
 If Hanson does acquire I.C.I., analysts say the price will be at least L10 billion ($17.2 billion). That would make it the biggest takeover in British history, exceeding the record that Hanson set in 1989, when it paid $5.3 billion for Consolidated Gold Fields P.L.C. Analysts predict that if I.C.I. were sold piecemeal, it would be worth as much as L20 a share, or a total of L14.2 billion ($24.42 billion).
 I.C.I. executives declined to comment today. But people close to the company say a management team led by Sir Denys Henderson, I.C.I.'s chairman, and Frank Whitely, its deputy chairman, have dusted off a takeover-defense plan and enlisted the help of S. G. Warburg & Company, the British investment bank, and Goldman, Sachs & Company, the American investment bank.
 I.C.I. had worldwide sales of $22.84 billion last year, of which the United States accounted for $4.5 billion. The company employs more than 18,000 people in its American operations. It is the fourth-largest chemical company in America, where its other major products include Glidden paint; drugs for treating depression, cancer and cardiovascular diseases, and seeds.
 Companies that have fallen to Hanson in the last six years include Imperial Group, which was bought for $3.85 billion; the SCM Corporation ($930 million), Kidde ($1.6 billion), Consolidated Gold Fields, Cavenham Forest Industries ($1.3 billion) and Peabody Holding ($1.2 billion).
 According to Hanson's last earnings statement, it had $12.88 billion in cash as of March 31. In April it sold $894.3 million worth of convertible bonds. And Mr. Smith noted that his company had the ability to borrow up to $29.2 billion.
 
Has Sold Other Stakes
 Will Hanson pounce, or is it only playing the stock because it sees I.C.I. as an undervalued company in a depressed industry that may be bottoming out? Analysts are divided.
 Hanson has bought and then sold large stakes in companies like Midland Bank P.L.C.; Westland Group P.L.C., the British maker of helicopters and Hovercraft, and the Cummins Engine Company. But with interest rates in Britain and the United States falling, and with many thinking that the recessions in the two countries are easing, some think Lord Hanson is eager to make a move.
 "He has moved from assets into cash over the last three years," said Geoffrey Allum of County NatWest Securities Ltd. "Now he wants to put the cash back into assets and ride the cycle back up again."
 But others note that Hanson could face problems from antitrust regulators if it tries to buy I.C.I. Both Hanson and I.C.I. are two of the world's biggest producers of titanium oxide, a pigment widely used in products like paint, paper and plastics.
 Even if there were no antitrust problem, some analysts say, the Government would never allow a company so important to Britain to be acquired and split up. "I.C.I. is not takeover-able," said Charles Lambert of Smith New Court Securities Ltd.
 I.C.I. employs more than 50,000 people in Britain, where it is a leader in research and development. These analysts note that Lord Hanson likes mature businesses with a strong cash flow and is not likely to keep research-intensive businesses like drugs and specialty chemicals.
 Before Hanson's announcement, I.C.I. had shareholder authority to buy back up to 10 percent of its shares. And its executives indicated to analysts this week that they would move quickly to slash costs and prune some lackluster operations.
 
Stock Has Underperformed
 Indeed, some in the financial community have long contended that I.C.I. is too diverse and suggested that its financial performance and stock price would be stronger had it been more aggressive in withdrawing from cyclical commodity chemicals and focused more on higher-potential businesses like specialty chemicals and drugs.
 For years, I.C.I.'s stock has underperformed the market as the slump in commodity chemicals and recessions in Britain and the United States have depressed earnings. Pretax profits fell 36 percent last year, to L1 billion ($1.93 billion) on sales of L12.9 billion ($24.88 billion), and profits in the first quarter of 1991 plunged 52 percent.
 Indeed, with Britain's economy mired in a recession, Prime Minister John Major's Conservative Government, which must hold a general election by mid-1992, has plenty to worry about without a huge acquisition that could threaten jobs and raise issues about Britain's competitiveness.
 Officials of the opposition Labor Party and of unions representing I.C.I. workers called on the Government to prevent Lord Hanson from trying to acquire I.C.I. Some have demanded that he be hauled in front of a parliamentary committee to explain his intentions.
 John Redwood, the Government's Minister of Corporate Affairs, hinted that the Government might block a takeover that would result in I.C.I.'s dismemberment. "Our main concern is to see competitive markets," he said, "but there are other issues that could come up because the law says it is about the public interest."
 
Investors Take Profits
 The possibility of Government intervention and an article in The Financial Times questioning whether banks would lend Hanson the remaining money it would need for a takeover bid apparently caused some investors to decide to take their profits and sell I.C.I. shares, analysts said.
 I.C.I. has made great strides in diversifying out of commodity petrochemicals, plastics, fibers and fertilizers.
 In February, Sir Denys, I.C.I.'s 58-year-old chairman, announced that his company would accelerate its drive to close or sell lackluster operations and to cut costs. And I.C.I. took a $901 million charge.
 But analysts criticize I.C.I. for not doing more sooner and for not taking advantage of the strong market for commodity chemicals in 1987 and 1988 by selling or spinning off a great part, if not all, of that business. "At the end of the day, they still have too much of their business in bulk chemicals," said Jeremy Chantry of Kleinwort Benson Securities.

HEADLINE: Madonna and the Master at Cannes

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby

DATELINE: CANNES, France 

 BODY:
Madonna and Akira Kurosawa: flesh and the spirit. Also, for that matter, spirit and the flesh. To be a show-business legend in your own time, you can't have one without the other. This was what film aficionados might call the subtext of the first week of the 44th Cannes Film Festival, which ends tomorrow night after 12 days of screenings.
 The presence of Madonna added a lot of redeeming lunacy to this year's festival, which has been mostly serious and often lugubrious. Mr. Kurosawa, his productivity undiminished at 81, has been the festival's implacable conscience. Their work was cut out for them. The uncertainty of current business conditions and of the further economic integration of the European Community, scheduled for 1992, somewhat dampened the enthusiasm, if not the hyperbole, of the hundreds of movie traders who came to Cannes this year. 
 Their object: to attend the main competition, subsidiary shows and the Film Market, and to buy and sell the rights to what the trade calls "product," even though many of these haven't yet been made. This year, the still-to-be-produced category includes two big-budget productions, celebrating the 500th anniversary of Columbus's first voyage to the New World. They may or may not be what the New World needs now. 
 This festival definitely needed both the ephemeral razzle-dazzle created by Madonna and her entourage and the prestige conferred on it by the great Kurosawa.
 Like "Rhapsody in August," the Japanese master's new work, "Madonna: Truth or Dare," Alek Keshishian's authorized documentary, now playing in New York, was shown in the main part of the festival but out of competition. It was also the week's second toughest ticket to obtain, the toughest being a ticket to the party celebrating the film's showing. Priorities tend to get confused when Madonna is around. She's not yet a cinema icon; she's a vibrant new public personality who creates the kind of excitement that helps movie makers survive.
 Another sort of necessity entirely is Mr. Kurosawa, who directed his first film in 1942 and appears to be in the midst of a vigorous Golden Age. It's a measure of the true originality of "Rhapsody in August" that it has not been a major festival hit. It doesn't cater to an audience's preconceptions of the new. It's not self-consciously inventive in the way of the films of Werner Schroeter, Lars Von Trier and the other avant-garde directors who come to Cannes.
 Instead, it is distilled, utterly direct, abrasive. It reflects the manner of a man who is no longer interested in superficial effects, only in expressing what is on his mind as efficiently as possible. The film is a message from a director who was born four years before the guns of August were fired in 1914. It is a report from that generation of directors who are supposed to be dead or at least retired and modestly grateful for honorary awards.
 Like "Akira Kurosawa's Dreams," shown out of competition at last year's Cannes festival, "Rhapsody in August" is visually splendid. Unlike "Dreams," though, it is almost willfully austere. It suggests something of the rigor of Roberto Rossellini's late films, though the two men otherwise don't have much in common. It is also a movie that could prompt righteous outrage in some quarters of the United States. At one point or another, there is something in it to offend everybody, including me. Mr. Kurosawa doesn't make it easy to accept man's higher nature, at least in part because the movie doesn't work in the way he seems to have intended.
 "Rhapsody in August," adapted by the director from a Japanese novel, "Nabe-No-Naka," by Kiyoko Murata, is about the dropping of America's second atom bomb, on Aug. 9, 1945, on the city of Nagasaki. Unlike Shohei Imamura's "Black Rain" (1989), in which the effects of the Hiroshima bomb are explicity detailed, "Rhapsody in August" avoids any attempt to recreate the spectacle of atomic holocaust.
 The time is now, and the setting is an idyllic farm on the far side of the mountains outside Nagasaki. Four teen-age children have been parked for the summer with their grandmother, widowed long ago in the Nagasaki raid, while their parents go off to Hawaii to visit the grandmother's dying brother, who became rich in Hawaii as a pineapple planter.
 The Hawaiian household includes the half-American children of the grandmother's dead sister. Kane, the grandmother, now mentally confused in her old age, had 10 brothers and sisters and has trouble keeping them straight, as does the audience, though that's not important.
 When Kane and the children are invited to join the others in Hawaii, she refuses. She doesn't hate all Americans, she says, but she doesn't especially cherish them. Little by little, she begins to tell the children stories about the bombing. Some are grimly factual; some sound like myth. 
 She had a younger brother who, though not caught directly in the raid, lost all his hair from the effects of radiation. He was so embarrassed that he spent the rest of his life in his room in the farmhouse. He was a painter, but his sole subject was a large eye, which Kane describes as "the eye of the flash" they saw on the far side of the mountain on the morning of the raid.
 At a key moment, Mr. Kurosawa shows the audience that eye. It is large and red and fills the sky. The effect is both shocking and magical. It's not an evil eye; neither is it good. It is a presence that hovers over their lives. The youngest grandson later sees the eye in a snake he finds in the mountain pool where Kane's bald brother used to swim at night.
 Kane remembers when a skinny-legged, dwarfish creature showed up at the farmhouse, having fished her nearly drowned brother out of the mountain pool. "A kappa," she says, as if describing a village policeman, "a water spirit." According to Kane, kappas do that occasionally.
 "Rhapsody in August" vividly recalls the atomic holocaust, but entirely by indirection. Though Mr. Kurosawa says he intended that the movie should be about the awakening of the children to the bomb's meaning, the children are less important to the movie than the indirectly evoked bombing itself and the vision of the apocalypse.
 The children, who range in age from late to early teens, remain largely uncharacterized. At first they miss television and the other pleasures they left at home in Tokyo. They are generic children, differentiated only by age, sex and the M.I.T. and U.S.C. T-shirts they wear.
 Somewhat too quickly and obligingly, they begin to explore Nagasaki on their own, looking for evidence of the Aug. 9 raid. It's as if Mr. Kurosawa didn't have time to waste in creating especially compelling children.
 Yet this doesn't interfere with Mr. Kurosawa's extraordinarily heartfelt recollection of the war and what it meant to the generations that survived it. Where the film gets tricky, and even ticklish, is when Richard Gere shows up as Kane's half-American nephew from Hawaii, who has come to pay his respects to his Japanese cousins and to apologize for the war.
 Mr. Gere gives a good, self-effacing performance in a role that's a little unreal. He speaks his own Japanese dialogue easily and is at the center of one of Mr. Kurosawa's most breathtaking moments. 
 During a ceremony honoring the bomb victims, the camera shifts away from the shrine to show a line of ants making a purposeful ant-line toward a rosebush. The ants climb the bushy stalk, single file, to arrive at the magnificent blood-red bloom.
 This may suggest that the ants, like the bomb's victims, have found their peace. However, it is far more effective if left uninterpreted. The film is full of such moments that might have pleased Luis Bunuel.
 When the movie's politics were questioned at a post-screening news conference, Mr. Kurosawa denied any intention to sidestep Japanese responsibility for the war. "We Japanese," he said, "were also the victims of Japanese militarism." The subject of the film, he insisted, is not guilt and responsibility but the horrors of war, in particular of the bomb, which has made possible the absolute end of everything. 
 It is, indeed, a subject about which he has been ruminating for years, most memorably in the 1955 "I Live in Fear," about a man obsessed by atomic destruction, and the wildly garish end-of-the-world nightmare sequence in "Dreams" last year.
 Later, at lunch at the Hotel du Cap in Antibes, sitting on a sun-drenched terrace, looking at the Mediterranean, Mr. Kurosawa expressed satisfaction with the film's reception here. The film maker looks a good 10 to 15 years younger than his age and is ready for a new project.
 He noted that his longtime associate, Ishiro Honda (the director of "Godzilla" and other Japanese sci-fi classics), had directed the stunning ant sequence in "Rhapsody in August." Ants, it seems, are more difficult to direct than dogs, cats and children. Mr. Kurosawa doesn't have the patience for it.
 Nor did he have patience for several grimly insistent autograph hunters who suddenly turned up on the closely guarded hotel terrace. He signed the first sheet of a paper shoved in front of him, then erupted in the formidable style of the man who is called "sensei" ("master") on the set. It was a ferocious but short outburst, after which the appetite, the charm and the concentration returned.

 Immediately after the Nicaraguan revolution in 1979 the Sandinistas changed the name of Managua's baseball stadium. The Estadio Anastasio Somoza Garcia, so titled in honor of the father of the Somoza dynasty, became the Estadio Rigoberto Lopez Perez, for the poet who shot him. For the 11 years of the Sandinista Government, the Estadio was home to revolutionary baseball. Some of the teams were named for Sandinista martyrs or revolutionary battles; on opening day politicians gave impassioned anti-Yanqui speeches. After the Sandinistas lost the elections of 1990, the stadium was renamed the Estadio Nacional; the new Government, it seemed, was eager for reconciliation.
If baseball in the United States has come to be not just a sport but a repository of cultural myths, this is doubly true of beisbol. It is the national sport of Nicaragua, Cuba, Venezuela, Puerto Rico and especially the Dominican Republic, which has produced more professional players proportionate to its population than any other country, including the United States. Baseball in Latin America began in Cuba, brought there by Cubans educated in the United States, but it was mainly spread by United States diplomats, businessmen and Marines. It is strongest where United States influence has been most prevalent, which helps to explain the coincidence of baseball and revolution.
Alan M. Klein, who teaches sociology and anthropology at Northeastern University, calls Dominican baseball "sugarball"; baseball grew as sugar grew there, and most amateur teams are still sponsored by sugar refineries. "The bonds between American and Dominican baseball came increasingly to resemble other economic and political relations between the two countries," Mr. Klein writes.
Although the author draws from social theorists such as Antonio Gramsci and Frantz Fanon, "Sugarball" is not a mere anti-imperialist critique. Mr. Klein concludes that baseball's effects on the Dominican Republic are ambiguous: a United States export dominates Dominican culture, but Dominicans have made the sport their own. The United States leagues draw the best players out of the Dominican Republic and then often prohibit them from playing winter ball in front of the home fans. But once in the ligas grandes, players such as Pedro Guerrero, George Bell and Manny Mota have become Dominican heroes and perhaps the single most important source of national pride.
There is a vivid and affectionate chapter about going to games at Santo Domingo's Quisqueya Stadium, and a wonderful depiction of the Los Angeles Dodgers' recruiting academy east of Santo Domingo, which in addition to sorting and signing prospects serves as a boot camp. There players who may have never before seen plumbing or gotten beyond fourth grade are taught to deal with discipline, teamwork, fame, wealth, gringo culture and race relations and the English language.
"Beisbol: Latin Americans and the Grand Old Game," the first book by Michael M. Oleksak and Mary Adams Oleksak, contains a brief description of the history of Caribbean ball, but the book centers on the fates of Latin players in the United States, with many statistics and stories. It is an enthusiastic, somewhat naively written guide for United States fans of Latin players.
Perhaps the Oleksaks' most intriguing anecdote is that during World War II Joe Cambria, a scout for the Washington Senators, twice rejected a certain Cuban pitching prospect named Fidel Castro. His arm was not major league, Cambria concluded. One can only speculate on the implications of the future President of Cuba playing for the Washington Senators, and not just the effect it would have had on Cuba; a great comic novel begs to be written in which Fidel lets loose his curveball on the American League.

THE BEAUTY MYTH
How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women.
By Naomi Wolf.
348 pp. New York:
William Morrow & Company. $21.95. 
 I am gazing at a glossy, full-color, seven-page advertisement for a new line of cosmetics produced by Ultima II, a division of Revlon sold mostly in department stores. They are called the Nakeds II. The Nakeds offer "HUNDREDS OF SHADES IN EVERY NUANCE OF NEUTRAL . . . FOR WHENEVER A WOMAN WANTS THE LOOK OF LESS FOR SATURDAY" (she's likely to be around trees, bushes and other naturalistic props), "THE LOOK OF MORE FOR WORK" (more money, more competence, hence more facial armature), "OR FOR EVENING, THE LOOK OF WOW!" ("Apply 2 coats of black mascara. Brush the blush in 'Bashful' on apples of cheeks. . . . Line lips with lipliner in 'Smooch.' ").
It's utterly ridiculous -- still, I can't help liking the packaging, those cream-colored makeup containers with black piping that so resemble ladies' hatboxes in the photograph on the three-page foldout. But that's my weakness, and it's there to be played on. How could it be otherwise, Naomi Wolf asks in "The Beauty Myth," a sweeping, messy, vigorous, callow but stouthearted book dedicated to the proposition that the icon of the educated, middle-class woman as wife, mother and tasteful sexual appliance has been replaced by the icon of the educated, middle-class, wage-earning woman as a flaw-free specimen of physical perfection. The operative principle here is that no society ever rights a wrong without finding a new one to put in its place: ours, having yielded ground on matters of social, political, economic and sexual freedom for women, dug in its heels when faced with the more psychologically nuanced issues of female beauty, desirability and self-esteem.
Ms. Wolf, a graduate of Yale who is now a Rhodes scholar at New College, Oxford, believes that from the Cult of Domesticity to the Feminine Mystique to the Beauty Myth and its backlash -- that is, over the past 35 years -- "inexhaustible but ephemeral beauty work took over from inexhaustible but ephemeral housework. As the economy, law, religion, sexual mores, education, and culture were forcibly opened up to include women more fairly, a private reality colonized female consciousness. By using ideas about 'beauty,' it reconstructed an alternative female world with its own laws, economy, religion, sexuality, education, and culture, each element as repressive as any that had gone before."
Ms. Wolf maps out this "alternative female world" by recording just about every form of obsession and exploitation a $20 billion-a-year cosmetics industry, a $33 billion diet industry, a $300 million cosmetic-surgery industry and a $7 billion pornography industry can nurture and supply.
There's the language of upwardly mobile beauty and fitness, austere one moment, sweetly lascivious the next: packed with technological intimidation (makeup containing mock-scientific ingredients such as "reticulin and mucopolysaccharides") and with born-again bullying ("Take the shades from your eyes and face the truth of the situation," says one ad. "Does your flesh wobble and seem dimpled?"). There are the women who take cosmetic surgery to she-devil lengths of pain and desperation, and the many more who empty their pocketbooks daily to look like any and everyone but themselves. There is anorexia and there is bulimia: anorexia alone is said to kill 150,000 American women each year; together with bulimia it afflicts one million a year.
Is this new information? No (as Ms. Wolf's plentiful footnotes verify), but it is information we keep refusing to process, and we must be reminded of it until we begin to do so. As a feminist muckraker and media critic, Naomi Wolf does her work well. But as a feminist cultural historian, she has two big problems. The first is the intellectual equivalent of beauty follies. She overdoes glittery, special-effect metaphors -- beauty as the cult millenarianism; beauty as the Iron Maiden, a body-shaped casket painted with the limbs and face of a young woman that served as a medieval instrument of torture. She is also addicted to cosmetic touch-ups of her thesis in the form of brief quotations and one-liners from critics, scholars and poets through the ages.
I'll put the second problem in question form: Why does every generation frame its recognition of lies and injustice in the claim that no previous generation has ever suffered them so acutely? I believe Ms. Wolf when she writes that "today's children and young men and women have sexual identities that spiral around paper and celluloid phantoms: from Playboy to music videos to the blank female torsos in women's magazines, features obscured and eyes extinguished, they are being imprinted with a sexuality that is mass-produced, deliberately dehumanizing and inhuman."
But I don't believe this is taking place "for the first time in history": it's taking place at this moment in history through the particular methods that media and technology provide. After all, the conventions, excesses and grotesqueries of the beauty industry were securely in place by the 1920's, from the pseudoscientific jargon and faux intime exhortations to the carelessly regulated health and safety standards to the ties that bind advertisers to women's magazines.
As for beauty standards -- from body shape to feature size -- they were a lot more restrictive and bigoted just 25 years ago than they are now, and while Ms. Wolf is right to say that the muscled and worked body in fashion today has its alien and bionic side, the 1950's exaggeration of "natural" female flesh and curves was just as artificial and (if you lacked them) debilitating. One body canonized pseudowomanliness; the other appropriates pseudomanliness.
Beauty is such a strange thing -- it's a fantasy, a pastime and a profession (like sports), and we bring a daunting range of emotions and associations to it. I like the fact that Ms. Wolf ends her book by saying we need more, not less of it. "The beauty myth is harmful and pompous and grave because so much, too much, depends upon it," she writes: we should treat it (and we do, sometimes) like theater and play.
"The Beauty Myth" shows us yet again how much we need new ways of seeing. I regret that it also shows how much we need new ways of writing -- polemics and manifestoes that will make room amidst their facts and theories for the contradictory particulars of each reader's life.

HEADLINE: INDIA'S DESCENT

BYLINE: BY BARBARA CROSSETTE ;Barbara Crossette is the New Delhi bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
UNDER THE WHITE-HOT sky of a Delhi summer, a few thousand thin men in faded clothes and tattered turbans have been waiting several hours in the sun for a political rally. There is no spontaneity or joy here, however. The men and a few dozen listless women are mercenaries of a sort, trucked in from the neighboring state of Haryana on the promise of a few rupees or a free trip to town to provide a sea of faces and applause. The portable crowd belongs to Devi Lal, Haryana's political godfather and the Deputy Prime Minister of India. He's sitting in a shaded pavilion, surrounded by a dozen fawning politicians who are preparing to kick off their campaigns for national elections this week. They are served mango juice.
On the ground, Devi Lal's people, dusty and thirsty and stuck there until the boss speaks, grow restless as speaker after speaker drones on. A few get up and shout for Devi Lal. They want the main event, but they are polite. Men with sticks tell them to sit down. 
 Finally, Devi Lal himself -- a tall, imposing 77-year-old man with snowy hair, dressed as always in crisp white, from his starched kurta shirt to the pointed toes of his Ali Baba slippers -- finally moves to the microphone, three hours behind schedule. The crowd springs to life, applauds appreciatively and cheers lustily at the conclusion. Their job done, Devi Lal's people walk out on the next speaker, the country's Prime Minister, Chandra Shekhar.
Devi Lal -- who fills his coffers with gold coronets and walking sticks of solid silver pressed upon him by constituents, and whose notorious son, Om Prakash Chautala, doesn't hesitate to send out goon squads to intimidate rival candidates -- is a symbol to many Indians of much that is wrong in a democracy that was once hailed as a model for the third world.
No political party or institution is free of the taint of nepotism, criminality and violence, says a retired police official, S. K. Ghosh, in "The Indian Mafia," a provocative new book about organized crime and politics. "In return for a ring of security, our politicians have surrendered their powers to gangsters," says Ghosh, who served under both British and Indian administrations and is now director of the independent Law Research Institute of Calcutta. "As our rulers increasingly fail to redress fundamental economic and social problems, they have to take greater recourse to muscle power to keep the disenchanted masses in line."
The idealistic country of Mohandas K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru is fast passing into history. A deeply troubled India is approaching this week's national election in a mood of cynicism and foreboding. Myths are being exposed and new problems are piling up for the world's most populous democracy, with 844 million people and more than half a billion eligible voters.
Fifty years ago, Nehru argued convincingly for a secular, socialist and democratic state. After independence in 1947, he constructed a foreign policy based on "a special relationship" with Moscow and leadership of the nonaligned nations. Now these pillars of modern India are crumbling.
In several respects, India's descent into confusion and despair mirrors that of its former superpower sponsor, the Soviet Union. Having relied heavily on Soviet experts and socialist theories of development, India now finds itself burdened with outdated technology and uncompetitive industries. The economy is strangled by inefficiency and corruption and saddled with high foreign debts, mounting budget deficits and inflation that soared to 17 percent last year.
A nation of diverse ethnic and religious groups cobbled together by British colonialism, India now seems on the verge of being ripped apart by separatist movements and religious violence. Scores are killed daily in clashes between dissidents and security forces. To maintain order, the Government has been forced to rule three strategic border states virtually by martial law. But the harsh measures only breed stronger resistance.
Indian democracy is being strained as never before by gangsterism and corruption, some of it tawdry. For example, a Supreme Court Justice is the subject of impeachment proceedings for, among other things, taking furniture from an official residence.
Unlike the Soviet Union, India has yet to repudiate unequivocally its past policies, many of which stemmed from an anti-Western, anti-imperialist ideology that stressed development without dependence on multinational corporations or lending institutions. Even after the Soviet turn to the West, Indians still broadly support rules that tightly proscribe foreign investment.
The future is not entirely bleak. Food production, one of India's greatest successes, remains strong, and famine is not even an issue (although malnutrition is). Efforts to privatize and decentralize the economy in the 1980's, while piecemeal, did contribute to a burst of growth, and the country has a considerable number of highly educated professional and technical workers. Finally, despite the strains, India remains a functioning democracy that is at least discussing the issues that, for now, paralyze it.
Many people insist that the country, which has weathered crisis after crisis since its birth in 1947, will overcome these new tribulations in time. "The idea that this country is falling apart should not be taken seriously," says K. Natwar Singh, a former diplomat and parliamentary candidate of the Congress Party, now led by Nehru's grandson, Rajiv Gandhi.
"It has serious problems, but we have the mechanisms, the institutions, the wisdom, the resilience," Singh continues. "The Indian national train won't derail. It might meet with an accident here and there, but it will come out of it."
But some are less optimistic. "In terms of catastrophe theory, you can have a whole series of negative trends, and they can continue for some time in a stable body politic," says Prem Shankar Jha, an economist and adviser to Vishwanath Pratap Singh, the leader of the Janata Dal Party. "But then suddenly you come to a precipice, and you go over. That's the way things are developing in India just now."
J. D. Sethi, an economist and former Government planner, wrote recently that "there is a view that India is one of those societies whose history is coming to an end." While not necessarily accepting so dim a view, he concluded: "Indian society is indeed being pushed into chaos from all directions. Above all, the norms of state behavior and societal values are collapsing."
 IT IS TWILIGHT IN Calcutta on a winter evening. In a park called the Maidan, the electric company has switched on an extravagant display of lights and water called the Fountain of Joy, and everybody wants to have a look. The traffic jam starts a mile away. Cars creep along a road winding through the park, circling the Victoria Memorial Plaza, engulfed by an ocean of humanity.
Stop the car for a moment, and tiny hands reach up to beg; little barefoot bodies with bright eyes, who barely reach the window. An open taxi door invites a crowd of petitioners: the handicapped, slender mothers in dirty saris clutching bony babies with vacant stares, hustlers with myriad gadgets and services to sell.
Somewhere in the background, the fountains play. But they are obscured by a tangle of carts and stalls, heaped with food and drink. Underfoot, the grass has turned to a slippery sea of mud and trampled garbage. The noise is as unremitting as it is deafening, from car horns to the spiels of the food hawkers to the cries of children.
A park, a temple, a market, a city street, a bus stop -- there are few places in urban India where lives do not collide, few places to find privacy or silence. In India's largest city, Bombay, up to 5 million of the metropolitan area's 12 million people are living as squatters in overcrowded apartments, in condemned buildings, on pavements, along the shoulders of roads and on scraps of open land that have somehow escaped development, says Sharad Pawar, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra state.
Ingenuity is squandered on survival. Outside the Taj Mahal Hotel, near the Gateway of India arch in Bombay's historic old harbor, children drag an exhausted, flea-bitten dog from the shade of a parked car and order it to stand on a pyramid of tin cans. Nearby, a woman holds an infant aloft on a pole, signaling to horrified visitors in the air-conditioned rooms above that they should throw money.
In a country where, in 1988, 612 people were packed into each square mile (compared with 66 in the United States), dwindling natural resources must sustain a population growing by 18 million a year. But forests are disappearing as illegal logging goes on with the connivance of corrupt officials, and as millions of poor villagers cut millions of trees for fuel and cremation pyres.
On the drive from the plains of West Bengal to the old British hill station of Darjeeling, the winding road that hugs the mountainside is showered with falling rocks, harbingers of landslides on slopes stripped of vegetation. Women trudge along, bent under heavy bundles of twigs and branches. Every year, they say, they walk farther for fuel. In Darjeeling, which once offered refuge from a pestilential climate, population growth has outstripped supplies of drinking water, and women with water pots hike miles up and down steep hills to distant streams and springs.
The World Resources Institute, a Washington research group, lists India among the world's top five producers of greenhouse gases, which scientists believe are responsible for global warming. In addition to chlorofluorocarbons, India produces large amounts of methane, from solid-waste dumps, livestock and wet-rice cultivation, and carbon dioxide, from fossil fuels and deforestation.
International experts estimate that no more than 10 percent of India can any longer be described as forested. In parts of some states, environmentalists report losses of up to 98 percent of old woodlands, some razed for plantation monocrops, often eucalyptus trees, which consume enormous quantities of water and soil nutrients. Silt from balding, eroding hillsides in the Himalayas is slowly filling in huge river basins, leading to catastrophic flash floods, particularly downriver in Bangladesh.
Cities and industrial sites use rivers as sewers; excess fertilizer and pesticides from farms leach into canals and streams. Maneka Gandhi, Minister of State for the Environment and Forests in the last two Governments, says some of India's greatest rivers, among them the sacred Ganges and the Jamuna, are biologically dead and chemically lethal. To practically nobody's surprise, a plan to clean the waterways, launched with great fanfare in 1986, is falling behind schedule.
According to a confidential report done for a foreign-aid organization, three-quarters of India's water supply is polluted, mostly by chemicals or bacteria. Air quality in big Indian cities now ranks among the worst in the world.
Indian social scientists are concerned at the correlation of corruption, political violence and overpopulation with poor health and education as well as illiteracy -- especially among women -- in one group of backward northern states. In this explosive region -- from Rajasthan to Bihar, taking in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and part of Haryana -- almost every social indicator is a warning.
The region, with more than 41 percent of the national population, has annual population-growth rates generally higher than the Indian average of 2.1 percent, according to the 1991 census. Literacy rates are considerably lower than the national average of about 52 percent. Only 38 percent of the people in Rajasthan and Bihar can read and write. Literacy rates among women are worse: 20 percent in Rajasthan and 23 percent in Bihar. In rural areas, the literacy rate among women routinely drops below 10 percent; in remote areas of Rajasthan, female literacy falls below 2 percent. Demographers say that high female illiteracy is one factor in the failure of family planning.
While calling itself an industrial and technological nation, India has become the world's largest producer of illiterates and child laborers. With a population likely to overtake China's early in the next century, India has no effective national family-planning program. And, no matter what the law putatively requires, there is no compulsory education, even at the primary level, except in a few enlightened areas. A third of its children are born with irreversible malnutrition.
"We are breeding a nation of morons," an Indian development expert said with a mixture of horror and grief.
 THE COUNTRY HAS no shortage of experts eager to tackle its social, environmental and economic problems. But they are consistently stymied by a legendary bureaucracy that, in addition to stifling initiative, often seems more concerned with presenting a picture of a working society than with actually building one. Bunker Roy, whose model rural community at Tilonia, in Rajasthan, became the inspiration for many villages in the semiarid region around it, wrote in The Times of India recently that "simply put, the politician, planner and bureaucrat are lying to the nation."
Thousands of villages that are listed as having drinking water are in reality dry, Roy says, forcing villagers to walk miles for water. Wells may have been dug and pumps installed, he says, but once something breaks down, it's finished. The Government doesn't follow up and the people just walk away.
"Primary-school teachers' quarters are constructed that are never occupied," Roy continues. Doctors who, on paper, are posted in primary health centers in rural areas are more than likely running private clinics in the neighborhood with Government equipment and medicines and collecting a Government salary to boot, he says.
"Roads are constructed that are not supposed to last more than a year, so that they can be constructed every year and shown on the record as new roads," Roy says. "Villages fully electrified on paper have to make do with kerosene lamps."
Prime Minister Shekhar, the head of the caretaker Government leading India into elections, draws attention to India's rural hospitals. "Most of the people are dying because of infection," he said. "In 500, 600 district hospitals, at least you could make one recovery room and one operating theater air-conditioned. Was it not possible in 40 years to do it if there was a will?"
Lakshmi Chand Jain, 65, a follower of Mohandas Gandhi who holds Asia's highest prize for public service, the Ramon Magsaysay Award, recently told a New Delhi audience that 44 years of overly centralized Government have "stifled, if not almost snuffed out, the very breath of freedom."
"We have handicapped millions of people without shooting them, without sending them to the gallows," he said. "The only skill considered necessary for them is the ability to stamp the ballot paper."
In an interview in his closet-size office, where he directs a small business consulting company, Jain talks about the roots of this human crisis. He finds them in the administration of Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first Prime Minister.
"The first error he made was to assume that the next phase of India's emancipation after the British left could be managed without first mobilizing the people and their resources and their energies and their imagination," Jain says. "On the landscape of India, Nehru mounted dams, power plants, steel mills, heavy industry -- all kinds of things that are a credit from a certain viewpoint. But he completely forgot that, apart from the land, there were the people also. The people's own participation -- that never came. Community development became an extension of the bureaucracy. As many of us pointed out at that time, there was probably some development in it, but there was very little community." Strong local government, the bedrock of American democracy, has never been cultivated in most of India.
"In a society where people are in abundance, and the diversity is enormous from village to village, household to household, the mobilization of those people -- their local knowledge, their own resources -- has to be the first step," Jain argues. "In the present scheme it's not even the last step. So we have made our task, which was already very difficult by all reckoning, much more difficult than necessary."
The drift away from the federal spirit of India's Constitution during 40 years of Congress Party rule, particularly under the regime of the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, not only stifled regional growth but also helped to precipitate the separatist movements that India now faces in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and the northeastern state of Assam. Disaffected minority groups, which might have been pacified by greater autonomy, turned in their rage to revolution. "I've never known a time when the integrity of India was so much under strain," says Soli Sorabjee, a constitutional lawyer and former Attorney General of India.
"Kashmir is now beyond solution," says Bharat Wariavwalla, a political and strategic analyst. "We might keep it by force, but mentally it is not a part of India." In prosperous and productive Punjab some disaffected Sikhs talk of returning to Pakistan, reversing the migrations of the 1947 partition, or even of creating a nation they would call Khalistan.
Finally, suffocating central controls have dragged down an economy that was once the envy of much of the developing world. Slow growth and rising joblessness, in turn, are feeding much of the cynicism, unrest and separatism that threaten the nation today.
"You're getting more desperate young men opting for everything from autonomy to secession in more and more parts of the country because they can't get jobs," says Prem Shankar Jha, the economist and political columnist. "They are unable even to get married. They haven't got homes to take their families to. They have no social relevance."
Jha says corruption has been a natural outgrowth of a overcentralized economy, where business generally has to pay "commissions" to politicians and bureaucrats to smooth and speed the process. "Industrialists flock like bees to the honey pot," Jha says. "And the honey pot is Delhi."
Rahul Singh, a columnist and former newspaper editor, thinks that official corruption has undermined the democratic system itself. "Democracy is in danger when the people become so disillusioned with their money-grabbing, cynical political leaders that any other system, even military rule, seems better," he wrote in The Indian Express. "We are close to that moment of peril."
But when it comes to economic reform, India is caught in a snare of its own making. Many people advocate a loosening of central controls and the introduction of modern technology and management. But many other Indians remain suspicious of "imperialist" exploitation. And they cling to the myths, heroes and ideas that contributed to the glorious victory over colonialism.
"The revisionist school of history is now in operation: dump Gandhi, dump Nehru," says K. Natwar Singh, the Congress Party candidate for Parliament, capturing a common sentiment. "They won't succeed," he insists. "You can't dethrone Gandhi. You can't take away Nehru's colossal achievement. He held this country together for 17 years."
 IN LATE MARCH, JUST as India was beginning to gear up for its 10th national election, disturbing reports of a lynching were emerging from a small farming town called Mehrana, about halfway between New Delhi, the national capital, and the city of Agra, home of the Taj Mahal. It was a grisly story, shocking in what it revealed about the brutality of village life and the persistence of violence and discrimination based on caste. The incident at Mehrana spoke to the torment that millions of Indians face daily because of their birth. It illustrates why many of them are for the first time in this election walking long miles under a searing sun, with a few chappatis -- flat Indian breads -- in a knotted cloth for nourishment, to sit attentively at rallies by politicians who promise a social revolution. These are not rent-a-crowd crowds.
In Mehrana on March 27, sometime between midnight and dawn, three young people were hanged on a village tree by their relatives and neighbors, who then threw their bodies on a common funeral pyre. The victims were Roshini, a girl of 16, Brijendra, her 18-year-old lover, and Ram Kishen, 22, a friend who had tried to help them elope.
The charge was not promiscuity, however, but breaking the taboo of caste. Roshini was a Jat, the dominant caste in the area -- and the caste of Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal, a factor in the publicity this story has received. The two young men were Jatavs, a community of outcastes, or Harijans, "children of God" to Mahatma Gandhi. A Jat-dominated village council sentenced them all to death after Roshini vowed to remain with her outcaste partner.
"A Jat girl marry a Harijan?" Roshini's mother told a reporter for the news magazine India Today, when asked whether it would not have been better that her daughter live as a pariah than die. "This may happen in towns, but not here."
There are many such stories in rural India, particularly in the north. A reporter hears them everywhere: accounts of outcastes pulled off bicycles and beaten because they are required to walk through high-caste neighborhoods, or assaulted for entering Brahmin temples or killed for defying any number of discriminatory rules. A civil rights group in Andhra Pradesh recently found that roadside tea stalls were still routinely setting aside separate glasses for outcastes. All of this is against the law.
The Hindu caste system is enormously complex, with thousands of subcastes grouped into four major divisions called varnas. At the top are Brahmins and Kshatriyas, the learned and warrior castes, respectively. They are followed by Vaisyas, the traders and merchants, and Sudras, laborers, servants and others who have low social status but are still in the system.
Under them all are the outcastes, people considered impure and therefore untouchable, who do the lowliest jobs. Among them are the more than 600,000 Indian families who still make their livings emptying latrines and chamber pots, carrying away excrement in buckets on their heads. Another subcaste catches rats. Although the national census does not record caste, social scientists estimate that up to three-quarters of India's people are Sudras or outcastes.
Caste affects everyone, including Indians who are not Hindus -- many of whom tried to escape the system by converting to Islam, Buddhism or Christianity -- and foreigners. On several occasions, I have been subtly but unmistakably served from separate dishes in Brahmin homes.
Every political analyst calculates and writes about "the caste factor" in election campaigns. Groups like the Jats or the Yadavs, also a northern rural subcaste on the rise, function now as ethnic voting blocs do in American politics, giving a voice to previously powerless groups. The growing political influence of Devi Lal's rural Jat community is the most visible example.
This year, the pervasiveness of caste discrimination has been dragged out of the shadows and made an issue by two politicians. One is the former Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh, a high-caste Rajput who is campaigning on the theme of social revolution -- achieved primarily through affirmative action in Government hiring -- as a prerequisite to development.
The other, Kanshi Ram, is an outcaste who says he is tired of knocking at the door of power and waiting for handouts from parties led by Brahmins. Ram's hero and his party's spiritual leader is the late Bhimrao Ambedkar, an outcaste who was educated in law at Columbia University, under the patronage of an enlightened maharaja, and who was chosen by Nehru to head the committee that wrote India's constitution.
Ram's party won its first three seats in Parliament in 1989. This year he has been courted by almost all the major political organizations, which are eager to share his potentially huge reservoir of votes through an electoral alliance. Ram's party has already cut deeply into the traditional lower caste and outcaste "vote banks" of Gandhi's Congress Party.
Many upper-caste Indians excoriate V. P. Singh as a traitor to his own high-caste heritage. That's no great surprise, say Indians in a position to know, considering that comments passed around Brahmin gatherings ("Would you want one of their surgeons to operate on you?") are often crudely derogatory. N. Ram, a leading Indian editor and writer, said that attacks on affirmative action in India could best be described as "racist" in the American sense. And so far, he adds, no one has mentioned affirmative action in the private sector, where company hiring policies are never scrutinized.
"What I am sure of," Singh told an audience in April, "is that our independence, won after a century of struggle, will remain hollow if the power and authority of the state is not deployed in the pursuit of equity."
 THE NARROW LANES THAT lead to what is momentarily India's most famous religious monument are festooned with barbed wire and policed by zealots. The town is Ayodhya, sacred to Hindus as the birthplace of the god-king Rama, the central character of the epic "Ramayana." The building, however, is clearly a mosque, the Babri Masjid.
Sentries stare menacingly at a visitor who is demonstrably not a Hindu. Off with the leather sandals, bag and the watch strap, they say. This may be a Muslim mosque, but the rules are orthodox Hindu. They have been since 1986, when the disputed building, sealed since 1949 after a similar religious confrontation, was ordered reopened by a local court during the administration of the Congress Party leader, Rajiv Gandhi.
Although Rama is almost certainly a mythical character, Hindu militants claim that the pretty little 16th-century mosque was built on the exact site of his birth. Moreover, the militants have drawn up plans for a temple that could be constructed only if the Babri Masjid was demolished or moved, and they have a long list of other mosques they would like to see destroyed.
As a result, the issue has taken on enormous symbolic weight, and Hinduism, the religion of more than 80 percent of Indians, has become a campaign issue for the first time since independence in 1947. The principal beneficiary of the Hindu revival, and the dark horse in this week's election, is the conservative Bharatiya Janata Party, led by the articulate parliamentarian, Lal Kishen Advani.
Electoral support for the Bharatiya Janata Party is drawn in surprising degree from the middle class, now more than 100 million strong and heretofore looked upon as a modernizing influence. But while the new middle class is the source of progressive movements to protect consumers, the environment and civil and human rights, it is also proving to be a recruiting ground for Hindu militancy.
In small towns across north India, shopkeepers fly the Bharatiya Janata Party flag. In cities, affluent women are drawn into revivalist movements. Hindu fundamentalism's best-known firebrand is a woman, Uma Bharati. Her provocative speeches are best sellers on audio- and videocassettes.
"There are many problems the middle class faces," says Prof. Romila Thapar, a historian at Jawaharlal Nehru University, in Delhi. "First of all, theirs was a reasonably quick rise. You get artisans moving up the social scale because they have picked up professions that have become lucrative. They are trying to improve their social status." One of the ways they do this, Thapar says, is to imitate the devout Hinduism of the upper castes.
"The issue of the Babri Masjid will bring up past passions," said Sorabjee, the former Attorney General, recalling the carnage of Hindu-Muslim violence in 1947. "The horror of it all is that I have heard people who should know better say that Muslims have had it too good for such a long time. This trend of intolerance is so unlike the India which we knew."
 WITH THIS ELECTION, INDIA BEGINS the torturous task of redefining itself, laying the foundation of a post-Nehruvian, post-cold-war future. The major question is whether that future will be forged through religious confrontation, caste war and civil strife or through the ballot and Parliament. As India begins its odyssey, the world can neither look away nor assume that the eternal, otherworldly "India of the Imagination," as K. Natwar Singh put it recently, can survive endless assaults on its down-to-earth institutions. "The real India needs remedial measures," he says.

HEADLINE: How to Be the World's Policeman

BYLINE: By COL. HARRY G. SUMMERS JR.; Col. Harry G. Summers Jr., U.S.A., retired, is a distinguished fellow of the Army War College and the author of "On Strategy II: A Critical Analysis of the Gulf War," to be published next February.

 BODY:
ON AUG. 2, 1990, the very day that Iraqi forces swept into Kuwait, Congressional negotiators and the Pentagon agreed to a "peace dividend" budget that would, among other things, slash troop levels by 25 percent over the next five years, do away with six active Army divisions, cut back the Navy to 451 warships from 545, and transfer nine active-duty Air Force tactical fighter wings to reserve status.
The cutbacks continued even as units of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps were ordered into battle positions in the Persian Gulf, complicating what was already a difficult deployment and compromising battle readiness. Although two of its three armored brigades went to the gulf, for example, the Second Armored Division itself was being disbanded; one brigade of the First Infantry Division was being deactivated even as the rest of the division moved into combat. 
 If the war had turned into a slugging match, the United States would have been hard pressed to relieve or reinforce its units in combat. Only Iraq's unexpected collapse saved the budget-cutters from the consequences of their wild gamble with the lives of American men and women in the gulf.
Now, in the war's aftermath, the cuts proceed apace. Will the United States, in its moment of triumph, continue to dismantle the very military machine that made its historic victory possible? That's not unthinkable. We did precisely that after both World Wars. And in the months immediately before the Persian Gulf crisis, the conventional wisdom was that our victory in the cold war had rendered obsolete the large standing military that we had maintained for four decades to contain and deter the spread of Communism.
Saddam Hussein should have knocked all that into a cocked hat last August. While it would be wasteful and probably futile to try to maintain the military we built to stand off the Soviet Union in the cold war, we still need to maintain strong, standing forces capable of projecting our power around the globe. But the weapons and strategies needed to fight and win a war have changed enormously since Vietnam, when we were still constrained by nuclear weapons. Fortunately, if we react intelligently, the changes will allow us to cut the size and cost of the armed forces without sacrificing anything in the battlefield.
AS JAMES MADISON SAID MORE THAN 200 YEARS ago, "The means of security can only be regulated by the means and the dangers of attack." Saddam Hussein failed to understand that "the means and the dangers of attack" had changed dramatically when the Iron Curtain crumbled in November 1989, and his mistake proved fatal. The United States was no longer constrained by fear of a nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union and could wield its military power in a way not possible since World War II. President Bush wasn't kidding when he said the United States wouldn't fight this war with one hand tied behind its back.
Although changes in the strategic environment worked to American advantage in the gulf, these same changes complicate the planning of future United States military strategy. For more than a generation, the Soviet "enemy" defined "the means and the dangers of attack," and thus provided the rationale for the United States military's organization, armament and training. More important, the Soviet threat provided an intellectual rationale for spending hundreds of billions of dollars to support large standing forces and an arms race. The upshot was that air, land and sea forces sufficient to defend against Soviet attack also provided more than sufficient military power to handle lesser threats -- Grenada, Libya, Panama and Iraq. But with the end of the cold war, we have lost that defining military threat.
"The means and the dangers of attack" did not disappear with the cold war's end, as Saddam Hussein's aggression made clear. But they are much more diffuse. Like it or not, a New World Order is at hand in which much of the world seems to be teetering on the edge of anarchy and the United States, as the world's only surviving great power, find itself liable to be forced into the role of the world's policeman.
What sort of military will we need to defend the American homeland and to protect and defend vital American interests? Several basic considerations will be shaping those forces: the destructive potential of nuclear weapons, the effect of geographic location, the battlefield influence of high-technology and, most important, the need for flexibility in thought and action.
 
NUCLEAR FORCES
Nuclear weapons pose the only credible threat to the American homeland, and deterrence of such an attack must remain one of our highest priorities. That said, however, the nuclear era is over, and thus the idea of a "strategic" nuclear triad of land- and sea-based ICBM's and penetration bombers is obsolete.
Even before the end of the cold war, it was becoming increasingly obvious that the civilian nuclear "strategists," with their phantasmagoric notions of nuclear war, had sold us a bill of goods. Their arguments that the "atomic age" had rendered obsolete all previous military theories, doctrines, strategies and battlefield experience sent professional military thought into an eclipse that lasted through the Vietnam War.
But an awareness slowly took hold that the specter of a nuclear battlefield was just that -- a specter with no substance. Among Saddam Hussein's many concerns as he faced off against allied forces in February, the threat of nuclear attack must have ranked near the bottom. No longer weapons of war, nuclear weapons today are useful only as a deterrent against their use by others. That's not unimportant. After all, nine countries -- the United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain, France, India, Israel, Pakistan and South Africa -- now have nuclear weapons, and more nations may soon join their ranks.
But deterrence does not require the thousands upon thousands of warheads now stockpiled by the superpowers. The former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara has argued that deterrence could be achieved with as few as 500 warheads. At present, we have about 20,000. The 1987 Treaty on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, which eliminated 867 United States and 1,836 Soviet intermediate-range nuclear warheads, was a good beginning. An additional 8,000 tactical, short-range nuclear weapons are virtually certain to be eliminated either unilaterally or when arms talks resume.
While the end of the nuclear era may be at hand, however, old ideas die hard. This is true particularly when, as with the $65 billion "strategic" B-2 bomber, they are backed by powerful constituencies. At about $863 million each, these radar-evading bombers' value was dubious even during the cold war, when their designed capacity to deliver nuclear bombs deep inside Soviet territory served at least an ostensible military purpose. The Air Force is now searching for non-nuclear missions for the B-2, but there's nothing it could do that can't be done now by existing B-52's or F-117 fighter-bombers, which, at $42.6 million apiece, are less than one-twentieth the cost of a B-2 bomber.
Still, some people just don't seem to have gotten the message. With painful choices overdue between obsolete nuclear systems and conventional forces, the Bush Administration proposed in its fiscal 1992 budget to maintain funds not only for the B-2 bomber but also for the MX "Peacekeeper" missile and the Trident II and Midgetman ballistic missiles. A total of $9.4 billion, or nearly one-sixth of the Pentagon's entire procurement budget for 1992, is scheduled to be spent on the B-2 and the Strategic Defense Initiative. All this while continuing to scale back personnel and conventional weapons in all the armed forces.
It was a dumb mistake, for these so-called strategic forces fail a primary test: they are not strategic. While of some value as a deterrent, they cannot be used to fight and win a war. As the Persian Gulf war again made clear, America's true strategic forces are its conventional forces.
 
STRATEGIC AIR AND SEA LIFT
Increasingly, however, what makes conventional forces strategic is the ability, as the Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest supposedly put it, to "git thar fustest with the mostest." That depends on air and sea lift, for in geostrategic terms, the United States is an island. If we are to protect vital interests abroad -- the most likely reason for the commitment of United States military forces to combat -- we must first deploy our military overseas to the scene of the action.
That geographical imperative is not always obvious. Working in the Army's War Plans Department in the Pentagon during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, one of my colleagues was bragging about the enormous advantage the United States enjoyed over the Soviet Union in the ability to resupply its allies. With our sea lift and air lift, he said, a capability that the Soviets did not have, we could readily provide military supplies to Israel.
Only when he was led to a nearby map did he appreciate that, as a continental power, the Soviet Union didn't need all that air and sea lift. They could march to the Middle East if they chose to do so. And they could march to Western Europe, South Asia and East Asia as well.
Thus, in the post-cold war, post-nuclear world, the real strategic military headquarters is not the Strategic Air Command at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska but the United States Transportation Command (Trans com) at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois.
Transcom, a unified command that incorporates the Air Force's Military Airlift Command and the Navy's Military Sealift Command, became fully operational only in October 1988. But it proved its worth during the Persian Gulf war. Using C-5 and C-141 jet transports, propeller-driven C-130's and units from the Air Force, Air National Guard and Air Reserve, as well as the commercial aircraft of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, which moved 62 percent of the troops and 27 percent of the airlifted cargo, Transcom flew more than 15,800 missions, hauling more than half a million passengers and nearly half a million tons of supplies.
As in past wars, 90 percent of the tonnage moved by sea. By the war's end, eight Navy fast sealift ships and a total of 164 other ships were moving arms, equipment, ammunition and supplies to the war zone.
However, this very success masks a serious strategic vulnerability. The United States now has more Navy warships than it has cargo ships in its merchant marine. Among the 225 cargo ships in the Maritime Administration's National Defense Reserve Fleet are dozens of World War II Liberty ships in an advanced state of disrepair. As Representative William S. Broomfield, Republican of Michigan, has complained, "Calling a 45-year-old ship which has not run in 25 years a national defense asset makes as much military sense as reintroducing the horse to the cavalry."
We were lucky in the Persian Gulf to have six months to move our war-winning armored forces and their tanks, guns, ammunition and supplies into position. But we can't count on luck. Money needs to be diverted from the ersatz "strategic" nuclear forces into real strategic forces, like C-17 transports to replace the aging C-141 cargo fleet and more and faster cargo ships. Beyond that, what we really need is a revitalized merchant marine. In 1950, American-flagged vessels carried half of the nation's exports and imports. Today, they carry less than 4 percent.

HIGH TECHNOLOGY
Once dismissed as "gold plating," high-technology weaponry proved its worth in the Persian Gulf war. Yet the terrible casualties suffered by the Iraqis serve as a grim reminder of the consequences of failing to maintain the technological edge. And our edge may not be so great as it appeared against the demoralized and disaffected troops of Saddam Hussein.
The lightning allied victory in the gulf obscured the fact that Iraq's South African-supplied G-5 and Austrian-supplied GHN-45 155-millimeter gun-howitzers with their 45-kilometer range far outreached any cannon artillery in the allied inventory. Their T-72 Soviet-supplied main battle tanks and their fighter planes, French-supplied Mirage and Soviet-supplied MIG-29's, were first-rate as well. Although the Iraqi weapons proved no match for our top-of-the-line systems, like the M1-A1 Abrams tank, they posed a deadly threat to less sophisticated systems like the 82d Airborne's M-551 Sheridan tanks, the Marines' M-60 tanks and the armored personnel carriers and Bradley fighting vehicles.
When the gulf war began, moreover, 30 nations had more than 1,000 tanks and 28 had at least 1,000 artillery pieces. At least 14 third world nations now have ballistic missiles like the Scud, and more are trying to acquire such weapons. With the collapse of the Soviet threat, deployment of the Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative is no longer called for. But anti-tactical ballistic missile systems that outperform the Patriot surface-to-air missile are essential to our future defenses.
The problem is that developing new high-tech weapons is expensive, and already the Congressional Budget Office is warning that current defense budget projections are inadequate for the task. A prime example is the F-22, the Air Force's new Advanced Tactical Fighter. Assuming that Congress is willing to back the program, the Air Force plans to buy 650 F-22's at a cost that could reach $95 billion. But even before the contract was awarded last month, the Congressional Budget Office reported that, with shrinking military budgets, the Air Force could equip only 18 of the 26 fighter wings it plans to maintain after 1995.
Military planners will face thousands of similar predicaments in coming years, as they struggle with falling budgets. What they have to avoid is trying to sustain the current military on a tighter budget. A smaller, better-armed military is one thing. A larger but underfinanced military is a recipe for disaster.

CONVENTIONAL FORCES
A key element in the overwhelming performance of our conventional forces in the gulf has gone virtually unnoticed. Without the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Defense Department Reorganization Act, which placed the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the chain of command and strengthened the role of the regional military commanders in chief (like Gen. H. Norman Schwarz kopf), it is doubtful that we could have achieved the integration of military command that was so crucial to the military's performance. When you think about it, the civilian secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force and their uniformed chiefs of service were almost invisible during the gulf war. For the first time in American military history, a war was a truly integrated effort.
Now, the same reorganization should be extended to the services themselves, to sweep out atomic-age anachronisms. The nuclear types who have dominated the Air Force since World War II have to give way to the tactical fighter pilots and airlifters who represent the real strategic forces today. And the dead hand of Adm. Hyman G. Rickover has to be pried from the Navy's throat and his nuclear submarine force subordinated to the surface battle groups that provide real, strategic power-projection capability.
When the atomic age began, the Army, fearful that it was losing its mission, grasped in desperation at "rapid reaction" forces, a division of troops that was kept on constant alert and could be deployed in a matter of hours. Now it's time to let that go, along with the glamorous but long obsolete "airborne mafia," like the 82d Airborne, which have dominated postwar military thinking. In the armor-dominated modern battlefield, the Army is again the decisive military force, the only one capable of destroying an enemy and its will to resist. The Army should leave rapid deployment to the Marine Corps, a role that the marines are ideally armed, trained and equipped to perform.
Finally, the "total force" concept embracing the active military, National Guard and reserves needs rethinking as well. Reserve forces, which essentially kept house for the combat units, were crucial to the success of the gulf war. But for the Army, at least, the war in the gulf showed that we cannot rely on part-time training for combat units.
For example, National Guard brigades for the Army's 24th Infantry Division and First Cavalry Division were not ready to go and had to be replaced with active Army units. And when the two National Guard units finally were activated, they were deemed uneady for combat and dispatched to the National Training Center in the Mojave Desert. It is an issue that must be resolved because current plans call for one-third of the Army's existing combat divisions to be placed in the reserve forces.
JUST AFTER WORLD War II, promising to cut the fat and not the muscle, President Harry S. Truman and Louis A. Johnson, his feckless Defense Secretary, proceeded to slash military spending to the bone. They created our first hollow military. Fighting units were reduced to two-thirds strength, new weapons were ignored and maintenance was allowed to slip.
When the Korean War broke out in June 1950, thousands of Americans paid for this penny-pinching in blood, a tragedy I witnessed firsthand. My commander was killed for want of a less-than-a-dollar spare part. When the driver was shot, his tank retriever stalled and could not be restarted because it lacked a solenoid. When he and the crew tried to escape they were gunned down. Korea may well be the "forgotten war," but the terrible price of false economies must never be overlooked.
As Mark S. Watson pointed out 40 years ago in his history of World War II, "The facts of war are often in total opposition to the facts of peace. . . . The efficient commander does not seek to use just enough means, but an excess of means. A military force that is just strong enough to take a position will suffer heavy casualties in doing so; a force vastly superior to the enemy's will do the job without serious loss of men."
The Persian Gulf war revalidated that truth. Whether America will have an "excess of means" in the future remains to be seen. It will depend not only on the size and shape of America's post-war military but also on the pitfalls and dangers of the strategic environment.
"Know the enemy and know yourself," said the Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu more than 2,000 years ago, and "in a hundred battles you will never be in peril." Although we cannot always "know the enemy" we can know ourselves. As we draw down our NATO forces in Europe, saving money, we also limit our ability to respond quickly in emergencies. As we close military bases at home we limit our ability to mobilize and train our reserve forces.
The "peace dividend" won't disappear; defense cuts planned for the next five years will produce a cumulative saving of $243 billion. In any case, military spending as a percentage of the gross national product is projected to fall to about 3.6 percent by 1995, the lowest since before the Second World War. But as George Washington wrote in 1780, "There is nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to meet an enemy." We ignore his counsel at our peril.

HEADLINE: The Annapurna Experiment

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK; THOMAS J. LUECK reports on real estate for The Times.

 BODY:
FOR all I had imagined the soaring splendor of Nepal, little prepared me for the hardscrabble pragmatism of my first night in the Himalayas. My lodging was with Dhan Bhadar Churung, a small entrepreneur at the forefront of an international experiment in conservation, tourism and economic development.
Mr. Churung is the owner of the Bankara Guest House in Dhampus, a village in central Nepal poised on a low peak beneath the Annapurna range, which includes some of the world's highest peaks. Like villagers throughout the region, he is taking part in the Annapurna Conservation Area Project, designed to give them greater responsibility for their fragile mountain environment. 
 Conservation groups in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa are scrutinizing the Annapurna experiment, now in its fifth year. Although it is too soon to judge it a success, many believe the approach could provide a better alternative to the intensely restricted national parks or government-financed resorts that have been established by many poor nations to combine environmental management with tourism.
On this night, Mr. Churung steamed rice and lentils for 10 guests, each of us paying less than $2 for dinner and a simple wood frame dormitory bed on which to unroll our sleeping bags. With his three children stoking the stove and waiting table, the innkeeper peered through a haze of wood smoke and candlelight, and talked business.
Dhampus and the entire Annapurna region have been swept up in a trekking boom. With a population of only 40,000, subsisting mainly on ancient agrarian terraces built into the mountainsides, and without roads, electricity, telephones or plumbing, the region was visited last year by over 35,000 foreigners, more than any other area of the Himalayas.
"Tourism has been good for us, and it is the best hope for our economy," said Mr. Churung, whose country has a per capita income under $200 a year and ranks among the five poorest in the world.
The relative prosperity of Dhampus was apparent in his lodge. A small new wing has increased its capacity from 8 to 12 bunks. His wood stove has been refitted with a boiler that heats water for bathing with the same precious wood fire used to cook. In the back the latrine has been spruced up.
But despite the modest improvements, Mr. Churung must deal with cultural crosscurrents that threaten the Himalayas. Trekkers still litter. Foreigners still ask for hot food and water at any hour, even though burning wood stoves constantly would hasten the random deforestation already apparent on nearby slopes.
"Visitors sometimes don't understand our limits," he said. "We must protect our environment because it is the most important thing we have."
As I learned in a 12-day trek through the Annapurna region, in conversations with villagers and lodge keepers and interviews with international environmental experts, the Annapurna experiment is sinking deep roots in the economic and social life of central Nepal, a region steeped in Buddhism, Hinduism and and the culture of Gurung, its predominant ethnic group.
My visit to the region was in November 1989, before violent political demonstrations threatened Nepal's ruling King a year ago. The civil unrest, centered in Katmandu, Nepal's capital, led to sweeping changes in the nation's Constitution and its first general election in more than 30 years, which took place last Sunday.
Despite the political turmoil, the Annapurna region has continued to attract foreign visitors, with a 30 percent increase in the number of trekkers last year. In the meantime, the villages of the region are moving rapidly, sometimes awkwardly, toward a cultural blend of mountain tradition and first world enterprise.
"This is not a living museum," said Chandra P. Gurung, a geographer and acting director of the Annapurna project. "The idea is to empower people in the villages, give them some economic benefit and make them accountable for the environment."
Environmental experts say a key element of the project is that it makes human development as important a goal as the preservation of rare wildlife species, forests and mountain vistas.
"The Annapurna project reflects a complete change in perception among people interested in conservation," said Michael Wells, a consultant to the World Bank who assesses environmental projects in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. We met plodding up the Annapurna footpaths, notebooks in hand.
"People have begun to realize that conservation is a hard sell to poor people in the affected areas," he added. "If you don't move them out, you have to to think about their livelihood."
The Annapurna Conservation Area Project, covering 500 square miles of the Nepali Himalayas, was established in 1986 with grants from the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation, a nonprofit group in Nepal that operates independently of the nation's monarchy, and the World Wildlife Fund.
Most trekkers first become aware of the project at the immigration office in Nepal, where all foreigners planning to visit the region are charged 200 rupees -- roughly $6 -- for a trekking permit. Mr. Gurung, the acting director, said proceeds from the permit sales would be used by the project for its operations in the Annapurna region.
By most world standards, the cash injection has so far been small. Trekking permit fees raised $250,000 last year, and the two nonprofit sponsors have provided $420,000 in grants over the last two years, Mr. Gurung said.
But while the project has hardly made the Annapurna villages prosperous, development projects are springing up throughout the region.
In Gandruk, a popular layover where more than a dozen lodges have been built to accommodate trekkers, a new medical center has been paid for in a 50-50 split between the project and local innkeepers and farmers. A small hydroelectric generator in the village was turned on last year, providing the only electricity in the region.
Ancient footbridges, critical links in a land of torrential rivers where walking is the only way to get around, have been repaired or rebuilt, and the project is providing free seedlings for tree nurseries, intended to reduce deforestation.
IN Kuldigar, a village near the Annapurna tree line, solar panels have been installed to generate heat in several lodges, with part of the cost paid by the project.
More important, many experts on third-world development maintain, is a Nepali form of grass-roots political clout that the project is trying to foster in Annapurna villages. "We are trying to make people in the village true custodians of their environment," said Mingma Sherpa, who manages environmental programs in Nepal and Bhutan for the World Wildlife Fund in Washington and was the first director of the Annapurna project.
One focus has been the traditional village council -- a mukhiya in the Gurung language -- which once ruled most aspects of community affairs, but had seen its power eroded, villagers said. The project has turned to the councils to adopt and enforce rules on tree cutting and other aspects of land management, giving them the power to levy fines or criminal charges against violators. It is estimated by project officials that in 5 years 15 Nepali villagers have been fined by their village councils for illegally cutting trees or killing deer.
Lodge owners in the region, all of whom have undergone training by the project on food preparation, sanitation, bookkeeping and other aspects of dealing with trekkers from around the world, have also formed their own committees in each of the villages to standardize prices, thereby eliminating the intense bargaining in many other areas of Nepali commerce.
The strategy in the Annapurna region differs sharply from programs in some other nations, Indonesia and Mexico among them, where government money has gone into building elaborate resorts designed to meet the standards of affluent foreign visitors. The affect has been to separate the visitors from poor local inhabitants.
Another approach, taken by Nepal's mountainous eastern neighbor, Bhutan, has been to impose high fees on trekkers and restrict their movements, thereby limiting the number of tourists and their contact with inhabitants.
Mr. Wells said the Annapurna experiment was also a departure from the national parks that other poor nations have established to protect wildlife and attract tourists.
In many cases, he said, governments that have set aside the parkland have relocated entire villages in the process, creating deep and abiding resentments. And while the parks have attracted foreign tourists, he said, land and game management has too often required the use of military troops or armed guards to prevent encroachment, foraging and poaching by local inhabitants.
To be sure, the Annapurna project has not proven an immediate cure for the environmental problems of the region. Although lush birch, juniper and bamboo forests cover vast expanses of the mountains, allowing trekkers to experience a rich diversity of topography and vegetation like few other corners of the globe, deforestation has scarred the mountain landscape.
The impact has been most severe at high elevations. Mr. Sherpa said unchecked tree cutting in the 1970's around the Annapurna Base Camp, a sweeping plateau that is nestled between the highest peaks of the Annapurna range, caused a rock slide in 1979 that destroyed three trekking lodges, then the only structures in the area. The trekkers have not been deterred; indeed, the Annapurna Base Camp, at 13,000 feet above sea level, has become a popular destination for those trekking for 10 days or more in the region, and 12 other lodges have been built to replace those destroyed in the slide. But no trees have taken root on the frozen plateau.
I reached the base camp with a group of fellow trekkers under a dense cloud cover on a late November day. At dawn the next day, with the temperature hovering at slightly over 15 degrees, we emerged from our down sleeping bags, walked out of our tin-roofed, unheated lodge and confronted Machupachure, Annapurna 1 and the three other principal peaks of the Annapurna range. Pastel waves of the new light cascaded off their snow walls. Like my companions, I stood transfixed, shivering in silent wonder.
But for all its stark beauty, a visit to the high Himalayas provides another reminder of the difficulty of environmental management. Having already lost much of the sparse tree cover, officials of the conservation project have banned wood-burning at the base camp and in all high villages. Cooking must be done with kerosene, carried up the mountains on the backs of barefoot Nepali porters.
Some experts say the most critical questions for the Annapurna experiment involve the cultural influence of thousands of trekkers on traditional culture, particularly on the children of lodge keepers and others who are in constant contact with the tourists.
So far, the result has been a complex cultural dynamic. In Dhampus, for example, Mr. Gurung's 18-year-old son, whom the father occasionally relied on for English translation in our conversations, has managed a striking proficiency at Japanese, German and French, and seemed to have mastered the idioms of American slang well enough to fit in at Yankee Stadium.
Mr. Gurung's younger children, age 10 and 12, who were studying for math examinations in the village school, found themselves drawn into an ebullient tutoring session by Marten Bjork and Lena Hansson, gregarious Swedish law students who were my companions in the early days of the trek. The Gurung family bade us farewell with warm wishes, which none of us doubted were heartfelt.
But Mr. Gurung and other villagers said there was reason for worry. Some young people in the villages are known to have developed a taste for the large, potent bottles of beer that are transported to all lodges by the native porters to be sold to trekkers.
And the relative wealth of the trekkers, many of whom walk through the region clad in boots, backpacks and other paraphernalia worth more than most Nepalis accumulate in a lifetime, has created intense emotional conflicts among youngsters.
"Trees can be restored and the land can be managed, but if we lose our traditional culture it is gone forever," said Mr. Gurung. "This is our most important challenge."
TO combat the problem, he said, training sessions for lodge keepers have emphasized the importance of respect for local traditions. Trekkers are urged to use simple Nepali phrases to greet and and say farewell to their hosts.
In most lodges, English-language signs have been hung prominently reminding trekkers to abide by the rules of the conservation project. The tourists are asked not to litter, not to defecate in the mountains or forests when a latrine is available and to keep their consumption of warm bathing water, in most cases dispensed from buckets, to a miniumum.
Schoolchildren in the region have been dispatched before each of the region's busiest trekking seasons -- from mid-September to late November and from mid-March to late April -- to pick up litter from the mountain footpaths. The result has been striking: in my 12 days, trekking at least six hours each day, I found virtually no litter at all.
One memory of the Annapurna region, among many, is of sunset in Kuldigar, 10,000 feet high, after a day walking through bamboo forests, beneath waterfalls and across footbridges built centuries ago. Ten trekkers -- American, British, Israeli and Japanese among us -- sat exhausted from the day's journey, watching high clouds float through the Himalayan peaks.
The only sound in the fading light was the slight, steady huff and puff of Nepali porters, approaching on the trail below, carrying kerosene, bottled water and other first world provisions to higher ground.

HEADLINE: Ecotourism: Can It Protect the Planet?

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER; ERIC WEINER writes about travel and transportation for The Times and other publications.

 BODY:
EAGER to see unspoiled natural habitats, threatened animal species and rare birds, travelers have forsaken loafers for hiking boots and surged into the world's game preserves, remote rivers and jungles. Statistics are not readily available, but by some estimates as many as five million Americans took a trip last year with an environmental theme.
Yet the growing interest in these areas can be the very thing that threatens their beauty, and even their survival. Litter mars Himalayan hiking trails. In Kenyan game preserves, vans loaded with tourists kick up dirt as their drivers jockey for position. Cruise ships crowd the waters off the Galapagos. 
 And so more and more Americans are taking responsibility for preserving these special places. They are planting trees in Nepal, clearing hiking trails in Ecuador and providing alternative income in Africa and Asia for subsistence farmers, who would otherwise cut down trees for farmland, only to have the topsoil quickly wash away.
A new word has entered the lexicon of travel: ecotourism. Born of the environmental movement, ecotourism promises the traveler an opportunity to help save the planet and get a suntan in the process.
"There is a definite trend toward more meaningful vacations," said Markly Wilson, a travel consultant in Stamford, Conn. "The typical baby boomer has done Hawaii and the resort in Jamaica and they realize something is missing."
In the process, a kinder, greener tourist is emerging. The ecotourist is asking tougher questions of tour companies, perhaps choosing only those that funnel a portion of their profits to local conservation projects. The ecotourist is more likely to choose low-impact transportation: a canoe rather than a cruise ship, walking rather than a Land Rover. And the ecotourist prefers small, locally owned lodges to huge hotels or resorts owned by multinational corporations.
However it is defined, ecotourism makes up a small percentage of all travel, and some critics dismiss it as a marketing mirage. Yet nearly 500 companies, most quite small, offer trips with an environmental theme, and new ones are cropping up each year. Destinations like the rain forest of the Amazon Basin, the Galapagos Islands and Costa Rica are especially popular, but there are also paying customers for the remote Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, the frozen terrain of the Northwest Passage and the untouched islands of Lake Nicaragua, with its abundant bird life. Nonprofit groups such as the National Audubon Society, the Nature Conservancy and the American Museum of Natural History are attracting more travelers. A recent survey by the World Wildlife Fund found that of 436 travelers interviewed in Costa Rica, Belize, Mexico, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic, 46 percent said they made the trip to see the country's natural attractions.
By enabling people to see the world's fragile regions firsthand, conservation groups say they are more effective in promoting their causes. "How can you save the rain forest if nobody knows about it?" said Richard Ryel, president of International Expeditions, based in Alabama.
Although this nature-based travel is in its infancy, conservation groups see it as a potentially viable alternative to the agricultural and commercial development that endangers many pristine lands. The economic incentive to protect the environment can be a powerful one. Kenya, for instance, is stepping up its antipoaching effort in large part because tourism is such a valuable commodity. According to the World Bank, each lion in Kenya's Amboseli National Park accounts for $27,000 in revenue.
"Ecotourism is one way local people can make money off natural resources while protecting them," said Elizabeth Boo, an ecotourism specialist at the World Wildlife Fund and author of a landmark 1989 study on the subject. "But it will succeed only if nature remains in a relatively pristine state."
This makes the concept of ecotourism compelling to many conservationists: it offers local residents a way to forsake their destructive practices for more environmentally sound ones. On Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, turtles once slaughtered and their shells sold to tourists are now housed in a preserve where visitors pay to see them.
When residents of Bermudean Landing in Belize discovered that a high concentration of rare howler monkeys was living nearby, they created a sanctuary, built a visitor's center and produced a guidebook on a desk-top computer. The Kuna Indians transformed a tract of virgin forest in southern Panama into a wildlife preserve, though it has not drawn large numbers of tourists because of the nation's political upheaval.
In Belize, in Central America, environmentally based tourism has become a national priority. The number of tourists entering the country has increased from 63,000 in 1980 to well over 100,000 last year. Many come to see the world's only jaguar preserve and its second largest barrier reef. The country recently created a new cabinet-level post, Minister of Tourism and Environment.
Costa Rica is viewed by many experts as a model for ecotourism. For a small country, roughly the size of Vermont and New Hampshire combined, it has an immense variety of wildlife, with 1,500 species of trees, 850 types of birds and 6,000 kinds of flowering plants. The national park system covers nearly 20 percent of the country, and there are several private parks as well. Costa Rica is also politically stable, adding to its appeal..
As in many of the world's parks and game reserves the entrance fees in Costa Rica are quite low, ranging from a few cents to $2.75. Many conservationists -- and even tour operators -- believe higher fees would not only encourage good land management but also limit crowds. Rwanda, in contrast to tourist-crowded Kenya, charges some of the highest fees in the world: $170 a day to enter the Parc National des Volcans and view its famous mountain gorillas. The high fees, which account for much of the nation's revenue, have enabled the government to add anti-poaching patrols and reduce the number of poaching deaths. The nation gets $1 million in annual park fees from visitors and up to $9 million in indirect revenue from tourists, according to the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit policy research center.
But plants and animals are by no means the only concern of the tour operators. "We don't think you can look at ecotourism without looking at the local people," said Virginia Hadsell, who directs the nonprofit Center for Responsible Tourism in San Anselmo, Calif., and encourages tourists to look at ethical issues as they travel. She stressed using local accommodations and hiring local people as guides. "Nobody can interpret their country better than a native," she said.
 One area where indigenous people have a stake in tourism is Kakadu National Park in Australia, where aboriginal groups have the ultimate authority for which of the 3,000 religious-art sites are open to visitors.
Concerned about the quality of their trips, many ecotour operators support limiting the number of visitors allowed in natural parks -- even if means losing business. "It's like limiting the number of people in the opera house," said Victor Emanuel, who owns a tour company with his name. "If it holds 500 people and you let 1,000 in, the opera house is damaged and people don't enjoy the show anyway."
Bhutan has the world's most tightly controlled tourist industry. It limits the number of tourists to 4,000 a year and charges visitors about $200 a day.
To some companies, ecotourism is just a new marketing term for what they've been doing quietly for years: a trackless type of travel to natural habitats where nothing is left behind but footprints. Others say that ecotourism also means improving sites visited.
Many of these operators have specialized in adventure travel, and the line between it and ecotourism can be blurry. For years Sobek Expeditions has been running rafting trips down Chile's Bio-Bio River, one of the world's wildest. When the organization learned of plans to dam the river, it formed the Bio-Bio Action Committee to try to block the dam project -- for environmental as well as commercial reasons.
There are some common themes among operators: most emphasize environmental education, for example. But while some trips require little expenditure of energy by their participants, others are more work than play. Earthwatch, for example, recruits about 3,000 paying volunteers each year to help scientists on its 130 projects.
Along with traditional backpacking trips, the Sierra Club runs 70 "service" trips. Travelers spend half their time working on conservation projects, such as clearing new trails on California's Santa Cruz Island or documenting archeological sights in Colorado.
NOT all tour companies are convinced that ecotourism is the wave of the future. Sobek recently began offering 11 "environmental trips" to the Brazilian Rain Forest, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. But the trips have not been as popular as anticipated. "People don't want to spend their hard-earned money being lectured," said Richard Bangs, president of Sobek.
Some conservation groups do use their trips to espouse their particular agenda. John Decock, director of the Sierra Club's travel department, said the amount of proselytizing on such trips depends on the individual guide. Overseas Adventure Travel contributes $200 from each of its safaris to the African Wildlife Foundation. Victor Emanuel donates part of the fee for Latin American tours to specific conservation efforts. Other groups take a nonpartisan approach. One relatively new private operator, Ecotours, prefaces its brochure by noting that it "doesn't serve as advocates of a particular conservation, nor does it dwell on the ethics of deforestation or development."
The National Audubon Society, which runs two dozen trips each year to the Amazon, Caribbean and Antarctica, has written a "traveler's code of ethics." It mandates at least one tour leader for every 25 people, limits travelers from getting within 20 to 30 feet of animals like seals, walruses, otters and tortoises and prohibits buying animal products like snakeskin and tortoise shells.
SOME critics contend that the sudden interest in ecotourism is easily exploited. For instance, the United States Virgin Islands recently ran a $5 million advertising campaign, highlighting the islands' environmentally sound setting. But the islands in fact have a dismal environmental record and have been under court order for six years to comply with Environmental Protection Agency clean-water regulations, according to Kim Helper, an E.P.A. spokeswoman. One conservation group called the advertising campaign "ecobunk."
Ms. Boo of the World Wildlife Fund said she would like to see certification of companies claiming to offer environmental tours. But she concedes that developing such a standard would be a "huge challenge."
Meanwhile, tourism is just reaching some parts of the world. More ships are being added each year to the small fleet that visits Antarctica, although so far the prohibitive cost of Antarctic expeditions has controlled the numbers. A 15-day journey with Society Expeditions can cost as much as $12,000, excluding air fare.
The Galapagos Islands, with hundreds of unique species of plants and wildlife, have drawn an increasing number of tourists, taking a toll on the land, according to many conservationists. Last year, there were nearly 50,000 visitors to the Galapagos, even though the Ecuadorean Government, which owns the islands, has had an official limit of 25,000 in place for years. Meanwhile, drawn by the economic opportunities that the tourists represent, the islands' local population has tripled in the last decade. At 14,000, it continues to grow at 12 percent annually.
Dozens of ships now ply the waters; as many as 17 have been counted clustered around one spot. In the past decade, about 100 new plant species have been inadvertently introduced on the island, threatening to wipe out indigenous species, according to the World Wildlife Fund study. And although littering is prohibited, more waste is washing up on the shores. Marine turtles have died after swallowing plastic bags, having mistaken them for jellyfish.
"This is ecotourism gone awry," said Mary Lou Higgins, a program officer with the World Wildlife Fund. "There is just constant growth and the island can't take it."
While stricter enforcement of the limit on the number of tourists is being considered, some operators say a better solution is higher park fees and better supervision of tourists. "You can take 100 people to a place and trash it or take 100,000 and not know they were there," said Mr. Ryel.
 
BOOKS THAT HELP PLAN A TRIP
Two recent publications serve as good guides to environmental travel.
"Environmental Vacations: Volunteer Projects to Save the Planet" by Stephanie Ocko (John Muir, 1990; $15.95, 231 pages, paperback), describes different kinds of nature tours, from archeological digs to sea research, and discusses programs in a general way. Specific operators are listed in the appendix, along with a list of endangered species.
More information: John Muir Publications, Post Office Box 613, Santa Fe, N.M. 87504; (505) 982-4078.
"Eco Vacations: Enjoy Yourself and Save the Earth" by Evelyn Kaye (Blue Penguin, 1991; $22.50, paperback, 242 pages), is a listing of 80 organizations that offer environmental tours. Each entry describes the organization, age range, qualifications for participants, price range and what participants provide. Tours are also categorized by topic, which is useful.

HEADLINE: Brazil's Forests in the Balance

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE ;JAMES BROOKE is chief of the Rio de Janeiro bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
WITH "green tourism" expected to triple in the Amazon basin in the 1990's, environmentalists in the region's largest city are weighing its impact on the fate of the forest.
Aided by reports of farmers burning the rain forest, the world's discovery of this isolated region is well-established. Visitors, largely Americans and Europeans, come to the Amazon to fish for piranhas, study monkeys in treetops and fall asleep at night listening to choruses of jungle birds. 
 Manaus, a humid, riverfront city that stagnated after the collapse of the rubber boom in the early 1900's, now ranks after Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo as the Brazilian city with the most international air links. On May 27, Varig, Brazil's international airline, will inaugurate a weekly flight connecting Manaus to Los Angeles and San Francisco. Already, flights link Manaus to Miami and nine Latin American nations.
Brazil's national tourism authority, Embratur, based in Brasilia, is making nature tourism its priority this year, and Manaus hoteliers plan to double the number of five-star hotel rooms to 3,000 by 1999. The number of foreign tourists coming to Manaus had been growing steadily from 12,000 in 1983 to 59,000 in 1989, before dropping last year to 39,357 -- a decline that has been largely attributed to the country's economic disarray. The economy is expected to have little impact on Manaus' tourism industry this year. The number of cruise ships stopping at Manaus has also increased -- in the winter of 1982-83, one ship called here; 21 called in 1988-89. On the surface, the impact of tourism on the sea of rain forest that laps at the edges of this state capital of one million people is minimal. Almost entirely forested, Amazonas state sprawls over an area three times the size of France.
"Green tourism is a good thing, but not something you can count on for protecting a lot of forest," said Philip M. Fearnside, an American ecologist who studies deforestation here at the National Institute for Research in the Amazon. "Tourists find walking around a few acres to be enough. That doesn't provide economic justification for preserving hundreds of square miles of forest."
For reasons that have little to do with tourism, satellite surveys show that only 5,334 square miles of forest were burned in 1990 -- the lowest level in recent years. In 1989, 7,273 square miles were burned. Seeking explanations, analysts cite Brazil's economic slowdown, an increase in rainfall, making it more difficult to clear the forest and to burn trees, and a new Brazilian Government policy that discourages burning.
However, many people versed in the Realpolitik of environmentalism say green tourism does help conservation.
Forming the embryo of a powerful lobby, the number of Manaus travel agencies catering to tourists quadrupled in the last five years to 67. By 1999, tourism is expected to become the state's largest source of international exchange.
"If we have a large contingent of people visiting the Amazon, ideas will change," said Silvio Magalhaes Barros, president of Emamtur, the state tourism authority.
Aware of the growing tourism lobby, Gilberto Mestrinho, the new governor of Amazonas state, has moved away from the confrontational stands that the five other state governors in Brazil's Amazon region often take on environmental issues. A 35-year veteran of political life in Amazonas state, which makes up 44 percent of Brazil's Amazon region, Mr. Mestrinho has displayed a fine nose for future trends.
According to a recent study by the Organization of American States, the number of foreigners participating in nature tours in the Amazon basin, which includes parts of Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Suriname and Guiana, is expected to increase from 123,000 in 1988 to at least 375,000 by 1999. In a poll of 436 international travelers at Latin American airports, the World Wildlife Fund found that 47 percent cited nature destinations as an important factor in vacation planning.
Although tourism is a labor-intensive industry, some critics predict that its benefits will bypass the Amazonians, either the Indians or the caboclos -- peasants who fish and farm along the region's riverbanks.
"ALL the profits go out of the area, and the local communities are left by the wayside," said Diana Propper de Callejon, Brazil's representative to Cultural Survival, an international organization dedicated to defending indigenous groups. "Local groups should be given investment shares in tour companies."
In one effort, a Manaus environmental group plans to train caboclos to work as park guards and ecological guides in the Jau National Park, a vast wilderness area 150 miles upriver from here.
"The idea is that the caboclos will depend on the conservation of the park, which is the largest in Brazil," said Leonardo Lacerda, a planner with the group, the Fundacao Vitoria Amazonica .
Mark J. Baker, owner of Ecotour Expeditions of Cambridge, Mass., said that the tours not only provide employment, but also "provide justification for the newly emerged park system in Brazil."
"Brazilian parks have often been paper parks," Mr. Baker said, referring to parks that appear on maps, but do not have guards, guides or trails.
Another fear is that uncontrolled green tourism will result in the overcrowding and degrading of the same wilderness areas that attracted visitors in the first place. One site, the Janauary Lake, across the Rio Negro from Manaus, is often cluttered with boats visiting giant water lily pads.
"Carrying capacity is the key word," said Silvana Campello, a Brazilian biologist who administers programs in Brazil for the United States' Nature Conservancy. "Ecotourism is not the destination, but what you do when you get there."
But caveats notwithstanding, most environmentalists said that tourism improves the prospects for survival of the forest. They predict that tourists -- foreign and Brazilian -- will create an informed international constituency for its defense.
"It is easy to sit in an air-conditioned room and say, 'We need to save the trees,"' Eugene Aull, a tourist from New York, said as he relaxed from a river trip. "There is incredible poverty down here. You have to give them something in return."
Peter N. Lahanas, a University of Miami biologist who served as tour guide, added: "These people are more informed, they will have a real image when they get back. The next time someone knocks on their door asking for money for the rain forest, they will give. "
 
HEADING DOWN THE RIO NEGRO
 
A River Journey
 Every Tuesday, the Tuna, a flat-bottomed 85-footriver boat, departs from the quay at Manaus's Hotel Tropical and heads up the Rio Negro for an exploration of the Anavilhas Archipelago, the largest river archipelago in the world. Taking side trips in powered canoes or on foot down forest trails, travelers see immense lily pads, wild orchids, jungle birds, alligators, jute plantations and stands of wild rubber trees. During the day, they can swim in the river or trawl for such Amazon fish as tucunare.
The Tuna has 10 cabins, each with private bath. Prices, including meals, are $549 a person for a three-day cruise, and $989 for a six-day cruise. Reservations can be made through Brazil Nuts (800) 553-9959.
 
Getting There
Lloyd Aereo Boliviano, (305) 374-4600, and Varig Airlines, (800) 468-2744, fly to Manaus from Miami for $930 round trip. Starting May 27, Varig will fly to Manaus from San Francisco and Los Angeles, for $1,958 roundtrip. -- J. B.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Corporate Relocations;
Heads or Torsos Remain While the Limbs Move On

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
MET LIFE had good and bad news for Manhattan last month. First the good news: Its headquarters would stay on Madison Square. Then the bad news: Some 4,000 jobs would not.
This split decision by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company illustrates a new complexity in corporate geography. 
 There seems to be less in the way of lock-stock-and-barrel relocation and more of the divided operation, in which a headquarters is maintained in New York City but many central-office functions -- not just the back offices -- go elsewhere.
"It's a quiet exodus," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "These are companies that never say, 'We're leaving town.' They're still here. But it's the hollowing out of their labor force. What remains is the head of the company. Many parts of the body -- the legs, arms and other key appurtenances -- are shifted somewhere else."
The chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Rosemary Scanlon, said: "In the late 1980's, there was an enormous national trend to hollow out corporations, so New York may not be all that exceptional. When I look at the whole corporate headquarters phenomenon of the 1980's, we had very few move-outs."
But the maintenance of a headquarters in New York, while significant, may mask a general trend to shift employees out of town.
"The scope of operations that a company finds necessary to keep in proximity to headquarters, that grouping has narrowed," Mr. Ehrenhalt said. "And the grouping that companies are willing to forego having in the immediate vicinity has broadened."
The broadening has occurred as a result of advances in computers and telecommunications. "That has made it possible to divorce many activities that have to do with record-keeping and transaction-handling from the location of the headquarters and still maintain control," Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
"That has made activities of the headquarters footloose," he said. "They are no longer anchored in New York. They can be spun off and located in whatever area has a competitive advantage. That's a major concern for the future because New York has traditionally been the nation's premier clerical capital. This means that many of the 600,000 clerical jobs in New York are at risk."
BY early summer, Gamco Investors expects to move most of its operations and some 90 employees from 655 Third Avenue, at 42d Street, to the International Corporate Center at Rye, 555 Theodore Fremd Avenue, near the border with Harrison, N.Y. The center is being developed by the Gateside Corporation of Rye, headed by Norman Feinberg.
It may be that a few employees, particularly research analysts, will remain in Manhattan. "We are in the financial-services business and New York City is still the international financial center," said Doug Jamieson, executive vice president of Gamco, a subsidiary of Gabelli Funds. "That's why I'd say we're anticipating having some presence in New York City. But for the most part, we'll be relocating to the Corporate Center."
Perhaps the clearest example of a footloose -- and hollowed out -- operation is the ITT Corporation, which once had 4,000 employees in its headquarters at 320 Park Avenue, between 50th and 51st Streets. It is now a smaller company, and since it left Park Avenue last fall, has maintained two "World Headquarters," each designated as such.
Some 250 employees work in the ITT Building, 1330 Avenue of the Americas, at 54th Street. This is the former ABC Building, now owned by the Shuwa Corporation. And 150 employees work at 100 Plaza Drive in Secaucus, N.J., part of the Harmon Meadow Corporate Park, developed by Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus.
"The dual headquarters is operating quite effectively," said James P. Gallagher, vice president and director of public relations. "Everybody is over their initial trepidation. Employees who have gone over to New Jersey have settled in and are quite pleasantly surprised by how much they like it."
"Employees who went over to Secaucus are no less important than employees at the Manhattan office," he added. "It's just that their jobs are such that they are not required to be in Manhattan on a daily basis. We save a bit of money because the space is less expensive over there."
A shuttle bus runs between the buildings several times a day, Mr. Gallagher said, noting that "we obviously give the fax machines quite a workout." Several senior executives, including the chairman, Rand V. Araskog, keep offices at both locations.
"I'd be hard pressed to come up with the percentage of business they do in one place or the other," Mr. Gallagher said. "But it's gotten to the point where, if you want to see or talk with Mr. Araskog, you first ask, 'Where is he?' "
Mr. Gallagher said that no serious thought had ever been given to quitting Manhattan entirely and that he was not quite sure" that Fax technology could "ever replace the effect of a face-to-face meeting and a handshake across the table."
This month, the Home Insurance Company said it would move 150 employees in its claims division to the new Exchange Place Centre, at 10 Exchange Place, in Jersey City, which has been developed by the Prudential Property Company of Newark. Home's headquarters, with 1,200 employees, will remain in lower Manhattan, at Maiden Lane and William Street.
Nearly 1,500 jobs at Metropolitan Life are bound for New Jersey -- Bridgewater, Paramus and East Hanover -- as the result of the impending renovation of the insurance company's 59-year-old North Building, on Madison Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets. Another 1,500 of the 4,000 employees who work in that 29-story building will be relocated elsewhere around the country. The other 1,000 jobs will be eliminated. Five thousand Met Life jobs will remain in New York City, in the landmark tower across the street from the North Building and in the adjacent South Building, at Madison Avenue and 23d Street.
THE company is not only renovating the North Building, at a cost of up to $150 million, but also its Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town housing developments, between First Avenue and Avenue C, 14th and 23d Streets. "From a real-estate point of view, Met Life is putting a lot of money into its New York properties," said Charles Sahner, manager of public relations.
Commonly, a headquarters core remains in Manhattan while other operations move to less expensive space elsewhere.
In something of a twist on that, the corporate core of Macmillan Inc., a subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation, is moving to Greenwich, Conn.
Meanwhile, the bulk of the staff in the giant publishing company will remain in the Maxwell Macmillan Building, 866 Third Avenue, between 52d and 53d Streets.
"The operations that we have in New York at this point in time we have no intention to move out," said David H. Shaffer, president of the Maxwell Macmillan Group. "They are editorial or they have a heavy orientation around advertising -- people who need to be in New York for the most part."
About 90 people will eventually move to the new quarters at 55 Railroad Avenue, a 129,000-square-foot building owned by Pontiac Associates of Greenwich.
Mr. Shaffer said the relocation would involve the "traditional corporate functions": executive, personnel, legal, accounting, tax, technology, treasury. "It was convenient that they be in Manhattan but not vital," he said.
There is another relocation twist to this story. The space that Macmillan is taking on Railroad Avenue was vacated by Amax Inc., the metals and energy company.
And where did Amax headquarters go from Greenwich? To the Pan Am Building, astride Park Avenue.

HEADLINE: A New Program Tries To Catch Welfare Fraud

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
THE County Social Services Department is receiving statewide attention for a program to prevent welfare fraud
The program, called the Front End Detection System, has tightened the review process for welfare applicants by training workers to spot suspicious responses that could signal potential abuse. 
 In the seven months since the program began, 1,887 applications for public assistancehave been more closely scrutinized, and 908, or 48 percent, have been denied or terminated.
County taxpayers have saved $1.6 million because of the new program, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke said at a news conference last week.
 
$5 Million in Savings
 The program is expected to save Westchester taxpayers $5 million this year, Mr. O'Rourke said, adding that state and Federal taxpayers would save an additional $7 million in their shares of public-assistance payments.
Mary E. Glass, the county's Commissioner of Social Services, who developed the concept, has been invited to present her ideas before the New York Welfare Fraud Investigators Association and the New York Public Welfare Association. State Senator Mary Goodhue has recommended the program to the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, L.I., as a budget-cutting measure.
The new system "is not an attempt to deny welfare to anyone who needs it," Mr. O'Rourke said. "But in an economic crunch, it is only fair to look at the way we use taxpayers' money." Westchester residents, he said, "cannot afford to underwrite people who want to use the welfare rolls and who don't deserve to be there."
The county received 29,532 requests for public assistance last year, and many were given special scrutiny, social-service administrators said last week. They were reluctant to disclose details of the new detection system for fear the information would be used for fraud.
 
Existing Patterns of Fraud
 But Nancy Shull, the department's director of field operations, said "red flags" were identified by studying existing patterns of welfare fraud by clients already in the system, and then applying the information to new applicants with the help of computers and old-fashioned investigative techniques.
"We looked at the tape match, using our computers to compare which people on assistance also had taxes being withheld by an employer," Ms. Shull said, referring to information the department receives from the state. In cases in which an applicant reported living at a particular address, Ms. Shull said, department workers were dispatched to check the facts by knocking on the door. In one instance, Ms. Shull said, a family reporting they were homeless were found to have a house in Connecticut.
The fraud-detection system is the newest phase of a larger reform effort in the county to reduce welfare dependence and to take an innovative look at the way it is administered. The change was prompted, in part, by the 1988 Family Support Act, which required that job and educational programs be part of welfare services.
 
Studying for Their Degrees
 In Westchester, the Moms on the Move program has tested 800 women receiving county support and found 46 percent ready for a college-level program, Ms. Glass said. Five hundred are now enrolled in special education and training programs, including 300 studying for their degrees at Westchester Community College in Valhalla.
The Pride in Work program has identified able-bodied welfare recipients who can work for their checks. Ms. Glass said that last year 2,370 individuals contributed 518,000 hours working for towns and community organizations in the county.
She called the new fraud-detection program an important addition to the welfare-reform effort in the county. "Fraud detracts from the integrity of the product," she said, "and makes people who must pay for this crazy."
A properly run welfare program "should help people who need help and do it very, very well," she added. "People should not look at our welfare budget and be suspicious."

A WALK IN PARK HILL
 Park Hill, one of the country's earliest planned residential communities, dating from 1888, will hold its second House and Walking Tour today from 11:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Last year for the first time, the historic Yonkers neighborhood overlooking the Hudson River was opened to the public for tours, led by a local architect.
Once again Stephen F. Byrns, a Manhattan architect, will conduct one-hour exterior walking tours at noon, 2 and 4 P.M., discussing the wide variety of architectural styles, the history and development of the enclave and the geological and other natural features of the area.
 Because of winding, hilly, tree-lined streets and its nearness to Manhattan only 20 minutes away, Park Hill has attracted many artists, writers, architects and musicians of many races and economic levels. Altogether, the neighborhood, about three-fourths of a square mile, has 1,400 households, about 300 of them in co-ops, the rest in single-family homes.
 "Although the lots average only an eighth of an acre, there is a great deal of privacy," Mr. Byrns said, "because of the mature plantings and the changes of level in the terrain."
 Four houses will be featured: an 1898 Colonial Revival mansion with a domed and polychromed dining room ceiling; a 1901 Shingle-style house with a huge fireplace; a 1921 Colonial Revival home with a copper-shingled roof; and another Shingle-style residence built in 1910 with a densely beamed ceiling. All the homes are furnished appropriately to their periods and styles, and all the stained glass, decorative woodwork, balconies, staircases and other integral features have been scrupulously maintained.
 Visitors may inspect the interiors, unguided, all day. The houses will be staffed with volunteers, and the street where tickets will be sold at the intersection of Hillside Drive and Park Hill Avenue will be closed to traffic. From the Cross County Parkway West take Exit 1, or from the Saw Mill River Parkway South take Exit 4A, Rumsey Road. From either highway, continue south on Rumsey Road to a fork; bear right to the stop sign and Park Hill Avenue. Admission is $12.
 
ENDING WITH THE BLUES
 Today's headliners in the last of the Sunday Jazz Series at the Schoolhouse in Croton Falls will be Della Griffin and Her All-Stars. Ms. Griffin specializes in blues, and she also plays the drums. Joining her in the 7 P.M. performance will be Gynne Michaels, a vocalist; Mac Goldsberry, a saxophonist; Dave Braham, an organist, and Randy Johnston on guitar.
 The Schoolhouse is on Owens Road, and tickets are $20. Discounts are available for students, the elderly and groups. Call 277-8477 for reservations or more information.
 
CRAB COURTSHIPS
 Making love at midnight, by flashlight, while being observed by a group of interested bystanders is the lot of horseshoe crabs who attract nature mavens. Beginning just after midnight Saturday, Alison Beall, curator of the Marshlands Conservancy in Rye, will lead a very quiet group to the courtship site on the sandy shores of Long Island Sound, where the mating and egg-laying ritual will take place. Participants will meet at the Conservancy on Route 1, just south of the Rye Golf Club. They should take flashlights and insect repellant, and wear clothing appropriate to the weather. It could take a while before the vigil produces results. Call 835-4466 for more information.
 
DEALING WITH NAZI PAST
 "Germany Today: How Has it Dealt With Ethical Dilemmas Presented by Nazism?" is the subject of a lecture at 8 P.M. Wednesday by Dr. Marion A. Kaplan, professor of history at Queens College in New York City.
The program is the last in a series offered by the Rockland Center for Holocaust Studies on the theme of resistance to resurgent Nazism. It will take place at the Center, at 17 South Madison Avenue in Spring Valley in Rockland County.
Dr. Kaplan, a graduate of the City University of New York, has devoted many years to research on German-speaking Jewry, and she has written several books on the historical roles of European Jewish women. Her talk is free. Call 356-2700 for more information.
 
ART OF HAPPIER WORLD
 "Visions for a Better World" is an art exhibition by children from kindergarten through eighth grade attending schools throughout northern Westchester. Eighty drawings, paintings, collages, posters, photographs, prints and mixed-media works will be on display today through June 21 at the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts.
 The purpose was to elicit the children's ideas and attitudes about a better world, one in which people of all races, religions and colors live together in harmony. They were encouraged to express their thoughts on preserving the environment, providing food and shelter for everyone and dealing with the technological challenges of the future.
 A reception will be held today from 3 to 5 P.M. at the center, on Old Bedford Road in Golden"s Bridge. Viewing hours are Mondays through Fridays from 9 A.M. to 10 P.M., Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. The phone number for more information is 232-5740.
 
NEWBORNS ON THE FARM
 Springtime at Muscoot Farm, when new baby animals and birds are in profusion, is a treat for young children. At 2 P.M. today the staff will conduct a program in which children will see newborn baby calves, lambs, piglets and newly hatched chicks. There will be demonstrations of feeding and care, children can see the chick hatchery and they will be able to feed corn kernels to the older ducks and geese.
 The farm is run by the County Parks Department on Route 100 in Somers. There is a picnic area, and admission and parking are free. To reach the site take I-684 to Exit 6, go west on Route 35 to Route 100 and turn left. Proceed one-and-a-half miles to the entrance.
 
FOLK MEETS METAL
 The four members of Boiled in Lead perform an intense brand of rock on a variety of instruments, applying their unusual style to traditional folk tunes, to original material and to samplings of Serbian, Armenian, Swedish and Thai music picked up on their travels.
 They will give a concert on Friday at 9:30 P.M. in the Towne Crier Cafe at 62 Route 22 in Pawling. Admission is $12.50. Call 855-1300 for more information.

Protest on Dorm Plan Splits Fraternity Groups

DATELINE: LEWISBURG, Pa.

 BODY:
Bucknell University is sending letters to more than 5,000 alumni to counter what university administrators say are attempts by 10 fraternities and sororities to hamper fund raising.
The national fraternities have sent letters urging alumni not to contribute to the university. 
 The president of the university, Gary A. Sojka, estimated that the protest could cost Bucknell up to $100,000 in lost contributions. The fraternity chapters here are trying to distance themselves from the protest, chapter leaders said.
The national organizations say they acted after Bucknell, in May, moved the rush period from the freshman year to the start of sophomore year.
 
 'Something Special' About Year
 "It is widely recognized that there is something special about the freshman year," Mr. Sojka wrote, "and that it is not unusual or inappropriate to ask students to become oriented to the institution before becoming too heavily involved in too many activities that are intense, emotionally exhausting and time consuming."
The national groups contend that the move was based on an assumption that the fraternity system is inherently bad and that students have to be protected from it until the sophomore year. Students, the groups pointed out, can join all other organizations at Bucknell in their freshman year.
"Any time our organizations are denied access to members for an entire year, we are concerned," said Margaret Watkins, national executive director of Delta Gamma sorority in Columbus, Ohio. "It is discriminatory to students to say, 'You can join other groups, but you cannot have access to the Greek system.' "
The director of programs for Phi Gamma Delta, Thomas DesJardin, said the move limited rights of association. "Our issue is not specifically with Bucknell," he said. "We can't let that first domino fall and be fighting it on 100 campuses instead of one."
Bucknell is trying to create alternative living arrangements. A plan formulated by a committee including national and local fraternity representatives was presented to the trustees on May 4. The board has not voted on it.
 
To Widen Membership
 The plan would include the fraternities in the dormitory system by requiring resident assistants to be in all houses and a resident manager to oversee the assistants. The plan also urges the chapters to sponsor activities other than parties, and it calls for chapters to coordinate admissions so that every student applying for membership is admitted somewhere.
In their letters to alumni, the national organizations said that the recommendations indicated a lack of support for the fraternity experience. "Instead of working closely with the nationals and the students on campus," Ms. Watkins said, "they took the other tack."
Mr. Sojka rejects allegations about a hidden agenda to abolish the system. "The board last year affirmed the value of the Greek system," he said in an interview last week, "and it is very clear the system is not in jeopardy here."
Mr. Sojka called the national groups' response to a perceived threat "an 11th-hour coordinated attack" that left him "with the anger of someone who feels betrayed, abused and personally insulted."
 
'Their Chapters Are Guests'
 "It's upsetting when people who are far from our campus actively interfere with our efforts," he said. "They may have forgotten that their chapters are guests on this campus."
Ms. Watkins said, "It was not an unusual occurrence" for the national office to contact alumni. But she added: "We do not ask our alumni to withhold financial support. It doesn't make any sense for us to sabotage the university."
Ms. Watkins's organization sent letters to its alumni advising them to let administrators "know your continued support for Bucknell depends on their satisfactory support of this situation."
The president of the Interfraternity Council, Denis Maguire, a sophomore economics major from Bath, Me., said administrators did not intend to shut the system. "They've made that clear several times," he said.
David Skena, vice president of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter and co-chairman of the implementation committee, said, "The whole idea of a hidden agenda is a baseless construct by the nationals to play on the worst fears of Greek alumni."
Mr. Skena, a junior economics and political science major from Murrysville, added, "At the time the nationals should be most ready and anxious to help us, they are denying the reality we've already accepted."

HEADLINE: Blair Soyster and Terrance Fiore Wed

 BODY:
Margaret Blair Soyster, a daughter of Eliza S. Soyster of McLean, Va., and Dr. Peter Soyster of Cambira, Calif., was married yesterday to Terrance Michael Fiore, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Dominic M. Fiore of Manhasset, L.I. The Rev. Jane Soyster Gould, a sister of the bride, officiated at St. John's Episcopal Church in the Georgetown section of Washington.
Mrs. Fiore, 39 years old, is known as Blair. She is a partner in the New York law firm of Rogers & Wells.

HEADLINE: Bottom-Fishing in the Gas Patch

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
If natural gas ever had a chance to move closer to center stage in supplying the nation's energy needs, the time is now. The war in the Persian Gulf exposed anew America's vulnerability to imported oil. Five years after Chernobyl, nuclear power is still shunned. And global warming has further darkened the cloud over coal.
Cleaner and cheaper than oil, natural gas has become the favored fuel among manufacturers and power generators -- but only ideologically. Despite reserves in the United States and Canada that could last 50 years or more, gas has taken a back seat to oil, supplying only 23 percent of its fuel needs in 1989. A tangle of regulations has choked demand, produced shortages and kept prices low and most gas producers too small to vie for lucrative long-term industrial contracts. And unless it can overcome its reputation as an unreliable long-term fuel source, the gas industry will blow the nation's best chance for clearer skies, lower fuel bills and fewer geopolitical scares in the future. 
 "In many ways, the natural gas industry has been its own worst enemy," said Kenneth L. Lay, the head of the Enron Corporation and perhaps the country's most outspoken proponent of shifting the economy toward gas.
But his company, the nation's largest company devoted almost exclusively to the gas business, thinks it has found a way to make the most of the industry's hodge-podge of gas patches. To woo big users -- the electric power generators that are the best shot for gas to replace oil -- Enron is building what it calls a "gas bank." Instead of deposits, Enron pools supply commitments from producers for varying lengths -- two years, six years, eight years, say. Enron then stitches these commitments together, pitching some of its own supplies into the pool, to create long-term contracts of 15 years or more for industrial users.
 
'A Portfolio of Supplies'
 "We're conducting an activity like asset-liability management at a bank," said Jeffrey K. Skilling, a former consultant at McKinsey & Company who joined Enron last year to help set up the gas bank. "We have a portfolio of supplies and a portfolio of markets. To the buyer, it's all coming from Enron in the sense that Enron has a corporate guarantee behind the contract."
For Enron, with $13.2 billion in revenues in 1990 and $9.8 billion in assets, the plan is part of a wide-sweeping vision to sells and deliver gas to industrial America and to build and operate the power generators that keep their plants humming. Eventually, it even hopes to sell compressed natural gas to a host of service stations for use in cars, buses and trucks.
If it pulls off these ambitious plans, as many on Wall Street and in the industry are betting, Enron could point the way to the long-forecasted bright future for natural gas and give the country the gift of reduced dependency on foreign crude that has eluded Washington for more than a decade. Enron predicts the gas industry could cut this reliance by at least three million barrels a day of oil by the end of the decade -- a bit more than the country now imports daily from the Persian Gulf.
"Natural gas probably has the greatest potential to displace foreign oil of any alternatives over the next 20 years," said the 49-year-old Mr. Lay. "But we can't realize that growth unless we package our product to meet what the market needs."
Since it formed its gas marketing group two years ago to package these long-term contracts, Enron has signed up about 35 producers and more than 50 customers, including six buyers and two suppliers in the last week, Mr. Skilling said.
 
Premium Prices
 Because gas is much more economical than oil, industrial customers and power generators are willing to pay a premium for a guaranteed extended supply. Some Wall Street analysts say Enron has sold some gas in fixed-price, 10-year contracts at an average price of as high as $3.50 per 1,000 cubic feet. In today's depressed market, gas is selling for $1.30.
As an intermediary, Enron could insure a tidy profit as long as it maintains a comfortable spread between what it pays and what it sells gas for. With limited reserves and resources, many producers are squeezed, living hand to mouth by selling supplies on the open market, where buyers have the upper hand. Eager for the cash advances offered by Enron, some are willing to lock in prices slightly higher than those on the open market for a few year to keep their businesses alive.
Analysts said the gas services unit contributed to Enron's 49.3 percent increase in the first-quarter earnings, excluding transactions not related to operations, to $101.5 million.
Some on Wall Street are so enthusiastic about these and other prospects of the company that they have sharply increased 1990 earnings forecasts. Ronald J. Barone, a managing director at Kidder, Peabody & Company, thinks Enron will earn $3.70 a share this year and $4.35 in 1992, rather than the $2.90 for both years that he had projected last month. Curt Launer, of Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette Securities, raised his 1992 estimate to $5.15 a share.
And while market values of most natural gas companies are slumping, Enron's shares have been trading not far below their all-time high of $62.75, set last November. They closed Friday at $58.25.
Still, some producers wonder whether Enron can sign up enough producers to keep its customers in gas. The healthiest producers are unlikely to sign up with Enron because they would rather hold out for higher gas prices than get locked into a long-term commitment at a fixed rate. And if prices do spurt, even some weaker producers may not be so eager to give up potential sales for the security of a predictable cash flow.
 
Harvesting the Needy
 That leaves Enron the hard-luck cases. "Enron is replacing commercial banks, which no longer loan on reserves," said Jeff Sandefer, president of Sandefer Offshore, a small oil and gas producer in Houston with 25 employees. "Some companies are in such trouble they can't borrow enough from Enron to get them out of trouble. Others are more bullish on prices and don't want to give up the up side to do a deal with Enron. That's where we are."
Enron, however, says there are plenty of needy producers for it to draw on. Few of the nation's 2,000-plus producers escaped unscathed when a mild winter and new discoveries of gas fields in Alabama, Oklahoma, New Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico forced prices down 20 percent from a year ago.
What is more, producers are still reeling from the lower prices that followed the Government's decontrol of gas prices in the mid-1980's and a supply glut that has persisted since 1981. The surplus developed when gas prices jumped in tandem with crude oil. When many gas users responded by switching back to coal or fuel oil, a drilling binge sparked by high prices collapsed and pipelines and producers were stuck with massive supplies and few customers. To save the industry from collapse, the Government eventually canceled long-term contracts amounting to more than $8 billion owed by pipelines to producers.
The long-term gas contract became nearly extinct and producers resorted to plying the spot market, where 80 percent of all gas is now sold, under contracts that typically are for 30 days or less, with some as long as five or six months.
But without ironclad guarantees for 15 years or more of supply, lenders have refused to finance the construction of gas-fired power plants for utilities. And even if prices were to rise enough to stimulate drilling, producers might resist making long-term pledges. Unlike the 25-year life cycles of gas fields in Canada and those of 200 years in Indonesia, American gas fields often give out within 10 years, or as few as two in the Gulf of Mexico.
Even so, taken together, reserves of natural gas in North America are far more abundant than crude oil by most accounts. The Energy Department estimates that proven supplies of recoverable gas in the United States would last less than eight years at current consumption rates, or just as long as the nation's known quantities of recoverable oil. And many industry executives and analysts say that new discoveries and technological improvements have increased the supply to 50 years or more.
 Nevertheless, oil continues to provide 40 percent of the country's energy needs. The United States consumed about 6 billion barrels of crude last year, 42 percent of it imported, according to the Energy Department. That compares with about 19 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, with all but 1.5 trillion cubic feet, from Canada, produced domestically.
 
A Connected Champion
 But Mr. Lay, for one, hopes to alter those proportions. And his political influence could help his cause. A former economics professor and head of energy affairs at the Interior Department, the Republican casts a long shadow in Washington and in local politics and counts the President among his acquaintances. He helped orchestrate last year's economic summit in Houston for President Bush. His connections clearly helped get ideas championed by the natural gas industry included in the National Energy Strategy crafted earlier this year by the Administration.
Although industrial customers are generally wary of the gas industry, having been burned badly in the helter-skelter of deregulation, Enron has moved to blunt some of their worries. Enron removes producers from the picture by guaranteeing long-term supplies and reduces the risks associated with drawing on only one supplier by allying with many. And it is able to fill any last-minute gaps that may surface in a contract with its own gas and, in fact, says about 20 percent of the gas pledged in long-term contracts will come from its own reserves.
While buyers are responsible for setting up their own deliveries, Enron -- as the country's largest pipeline network, it ships 18 percent of daily gas supplies -- can be of service. Half of the gas sold by the gas bank so far will be shipped over its pipeline. And its role as a pipeline gives it access to critical information about pricing gas.
 
The Biggest Deal
 The gas bank's biggest deal so far is with Florida Power and Light, which ordered 343 million cubic feet of gas a year for 15 years, enough electricity a day for 1.7 million homes. The New York Power Authority has agreed to buy 34 million cubic feet of gas a day for 23 years, starting in January. The deal enabled the power authority, New York State's largest electricity producer, to win a bidding competition to build a new power plant in Suffolk County that, when completed in 1994, will produce 150,000 kilowatts a day for the Long Island Lighting Company. That utility currently generates 70 percent of the electricity it produces from oil-fired plants.
Richard M. Flynn, chairman of the power authority, said the Enron contract "will be a key factor in our efforts to reduce New York's dependence on foreign oil and diversify its fuel mix for electricity production." Despite its growing alliance with often forlorn gas producers, Enron has taken precautions to minimize its risks. After spending several million dollars and 18 months on legal research, Enron came up with a plan under which it legally acquires the rights to specific gas reserves from producers under what are called production payment agreements. That way, Enron provides money for producers to invest in other gas development while avoiding losses if any of its producers stumble into bankruptcy.
Little of the money comes from Enron's coffers. Much of the cash is coming from big pension funds, insurers and credit companies, which buy securities backed by Enron's fixed-price gas contracts, just as they buy securities backed by home loans from mortgage bankers.
 While it is still too early to tell if Enron can create a market for long-term gas deals, many are betting that it can. "They've done a lot of business," said Mr. Sandefer. "They've placed a lot of money, hundreds of millions of dollars."
Mike Naeve, who specializes in energy issues as a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, in Washington, and who is a former commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, agrees. "My view is they are making a dent," he said. "One way they are making a dent is in the development of sophisticated hedging and packaging techniques that enable them to enter into these transactions. Clearly they are a leader in that area. A lot of people are watching Enron to see how it works."
And if others pile into the gas banking business, if nothing else to keep their customers from signing up with Enron, as some analysts expect, it may be only a matter of time before long-term contracts become a fixture of the gas world once more.
 
 
A NEED FOR NEW PLANTS
 Part of Enron's plan for creating a market for long-term gas contracts depends on utilities' need to build new gas-fired plants. Some energy analysts say the timing is just right.
Gas-fired projects are scarcer than those fueled by coal and nuclear energy. For nine years, until 1987, the Government banned construction by utilities of gas-fired plants, fearing that conversion to gas under deregulation would renew shortages that gripped some regions in 1977. Utilities have built few gas plants since, discouraged by the lack of long-term contracts that lenders insist upon. And many regions had plenty of electricity, thanks to the overbuilding of capacity in the 1970's.
The industry may be ready to build again. "Demand for electricity is growing faster than in the mid-1980's," said Mike Naeve, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom in Washington and a former commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. "There is an opportunity for gas to fill that void, especially given the environmental benefits."
New technologies make gas very efficient. Modern combined-cycle plants include one gas turbine and a second powered by heat from the first one. Their operating costs are up to 30 percent below those of oil- or coal-fired plants.
 
 
FROM TEXAS TO SCOTLAND, A SPRAWLING GAS EMPIRE
 From searching for new gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico to building the world's largest electricity plant powered by gas in Scotland, Kenneth L. Lay has assembled a sprawling empire since the 1985 merger that created Enron.
The deal married two big pipeline companies, the Houston Natural Gas Company, headed by Mr. Lay, and the larger Internorth Corporation at a time when Washington was loosening its grip on price controls for pipelines and in the gas fields and competition was heated. As Enron's chairman and chief executive since 1986, Mr. Lay has exploited advantages endowed by the company's size. His latest attempt to hook industrial users on gas will benefit many of its businesses.
 In the last two years, he became the first executive of a major American gas company to expand into Europe in ventures unrelated to gas production. On the northeast coast of Scotland, in Teesside, Enron's power generation unit is building the world's biggest cogeneration plant. The colossus will consume 300 million cubic feet daily of natural gas shipped from North Sea fields more than 140 miles away by a group of gas producers headed by Amoco Inc. The plant will displace the equivalent of 52,000 barrels a day of crude oil that would have been needed.
The same construction unit has completed four gas-fired cogeneration plants in the United States since 1987, including one in Bayonne, N.J., for Jersey Central Power. In addition to producing electricity, cogeneration plants recapture heat generated by turbines and transform it to steam used by nearby industrial plants. In conventional electric power plants, heat generated by turbines is wasted. Enron is building another gas-fired plant for a group of investors in Milford, Mass., which will supply power to the local utility, the New England Power Company. Mr. Lay is counting on Enron's new gas-marketing units to accelerate this business.
Enron's pipeline network could also benefit. It dominates in the Middle West and Florida and has new links to California, but has no connections in the northeast, the region where analysts expect gas demand will grow most rapidly in years ahead.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
A Good Bargain in Blue Chips?

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
Back in the Roaring Twenties, when the national cocktail was bathtub gin and the stock market was everybody's dream machine, the Adams Express Company was at a crossroads. Its basic business, shipping small parcels around the country, had been invaded by the Post Office Department, and the nation's booming railroads were offering handsome prices for its rolling stock. It was time for a change.
The transformation came in January 1929, when Adams Express became a closed-end mutual fund, listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It promised its investors it would preserve their capital and give them "reasonable" income and opportunity for capital gains. It kept the promise. Through Depression, wars and countless stock market cycles, Adams Express has built up a $600 million portfolio of blue-chip stocks, the stuff that Old Money is made of. 
 Yet today, its own shares routinely trade for less than the market value of the sterling stocks it owns. One reason may be that the fund's portfolio, rich in capital gains, exposes most investors to an unattractive tax bite. But for tax-exempt investors, like pension funds and retirement accounts, that tax cloud just makes a good bargain even better.
Unlike open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds have a fixed number of shares and they do not redeem their old shares for cash. Closed-end funds simply sell stock and invest the proceeds for their shareholders' benefit.
The 20's saw a boom in new closed-end funds. But the changes at Adams Express were not some flapper-era fad. Although Adams Express had been one of the leading shipping companies in the country -- its leading rivals were American Express and Wells Fargo -- its management decided that the future lay elsewhere.
On Wall Street, in fact. Thus, the company sold its railcars and "plunked the money into the stock market," said Douglas G. Ober, chairman of the fund.
The timing, of course, was not ideal. Only a few public stock funds born in the 20's survived the 1929 crash and the industrial collapse that followed. Besides Adams Express, this hardy band includes General American Investors, traded since 1927; the Niagara Share Corporation, founded in early 1929 to specialize in public utilities; and the Salomon Brothers Fund, founded as the Lehman Corporation a month before the 1929 crash.
Today, when so many companies seem to have the life span of a butterfly, all of these pre-Depression survivors have a certain dowager charm. General American Investors, in fact, has become something of a market darling lately, having recently been recommended by Prudential Securities. Niagara Shares broadened its portfolio in 1952, and now invests in common stocks here and abroad. The Salomon Brothers Fund has perhaps undergone the most dramatic alterations, changing its name and shifting from internal to outside management.
There have been a few changes at Adams Express, too. In 1976, it packed up and moved from New York City to Baltimore to take advantage of a kinder tax environment for mutual funds. More recently, on April 1, it got a new chairman when Mr. Ober, 44 years old, succeeded W. D. MacCallan, who had been chairman for 20 years.
But do not look for a housecleaning in the portfolio now that he has stepped down. "You might see some very, very minimal changes," Mr. Ober said. "But I came to this business from commercial banking -- back when that was still a conservative business -- and balance sheets are my specialty. So I would have to say we would probably be as conservative as in the past."
What one sees in the Adams Express portfolio these days is all "pretty close to the consumer dollar," as Mr. MacCallan used to say. The fund's managers do not expect a hefty economic revival until late this year, at the earliest, and they have put the fund's money into consumer staples like Borden and General Mills, health care companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb, and public utilities like the Baby Bells and New England Electric System.
But although the fund owns blue-chip names -- and consistently has charged extremely low management fees, compared with its rival funds -- the stock market has typically not given it full credit for its holdings. Right now, the fund is trading at an 8 percent discount to the per-share value of its net assets; in the past year, the gap has been as big as 16 percent.
Most analysts attribute the size of that gap to the rich lode of taxable capital gains embedded in the fund's well-seasoned portfolio. Thomas J. Herzfeld, an investment adviser in Miami who specializes in closed-end funds, notes that Adams Express has been taking profits on its stocks for years and has paid those profits out as taxable capital gains to investors.
"I think that's why they trade at such a discount," Mr. Herzfeld said. "I've been recommending them to our pension fund clients -- that way, they're getting the advantage of other people's tax liabilities."
Mr. Ober, the fund's chairman, said he thinks the chronic discount is rooted more "in the market's perception of the portfolio." When blue chips look attractive, he pointed out, his fund's discount shrinks; when smaller, riskier stocks are hot, the discount widens. He conceded, however, that pension funds and people managing their own individual retirement accounts might well favor the fund more than taxable investors would.
"It's a strong income vehicle," he said, "and the yield, when you include the capital gains, is something like 9 percent. I would think that our fund would be attractive to someone who has got a good-sized pension or fairly large I.R.A. and is looking to safeguard what they have."
After a moment's thought, he added: "I really wouldn't recommend buying, though, until the discount widens to about 12 percent. It would be a much better bargain then."

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
Trouble Sleeping? Call a 24-Hour Trading Desk

BYLINE: By Mary Billard

 BODY:
The band was loud. The music was good. The beer was cold. But George Kaufman's mind started to drift thousands of miles away from CBGB, the downtown rock club. Around midnight, Mr. Kaufman walked out to the deserted Manhattan street -- the Bowery -- and made a phone call. He came back smiling. "I needed to find out what gold was trading at in Hong Kong," he told his friends, a little sheepishly.
To find out, Mr. Kaufman, a principal in the New York commodities firm of T&S Commodities Inc. had called the trading desk of Credit Lyonnais Rouse. 
 Like any other trading desk, it provides market information and executes orders for its customers. And its customers are a breed apart: they trade everything the world's major exchanges have to offer, primarily currencies and precious metals, and they are acutely aware that something is trading at every hour of the day or night.
Mr. Kaufman describes one of his friends, a successful speculator, as a real maniac. "He calls me first thing in the morning and says, 'Can you believe where the Swiss franc was trading last night at 3 in the morning? ' " says Mr. Kaufman. "I ask him, 'How do you know that?' And he'll say, 'I called on the way to the bathroom. Doesn't everybody? ' "
At Credit Lyonnais Rouse, customers range from small operations like T&S to foreign banks and money managers, all of whom need a central place where they can trade around the clock. The late shift, which comes on at midnight, takes care of select customers for whom uninterrupted sleeping has become passe, eclipsed by the need to plug into the pulsating markets. It is such a small group on most nights that one executive noted, "You could make a pot of coffee at night and it would take care of everyone trading. And their parents."
Located on the 21st floor of a high-rise building on lower Broadway, the Credit Lyonnais office shows the wear and tear of a 24-hour operation. Many chairs have broken springs, the carpet could use cleaning and the clock that tells Sydney time has fallen down. But the firm, a subsidiary of the big French bank, has more than 2,000 clients.
 "The overseas exchanges keep growing and more people are taking an interest in them, particularly money managers," said John Hannam, president of Credit Lyonnais Rouse.
Like surfers prowling the world in search of the perfect wave, traders who call the overnight desk at Credit Lyonnais are striving to find the perfect market -- huge, fluid and offering a breathtaking ride. And Credit Lyonnais Rouse is not the only firm with such a clientele; others nearby include Refco Inc., in Manhattan, and the AIG Trading Corporation in Fort Lee, N.J.
When it is lunchtime in Tokyo, it is 11 P.M. at the Credit Lyonnais trading desk in New York. The four traders on duty are flapping their jaws like auctioneers on a record-breaking day. All eyes are glued to the green numbers on the Reuters monitors; all shoulders cradle phones. The two younger traders -- Seth Brufsky and Chris Curtain -- keep pacing, but only as far as phone wires allow.
No conversation lasts more than 30 seconds. Snatches of phrases ring out: gold is up; Singapore has a demand for silver; the D-mark is unchanged; the yen is up; the "Swiss-ee" is down; the pound unchanged. "I need spot gold," shouts Mr. Curtain. It is a symphonic ode to the free flow of capital currency and commodities.
But still there is not enough action. Phone conversations reveal that the traders are finding things a tad too tame. There is no volatility in the market. Mr. Brufsky recites a litany of numbers to a customer and then concludes: "Nothing's moving up here." Nothing is worse than nothing. When the phone rings, everyone grabs it. Roy Friedman, one of the traders, even has time to joke with a customer who calls every night. "Isn't your wife home from the gym yet?"
Jack Trapp, who has worked nights for five years, tells tales of yore -- four months ago -- when the bombing of Baghdad began. "The phones stayed lit up for days," he says, staring forlornly at the one lighted phone line.
After hearing bedtime stories of riches in faraway lands, most of the customers go to sleep and the calls drop off. Around midnight, the next shift at Credit Lyonnais comes in. Some nights Andrew Gilbride and Rodolfo Gutierrez, traders in their 20's, are as lonely as the repairman in the Maytag ads. They talk to the London office to see what is happening and joke with the trader they nicknamed Elvis for a reason they have long since forgotten. They watch CNN and wait for the deli to open at 5 A.M.
If there is political or economic news anywhere in the world, the Credit Lyonnais traders start speed-dialing their customers. For example, when Margaret Thatcher resigned last fall, the pound went haywire. Mr. Gilbride and Mr. Gutierrez started dialing customers even though it was before dawn on Thanksgiving morning in New York.
Even on a relatively slow day, Mr. Gilbride is the cause of interrupted dreams. Many customers leave word that they wish to be alerted if certain levels are reached in the markets. Picking up the phone around 5 A.M., he dutifully calls a customer about a specific market fluctuation. The call takes less than a minute. Hanging up, Mr. Gilbride sighs, "I haven't let him sleep a full night in a year."
At around 5:30, the phones start ringing more frequently. By 6, the calls are nonstop. There are regulars -- money managers, traders, bankers -- who call every morning to see what they missed by sleeping. When the markets have been active, Mr. Gilbride says he can almost hear his customer's heart rate quicken.

HEADLINE: DIALOGUE -- American Intelligence: Do We Still Need the C.I.A.?;
Independence Means Integrity

BYLINE: By Bud Shuster; Bud Shuster, Republican of Pennsylvania, is a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's effort to abolish the Central Intelligence Agency and transfer its functions to the State Department is a recipe for disaster. Giving the Secretary of State chief responsibility for intelligence raises the specter of "cooking" intelligence to support a preconceived policy. The separation of intelligence-gathering and foreign policy is a fundamental principle.
As Dave Durenberger, ex-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: "There's danger when your eyes and ears become your brain. You start seeing what you want to see." 
 Senator Moynihan is using his bill to promote his thesis that the C.I.A. is synonymous with the cold war and that the cold war is dead. Therefore, the agency should now be buried in the State Department. But contrary to his intimations, the C.I.A. has plenty of missions other than analyzing the Soviet Union. Some experts argue that other priorities have been neglected: nuclear proliferation, drug trafficking and terrorism, for example. There has been an explosion in the need for information difficult to acquire.
Moreover, though the security risks that motivated our traditional intelligence effort have abated, it has become harder, not easier, to keep tabs on the Soviet Union, which remains our main geopolitical and military rival. The monitoring of arms control agreements -- involving a key C.I.A. role -- will continue to be crucial to U.S. security.
True, Senator Moynihan advocates moving C.I.A. functions to the State Department, not abolishing them. He claims he was prompted as much by the agency's inadequate performance as by the waning of the cold war. He cites the failure to recognize the Soviet economic crisis, implying a lack of objectivity by officials eager to bolster the Reagan military buildup. Mr. Moynihan mistakes the causes of this error. That aside, what makes him think the C.I.A. will be more objective subsumed in a politicized State Department?
He cites U.S. overestimates of Moscow's military abilities in the 1950's and early 1960's, before we had the technical ability to reduce the guesswork, but ignores the underestimate of Soviet military might in the late 1960's and 1970's. Opponents of the Reagan Pentagon budget used the relatively low C.I.A. estimates of Soviet military spending to undercut it. So much for cold war paranoia.
As already noted, a rationale for a separate C.I.A. is to protect analysts from pressure to gather information favorable to an Administration's initiatives. It is doubtful that the State Department would relish a reversal of this wise policy. For reasons of safety and credibility, foreign service officers distance themselves from "spies." In addition, Senator Moynihan does not indicate how transferring the functions of the Director of Central Intelligence to the Secretary of State would affect Defense Department components like the Defense Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, over whom the Director of Central Intelligence has considerable authority.
Mr. Moynihan's is a bad idea whose time will never come. By the late 20th century, America should have outgrown the notion that it has little need for intelligence collection and analysis. After World War I, the U.S. reduced its intelligence effort. We paid the price at Pearl Harbor. We nearly made the same mistake after the war, until Soviet expansionism led to creation of the C.I.A. in 1947.
The focus of U.S. intelligence may fluctuate with our interests and roles. But we should get over the idea that intelligence is dirty, that it represents the abandonment of American innocence and ideals rather than a wise way to preserve those ideals. We can improve U.S. intelligence, but proposals for doing so will have to be more thoughtful than Mr. Moynihan's.

HEADLINE: Recycling? Try Reverse Shopping

 BODY:
The article about recycled commingled materials demonstrates that the only moneymaker for the intermediate processing plants to which the mixed items are delivered is the aluminum beverage can portion.
Community and county programs now pay $25 to $40 a ton to get rid of the aluminum cans, which the processing facilities remove from the mix, flatten and sell for up to $1,100 a ton gross profit to nearby end-users. That is quite a markup. If there were no aluminum cans, the tipping fee for the commingled plastic containers, tin cans and glass would be almost as high as the cost to bury garbage.
Programs that collect the aluminum cans separately and sell them for their own account retain the income themselves. Also, those programs that have realized that glass is the only material in the mix that breaks, and that collect the glass containers separated by color, not only earn as much as they would pay out if the glass were commingled, but also avoid the cost of disposing of 15 to 25 percent of the mixed glassy aggregate that is a byproduct of every commingled operation.
Politicians have bought the commingling concept under the mistaken fear that the public will throw them out of office if they ask voters to separate their recyclable items for economic reasons. Many public works departments opt for commingling also; it reduces their responsibilities.
There are dozens of examples of New Jersey recycling programs that have made reclamation less costly by building around intelligent collection procedures. They avoid landfilling as many tons of recyclable materials as the commingling concept because they don't have any below-grade glass aggregate to dispose of -- they source-separate.

HEADLINE: Kohl Due in U.S. With Pledge of Strong Ties

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 18

 BODY:
The German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, begins a two-day visit to Washington on Sunday with the message that reunited Germany places great value on continued close ties with the United States.
Mr. Kohl's visit, his first since the Germanys reunified in October, will afford him a chance to soothe some Americans' pique over what they perceived as Germany's grudging commitment of resources to the Persian Gulf war. But the deeper purpose appears to be to dispel doubts about the future course of united Germany and its role in the European Community, which is seeking deeper economic, political and security links. 
At a news conference on Friday in Bonn to discuss the visit, Mr. Kohl emphasized that his message in the United States would be that reunited Germany, Western Europe's wealthiest and most populous country, places great value on the closest possible cooperation with the United States. He will stress, he said, the extent of Germany's political and financial support of Western policy in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.
Mr. Kohl reiterated his often stated proposal to seek parliamentary passage of laws to allow German troops, for the first time since the World War II, to be deployed in regions outside the NATO area. But Mr. Kohl's opponents in the Social Democratic party, whose parliamentary support is needed for passage, immediately repeated their opposition, serving notice that the Chancellor will face an uphill legislative battle.
The Chancellor will be accompanied to Washington by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and will meet with President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. But an aide who will accompany Mr. Kohl emphasized that the visit was an effort not so much to reach the President, with whom Mr. Kohl talks by telephone almost weekly, but to reach members of Congress and other policymakers in meetings and a series of foreign policy speeches, most notably an address on Monday at Georgetown University.
The aide said Mr. Kohl would stress the need for strong continued endorsement of the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Germany has been particularly receptive to calls by Mr. Gorbachev that the major industrial nations of the Group of Seven agree at their meeting this summer to approve aid for Moscow's transition to free markets and open borders.
Mr. Kohl is expected to reiterate the view that by strengthening European security structures, such as the Western European Union, a long-disused military organization, European governments were not weakening NATO, but bolstering its European leg.
The trip may also allow Mr. Kohl to regain some political ground lost this spring. The public perception that he lacked resolve in dealing with the deepening economic problems in the east was a major factor in the defeat of Mr. Kohl's Christian Democratic Party in his home state, Rhineland-Palatinate, in elections in April.
Mr. Kohl has recently seemed at pains to appear more assertive, sending German soldiers to Iran for relief work among the Kurds, challenging protesters in depressed eastern German cities where they pelted him recently with eggs and taking controversial domestic stands, like his whole-hearted endorsement of Berlin as the seat of government.

HEADLINE: Darman Tackles Domestic Issues in Talk at College

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
Solving America's toughest domestic problems cannot be done with just money and a sense of mission, the Bush Administration's budget director said today, but requires basic changes in technology and values, from the development of a better car battery to the determination that children spend more time in school.
Richard G. Darman, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, told graduates at Bryant College in Smithfield, R.I., that it was a mistake to conclude from the United States' success in the Persian Gulf war that sufficient money and an agreed-upon purpose could solve domestic problems as well. 
 His remarks were broader than the usual budget office concerns, but throughout his tenure he has occasionally given speeches on economic and social philosophy as he has sought to be known as more than an accountant. Today's focus on education reflected his enthusiasm at working with the new Secretary of Education, Lamar Alexander, and his interest in finding new ideas and financing for the nation's public schools.
Mr. Darman said the right education goals were already there, in the six objectives set last year by the nation's governors and President Bush. Without citing the complaint of most Democrats that the Administration's education program amounted to more talk than dollars, he maintained that money was not an issue because "we already spend more per capita than our major competitors," referring to foreign countries.
Improved technology is especially important to educational progress he said, because while computer terminals can finally be found in classrooms, "most school budgets remain about as labor-intensive as they must have been in ancient Egypt."
He said the educational system has hardly begun to transfer "rote teaching functions to interesting software." If it did, he suggested in an interview Friday, computers could teach the basics more effectively, reduce the number of teachers being used for that purpose and, with a smaller work force, be able to pay teachers more.
But the opportunities provided by technology are unlikely to be realized, he told the graduates, if major changes in values do not accompany them. While more is being expected from the nation's schools, students spend only 175 days a year in school and 90 percent of their time outside the classroom, much of it watching television. "We've trained a generation of experts in the Wheel of Fortune," he said.
The nation has to put greater value on accountability and choice, employing a "market orientation" and allowing parents to "shop around" among various schools, he said in the interview. Hitting a central theme of the Administration's education program, he said pressure for improvement of the schools has to come from "performance measures and freedom of choice."
He applied the same argument of values and technology to the nation's health care costs and its reliance on imported oil.
Reducing dependence on imported oil, he told the Bryant graduates, also requires basic changes in technology and values.
"Over time, our culture must be weaned from the excessive value it places on the traditional automobile," he said.
The changes in values, he said, can only accompany "commercially sound breakthroughs in battery technology and in high-speed rail technology." He said there is already a clear Federal role in these areas, in encouraging battery research and in helping to finance basic research into superconductors that were relevant to magnetic rail technology. The Government, through its control of interstate highways, may also provide rail right-of-ways that would otherwise be very costly.
Dealing with rising health costs, he said, is obviously essential, since they have grown from 3 percent of the gross national product three decades ago to 12 percent today and are expected to grow to 18 percent in the 90's.
 
Tackling Health Care Costs

But solving the problem without risking either personal health or the nation's economic health would require new technology and new values, he said.
One obvious value change, he said, would be "to reduce drug abuse, alcohol consumption and high-risk behavior generally."
"Controlling such risk factors could prevent, perhaps, half of all premature deaths and cases of disability." he said.
The technology, he said, should involve medical advances that would do more than just keep people alive. While the first artificial hearts allowed no real mobility, he said in the interview, recent advances enable patients to live nearly normal lives.
But along with medical advances, he said, the nation will also need changes in values that would encourage patients to keep working or find new work so they can continue to earn money to help pay for health care costs.

HEADLINE: In Fiscal Crunch, Frills of Office Can Loom Large

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
When City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman appears in public, two police detectives accompany her. When Mayor David N. Dinkins arrives each morning at City Hall from Gracie Mansion, one of his police bodyguards carries a cooler containing the Mayor's specially prepared diet lunch. When Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown travels the two blocks from Police Headquarters to City Hall, he drives, with a back-up car.
The customary perquisites of life at the top of New York City government -- cars with drivers and telephones, police protection for senior elected officials, helicopter rides or even the occasional trip abroad -- may appear impolitic, if not imperial, when local officials are contemplating laying off thousands of city workers and eliminating or sharply reducing services to close a $3.5 billion budget gap. 
 For some New Yorkers who have consumed a steady diet of news reports on the issue in recent days, the question of whether curtailing such perks would really make a dent in the city's financial mess is beside the point.
"Why should they be driving around in $20,000 cars when the city has the problems it has?" asked Tracy Stwaerd of Brooklyn, who is 20 years old. "They should take a taxi, or they should take the subway."
Andy Rothstein, a lawyer who also lives in Brooklyn, said of city officials: "Essentially, they are on my payroll. I don't live like that, so why should they?"
 
'Penny-Ante Stuff'
 "Since Boss Tweed they've been living too well," said Allen Seaman, who works in a Manhattan textile-manufacturing company. "But this is penny-ante stuff. He was a bigger crook than all these guys put together."
One morning last week, two newspapers devoted their front pages to what they portrayed as extravagant behavior by city officials. The Daily News took to task the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, for purchasing three new city cars in the last year. And New York Newsday heaped scorn on what it called a "Riviera Romp" -- a trip to the Cannes Film Festival by two city officials, Jaynne Keyes and Nina Streich of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting.
There have also been articles about limousines rented by a city commission to take members home after meetings; about vice presidents of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation who were dismissed but then given temporary jobs in the agency while they looked for new employment; and about a helicopter taken by the head of the Housing Authority, Laura D. Blackburne, to deliver a speech in Atlantic City.
"There is no question that it's open season on government officials," said Henry J. Stern, a former Parks Commissioner who is president of the Citizens Union, a nonprofit civic group. "On a slow day, one can at least go out to the motor pool and see what's up."
 
Symbolic Impact
 But Mr. Stern also said that lavish perks should be questioned, especially when the city government was preparing Draconian measures to meet its fiscal problems. Cutting back on such practices would not solve the budget crunch -- Mr. Golden would have to get rid of 175,000 city cars at $20,000 each to close the city's $3.5 billion gap for the next fiscal year -- but reducing amenities would have strong symbolic value, many people said.
"The details may be trivial -- obviously we're talking about pennies," Mr. Stern said. "But it's important for symbolism. It's difficult to defend even minor excesses when you're talking about laying off 18,000 people and doing away with important programs."
"Appearance is important in public life," he added.
Ms. Stwaerd, Mr. Rothstein and many other New Yorkers interviewed last week said they thought only the Mayor and a handful of other top officials deserved cars, drivers and police protection.
Gene Russianoff, senior attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit lobbying organization, said he thought the public would firmly support a shift from dark sedans to the D train.
 
Who Has to Suffer
 "I don't think it's just symbolic," he said. "City officials should use city services, particularly if they are talking about cutting them." Mr. Russianoff said that at public meetings where transit officials are discussing service cuts, he has often seen cars and drivers waiting outside for the officials.
"I think the public says to itself, 'If the fiscal crisis is real and we're going to have to suffer and we're going to have to change our behavior, so do the people who run the city,' " he said.
But others called the issue inconsequential and argued that the criticisms were simplistic. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch called the news reports "a lot of petty buffalo chips," because such expenditures actually involve very little money.
Mr. Koch said that officials like Mr. Golden, an old political adversary, needed city cars to perform their jobs. The subway is not always practical for elected officials who spend a large part of their day traveling to many different places, he said.
"The Mayor and other officials are performing important jobs, and you want to make it easier for them, not harder," Mr. Koch said.
Mr. Stern said he thought the use of city cars was often appropriate, particularly because city business can be conducted on the car phones. "It's a way for a top official to get around, and you don't want them lining up at pay phones," he said. But he said the use of cars and drivers by many mid-level officials should be curtailed.
Have some officials been insensitive to the austerity that has overtaken local government?
Mr. Golden bought three new cars with city money in the last year, The Daily News reported. Two cost about $22,000 each, The News said, and the other cost $16,000. Mr. Golden's spokesman, Pat Smith, said in a statement that the third car was for the Borough President's staff, and it replaced a seven-year-old car that had become unserviceable. He said the two cars bought for Mr. Golden replaced a car that had been stolen and a four-year-old car that had become too costly to maintain.
New York Newsday, in a column on the trip to the Cannes Film Festival by the two members of the mayoral office that promotes the shooting of movies in New York, said the trip cost $10,000. The next day, though, the paper published an article from a staff correspondent in Cannes, which said that Ms. Keyes and Ms. Streich had bought $385 round-trip plane tickets, had traveled by overnight train from Paris to the Riviera, were staying 10 miles out of town and were getting by on an expense allotment of $25 a day.
 
Spending Money Wisely
 The story also said that the officials had already signed up one movie for New York at the festival and were working on several others. Movie production in the city pumps hundreds of thousands of dollars into its economy.
"It is a real principle of both the private and public sectors that sometimes you have to spend money to make money," said Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President. "Certainly the film trip is a good example of that."
Ms. Messinger said that every city official had to concentrate on ways to reduce costs, and that news reports highlighting excesses were often helpful. But she also said that government leaders should not be so afraid of the potential for negative publicity that they fail to spend money intelligently.
"Some of this has a chilling effect," Ms. Messinger said. "It makes people afraid to do things that ought to be done, because they are afraid that it will be picked up."

Leaders of the Yugoslav republic of Croatia today rejected a federal panel formed on Friday by the country's Prime Minister to keep this six-republic federation functioning after the collapse of the federal presidency.
"We are questioning the constitutionality of the move," said Darko Bekic, an adviser to Croatia's President, referring to Prime Minister Ante Markovic's appointment of the panel. "This is something that is his private initiative." 
 Mr. Markovic formed the team Friday evening after the republics of Serbia and Montenegro plunged Yugoslavia into yet another constitutional crisis by preventing Stipe Mesic, Croatia's delegate to the eight-member national presidency, from assuming the body's chairmanship. The move violated the system of annual rotation of the chairmanship and has effectively left Yugoslavia without a head of state and its armed forces without a commander in chief.
It is still unclear which powers will be assumed by the panel appointed on Friday, especially those powers relating to control of the military. The members of Mr. Markovic's team have not been officially identified, although it reportedly includes Yugoslavia's Defense Minister, Gen. Veljko Kadijevic, and other key ministers.
 
Violent Serb-Croat Clashes
 At a meeting in Belgrade today, the army's high command spelled out the steps it will take to carry out a May 9 decision of the federal presidency, which set a 30-day deadline for the ending of all armed conflicts in Yugoslavia and the disarming of all illegal paramilitary groups in the country, a Defense Ministry statement said without elaboration.
The high command also "reviewed the defense and security aspects of the current situation in Yugoslavia and international reactions to it," the statement said.
Violent clashes between Serbs and Croats have claimed 19 lives in the last three weeks, and the United States and the European Community have issued statements warning the Yugoslav Army, whose officer corps is dominated by Serbs, against trying to resolve the tense political situation by seizing power.
"Croatia will not be obligated by anything undertaken outside the Constitution," Mr. Mesic said in an interview today. "I am afraid that the team will not be able to act in any way to resolve the present situation."
Zvonko Lerotic, another adviser to Croatia's President, Franjo Tudjman, said: "Mr. Markovic is attempting to find a compromise between both groups. He is acting as a savior or mediator who is attempting to find institutions through which both sides can negotiate."
Mr. Lerotic said: "Mr. Markovic thinks he has the support to do this. I don't think he does."
"It will last until its first failure," he said. "When the first serious problem appears before this group it will be blockaded, half and half. Every federal group, every initiative is broken up half and half. It is impossible to take any decisions except on peripheral issues."
In a brief interview today, Mr. Markovic described the team only in the most general terms.
 
No-Confidence Vote Urged
 "It is an interdepartmental team which will work on the realization of our goals," he said, refusing to elaborate.
Serbia's government has yet to react to the formation of team, but its President, Slobodan Milosevic, is a political enemy of Mr. Markovic and his program to introduce market economic changes in Yugoslavia.
"A new attack from Serbia will be directed at the Government of Mr. Markovic," Mr. Mesic said.
A Serbian representative has already called for the federal Parliament to take a vote of no confidence in the Government later this month.
"For Milosevic, no kind of Yugoslavia is acceptable, only Greater Serbia," Mr. Mesic said. "I am satisfied only by the fact that the world can now see with whom Croatia has to deal."
Mr. Mesic said that Croatia's President, Mr. Tudjman, and the republic's Parliament would decide how to respond to Serbia's blocking his appointment to the presidency's top post. Before Friday's vote in the presidency, Mr. Mesic said Croatia would secede if he were not named the presidency's chairman.
Voters in Croatia are to cast ballots on Sunday in a referendum on whether they want the republic to be a sovereign independent state joined in confederation with other Yugoslav republics.
Mr. Lerotic said Croatia's leaders hoped the vote would be a huge show of support for the republic's government and provide impetus for the United States and European Community to recognize Yugoslavia's internal borders as inviolable international frontiers.
 
Role of Yugoslav Army
 "We think that the referendum will help America and the European Community to think about recognizing the internal borders as international borders," he said, adding that he expects about 80 percent of the Croatian electorate to go to the polls and for the proposition on sovereignty to win 70 to 80 percent of the votes.
Widespread support in the referendum is important for the Croatian government's relations with the Yugoslav National Army, Mr. Lerotic said, because it will dispel assertions by the army leadership that only the Croatian government desires Croatia's distancing from the Yugoslav federation.
"The leadership of the Yugoslav National Army will be in a very bad position after this referendum," he said.
A senior Western diplomat today described Mr. Markovic's team as a kind of Government task force.
 
'The Presidency Is Paralyzed'
 "I have no sense that there are people other than those in the Government on the committee," he said. "You need the Government to keep the army under civilian control."
"I don't think you'll see it doing dramatic things," he added. "It doesn't seem to be a committee of public safety."
"The Government is acting as a government, as the only functioning federal executive organ," he said. "The presidency is paralyzed."

HEADLINE: BUDGET THREATENS PHYSICS PROJECT

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
The search for the top quark, an elusive subnuclear particle regarded by high-energy physicists as a kind of Holy Grail, will probably be delayed for years because of financing problems, leading physicists say.
The top quark, believed to be a building block of an exotic form of matter, may hold a clue to one of the most puzzling questions in physics: why matter has mass. Unless the quark is found, this line of inquiry is stymied. 
 Last week, the House Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, headed by Representative Tom Bevill, an Alabama Democrat, completed work on the Federal appropriations bill for 1992. The panel cut $100 million from the $534 million requested by the Administration for the Superconducting Supercollider particle accelerator planned for Texas. The subcommittee also omitted financing for an upgrading project that had been planned for the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois. Both actions affect the quest for the top quark.
The Fermilab project, which would cost $177.8 million, is an injector that would pump additional tightly bunched swarmsof protons and antiprotons into the Fermilab Tevatron, the most powerful particle accelerator in the world. By increasing the number of particles forced to collide with each other in the machine, physicists say, there will be a better chance of spotting the very rare collisions in which top quarks are expected to appear.
 
Fermilab as Best Hope
 Many of the greatest high-energy accelerators in the world, including Petra at Hamburg, Germany, PEP and the Stanford Linear Collider in California, Tristan and KEK in Japan, and the Large Electron-Positron collider at Geneva, have all tried and failed to find the top quark.
But the best hope lay in Fermilab's Tevatron, which can smash protons and antiprotons into each other with a combined energy of nearly two trillion electron-volts. The energy unleashed by such collisions is spontaneously converted into matter, including not only the kinds familiar today, but also forms of matter that existed immediately after the Big Bang explosion from which scientists say the universe emerged.
Most scientists believed that after the Tevatron was completed in 1987, it would take only a few months to find the top quark. But despite a succession of improvements made in the machine since then, even the mighty Tevatron has failed to turn up the particle.
Physicists worry about this for economic as well as scientific reasons. Part of the justification for spending billions of dollars for high-energy research is the assumption that important discoveries will result. The failure to find the top quark could be interpreted as a failure of physics and as a reason for reducing or eliminating funds for gigantic accelerator projects.
 
At Least a Year's Delay
 There is a consensus among physicists that Fermilab now offers the best prospect for finding the elusive quark, provided that the new, upgraded injector is built for the Tevatron accelerator. But last week's action in the House appeared to have delayed the project for at least a year.
Dr. Leon M. Lederman, president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a Nobel laureate in physics, deplored the development.
"If I were still the director of Fermilab, I think I'd cut my wrists," he said. "Eliminating funds for the injector will mean throwing away the world's pre-eminent machine of its kind. It is snatching defeat from the jaws of victory."
Fermilab's current director, Dr. John Peoples Jr., was less pessimistic. "This is a great disappointment," he said. "But if it's only a year's delay, we can live with it. But if the cut in funds for the injector is permanent, the result will be devastating."
Spokesmen for the House subcommittee and Representative Bevill refused to comment on the deliberations that led to the cuts.
 
Other Projects' Problems
 Two other big accelerators still in the planning stage, the supercollider and Europe's Large Hadron Collider, could both provide the energy and tight packing of particles needed to produce the top quark. But both projects face major uncertainties. High-energy physicists say that it is unlikely that the supercollider could be completed before 2005, and that the whole project might still be scuttled by spending constraints.
The European accelerator, which would be built near Geneva in an existing accelerator tunnel 17 miles in circumference, also faces financial and technical problems. Scientists say that major difficulties in designing huge magnets to control the accelerator's proton beams have yet to be resolved.
Physicists believe that the fundamental building blocks of all matter are particles called quarks and leptons, which are related to each other in terms of a theory called the Standard Model. This theory, which has been almost perfectly verified by experiments, supposes the existence of six kinds of quarks, which have been given the whimsical names "up," "down," "charmed," "strange," "bottom" (or, alternatively, "beauty,") and "top."
All the matter in the ordinary realm of existence is based on up and down quarks, which combine to form the protons and neutrons from which atomic nuclei are assembled. The other quarks are not seen outside accelerator laboratories.

HEADLINE: Waves of Sewage and Auto Traffic Sweep Down on U.S. From Canada

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BLAINE, Wash.

 BODY:
The complaints from American officials sound familiar: pollution from an outdated sewage system fouling international waters, and a surge of people crossing the border, some of them illegally, in search of economic oppportunity.
Tijuana? El Paso? Try the 49th Parallel, where Washington State meets British Columbia. In a rare display of friction, United States officials are upset over what they call a "1950's-era" approach to pollution control in Canada, and for gridlock at a border entry area that is now the most heavily traveled on the nation's northern boundary. 
 The pollution complaints arise because every day Victoria, the capital city of the fastest-growing province in Canada, dumps 20 million gallons of raw, untreated household sewage from the 250,000 people in its metropolitan area into waters shared by Canada and the United States. It is the only major city on this vast coastal region that does not treat its sewage.
"It is astonishing that a city the size of Victoria is dumping so much raw sewage into the water," said Robert Burd, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency's regional director for water programs. "That is a lot of gross stuff being flushed out to sea. The problem is that Canada just doesn't have the environmental laws we have. They are about where the United States was in the 1950's."
 
 Mobs of Bargain Hunters
 The other major source of complaints is about Canadian bargain hunters who are overwhelming border communities in unprecedented numbers. Driven by high taxes and a cost of living that is nearly double that of Washington State, Canadians crossed the border into northwest Washington about 27 million times last year. The number of crossings, equal to Canada's entire population, was reported by five border stations within a 30-mile area.
The visitors came to shop for things like gasoline, cheese, milk or even real estate. Unleaded gasoline, for example, sells for about $1.20 a gallon here, while it can cost more than $3 in United States money in British Columbia, where taxes and higher costs for processing run the price up.
"We've not only lost control of our town, but the whole economy has shifted," said Bruce Brown, publisher of The Sumas Astonisher, the newspaper in another border town in northwest Washington. "Here's a little town of 749 people and you've got gridlock at 11 o'clock in the morning."
Mr. Brown calculated that there is one gasoline dispenser for every three residents of the town.
Moreover, prices are higher here than they are elsewhere in Washington because merchants know the Canadians will pay. This sends some local residents up to 70 miles south in search of basic goods.
A recent study by the Chamber of Commerce in British Columbia estimated that the province was losing $1.2 billion (United States money) each year because of Canadians who were taking their business south.
 
 Opening of Commuter Lane
 To ease the border congestion, Canadian national officials have started a commuter lane for frequent international shoppers, but they say the only thing that will really reduce border crossings is a major shift in the Canadian economy.
They say they are pressuring Victoria to clean up its municipal sewage system, but it could be years before Victoria builds plants to start treating its sewage.
Victorians seem somewhat embarrassed by the sewage dispute, which has been the subject of many newspaper editorials on both sides of the border, and comments in British Columbia's Parliament and Washington's Legislature.
The friction is a reversal of the early 1980's, when Canadians, primarily in the East, were complaining about pollution coming from the American side, in the form of acid rain. And Canadians in the Great Lakes region have long criticized water pollution originating in the United States.
After spending billions of dollars to clean up sewage treatment plants in Washington State, officials on the United States side say the Canadians should do their share to remove effluents from the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which opens to the Pacific Ocean. They also complain about the flow of industrial chemicals from pulp and paper mills into the Fraser River, which empties into international waters.
Mr. Burd said past analysis of raw sewage indicates that toxic waste and chemicals are sent out to sea with the sewage. The sewage endangers a rich fishery that includes crab, halibut, salmon, cod, squid, oysters and clams, he said.
Victoria officials say there is no proof that the sewage is harmful to marine life. "The sewage is 99 percent water, and the other 1 percent is made up of waste from us humans and chemicals that we throw away," said Michael Williams, the chief engineer of the agency that controls Victoria's sewage. "The concern that we have at the technnical level is chemicals. With respect to human waste, mother nature tends to take care of that."
A longstanding agreement between the two countries says that if damage to fish can be proven, the polluting source can be forced to close. In recent meetings where United States officials raised the issue of Victoria's sewage, Canadian officials indicated willingness to cooperate, Mr. Burd said.
 
 An 'Unacceptable' Situation

Canadian national officials have joined the criticism of Victoria. "We have told the City of Victoria that the present situation is unacceptable," said Alain David, a water pollution expert with Environment Canada, the federal pollution control agency.
Last week, Victoria unveiled a study on how the city could clean up its sewage. The options could cost up to $350 million, the study said.
While Victoria officials debate whether to spend the money to clean up their sewage, a solution for the other border is nowhere near a solution.
Last year, according to evidence presented at a Congressional hearing on the problem, this border area became the most heavily used, passing the Buffalo and Detroit crossings. A recent Canadian tax of 7 percent on virtually all goods and services added to the incentive for Canadians to shop in the United States.
Warehouses stocked with groceries and electronic goods draw near-capacity crowds every day. Many goods cost at least 50 percent less on the United States side of the border.
Gasoline stations have sprouted in former dairy fields. Lines of returning Canadian cars stretch for miles on the United States side, waiting as long as three hours to re-enter their country. The delay is caused mostly by the collection of duties on goods purchased in this country.
 
 Traffic Chokes Town
 "They back up so far at the border station that it stretches three miles into town, blocks everything and our town comes to a stop," said Butch Hinchey, the Chief of Police here in Blaine, the American border town of 2,600 people that has become the main entry point. "We basically lose our town."
To avoid the long waits at official border points, some Canadians have been crossing illegally, driving across thick wooden planks they place across an irrigation ditch that separates the two countries, customs officials say.
While many businesses are prospering from the influx, some longtime residents do not like it. Chief Hinchey, a resident of Blaine for 22 years, said the only time he has seen border traffic this bad was in the 1970's, when a Canadian beer strike sent crowds south.
In its experiment for the tourist season, the Canadians have started a commuter lane, open to people who cross the border frequently and have applied for a special decal.
But only 20,000 applicants will be allowed to use the new system. Traffic jams will not go away, Mr. Watt said, until one country is less of a bargain than the other.

HEADLINE: Political Talk

BYLINE: By Todd S. Purdum

 BODY:
Feud Gathers Momentum
Aides to the New York City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, were apoplectic last week when they got their hands on a memo saying that Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch would be in charge of negotiations on the city's $29 billion budget. 
 That's because the Council leadership has been feuding bitterly, though indirectly, with Mr. Lynch over drawing new districts to expand the Council and fill 16 new seats this fall. Mr. Lynch has let it be known that he intends to field candidates to challenge incumbents and try to fill the new seats with members more loyal to the Mayor than to Mr. Vallone.
 "Why is Bill Lynch doing this?" one Council aide asked. "He never talks to us."
 But First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, who wrote the budget memo to city agency heads, said it was intended merely to emphasize that they should not try to negotiate pet programs on their own with Council members, but go through Mr. Lynch, whose portfolio puts him in charge of intergovernmental affairs.
The stakes on the budget are so high that in a recent meeting, some city officials said, Mr. Steisel told commssioners that anyone who tried to make private deals with the Council "will never work on a Dinkins budget again."
 
 No Campaign Intended
 They all insist that it has nothing to do with preparing for any future political campaigns, but two men who ran for governor against Mario M. Cuomo and a third who wanted to are among the founders of a new anti-tax lobbying group.
The organization, known as Change-NY, recently began a direct-mail campaign criticizing Governor Cuomo for proposing more than $1 billion in tax and fee increases this year. It also attacks the Legislature for being more interested in "preserving its privileges, perks and pork than in giving taxpayers a break."
The letter was signed by Lewis E. Lehrman, a businessman who was the Republican-Conservative candidate against Mr. Cuomo in 1982; Herb London, last year's Conservative candidate for Governor, and Evan G. Galbraith, a former Ambassador to France who wanted to run as a Republican against Mr. Cuomo last year but did not meet state residency requirements.
Asked if he saw the group and the letter campaign as a sign of growing anti-tax sentiment, Mr. Cuomo said: "I don't regard it as a movement. Some rich people got together and started a group. They could bail out our budget, these guys."
 
Public-Relations Lesson
 When Gov. Thomas H. Kean first went on the air with tourism ads for New Jersey in 1984, his popularity rating was already 57 percent. Five years later, it had soared to 80 percent.
 A bustling economy and a building boom had a lot to do with it, but the public-relations lesson has not been lost on Gov. Jim Florio, whose popularity has sagged to 20 percent in several polls over the last year since he rammed the largest tax increase in state history through the Legislature.
Now Mr. Florio is poised to go before the cameras within the next week or so, his aides say, also in the name of promoting the Garden State's garden spots.
"New Juhsey and you, puhfect together," became Mr. Kean's trademark, in his purring patrician accent. Mr. Florio's terse, tough-guy inflection is another thing altogether, but at 20 percent there is no place much to go but up.
 
 D'Amato Under Fire

Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who is under fire because of a Federal investigation into influence-peddling allegations, has lost the support of a major lobbyist for New York gun owners.
Gerald Preiser, president of the 4,000-member Federation of New York State Rifle and Pistol Clubs, said last week that his group could no longer back Mr. D'Amato because of his recent votes on legislation that could affect gun owners and because of "the sleaze factor."
"It's bye-bye, Al," Mr. Preiser said. He said he would no longer send mailings supporting Mr. D'Amato, a Republican, to the one million names on his list of gun owners and opponents of gun control, and would support whoever the Democratic nominee is.
Mr. D'Amato said in a statement that "What Mr. Preiser chooses to do or support is his business," and that "like most New Yorkers, I support increased penalties for criminals who commit crimes with guns."
 
 What's in a Name?
 It's the loveliest room in New York's City Hall, with its clean white columns and benches that look like pews. But no one can agree what to call it.
It's the old Board of Estimate chamber on the second floor.
But since the United States Supreme Court declared the board unconstitutional and a new City Charter redistributed its powers to the Mayor and City Council in 1989, the room's name has become a political football.
Some official city announcements refer to it as the public hearing room, and some call it the Board of Estimate chamber. So what is it really?
"It's an ideological question," said Kenneth J. Knuckles, the Commissioner of General Services and therefore the landlord of City Hall. But Mr. Knuckles, who sat on the board, said it would "always be the Board of Estimate to me."

HEADLINE: Poor and Illegal, Mexicans Lose Hope in New York

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Beaten down by a dismal economy, Lucas V. left his construction job, a wife and two children in Mexico and ventured to New York in search of the nest egg that would enable him to open a small business back home. After two years of laboring on construction sites for $260 a week, he is no closer to his goal than when he first arrived.
"I think I made a mistake coming here," the trim 30-year-old said one recent afternoon on the sidelines of a soccer match in upper Manhattan, one of his few diversions. "What you earn here stays here." 
 Lucas, who scrapes by without immigration documents or English, is like many in a new wave of Mexican immigrants who have arrived in the New York metropolitan region in recent years. The exact numbers are uncertain, since many are here illegally, but the Mexican Consulate in New York estimated that since the mid-1980's, the number of Mexicans living in the region has grown from about 60,000 to as many as 200,000, with increasing numbers of women and children making the trek north.
While the United States and Mexico are discussing the technicalities of a possible free-trade agreement, the stream of new arrivals in New York City shows a human dimension often overlooked in the economic equation.
"When we talk about globalization, we mostly talk about capital, but it's happening at the level of people," said Saskia Sassen, a professor of urban planning at Columbia who has studied the city's burgeoning Mexican community.
In past decades, the city attracted a small group of Mexican professionals, businessmen and artists. But the most recent migration, which gathered steam about five years ago, is bringing many poorer, mostly illegal Mexican immigrants. Many of them have settled in small pockets in the city's established Hispanic neighborhoods, like East Harlem in Manhattan, the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn and the Tremont section of the Bronx.
 
Farming to Dishwashing
 Peasant farmers who once picked vegetables in the fields of Mexico now wash and stack produce at greengrocers or peddle flowers from rickety shopping carts at busy intersections. For others, the journey that began on sun-baked dirt roads in distant corners of Mexico ends with a spray of hot water, washing dishes inside a humid kitchen.
The tales of friends and relatives who returned home sporting new suits and lugging boxes and suitcases bulging with the trappings of North American success have lured them here. But many find themselves underpaid by employers, overcharged by landlords and overrun by neighborhood toughs who see them as easy prey, since their fear of deportation often forces them to endure indignities in silence.
It is a cruel test of faith. "They are carriers of the American Dream in a way those who have been here a long time no longer are," said Ms. Sassen. "They really believe it will work out. But for a growing number, it is not working out."
The most recent Mexican immigrants are unlike earlier waves of Dominicans or Colombians who came to the United States with some money and education. They are coming from some of the poorest regions of Mexico -- the states of Puebla, Oaxaca, Guerrero and the capital, Mexico City, said Robert Smith, a doctoral candidate in political science at Columbia who is writing his dissertation on the new immigrants.
 
Demand for Cheap Labor
 Traditional destinations in the Southwestern United States had become saturated with new migrants -- and also riskier, as immigration authorities cracked down on employers who were hiring illegal immigrants, Mr. Smith said. Cities like New York became attractive, he said, because jobs were plentiful and attention from immigration authorities minimal.
"What happened in the mid- and late 80's was the economic need had become so much worse and the demand for cheap labor in New York found this source, so immigration spread quickly," Mr. Smith said.
Ms. Sassen said the 1986 Federal law imposing penalties on employers who hire undocumented workers also pushed down wages. She said some employers decided that if hiring undocumented workers would put them at risk of fines, they would minimize their losses by hiring the cheapest labor possible.
So the new Mexican immigrants have become the favored source of cheap labor. In some garment factories, workers are getting as little as $2 an hour, while others who make restaurant deliveries work just for tips, Ms. Sassen said.
At a park by the Hudson River in upper Manhattan, Alejandro M. weaves through the crowd with an instant camera, ready to shoot portraits against the backdrop of the Palisades for $4. During the week, he pushes a cart loaded down with a block of ice and jangling bottles of fruit flavors, selling snow cones along Broadway.
 
'They Return Defeated'
 "It's not dignified work, but it's serious," said Alejandro, who like other illegal immigrants interviewed for this article spoke on condition that his last name not be used. On a good day, he can earn $50, which combined with his wife's work at home as a hairdresser helps pay their rent of $500 a month, feed and clothe their two children and perhaps salt away a few dollars.
"We came with the illusion of earning a little money, investing it and doing something in Mexico," he said.
"In any country, those who work can survive. But those who get $180 for working seven days, what can they do? They return defeated to Mexico."
Going back to Mexico is out of the question for Lucila M. and her brothers, Leandro and Eduardo, since their jobs help support their parents and four brothers and sisters in Puebla.
"We came to New York because we are poor farmers and our parents did not have enough resources to send us to school," said Leandro, 26, who earns $200 a week delivering food.
"Here we found work, but nobody pays us," said Lucila, adding that her employers at a garment factory owe her three weeks' back wages.
Lucila, Leandro and Eduardo live with Lucila's two children and three other relatives in a two-bedroom apartment on the Lower East Side, splitting the $380 rent. Though the water sputters out for days at a time, the heat fails often in the winter and the walls have crumbled so badly that her two children have been diagnosed as having lead poisoning, Lucila and her relatives do not complain. "We're scared because if we say anything, the landlady might throw us out," she said.
The fear of arbitrary evictions, dismissal from their jobs and the threat of deportation keeps many illegal immigrants silent.
Alberto L., an 18-year-old factory worker, was robbed recently of $75 as he walked home in the nascent Mexican community on the fringe of the Belmont section of the Bronx. Rather than report the robbery, he borrowed some money until the next pay day.
"I can't go to the police -- I don't have documents," he said. "The police will only add to my problems."
That is a common misconception, immigrants' rights advocates say. An executive order issued during the Koch administration prohibits city agencies from turning over information on immigrants to the Federal authorities unless the person involved committed a crime, said Elizabeth Aivars, director of the Mayor's Office on Immigrant Affairs. But getting that message out has proved difficult.
"Part of the problem of the undocumented is they don't know what rights they have," said Marie Guiardinu, director of Hermandad Hispana, an immigrant-rights group in Manhattan.
She has tried cajoling the flower vendors she sees on the street into coming into her organization's office for help with labor and immigration problems. She considers them among the poorest and most vulnerable of the immigrants, sometimes pooling their meager incomes to rent basement apartments where 10 or more people live huddled together.
But despite her entreaties, they never come in. "I think they are worried about losing whatever they have," she said.
In recent years, the Mexican Consulate has tried to strengthen the handful of nonprofit agencies working with the immigrants, said Jose Antonio Lagunas, the vice consul in charge of the effort. He said he has tried to make city agencies more aware of the problems in the community and is hoping to get volunteers to offer immigrants legal advice.
But many immigrants seek guidance in more familiar settings. La Tejanita, a tiny Mexican grocery, is an unofficial center for Mexicans in the Belmont section. Jose Andon opened the store last year after working in cafeterias and hotels in New York for 23 years.
He knows his newly arrived countrymen can have a hard time surviving in New York, so he helps when he can with clothing or job leads.
"When they arrive in this country, they make you want to cry," he said. Still, he thinks that for those who work hard, some measure of success -- a car, or money for a nicer home in Mexico -- is attainable.
But many immigrants remain adrift, unsure whom to trust for help.
After six months working for a greengrocer who paid him $150 a week -- when he was paid at all -- Guadalupe G. started selling oranges on the streets of upper Manhattan. He can earn $30 a day, enough to feed his wife and three young daughters and pay the $450 rent on a basement apartment.
His oldest daughter, Susana, is 6 years old, but he is afraid to enroll her in school since the family is here illegally. Instead, she and the other children stay at home or scamper nearby as he peels oranges.
He expected life would be hard, and it has gotten tougher with the arrival of more Mexicans. "There are too many for work," he said. "It's filling up here."
Like the others, he had hoped to save money, but has failed. "The reality is, you work here so you won't suffer much, and pay the rent," he said. "At least we're not dying of hunger."

HEADLINE: U.S., Citing Human Rights, Halts Economic Aid to Yugoslavia

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has quietly suspended all economic assistance to Yugoslavia, including support in international financial institutions for loans and credits.
In 1952, Yugoslavia, then a maverick Communist country, began receiving large amounts of United States aid to help it continue its defiance of Stalin. In recent years, the Belgrade Government benefited repeatedly from American backing for international loans and credits for its economy. 
 The suspension was begun May 6 under the provisions of a law passed by Congress in November, requiring the United States to end all forms of economic assistance to Yugoslavia and its six constituent republics in six months if it was determined that "a pattern of systematic gross violations of human rights" was occurring there.
In a voice vote last month, the Senate declared that a complete cutoff of aid for Yugoslavia was warranted.
 
'A Big Turning Point'
 The legislation says Yugoslav compliance is to be certified by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. When the deadline arrived, Mr. Baker permitted the sanctions to take effect without declaring a position on the issue.
"This marks a big turning point in our relations with Yugoslavia," an Administration official said. "It really does change our policy."
United States policy toward Yugoslavia for five decades has been to support "the territorial integrity and independence" of the country. On the same day the Administration decided on the aid suspension, Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, when asked about disarray and communal violence in the country, said, "We support a democratic unified Yugoslavia achieved through peaceful dialogue."
The six-month deadline mandated by Congress passed as nationalist turmoil was spreading in the multinational Balkan country, and Mr. Baker decided not to commit himself one way or another on whether the terms of the law had been met. Instead, the State Department press office was instructed simply to say, "No actions that would be prohibited under the legislation will be taken." That meant, in effect, no American economic aid.
 
Possible Effect in I.M.F.
 Although no new assistance programs are under consideration by the United States now, the cutoff could soon have an effect in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, where the United States would, under the law, be compelled to vote no on loans or credits for Yugoslavia.
In a separate measure, the Export-Import Bank is expected to announce next week that it no longer considers the Belgrade Government to be creditworthy, meaning eligible for guarantees for financing exports to Yugoslavia, Government officials said.
As the Congressional deadline on the Yugoslavia issue drew near, some State Department legal advisers said they concluded that the human rights criteria legislated by Congress in this case could be applied to several countries, possibly with disastrous effects on United States foreign relations.
Partly as a result of this conclusion, Mr. Baker determined not to set a precedent by taking a clear-cut position on the Yugoslav human rights matter, State Department officials said. Rather, he chose to let the sanctions go into force for the time being, leaving him the option to say later that Yugoslavia had or had not met the human rights criteria.
The legislation passed last year is an amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for the 1991 fiscal year, which ends in September. Called the Nickles Amendment for its principal author, Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, the measure instructs the Administration to oppose any assistance to Yugoslavia proposed in international financial institutions such as the I.M.F. or the World Bank. That could eventually have a crippling effect on Yugoslavia's efforts to reform its battered economy.
The motive behind the Nickles Amendment originally was to find a legislative vehicle for a group of senators and representatives to penalize the government of the Serbian Republic in particular and Yugoslavia in general for the repression of ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo region of Serbia.
 
Albanian-Americans Lobby
 That effort has been spearheaded by Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader. In recent years, Mr. Dole, Republican of Kansas, and other members of Congress have received hundreds of thousands of dollars in political action committee contributions from the Albanian-American lobby. Albanian-American organizations have often called for United States steps against Serbia.
There are about 1.7 million ethnic Albanians in the formerly autonomous province of Kosovo. In recent years, the Serbian government of President Slobodan Milosevic has imposed a form of martial law in Kosovo. More than 90 Albanians have been killed in clashes with Serbian security forces in the last two years.
But Senator Dole and his supporters on this issue found it impossible to single out Serbia, one of Yugoslavia's six constituent republics, in any meaningful legislation. They settled instead in conference with the House for an amendment that would hold Yugoslavia's federal Government responsible for human rights violations in any part of the country.
Since then, however, Yugoslavia has plunged ever deeper into a constitutional crisis, leaving the federal Government virtually paralyzed and the country without an armed forces chief or a head of state.
On April 18, Mr. Dole submitted a resolution to the Senate that said the criteria established in the Nickles Amendment "have not been met by the Yugoslav and Serbian governments." Passed by a voice vote, it singled out Slobodan Milosevic, calling on him "to cease all repressive policies against the Albanian population."

As Team Owners Consider Designating Two Cities, What Price Expansion?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Is baseball ready for the Miami Vise or perhaps the Denver Sprawl? For the first time since 1977, major league owners are preparing to make room in their elite circle. And in spite of the $95 million initiation fee, they do not want for applicants.
The decision by the owners on which two cities from a group that includes Buffalo, Washington, Denver, Miami, Orlando and St. Petersburg will get the new National League franchises may be made next month. And it is bound to disappoint the also-rans, as well as fans in a dozen other places who lust after big-league baseball teams of their own. But in the view of economists who study sports, the chances of baseball's opening the door much wider are small. 
 The public's interest in expansion, argues James Quirk, an economist formerly at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, conflicts with the interests of established players and owners. Adding even a half-dozen teams would dilute the financial windfall they now divide among themselves. Only a fundamental change in the business would alter baseball's incentive to resist growth. And only Congress is in a position to force change.
 Major league baseball is a shared monopoly, in which the exceptionally high returns to the principals can only be maintained if entry into the business is severely restricted.
Consider the $362 million annual take from national television contracts, roughly one-quarter of major league baseball's income, which is divided evenly among the clubs. Quirk believes that expansion would split the television pie into smaller pieces without guaranteeing any growth in baseball's television audience.
"It is hard to believe that more teams would add much to the national television market,." Quirk said.
Roger Noll an economist at Stanford University who has long tracked baseball's finances, agreed, noting that 80 percent of CBS's $250 million contract represents payment for the broadcast rights to the playoffs and the World Series.
Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, sees other ways in which expansion clubs could dilute the cartel's profits. Those situated near established teams, like the proposed Buffalo or Washington franchises, would be sure to cut into attendance and television audiences in Toronto and Baltimore.
 
No Traditional Rivalries
 New franchises are even likely to reduce the total drawing power of clubs thousands of miles away: Expansion clubs typically generate sparse attendance on the road, both because they play poorly and because there is no historical rivalry to bring out the fans.
Quantifying baseball's potential losses in future income and comparing them with the gain from franchise fees is guesswork. What does seem clear to economists is that relatively few cities could hope to support expansion franchises costing anything close to the $95 million entry fee that major league baseball is charging for this year's expansion franchises.
And as Noll noted, the cities with the best financial prospects are probably the least likely to be offered teams anytime soon. Expansion teams in suburbs of Los Angeles and New York, both lucrative markets, would almost certainly be vetoed by the owners of established franchises.
Free-agent players might imagine some immediate advantage in expansion; it's always nice to have more teams bidding for your services. But the equation of more bidders with fatter paychecks is almost certainly an illusion. While the rare superstar might lend credibility to a new franchise and thus be worth a few extra million dollars, adding many more teams would work against established players' interests because they would dilute major league baseball's total profit.
 If both owners and senior players have good reasons to choke off growth after this round of expansion, what hope is there for fans in cities like Sacramento, Calif., Phoenix, Indianapolis, San Antonio or Charlotte, N.C.?
 Were the Federal antitrust laws applied to baseball, the wish to maximize monopoly profits would not be a legal defense and the major leagues would probably not be able to prevent entry. But the courts, said Gerald Scully, a professor of management at the University of Texas at Dallas and the author of "The Business of Major League Baseball," have always been reluctant to take on the major leagues.
Might Congress rush in where the courts fear to tread? Senators Tim Wirth of Colorado and Connie Mack of Florida have pressed for expansion franchises for their states, using the threat of the antitrust hook as a door opener. But it is hard to find anyone who believes that Congress would be prepared to buck the major league's army of lobbyists and campaign contributors on the question of broader expansion.
Then there's the question of whether the cities that want the new franchises can truly support them. To a large degree the financial fortunes of teams in smaller cities turn on the loyalty of fans, the league standing of the team and the success of management in holding down costs without eviscerating the quality of play.
The three Florida cities in contention for the two new National League franchises -- Miami, Orlando and Tampa Bay -- show the greatest potential. Denver is positioning itself as the Rocky Mountain team, able to capture the loyalty of the entire Mountain time zone. More people live within driving range of Washington, but the franchise would have to compete for fans with the Baltimore Orioles. Buffalo, now home to a successful minor league team, suffers from a small population and its proximity to both Toronto and Cleveland.
However one rates the candidates, the key to their financial viability is television. The new franchises, which will field their first teams in 1993, will not be offered a piece of the current, four-year $1.4 billion contracts for national broadcast rights from CBS and ESPN, which expire that year. But they will no doubt be able to sell local television rights for a hefty sum.
None could hope to come close to the Yankees' deal with the MSG cable network, worth a minimum $36 million annually until the year 2000.

Demands to Fix U.S. Health Care Reach a Crescendo

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE American health care system is the most expensive in the world, but for those not in its mainstream, the care it offers is among the most unsatisfactory. Americans pay $700 billion a year for health care but 34 million of them remain uninsured. Life expectancy in the United States is shorter than in 15 other nations, and infant mortality is worse than in 22 other countries.
Many believe that this is a system in crisis, a crisis marked by sharp contrasts drawn mostly along class lines but permeating every segment of society. Now, after decades of fruitless debate, it has inspired a sense of urgency. In Congress, there have been more than a dozen proposals to revamp the system. And last week the medical establishment, through its leading professional publication, the Journal of the American Medical Association, trumpeted its concern and called for action. While these and other advocates have produced a bewildering diversity of overhaul plans, they agree on at least a couple of things: reforming health care is essentially a political problem; and it will be difficult to solve without leadership from the White House, which so far has had little to say on the issue. 
 A main concern of reformers is that patients' medical needs play so small a role in determining levels of care and reimbursement. Ron Pollack, executive director of Families U.S.A., a nonprofit health reform group, tells of a Maryland couple with full health insurance that has been bankrupted by their son's ailment. A star soccer player by day, the boy suffers near suffocation every night because of a nerve disorder. The family's policy, as most policies do, has an upper limit on some expenses, and theirs -- $100,000 per dependent -- was exceeded when the boy was 11 months old. He is now 10 years old; his family is $600,000 in debt.
For the public, fear is growing. In any two-year period there are 34 million people without health insurance. But the number who lose their insurance at least temporarily is nearly double that many, 63 million.
For businesses, tension is rising. Companies watch as health care spending devours ever larger portions of their profits. In the 1960's, businesses spent about 4 to 8 cents of each dollar of profits on health care. In 1990, it was 25 to 50 cents per dollar and rising.
For labor, anger mounts. The Service Employees International Union reports that the proportion of workers involved in health-care related strikes rose from 18 percent of all strikers in 1986 to 78 percent in 1989.
Enter the doctors. On Wednesday, the American Medical Association, a group usually seen as fiercely opposed to all social reform in medicine, shed its inhibitions. The Journal of the American Medical Association and all of its nine attendant journals were devoted to calls for health care reform. There were no fewer than 13 separate proposed solutions.
The new leadership at the physicians' group made strong statements of new-found fervor for reform.
"The A.M.A.'s old style was to react and be against things," said C. John Tupper, president of the association. "But there has been a philosophical change in our house of delegates," the group's policy-making body. "We will be out front where the action is. We'll stop being just selfish and only thinking of our own welfare. If we start taking good care of our patients, they will take care of us."
He added: "I think we will see health care reform high on the list of both presidential candidates in the next election."
But on the Potomac, when there is too much interest in a subject a political paralysis can result. In Congress there have been no fewer than 14 proposals to revamp the national system. At the White House, there have been no major proposals, as political specialists wait for the right conservative proposal and the right moment -- just before or just after the election -- to put it forward.
Still, there is some optimism in Congress, especially among staff members in Senator Edward M. Kennedy's Committee on Labor and Health, where last fall, for the first time, a huge health care proposal received a favorable vote and was reported out of committee.
A committee aide said the difference is that the Democratic leadership is behind the bill. "It brings many Democrats on board and almost certainly leads to a floor vote," the aide said. "That in turn means people from the different groups have to come in to start cutting deals. Let me not mislead you. It will be a tough fight. If it weren't hard, we would have passed reform 20 years ago like every other industrialized country did."
Senator Kennedy, who along with Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine is an author of the leadership bill, said on Friday that Congress "has been slow to respond, and so has the Administration."
"More and more businesses, labor unions, hospitals and doctors understand that something must be done, Mr. Kennedy said. "We are closer to enacting real reform today than at any time since Medicare was enacted in 1965."
In the House, the Democratic majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, has asked committee chairmen to put together a broader proposal that could be accepted by many of the interested parties.
Congressional staff members believe there are at least two ways the politics might work. If enough momentum can be gained to pass some major legislation or several smaller bills in this Congress, the result will likely be a proposal that requires employers to give insurance to employees or pay some amount into a pool to cover all those now uninsured. President Bush would likely veto such a plan because it puts too great a burden on businesses.
Others believe that if it appeared that Congress would produce a proposal that might pass, the President might feel obliged to have his own proposal and work for a compromise.
When the Administration came forth with its first proposal of any kind on health care reform last week, a plan to curb the costs of malpractice, it was met with a negative chorus from Capitol Hill. One Congressional staff member called it "laughable," because it addressed such a narrow part of the problem, and did so two years after similar proposals were made in Congress.
While not all Bush Administration officials want to get involved in the issue, among those pressing for a plan are Richard G. Darman, the Budget Director, and Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis W. Sullivan. But generally the attitude is wait and see.
"We're not neglecting the issue," a White House official said. "But we would rather have a good proposal than a quick one. There are two questions here. One about the timing and one about what kind of proposal would be the one we would want to put forward. It is true that this has traditionally been viewed as a Democratic issue, that Republicans can only lose. And we don't want to be leading with our chins by putting out a proposal that will fail or can't work."
One possibility is to put forward a plan in the months just before the election so that the President can come into office with a mandate to put his proposal into action. Somewhat more likely right now is that no major proposal, or package of minor proposals, will be forthcoming until after the election.
An official at the Department of Health and Human Services said, "We simply don't have a consensus now in the country on what should be done, even though we all agree something must be done."
The trouble in any case is money. The simplest reform idea, for a national health service akin to Canada's, is almost universally pronounced dead because it is too great a change for politicians to accomplish, at least in one stroke. All other proposals require major taxes or shifts of tax burden in society. Many liberals propose plans that require employers to pay for insurance for employees; many conservatives propose plans that require individuals to buy their own coverage with tax credits after new health taxes are levied.
In a worried economy, any such programs will meet with resistance, so prognosticators in both the Administration and Congress say that while momentum for reform will probably continue, no major action is likely until the end of 1992, or in the new Congress beginning in 1993. But no one now doubts that it will come.

Glimpsing the Future, The Red Army Frets

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
THE American military successes in the gulf war seem to hold a clear message for the Soviet high command: a professional army with exotic electronic weaponry can make mince-meat of a massive land force of conscripts and tanks. Indeed, Soviet marshals have been quick to seize on the demonstration of the West's high-tech muscle to call for a tune-up in their air defenses and, not surprisingly, to argue for more money.
"What happened in Kuwait and Iraq necessitates a review of the attitude towards army air defenses and the country's entire air defense system," declared Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov shortly after the war's end. "When we ask ourselves, did it work in Iraq, we have to answer, mostly it did not. And then we ask, why not?" 
 Soon after the war broke out, the military set up a special group to answer questions like that, and in March the General Staff conducted a conference to assess the war's implications. In purely military terms, the issues seemed straightforward, and they suggested that the Kremlin would do well to go ahead with the much-discussed shift to an all-volunteer army and to reconsider its presumption that a war would involve defending against a huge ground invasion. Last week, the Supreme Soviet passed a bill creating an experimental volunteer unit in the Navy.
The gulf war also raised questions about the doctrines limiting the military to strictly defensive measures. The allies' effectiveness in neutralizing Iraqi defenses, Soviet military analysts have argued, showed that an army cannot wait passively for an attack. Accordingly, Soviet statements now talk of a strategy of "adequate response."
What this will eventually mean in practical terms, however, probably depends less on the analyses of the gulf war or recommendations of military experts than on the complex mess in which the Soviet Union finds itself.
Of all Soviet institutions, the military probably faces the most profound challenge from the collapse of the Stalinist model. For one thing, the Soviet economy simply cannot continue to shovel exorbitant resources at the military, and there is no way a democratic government would allow this.
 
An Exorbitant Cost
 The real cost of the military is still something of a mystery, but no one denies that it consumes a ridiculous portion of the national wealth. According to various official figures, the military absorbed 40 percent of the machinery output, 50 percent of the Russian Federation's industrial output, 40 percent of the national budget, 18 percent of the gross national product. Thus the problem, as Georgy Arbatov, head of the U.S.A. Institute, wrote, goes beyond military organization: "Both the reduction of armed forces and the conversion of the defense industry have become less of a military and political problem than a social one: In our supermilitarized society, they are threatening the interests of hundreds of thousands, even millions, of military personnel and employees in the military industry and defense research."
There is also an institutional reluctance in the military -- common to any bureaucracy and exacerbated in time of economic crisis -- to surrender any of its possessions, even if they are acknowledged as superfluous. Marshal Yazov inadvertently gave voice to this anxiety in a recent interview: "They ask us, do you really need the tanks right now? No, we can do without new tanks for three or four years. But what do we do with the factories? With the working class? Dismiss the workers? In four years' time they'll convert the plant to produce something else, and in five years we'll go to them and say, 'Comrades, make us some tanks; ours have reached the end of their service life.' "
Soviet generals are proving equally reluctant to shed the enormous political and social role the military played in the old order. Since Stalin, the vast military-industrial complex and the conscript army have been a fundamental lever of state power, used to indoctrinate every Soviet man in ideology and discipline, and to extend control throughout the empire.
Initially, Marshal Yazov and the Chief of Staff, Mikhail Moiseyev -- who is in Washington this week for talks on conventional arms reduction -- were viewed as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's hand-picked partners in reform. But as with so many carryovers from the pre-Gorbachev era -- not least Mr. Gorbachev himself -- they have had second thoughts.
 
The Enemy Within

The withdrawal from Eastern Europe and Afghanistan, collapse of the Warsaw Pact, shrinking budgets, abuse from newly vocal critics, criticism over domestic bloodshed, increases in defections, revelations of brutality in the ranks, demise of ideology and general disintegration of Soviet society -- all this has led men like Marshal Yazov and General Moiseyev to voice open revulsion for the fruits of liberalization. "Things have reached the point where the October anniversary is not observed as a national holiday in some places," Marshal Yazov groused in the interview, referring to Revolution Day, "and neither is Soviet Army Day."
That sort of talk points to another reality, that after spending their lives bracing to defend "socialism," the military -- and the K.G.B. and the rest of the ideological apparatus set up by the Communists -- realized that the enemy was not out there, but within, in the yearning for democracy and the failure of Communism.
Such thoughts are bound to have effects as the military command ponders its future and the lessons of the gulf war. On the theoretical side, it may be clear that an elite high-tech force is the way of the future. But that would also mean a different role for the military in Soviet society, a retreat from its central role in the ideological and social spheres. For old soldiers sworn to defend socialism, the choice may not be obvious.

The Task: Slip Spies Into the New World Order

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IF confirmed by the Senate as the Director of Central Intelligence, Robert M. Gates may well take the United States intelligence "community" through its most important transition since President Harry Truman set the structure for America's bureaucracy of spies in 1947.
Despite the best efforts by the departing director, William H. Webster, to define a new role for the spy agencies he has supervised since the death of William J. Casey in 1987, the farflung American intelligence apparatus remains in search of enemies and threats to justify not just its $30 billion budget, but its very existence. 
 Saddam Hussein and the Persian Gulf war provided a respite from the "What-are-we-about?" debate that has seized the nation's intelligence agencies since the Berlin wall came down. But President Bush's nomination of Mr. Gates last week abruptly returned the spotlight to the intelligence agenda, which is anything but in order.
Both the House and Senate oversight committees are warning that if the new C.I.A. director does not bring discipline to intelligence spending and cut duplication between military and civilian agencies, they will force changes by legislation. Mr. Gates is viewed as a forceful bureaucrat with C.I.A. and White House training who will seek to pre-empt the intelligence committees by making his own changes. But any major restructuring will meet formidable institutional resistance.
"My concern about the new director," said the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Dave McCurdy, "is that he be willing to take on the bureaucracy and the culture in order to bring about the necessary changes and have a much broader focus for intelligence."
One of the changes both committees are considering could strip away the broad mandate the C.I.A. head currently has to direct the entire intelligence community, leaving him to run only his agency, and create a director of national intelligence to be the President's intelligence czar.
Aside from the C.I.A., the "community" includes the National Reconnaissance Office, which is in charge of imagery satellites; the National Security Agency, which is in charge of signal interception; the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's analytical arm, and an assortment of military intelligence services.
Whatever changes are wrought by Mr. Gates or the oversight committees, the C.I.A. and its sister agencies appear to be headed for a period of budgetary decline. "There are actually greater requirements for sophisticated intelligence than ever before," said Mr. McCurdy, "but they are going to have to be accomplished with fewer resources."
 
Shrinking Threats
 In the same pattern as the Pentagon's $300 billion budget, more than half of the dollars spent for intelligence collection and analysis over the last four decades have been targeted at the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. With that threat gone, American intelligence czars have yet to answer the questions about what they are going to do in the next century.
To be sure, there will be drug trafficking to combat, terrorism to counter and third world brush-fire wars to monitor, but these problems pale against the overarching military threat the Soviet Union once posed -- although some monitoring of Soviet strategic and conventional forces will be necessary for years to come.
With a fleet of high-technology reconnaissance satellites, scores of aircraft, submarines, underwater sensors, mountaintop listening posts, legions of spies and analysts, the intelligence agencies live in an insular and well-funded world, issuing reports on worldwide trends and events, but driven less and less by the engines of East-West competition.
Many experts believe the problems of the future, such as economic collapse in the third world, ethnic and regional conflict, environmental degradation and population control, will be readily apparent. The challenge will be more to understand what is visible than to ferret out what is hidden.
Today, and increasingly in the future, large parts of the multibillion dollar intelligence programs are destined to suffer the crisis of justification that has befallen the B-2 Stealth Bomber, a weapon built to penetrate Soviet air space during nuclear war but now seeking a new mission in a safer world.
An intelligence parallel is the National Security Agency, with 27,000 employees and an annual budget of $4 billon. Behind the high security fences at its headquarters in Ft. Meade, Md., one of N.S.A.'s largest single activities is collating, interpreting and breaking the codes of Soviet communications, radar signals, telemetry and computer data intercepted by $1 billion-plus satellites or by squadrons of spy planes. Billions of dollars have been spent for the banks of supercomputers the agency uses to run programs that decode what Soviet political leaders and military commanders are saying to each other.
Is this agency ripe for cutting? "Yes," said Bobby Ray Inman, a former N.S.A. director and now a member of the President's intelligence advisory board.
"But before you start reorganizing, you need to decide what you want to know about the outside world and you need to look ten years out and not five," he said. "We will have almost no concerns about military activity in Eastern Europe, but we will be vastly more interested in internal stability, economic and political developments. It's not that we are going to be doing vastly less, but we're going to be doing it in the open."
One former intelligence officer observed that more could be learned today about the implosion of the Soviet empire by openly sending American cultural attaches to each of the Soviet Republics than by recruiting networks of spies to dig out secret data.
"I think American intelligence needs to have a better feel for the societies in which they operate overseas," said Graham Fuller, a former Middle East analyst for the C.I.A. "It isn't just the collection of secrets that helps the agency predict events, it's getting our fingers on the pulse of society. That's not secret, it's just hard to find out."
For all the billions of dollars sunk into intelligence systems in the last decade, the intelligence community has a mixed record on spotting trouble. In the national security review Mr. Bush conducted in early 1989, C.I.A. analysts predicted: "War weary Iraq will pose a military threat to small neighboring states during this period, but will be reluctant to engage in foreign military adventures. It is more likely to resort to diplomacy and subversion to achieve its goals." By March 1990, the agency was saying that the Iraqi leader might undertake a new military campaign in the region after three more years of recuperation from its war with Iran.
Even Mr. Gates, who built his reputation as a C.I.A. analyst with well-grounded predictive powers, was confidently forecasting in January 1989 that the Afghan leader, Najibullah, would not last through the summer after the Soviet army's pullout. Yet Najibullah still dominates Kabul two years later and has confounded American policy in Afghanistan.
These and other examples demonstrate that the intelligence business is a very expensive game of informed assessments and predictions in which truth is often the most elusive product. The question is, said the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, David Boren, in recent hearings, how much should the United States pay for it?
As Mr. Gates heads for what may be a grueling series of confirmation hearings, he will have to be concerned not just about the price, but how, in a rapidly changing world, to find the product.

HEADLINE: The Everyday Disaster of Life in Bangladesh

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: DHAKA, Bangladesh

 BODY:
A CYCLONE in the south, flooding in the north, and tornadoes in the center. Those are the latest natural disasters in a country that is often regarded, by Bangladeshis and foreign aid workers alike, as bountiful primarily in misfortune.
"No country has got a worse natural and environmental deal than Bangladesh," The Dhaka Courier said in an editorial this month. "One must seriously consider whether there is a curse on this land or not." 
 To be sure, even for the poorest Bangladeshis, lives are less miserable than they used to be. The economy is growing, and there is generally more ethnic, religious and linguistic harmony than in India and other countries in the region. Even the terrible floods are a blessing of sorts, for they irrigate and fertilize the land.
But the 8,000 American troops who arrived a few days ago to help with cyclone relief efforts seem struck mostly by the scenes of wretchedness: babies dying of diarrhea, ragged children begging in the streets, destitute families huddled in shanties and forced to use any bit of open ground as their toilet. They are found not only among the cyclone victims but routinely throughout the country. The cyclone was merely a spectacular addition to a misery that is endemic.
When the American military assistance for Kurds is completed, many of the Kurds may be able to return to their homes and resume normal lives. But when American troops leave Bangladesh, the people will continue to die in appalling numbers.
The cyclone captured international attention by killing some 139,000 people, an official count that could be way off in either direction. But each year, even without a cyclone, more than 260,000 children under the age of 5 die of nothing more than diarrhea. Respiratory infections kill another 157,000 each year, and even measles takes the lives of more than 60,000 children.
Inevitably, death by natural disaster catches the eye more than death by diarrhea, and Bangladesh's geographical location insures plenty of catastrophes.
"It's very unlucky," says Charles H. Larsimont, the resident representative of the United Nations Development Program. "When you're in a configuration like this, where big rivers lead to a flood plain, then that causes a big mess every once in a while."
In addition to the flooding from the north and west, Bangladesh faces cyclones from the south and east. Poor communications and government mismanagement sometimes compound the disasters in Bangladesh by slowing the relief efforts and allowing people to die afterward of hunger or illness.
With the floods and cyclones, Bangladesh has faced a series of calamities: the 1970 cyclone killed some 300,000 to 500,000 people, the war for independence in 1971 claimed an immense number of lives variously estimated from several hundred thousand to several million, and then there was a famine in 1974, and periodic floods and cyclones ever since.
In a richer country, the weather would not be so lethal, but population pressures have obliged people to live in thatched huts on any clump of land that rises above the sea, accepting the risk of drowning as preferable to the risk of starvation.
These population pressures will get far worse. The population, now 118 million, is growing by about 2.5 percent a year and by some forecasts will reach 219 million by the year 2025 -- in a country that is the size of Wisconsin.
The Government encourages family planning, and the birth control pill and injectable contraceptives are free, while condoms are available at a subsidized price equivalent to one-eighth of a penny each. One-third of Bangladeshi couples now use contraceptives, and population experts see some hope that the population growth will eventually be controlled.
But in other important areas, the situation may be deteriorating. Most important, the literacy rate is only 24 percent and has been dropping in recent years. The education system is in disarray, and one-third of children of elementary school age are not enrolled.
In some respects, Bangladesh resembles countries like China before their Communist revolutions. Not only is it poor -- per capita income is $170 a year -- but social inequities are overwhelming, with homeless beggars sharing streets with tycoons riding in imported cars. There is a substantial class of peasants without property, who must till the soil of others.
Yet while socialist rhetoric has had some resonance here, Communists have never made many inroads in Bangladesh. A prime reason may be that 84 percent of the people are Muslims and disapprove of Communist assertions of athiesm. In any case, Bangladesh now has a democratic government and a tolerance for free expression that may allow steam to be released without challenging the system directly.
There is also a measure of hope that life will improve. Real economic growth has averaged between 3 percent and 4 percent in recent years -- a modest increment above the population growth rate -- and Bangladesh has improved its infrastructure and built up an impressive garment export industry.
Some foreign development experts and diplomats, and more Bangladeshis, cite these achievements to voice a cautious optimism for the country. They note that headlines about disasters tend to obscure the country's progress. This year, for example, there may well be a record rice harvest, despite the cyclone, and Bangladesh will be nearly self-sufficient in food.
A Western diplomat cited several strengths of the country: a resilient people, absence of major communal violence or secessionist warfare, the presence of an educated group of technocrats, a brand of Islam that is relatively pragmatic and is not anti-Western, and a widespread desire for stability and political dialogue.
"There is a lot more going on here than just disasters," he said.

Castro Reopens The Gate To Exodus

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
LAST summer, when a few dozen Cubans sought to flee by taking refuge in Havana's foreign embassies, an uncompromising President Fidel Castro defused one of the most delicate crises he has faced in recent years, vowing that not a single asylum seeker would be allowed to leave the island.
But with Cuba's moribund economy unravelling faster than its Communist leadership can devise reforms, a sharp reversal in Mr. Castro's tactics has set off a wave of Cuban emigration that is becoming a sensitive challenge for the United States as well. 
 The Cuban Government's new strategy, including steep reductions in age minimums for exit visas needed to leave the country legally and a relaxation of once-aggressive efforts to police the island's shores against escapees, has spurred a sudden rush toward the United States. Many say the initial reaction of Cubans recalls the prelude to the 1980 Mariel boatlift, when a similar burst of asylum-seekers led to the hectic exodus of 125,000 people.
In recent months, as basic goods from soap to razors to fish to fruit have disappeared from Cuban shelves, the number of refugees trying to reach South Florida by perilous sea journey aboard inner tubes and makeshift rafts has jumped dramatically. While summer, with its calm seas, has normally been the preferred season for such journeys, well over 600 Cubans have already been rescued this year by the United States Coast Guard, a record.
At the same time, according to the State Department, visa applications at the United States Interests Section in Havana, where one officer processes all requests, have also been increasing at a record rate. So far this year, 25,000 non-immigrant visas have already been issued in Havana, compared with 34,000 for all of last year. "We have a backlog of about 30,000 applications sitting in boxes that we haven't even opened yet," said one United States official.
 
Many Will Stay
 Immigration officials say they have no way of knowing how many Cubans decide to stay in the United States after arriving with non-immigrant visas. Cubans are automatically eligible for legal residency after a six-month stay in the United States, and as conditions worsen in Cuba, the percentage of those availing themselves of this privilege is thought to be rising.
While officials in Washington acknowledge discussions on the matter between the State Department, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Coast Guard, they declined to provide any details of possible responses to further steep rises in the numbers of Cuban boat refugees. Noting reports that Havana would soon lower its exit visa age minimum to 18, from 35 for men, one official said only, "Our policy is the same worldwide, and each case's merits will be adjudicated on an individual basis."
While Washington issues coolly worded statements of principle, experts in hemispheric affairs say that any surge in attempts by Cubans to take refuge in the United States will present American policymakers with a nettlesome tangle of political and diplomatic questions.
 
'A No-Win Situation'
 "This is a clear case of a no-win situation for the United States," said Gillian Gunn, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "Whichever way the Government responds, there will be real liabilities."
Ms. Gunn and other Cuba watchers say another wave of Cuban immigration to this country would open the Administration to criticism from conservatives and from Havana's staunchest Cuban-American foes that it is helping rescue Mr. Castro's Communist system from terminal decline.
Moreover, these analysts say, special measures to open the United States' doors wider for Cubans fleeing a sharp deterioration in their living standards would draw charges of inconsistency from countries like El Salvador and Haiti, whose citizens have enjoyed no favors while fleeing arguably harsher circumstances.
Cuban affairs experts argue, meanwhile, that if the United States maintains its current policies, Mr. Castro will attempt to blame the United States for the deaths at sea and the frustrations of Cubans unable to travel to this country.
"If all we do is keep rescuing people at sea, we will have a crisis in the making," said Jorge I. Dominguez, a political scientist who studies Cuban affairs at Harvard. "We are signalling to ordinary Cubans that it is all right for them to come this way."
Other pressure to accommodate fleeing Cubans is likely to come from the Cuban-American community, which could use its influence within Florida and the Republican Party to demand emergency relief.
Even on this issue, however, Cuban-Americans, who number about one million people, are as deeply ambivalent as anyone. Some groups have already begun to call for all those fleeing Cuba to be treated as human rights cases, immediately eligible for residence, while others, anxious to precipitate Mr. Castro's fall, urge more caution. Hard-liners say that Mr. Castro has already encouraged large-scale emigration from Cuba three times during his reign, to relieve social pressures and purge the island of its most disaffected citizens. To take in more Cubans now, they say, would only help him maintain control.
A growing number of Cuba experts say that the debate over the immigration issue misses the point of the potentially explosive change facing a country whose 32-year Communist system is in steep decline.
"Unless they can make the necessary changes toward a mixed economy we could see a very bloody process that would leave both countries in real trouble," said Wayne Smith, the former chief American diplomat in Havana and the director of Cuban Studies at Johns Hopkins University. "If we don't want to see a huge number of people coming to the United States from Cuba, then what we should be working for is a peaceful transition."

Dinkins's Nightmare Budget Gains A Frightening Air of Plausibility

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
JUST a week after Mayor David N. Dinkins proposed a New York City budget so grim that he called it a worst-case warning, it seemed the worst might really come to pass.
Mr. Dinkins's hopes for avoiding the harshest of $2 billion in spending cuts to balance the $29 billion budget got a setback when one of the angels he'd counted on, Felix G. Rohatyn, had his wings clipped. 
Mr. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was set up to borrow money on the city's behalf in the last fiscal crisis, said he could not proceed with plans to give the city $1 billion over the next four years by refinancing the corporation's bonds. The Standard & Poor's credit rating agency had warned him that this might let the city paper over its problems and would cause a lowering of the city's bond rating.
Since a downgrade would make it harder and more costly for the city to borrow money in the credit markets -- the very problem MAC was created to avoid -- Mr. Rohatyn said it was a risk he could not take and the corporation's help would have to wait. That left the municipal unions, from whom Mr. Dinkins has been seeking wage and benefit concessions, saying they'd have to wait and see, too.
So the City Council, six weeks before the start of the new fiscal year, is left with the budget Mr. Dinkins gave it. That would mean thousands of layoffs, dirtier streets, darkened streetlamps and closed health clinics, pharmacies and homeless shelters.
"I think that the worst-case scenario is clearly going to be a worst case," said the Council's finance chairman, Herbert E. Berman of Brooklyn. "You can't create any false expectations. There's an inability to do anything dramatic."
That sounded less sanguine than the pledge of the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, a week earlier to spare the city some of the nearly $1 billion in proposed taxes and avert the worst of Mr. Dinkins's threatened cuts, which would be a neat trick in the best of times. But Mr. Berman insisted: "I do think we can hold down taxes. I think we can look at reordering priorities."
 
Left in the Lurch
 The week's developments left Mr. Dinkins in the lurch, too, since he had proposed cutting many programs dear to him as a way of prodding the unions, Mr. Rohatyn and the state to help. Now he risks having some of those cuts accepted by the Council and being blamed for them. "I can't believe that this is the set of cuts he would have chosen if he thought he'd have to carry them out," said a state official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Many city officials viewed Mr. Rohatyn's setback as transitory. Wall Street may downgrade the city's bonds in any event, they say. Then, even after a budget full of cuts is passed, Mr. Rohatyn could be free to go ahead and help the city by refinancing some of the Assistance Corporation's bonds. The money could then be used as a reserve to help the city in the event of even further downturns in the economy.
"In some strange ways, I think this makes it even more certain," said a senior mayoral aide, who asked not be identified, referring to the eventuality of the corporation helping.
The contretemps pointed up again the reality that the strict controls imposed on the city after the crisis of the mid-1970's -- which force it to balance its budget precisely and adjust it perpetually -- compel it to make cuts in services from sanitation to parks that other cities would seldom be forced to consider.
And because of the city's consuming need to maintain access to the public credit markets -- to finance the cost of building the roads and bridges and schools and jails it needs -- a handful of analysts and experts on Wall Street hold powerful sway over its priorities, even while insisting it is not their job to tell the Mayor what to cut.
 
Staying on Planet Earth
 One of the rating agencies' main objections to help from Mr. Rohatyn was that it would be a nonrecurring revenue. But Mr. Dinkins, noting that it would come over four years, wondered to reporters just how long a revenue must flow to be continuing.
"You know, 'recurring' is a question of definitions," Mr. Dinkins said. "How often need it appear to be recurring? Four years is not enough? Maybe it's six or seven."
The Mayor, confronted with a checklist of tactics for balancing the budget that one group or another considers verboten -- from higher taxes to deeper cuts to one-shot revenues -- has sometimes wavered in his rhetoric, forswearing each by turns, but unable to forswear all of them.
For example, while looking askance at "one-shots," he accepted a private, one-time donation from a charitable foundation to keep the city's 32 swimming pools open for part of the summer, though private donations are not generally the sort of one-shots fiscal monitors frown on. Or as Roger Altman, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and one of his financial advisers, put it, "When people say no one-shots, I ask them what planet they're on."
By law, Mr. Dinkins's feet must stay planted firmly on the earth of a balanced budget. But just as it seemed the challenges could hardly rise higher around him, they rose again.
"Sometimes I feel as if we're in the last half of the fourth game of the World Series, and the news is filled each night with player profiles, scores and instant replays," the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, told a civic group on Friday. "The bookies are making a fortune, and I'm up to bat. This is the World Series all right. But the game isn't baseball. It's the survival and supremacy of our city that is at stake."

Oil Facts and Follies

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB; Anna Quindlen is on vacation.

 BODY:
Certain facts pack a thermonuclear bang. Consider this one: Before the end of the decade, the Soviet Union -- the world's largest oil producer -- will become a net importer of oil.
 That future fact could explode most of America's most vital national security objectives. It means virtually no hope for economic development and democracy in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. And it guarantees massive dependence on volatile Persian Gulf states, the only producers capable of filling the shortfall. 
 Top Bush Administration officials, Soviet leaders and oil experts everywhere are well aware of the situation. But few are doing anything about it. Inaction, when much can be done quickly, amounts to reckless irresponsibility.
Here are the facts as understood by oil experts, and laid bare again last week by Yevgeni Khartukov, a senior Soviet energy official:
 Soviet oil output, without market reforms and Western help, will decline from 11.5 million barrels daily in 1990 to possibly 9 million by 2000. Net exports, which totaled 3 million barrels daily in 1990, will fall to zero by 1994 or sooner. By the end of the decade, Moscow will run a net deficit of about 2 million barrels daily, assuming present rates of Soviet domestic consumption. The plus to minus turnaround could be 5 million barrels per day in this pessimistic but realistic scenario.
 Oil exports represent 40 to 60 percent of Soviet hard currency earnings. Their loss plus the new bill for oil imports would wipe out Moscow's hard currency reserves and sharply reduce funds to buy essential Western goods. Efforts at economic reform almost certainly would collapse. Moscow could turn to selling more arms to make up the cash deficit, but that is the last thing the West would want. It is hard to imagine fragile democratic roots surviving in such dire economic circumstances.
 Declining Soviet oil output also would create upward pressures on world oil prices. The effects on Eastern Europe (not to speak of all developing countries) would be immediate and devastating. These economies would tumble, with fatal repercussions on democratic movements.
 Meantime, U.S. oil production has declined by 2 million barrels daily since 1986, and consumption continues to rise here and around the world. By the end of the century, the world shortfall could be 7 to 9 million barrels daily. That gap could be closed easily by the gulf states. But no leader of an industrialized nation would wish for that state of affairs for painfully obvious reasons.
 To avert the fallout of declining Soviet oil production, first steps are up to Soviet leaders. They have to clear the mine field of restrictive laws and practices that seriously retard joint ventures with eager Western oil companies. For example, The Petroleum Intelligence Weekly will report the breakdown of critical negotiations between Chevron and Moscow, largely because of conflicts between the Moscow bureaucracy and the Azerbaijan republic.
 Next steps belong to Western oil conglomerates. They cannot be too greedy. Reportedly, Chevron was demanding all export profits from the proposed joint venture. Industrialized governments have to help by approving technology exports. Desperately needed new equipment can be put in place rapidly, thus halting the slide in Soviet oil production and exports.
 Finally, Americans have to stop behaving like infants and act in their clear self-interest. President Bush's energy policy is laughable in its inattention to conservation and its unwillingness to entertain a high gas tax. So say many of his own experts, especially in light of the Soviet situation.
 This would not be the first time that the Soviet and Russian oil industry has had decisive effects on the world market. In the late 1870's, Imperial Russia's entry into oil trade broke Standard Oil's monopoly on the world market. In the late 1920's, Soviet dumping of exports prompted major oil companies to counter with a cartel. Similar Soviet dumping in 1960 led even more dramatically to the formation of OPEC.
 The coming Soviet-induced oil crisis will be far more threatening to goals held most dear by Soviet reformers and American leaders. Solutions are well within their power if only they would focus on the thermonuclear fact staring them in the face.

HEADLINE: A Sampling of Expeditions

BYLINE: By NANCY SHARKEY

 BODY:
ECOTOURISM is the travel buzzword of the 90's. Dozens of nonprofit environmental groups are vigorously working to preserve natural areas and selling field excursions to their members. And a new crop of environmental entrepeneurs -- scientists, professors, former Peace Corps workers and tour operators -- has begun capitalizing on the interests of a generation raised on Rachel Carson and Jacques-Yves Cousteau.
The destinations selected by these organizations tend to be clustered in developing countries, in Central and South America, Africa, Asia and the South Pacific, where vast tracts of pristine land are home to endangered animals, rare birds, and exotic plants and trees. But worthy tours are also offered in the United States, the Caribbean and Hawaii. 
 This listing highlights 20 of the 500 or so organizations whose trips are marketed as evironmental travel. It is not all-inclusive; many smaller companies have tours with regional focuses, like the Rain Forest Alliance, a New York-based group with trips to Brazil, and Baja Expeditions of San Diego, known for its whale-watching trips. And virtually every trekking company can claim to follow one of the key tenets of ecotourism: take nothing from the land; leave only your footprints.
These companies are divided into nonprofit organizations, many of whom subcontract with private operators and add their own specialists as guides, and private operators who, conversely, are beginning to found and finance their own nonprofit research organizations in the areas they visit. Some of the nonprofit trips have an added appeal: tax deductions. Earthwatch, for example, says its trips are virtually entirely deductible.
A sample tour for each company is listed. These were selected for geographic range and diversity. Prices are for one person, based on double occupancy, and unless otherwise specified include all meals, lodging, local transportation and guides.

With its hands-on environmental agenda, Earthwatch was founded in 1971 to preserve fragile lands, monitor change and conserve endangered species. Its scientific expeditions draw about 3,500 people a year who are willing to work on their vacation. Members have supported nearly 2,000 projects throughout the world and contributed $17 million to scientific research. This year, Earthwatch offers 120 projects, primarily in the United States, Central America, the Caribbean and Europe. The range of programs is wide, from tracking timber wolves and counting the humpback whale population off Mozambique to exploring ancient civilizations in Europe and Africa. Volunteers sign up for a week or two; some projects have as few as three teams, others go year round.
 
Canary Island Sea Life
The goal is to assess whether island tourism can be encouraged without endangering fragile marine environments. Team members who are divers make one or two dives a day to depths of 60 feet, recording algae growth, counting fish and looking at habitats. Nondivers document life in tidepools and intertidal areas. The research is led by James Van Tassell of the American Museum of Natural History, Dr. Steve Bortone of the University of West Florida and Dr. Alberto Drito Hernandez of the University of La Laguna in the Canary Islands.
Cost: $1,295 for the 12-night stay, including accommodations in apartments and some restaurant meals but excluding air fare to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands.

FOUNDATION FOR FIELD RESEARCH
Post Office Box 2010, Alpine, Calif. 91903
619-445-9264
Founded in 1982 as a matching service between scientific researchers and volunteer assistants, the foundation supports projects in anthropology, oceanography, archeology, botany and biology. Volunteers are both expedition members and a financing source. Accommodations are Spartan; work is hard. The number of volunteers on a team ranges from 5 to 25, with an average of 10. Programs range from protecting leatherback turtles in Michoacan, Mexico, to examining agricultural problems caused by protected prairie dogs in Missouri. The foundation's current offering of 38 programs travels mostly to Mexico and the Western United States, but also to Grenada, Wales, Mali, Liberia, Micronesia and British Columbia. The foundation says that an average of 76 percent of the program cost goes directly into the field for research. The remainder is for advertising, tour planning and administration.
 
Creating a National Park in Mali
In the southwest of Mali, the Government has established a reservation, the first step to protecting the region. Scientists, led by a Senegalese researcher, are conducting a census of animal life, including baboons, buffalo and chimpanzees, which will help set boundaries for a national park. The study will also involve an anthropologist analyzing the park's impact on local communities.
Project cost: $1,672 with housing in tents, with field kitchen, shower and latrine. Excludes air fare to Mali.
Dates: Two-week periods from Feb. 10, 1992, to May 2, 1992.

Cost: $5,615 to $8,835, depending on cabin location. Includes lodging, meals, excursions and lectures; excludes transportation to and from Oslo.
Dates: July 8 to 24 (cruise starts July 11).
 
NATURE CONSERVANCY INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM
1815 North Lynn Street, Arlington, Va. 22209
703-247-3720
Helping to preserve fragile areas by buying land in North America, or helping local groups abroad who make the acquisition, the conservancy protects the world's largest private reserve system, consisting of 5.5 million acres in 50 states and Canada in 1,200 individual preserves. In addition, a vigorous Latin American program has protected 25 million acres in Belize, Bolivia, Costa Rica and other countries. The international travel program, begun four years ago, sends about 400 people a year to Central and South America. Part of their payment includes $300 for an emergency land-protection fund. The trips are packaged by International Expeditions, Geostar Travel and Society Expeditions and use two guides: a Nature Conservancy escort and an in-country naturalist. The average group size is 15.
 
Argentine Pampas
A 14-night tour to the Punta Rosa Biological Station to see migratory bird species, the Patagonia region and the Magellan penguin colony at Punto Tombo, the Valdes Peninsula (with its elephant seals) and Argentina's Glacier National Park, where participants cruise along the Upsala Glacier, then sail to Tierra del Fuego and Beagle Channel.
Cost: $3,598, including air fare from Miami, contribution to the conservancy, accommodations in lodges and hotels, meals and a cruise.
Date: Oct. 20 to Nov. 3.
 
OCEANIC SOCIETY EXPEDITIONS
Fort Mason Center, Building E, San Francisco, Calif. 94123
415-441-1106 or 800-326-7491
Founded in 1972, the society designs its own programs, supporting research and further conservation with proceeds and donations. The organization recently merged with Friends of the Earth, an environmental advocacy group. More than half the trips focus on sea coasts and oceans, with whale watching, dolphin research, shore bird photography and marine mammals. The society's naturalists and marine biologists are on hand for the trips. Group size is limited to about 15.
 
Bahamas Dolphin Research
Swimming with wild Atlantic spotted dolphins off Grand Bahama, where researchers are studing the family and social structure of the mammals. The seven-night trip includes six days of swimming with the dolphins, photographing them and recording behavior. Led by marine biologists doing field work.
Cost: $1,250, including hotel, meals and transportation on the sailboat Jennifer Marie to or from Grand Bahama.
 Dates: Departures from Fort Lauderdale on May 26, June 13, July 1, July 19, Aug. 6 and Aug. 24 and from West End, Grand Bahama, on June 3, June 21, July 9, July 27 and Aug. 14.
 
SIERRA CLUB OUTING DEPARTMENT
730 Polk Street, San Francisco, Calif. 94109
415-923-5630
The organization founded by a group of private citizens to preserve California wilderness begins its centennial year this month. The club has 600,000 members and attracts about 5,000 travelers a year for its programs. Almost 90 percent of the trips are domestic, with many in national parks. A large number are active vacations, with hiking, biking, cross-country skiing and river rafting featured. The travel program reflects the grass-roots philosophy of the organization: tour leaders design their own trips and itineraries, while the San Francisco office coordinates them.
While leaders often have scientific backgrounds, their fields may not be directly related to their tour. An American chemistry professor who lives half the year in Nepal, for example, leads the trek to see blooming rhododendrons in the Annapurna Sanctuary every March. Groups are usually no more than 15.
 
Rajasthan Desert Kingdoms
A 17-day tour in India from New Delhi to Jaipur, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Jodphur and Udaipur, with a three-night camel safari in the Thar Desert. The Sierra Club catalogue specifies that the club is opposing development of the Sardar Sarovar Dam Project, which is expected to cause deforestation and wildlife depletion in Rajasthan.
Cost: $2,360 for 12 to 15 participants; $2,610 for 11 or fewer. Price includes meals and accommodations in hotels, sightseeing tours, train trips and transfers, safari and all meals. Excluded is airfare to New Delhi.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION NATIONAL ASSOCIATE PROGRAM STUDY TOURS AND SEMINARS
1100 Jefferson Drive, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20560
202-357-4700
The Smithsonian, like the American Museum of Natural History and the Audubon Society, contracts with private operators to offer tours but adds Smithsonian lecturers. Of the 150 study tours offered, half are domestic and half international. The majority are academic -- with topics like Rembrandt's art in the Netherlands to the literature of Ireland to projecting global air power, a study program at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. But the Smithsonian has begun offering research expeditions both to natural areas like Costa Rica, where an active volcano is being monitored, and to cultural events, such as the Crow Indian fair in Montana.
 
Colorado Rockies Natural History
Families stay at the Nature Place in Florissant, Colo., an environmental education center on 6,000 acres, ranging from desert to alpine life. Ten learning centers include a working cattle ranch, a sawmill and a restored 1880's homestead. Accommodations are in a studio apartment with loft. The staff includes university professors and naturalists who lead families on nature walks that focus on all aspects of the various life zones.
Cost: $850 ($1,150 in single occupancy); $560 for children 7 to 15. Includes lodging and group meals; excludes air fare to Colorado Springs, Colo.

202-293-4800
With one million members in the United States, the World Wildlife Fund, and its partner the Conservation Foundation, works to preserve tropical forests in Latin America, Asia and Africa. The organization also works with local residents to help improve living standards, thereby confronting root causes of threats to nature. In Annapurna, for example, the fund has helped set up a program that combines habitat protection with sustainable development in forestry, agriculture and tourism. The fund commissioned the major study to date of ecotourism's potential effect on developing countries.
 
Thailand and Nepal Expedition
A 19-night expedition through Thailand and Nepal, including the Khao Yai National Park, home of the elusive forest elephant, islands in the Andaman Sea, a cruise on the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok for the annual festival of Lights, and a trip to one of the fund's Thai projects, a rural community development program. The group then flies to Katmandu, takes elephant ride in Royal Chitwan Park and hikes in the Annapurna Conservation Area. Group size limit: 18.
Cost: $6,275, including air fare from Seattle.
Dates: Nov. 19 to Dec. 8, 1991.
 
PRIVATE OPERATORS
 
ABERCROMBIE & KENT AND SOCIETY EXPEDITIONS
1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, Ill. 69521
800-323-7308 or 708-954-2944
A luxury tour operator, Abercrombie & Kent started offering safaris in Africa 29 years ago. The company's owners, Geoffrey and Jorie Butler Kent, founded a nonprofit organization, the Friends of Conservation, which helps preserve land and assists the Kenya Wildlife Service, headed by Dr. Richard Leakey, in a variety of programs -- from providing vehicles for antipoaching patrols to relocating and providing veterinary care for endangered rhinoceroses. About half the company's business is to Africa and the Galapagos for nature tours. The company offers 15 itineraries in Africa with 300 scheduled departures a year. Maximum group size averages 16. The company has 26 departures a year to the Galapagos, with maximum group size of 18 to 20.
Abercrombie & Kent also markets Society Expeditions cruises. The company, based in Seattle, was founded in 1974 with a cruise to Easter Island that helped restoration of the giant Maoi statues there. About 85 cruises are scheduled next year on 45 itineraries to Indonesia, the Amazon, the Cook Islands, Easter Island, Greenland and Hudson Bay, the Indian Ocean and Antarctica. The company's three vessels range in capacity from 98 to 160 passengers. Some of its cruises are operated in collaboration with nonprofit academic and environmental organizations.
 
Tanzania-Kenya Tent Safari
A 14-night Abercrombie & Kent safari that includes game watching at Ngorongoro, Serengeti National Park and the Masai Mara, where the Friends of Conservation has undertaken a community conservation project to help ease conflicts between the tourism industry, interested in preserving wildlife, and the adjacent landowners, under increasing pressure to lease land to ranchers for grazing. Accommodations are in luxury campgrounds with local guides.
Cost: $6,470 from June 1 to 30 and from Nov. 1 to Dec. 14; $6,990 the rest of the year, including all meals, transportation in Land Rovers, guides and lodging. Excluded is air fare from New York, estimated at $1,800.

INTERNATIONAL EXPEDITIONS
1 Environs Park, Helena, Ala. 35080
800-633-4734 or 205-428-1700
Founded in 1980 by a research scientist with a doctorate in biological sciences, International Expeditions focuses on rain-forest expeditions in Ecuador, Costa Rica, Belize, the Peruvian Amazon and Venezuela, but also offers safaris in Africa, a cruise and river raft trip in Alaska and visits to parks and wildlife refuges in Australia, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Nepal and China. Trips are accompanied by members of the International Expeditions staff of experts in botany, zoology and archeology. Average group size is 15, depending on destination.
The company has founded a nonprofit center in Peru, near Iquitos, on previously imperiled land. The 4,400-acre site was set aside as forever-wild land by the Peruvian Government, and the new nonprofit center, called the Amazon Center for Environmental Education and Research, provides a research station for scientists and a headquarters for visitors. The center, near Iquitos, Peru, was founded with $60,000 raised in March from a rain-forest workshop that drew 150 participants and 20 scientists and naturalists representing the World Wildlife Fund, the Smithsonian Institution and the Nature Conservancy. Plans for the site, called the Amazon Biosphere Reserve, call for expansion to 100,000 acres in the next year. The center will be supported by proceeds from International Expedition trips to the center.
 
Naturalist Tour of Belize
A 10-night trip from Belize City covering wildlife refuges for Howler monkeys, birds, a boat trip down the Macal River, Rio Frio Cave, botanical walk in the jungle, the jungle at Tikal and its ruins and a snorkeling trip off Ambergris Caye, the huge barrier reef off Belize.

JOURNEYS
4011 Jackson Road, Ann Arbor, Mich. 48103
800-255-8735 or 313-665-4407
Founded by a former Peace Corps volunteer with a doctorate in natural resources, the company's focus is to support environmental conservation with adventure travel. While some of the trips are strictly adventure in focus, some profits -- about $50 a trekker -- are turned over to a nonprofit corporation, the Earth Preservation Fund, that supports local environmental programs in Zimbabwe, Botswana, Nepal and other places on the company's itinerary. Among the projects funded by this nonprofit arm are school construction, bridges, restoration of a monastery, seed distribution and solar heating projects. The solar project attempts to provide a cheap alternative power source to Nepalese, thereby preventing deforestation for firewood (the chief energy supply for more than 90 percent of the people). The company also has a community forestry project near Sirendanda, Nepal, in which trekkers help plant trees from a Katmandu nursery.
Journeys has about 25 itineraries, with 150 departures a year. The average group size is 6 to 8, with a maximum of 12. Local guides accompany participants. Accommodation on most trips is in tents.
Tree-Planting Trek in Nepal
This 20-day expedition initiates the Journeys forestry program each year. Trekkers bring seedlings and agricultural and forestry materials from Katmandu to the nursery at Sirendanda, the site of a Buddhist monastery. The trek is timed to coincide with Buddha's birthday and accompanying festivities. The trip departs from Katmandu for a nine-day trek along the ridge east of Annapurna in the rhododendron forests of Baudha Himalaya. Six days are spent at Sirendanda.
Cost: About $1,500 a person. A two-day whitewater raft trip to Royal Chitwan National Park and two days in the park can be added for about $400. Estimated air fare from New York to Katmandu: $2,000.
Dates: Next April.
 
MOUNTAIN TRAVEL-SOBEK
6420 Fairmount Avenue, El Cerrito, Calif. 94530
800-227-2384 or 415-527-8100
Two of the leading adventure travel companies are in the process of merging. Mountain Travel got its start in trekking, Sobek in river rafting. While adventure travel remains the primary purpose of both organizations, they offer environmental programs as well, with trips to the Amazon rain forest and to Prince William Sound to observe the after-effects of the Valdez oil spill. Sobek's founder, Richard Bangs, has been active in publicizing the shrinking of the Aral Sea in the Soviet Union, caused by diversion of rivers feeding it. Mr. Bangs, who started his career as a guide on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, launched a rafting business in 1973, taking it to African rivers. From there, it expanded to other great rivers, and in the late 1970's the company began to include trekking, climbing, biking and other activity vacations. Today the company offers 125 different itineraries, about 20 percent of which are river trips, with more than 1,000 departures a year.
Mountain Travel's extensive itinerary includes both strenuous climbing trips and easier hikes. Begun in 1967 to take advantage of the growing interest in trekking -- its first trip was to Nepal -- the company has expanded into softer adventure trips, focusing on wildlife and natural history. The company now has 125 different itineraries and about 400 departures a year to Asia, Africa, Europe and South America, with a few programs in North America, Australia and Indonesia.
Environmental Challenge in the Ukraine
On this Sobek trip, participants will explore Ukrainian villages and the Carpathian mountains, while learning about environmental devastation from nuclear and coal projects and industrial waste. The trip will be escorted by Kristin Suokko, a Soviet expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Trip includes stays in Moscow, Kiev and Odessa, with a four-day bicycling tour of the Carpathians. The trip does not go into the devastated Chernobyl area, because of the continuing radiation danger.
Cost: $2,490, including a $250 donation to the N.D.R.C., local transportation, lodging in hotels and campsites and meals. Excludes air fare to Moscow. Maximum group size is 15.
Date: Aug. 4 to 17.
 
NATURE EXPEDITIONS INTERNATIONAL
474 Willamette, Post Office Box 11496, Eugene, Ore. 97440
800-869-0639 or 503-484-6529
Founded by a pair of science professors in Palo Alto, Calif., the company grew out of a series of armchair lectures on natural history. Gradually, demand for field trips increased, and the company expanded to a full-fledged itinerary of expeditions and safaris in Africa, Asia, South America, Australia, the South Pacific and Alaska, Hawaii and the Southwest. Leaders, who all have college-level teaching experience, give informal evening lectures and daily interpretive sessions along the trail. The company sends out 30 to 50 tours a year, with a maximum group size of 8 to 12 participants.
 
Easter Island Expedition
A 13-night journey with 10 days on the island and three in Santiago, Chile. Led by Sergio Rapu, director of archeological investigations and a former Governor of Easter Island, and an ethnologist.

Tour focuses on the giant statues of Easter Island but also visits digs and restorations throughout the islands. Evening lectures cover culture and anthropology, flora and fauna and archeological research
Cost: $1,990, including accommodations in hotels, all meals and lectures, but excluding air fare.
Dates: Departures June 23, Oct. 6 and Dec. 15.
 
QUESTERS TOURS AND TRAVEL
257 Park Avenue South, New York, N.Y. 10010
800-468-8668 or 212-673-3120
Questers was founded in 1973 by a naturalist-book publisher and an employee of a tour operator, who consulted naturalists to devise itineraries. Their goal was to offer trips in search of the natural world. "Our own curiosity about earth's life forms and their ecology -- and our conviction that nature-oriented tourism could aid the cause of conservation -- spurred us on," their current catalog says. The company now offers 34 tours in 30 countries, with 104 departures a year. Maximum group size is 20. Staff naturalists accompany the groups.
 
Alaska Natural History
A comprehensive 16-night tour from Juneau to Anchorage that includes a catamaran ride in Glacier Bay, nature walks, a visit to Denali National Park, the Seward Peninsula, a chartered plane ride over the Kiglauk and Kougarok Mountains and Bering Strait and a float plane trip to Katmai National Park. Limited to 20 participants.
Cost: $5,800, including accommodations in hotels, meals, entrance fees and air fare from Seattle.
Dates: Departs June 16, July 7 and Aug. 11.
 
 
SALEN LINDBLAD CRUISING
333 Ludlow Street, Post Office Box 120076, Stamford, Conn. 06912
800-223-5688 or 203-967-2900
The company, started in 1982 by the son of a Swedish sea captain, is best known in environmental circles for its 164-passenger Frontier Spirit, a nonpolluting vessel with an onboard sewage treatment device, trash compactors, refrigerators for storing garbage, an oil separator in the bilge to prevent accidental spills and onboard recycling bins. Salen Lindblad, like other private operators, has its own nonprofit arm, called the Oceanites Foundation, an educational organization to foster marine preservation. The company offers trips, with about 55 departures a year, into ecologically sensitive areas like Antarctica, the Arctic, the Indian Ocean, Indonesia and the Amazon. Lindblad's other vessel is the Caledonian Star.
 
Northwest Passage
A 30-night voyage from the Aleutian Islands through the Northwest Passage of Canada and onto Greenland. Zodiac landing craft take passengers to view such wildlife as polar bears, whales, walruses, caribou and puffins. Onboard naturalists act as guides. The ship has an ice-breaking hull that enables it to make the journey.
Cost: $17,500, including meals, excursions and lectures.
Dates: Aug. 18 to Sept. 16.
 
VICTOR EMANUEL NATURE TOURS
Post Office Box 33008, Austin, Tex. 78764
800-328-8368 or 512-328-5221
The leading tour operator for birders, Victor Emanuel founded the company bearing his name 17 years ago and now offers 100 birding and natural history tours around the world. Leaders include well-known ornithologists and naturalists; Roger Tory Peterson is one of the company's directors. Group size ranges from 8 to 16, with 150 departures a year in an equal mix of international and domestic itineraries. The company donates part of the tour fee to half a dozen specific projects in regions visited, and it estimates that 70 to 80 percent of foreign tours directly benefit local economies. For example, Victor Emanuel's donkey tender at El Triunfo reserve in southern Mexico used to be a subsistence farmer, deforesting the very area he is not benefitting from. On the King Ranch tour in south Texas, $50 of the tour fee of eachvisitor goes to Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Institute, winter home of the endangered whooping crane. Only 200 are left.
 
El Triunfo
An eight-night tour from Mexico City to the cloud forest set in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the El Triunfo journey is more active than most of Victor Emanuel's offerings. Pack animals carry gear; participants hike to the valley in a three-day ascent that covers 20 miles. The habitat includes 40-foot ferns, enormous trees and a chorus of bird life that includes the rare azure-rumped tanager.
Cost: Estimated at $1,850. Excludes air fare.
Date: March 21, 1992.
 
IF YOU PLAN A TOUR
Here are some questions to ask before signing up for an ecotour.
1. How large are the tour groups and what is the ratio of tour guide to traveler? (More than 20 to 1 is considered undesirable.)
2. Does the company make an effort to protect the environment by using low-impact forms of transportation like canoes instead of ships or horses instead of buses? What are the sources of fire wood? Is waste disposed of in an environmentally sound manner?
3. Do trained naturalists accompany the group?
4. Does part of the cost of the trip go to a local conservation project?
5. Does the trip employ local guides, use locally owned lodges or in some other way insure that the economic benefits of the tour help the community?
6. For nonprofit groups, does the company design its own tours or hire a private tour operator and add its own experts as guides? -- E. W.

BYLINE: By RACHEL POWELL

 BODY:
Baby boomers who spent much of the 1980's tending their bank accounts now seem to be turning to more organic pursuits: growing flowers, trees and vegetables.
"They're cocooning, spending more time at home," said a pleased Harris Ashton, chief executive of the General Host Corporation, which owns Frank's Nursery and Crafts, the nation's largest lawn and garden retail chain. 
 With the boomers and other greenthumbers out in force these spring growing days, Mr. Ashton is counting on General Host to grow with them. The company, based in Stamford, Conn., expects sales of $550 million in fiscal 1991, up from $515 million for 1990. Besides Frank's, the company owns Calloway's, an 11-store chain in the Dallas area.
For the industry as a whole, sales reached almost $21 billion in 1990, from $16 billion in 1989, according to the National Gardening Association, a nonprofit group of gardening enthusiasts based in Burlington, Vt.
Demographics are perhaps the most compelling reason for the increase, along with heightened environmental concerns. The recession has even helped, experts say. Some people are sprucing up their yards to shore up sagging home values; others are discovering that gardening can be a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment.
General Host bought Frank's in 1983, when the chain had $63 million in sales. Since then, Frank's has grown to 280 stores, from 99, while adopting a supermarket look, complete with bright lights and shopping carts. This makes the stores less threatening to the novice than the traditional nursery, said Mr. Ashton, who is 59 and has been head of General Host since 1970.
Though aficionados might not buy their plants at Frank's, preferring the wider and more exotic selection offered by independent retailers, Mr. Ashton said they will still come in for more mundane supplies, like hoses, because prices are lower.
Frank's "made a conscious effort to have good selection and good quality," said Bruce Butterfield, research director of the National Gardening Association.

 CORRECTION:
A report in the "Making a Difference" column last Sunday about the General Host Corporation included an erroneous sales figure supplied by the company for its lawn and garden chain, Frank's Nursery and Crafts. In 1983, the year it was acquired by General Host, Frank's had sales of $150 million, not $63 million.

HEADLINE: 5 Massachusetts Towns Continue a Tradition of Tax Rebellions

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHELBURNE, Mass.

 BODY:
The hill towns of western Massachusetts have a long history of independent mindedness, going back to 1786, when a band of impoverished farmers took pitchforks and guns and headed down from the hills to protest high taxes. The insurrection, known as Shays' Rebellion for its leader, Daniel Shays, was ultimately put down.
But as Massachusetts's financial crisis deepens, another rebellion is brewing in these hills. Five towns recently voted not to pay off two loans for school projects. 
 The action may jeopardize their ability to take out future loans, but the residents, pressed by growing numbers of students in their schools and expensive state-mandated programs, said they had no choice.
 
'An Outright Insurrection'
 "What you are seeing out here is a populist form of spontaneous combustion," said David Newell, business manager of the Mohawk Trail Regional School District, which is at the center of the rebellion. "These people aren't kidding. They've had it. Unless something changes, I think you are going to see something verging on an outright insurrection."
The Mohawk school district is made up of eight towns. Five of them, Ashfield, Buckland, Charlemont, Colrain and Shelburne, have voted to default on the loans. One town, Hawley, voted not to default. The other two, Heath and Plainfield, have scheduled votes for next month. All eight towns share a high school, and several of them share grammar schools.
One loan is for $285,000, which the towns of Buckland and Shelburne used to repair the roof of an elementary school. Town officials say that when they applied for the loan in 1987, the state told them that 75 percent of it would be reimbursed when money became available. So far, the state has not given the towns any money. The next payment is due in August.
The other loan is for $230,000, which all eight towns took out to pay for construction of an access ramp for the handicapped at the high school. The next payment on that loan is due next April, and the state has partly reimbursed the towns for its share of the costs.
It is not unusual, especially in this time of recession in New England, for cities and towns to be in financial straits. Massachusetts has been especially hard hit.
Last Thursday, the State House Ways and Means Committee approved a $12.8 billion budget that includes a reduction of $480 million in aid to the state's 351 cities and towns. Under that plan, about a third of the state's communities, mostly rural and suburban towns, would receive little or no state assistance in the coming fiscal year.
But the plan, which ran into immediate bipartisan opposition, is now expected to be scrapped.
Some cities and towns are considering making up for the cuts in state aid by voting to override the state's 2.5 percent limit on property tax increases.
But in poor rural towns like Shelburne, where the unemployment rate is 17.5 percent, town officials say a big tax increase is out of the question. Half the residents make less than $10,500 a year per capita. Thousands of dollars in debt, many of the small dairy farmers have closed their barns.
So far, reaction to the votes to default has been mixed. Those who see the default as a desperate protest say it will make the state realize the severity of the cuts. Others, including bond rating officials, say it may only damage the credit-worthiness of the towns.
"If this is a problem with the state, it could cause us to look again at what's going on there," said Richard P. Larkin, a managing director at the Standard and Poor's Corporation, a bond rating agency in New York.
The BB bond rating of Massachusetts is already the lowest rating of any state, and Wall Street has threatened to downgrade the state's securities to "junk bond" status.
"But if they are doing this for a protest, an action like this could hurt them for a long time to come," said Mr. Larkin.
For the five towns, the lesson of Shays' Rebellion is a double-edged one. In 1787, the insurgents were crushed by an army hastily raised by the governor. But the Legislature later met some of their demands for tax relief.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 26, 1991, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about five towns' refusal to repay the State of Massachusetts for school repair and construction loans misstated the state's bond rating. The Standard & Poor's Corporation rates Massachusetts bonds BBB, not BB. The BBB category reflects an "adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principle," in Standard & Poor's words; BB is considered "speculative."

GRAPHIC: Drawing: In the same hills of western Massachusetts that were the home of Shays Rebellion in 1786, where farmers armed themselves and took the courthouse, shown here, and marched from the hills to protest high taxes and the government that imposed them, another rebellion is brewing as the state's financial crisis deepens. Recently, five towns there voted not to pay off two loans for school projects. (Illustration by Howard Pyle from "Book of a the American Nation")

A Giant Killer Stumbles and Takes a Big Fall
 

Joseph R. Canion, president of the Compaq Computer Corporation, has to be more careful when he speaks. Last week, before the company's annual meeting, he predicted that Compaq's earnings would be down 79 percent this quarter. The analysts did not have to run those numbers through their laptops. The market value of the stock tumbled by $1.2 billion on the news. Share prices fell from $49.25 to $36. It finished the week at 35.75. Back in 1982, when Mr. Canion started the company, it was the giant killer. But inexpensive computers, some with more features, ate into its market share. Inventories built up. Last April, Compaq was forced to cut prices, which hurt profits, and Mr. Canion sold 20 percent of his stock, which hurt morale. Compaq announced that it will buy back up to 10 million shares of its stock. Good for the stock, but what about the company? Compaq should invest in high-end products, analysts say.

Putting a Price on T.W.A.'s Debt
 
Trans World Airlines missed several payments on its $1.2 billion in debt, and now its creditors are threatening to repossess 10 airplanes and dozens of engines. That would cripple the airline. Carl C. Icahn, who owns T.W.A., wants to keep it in the air, so he is offering his creditors a deal. Mr. Icahn is willing to buy back T.W.A.'s debt, but at a deep discount -- 17.5 cents to 73 cents on the dollar, depending of what they hold. Not bad, he says, since some T.W.A. paper is trading at just 15 cents on the dollar. The creditors are understandably angry. But Mr. Icahn has leverage. He can put the airline under the protection of Chapter 11. Or, since he sold his stock in the USX Corporation last week for $1.02 billion, he could buy T.W.A.'s debt at full price.
 
School Construction at a Profit?
 
The man who brought advertising into the classroom now wants to build schools -- 200 of them beginning in 1996. Christopher Whittle, chairman of Whittle Communications Inc., in Knoxville, Tenn., expects his schools to make a profit, but he vows not to line the hallways with billboards. He wants to blend technology with traditional methods, all for $4,300 per pupil a year -- about the national average. To build the schools, Mr. Whittle still needs to raise $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Education Secretary Lamar Alexander sits on the company's board, but Mr. Whittle claims he does not want government money. However, he will accept payment vouchers, as proposed by the Bush Administration, if that program ever gets off the ground.
 
S&L Properties by the Bundle
 
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolutution Trust Corporation, figured it would take 300 years to sell off all the properties remaining from the savings and loan bailout. So he came up with a plan: Bundle the properties together, sell them to big developers and let the buyers pay the government out of earnings. Congress wants cash.

Buying Loyalty from Viewers
 
People used to watch CBS voluntarily. Now they need to be paid off. The network unveiled a plan last week to build viewer loyalty that is based on the frequent flyer programs of the airlines. The more you watch, the more you win, said CBS. But the network's experience with buying viewers with promotions has been almost as bad as the airlines'. Shoppers who see the CBS promotions at K-Mart stores are still going home to watch reruns on cable TV.
 
The End of a Fight
 
They fought for 10 weeks, taking out advertisements in newspapers around the country, but in the end they made a deal. France's Groupe Schneider S.A., the giant electrical equipment company, acquired the Square D Company for $2.23 billion. Square D makes electrical controls for factories and the home market. So does Schneider. With the acquisition, Schneider will become the world's largest producer of electrical control products, with more than 30 percent of the American market. In the dim days of the past -- before the Reagan and Bush Administrations, that is -- that much concentration might have raised an eyebrow at the Justice Department. But Justice has given the deal a nod.
 
A Costly Way to Increase Sales
 
The Saturn Corporation is trying desperately to run rings around its competition with better service and a better car. It is the General Motors Corporation's import fighter.When it mistakenly put the wrong coolant into the engines of 1,100 Saturn cars, it decided to replace the cars at no cost. A pretty good deal. But last week, G.M. said it will count each of the cars it replaces as a new-car sale. With sales like that, how long can the Saturn last?
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY


Housing Starts Rise Sharply . . .
 
The housing industry is sending signals that the end of the slump is near. The first three months were erratic, with sharp ups and downs. But April, the Commerce Department said last week, was a relief, especially for the nation's home builders. Housing starts climbed by 6.2 percent, quite a nice jump. "The way recoveries begin is with an upturn in housing," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. Does this upturn say the recession is nearing its end? "Growth by the end of the year could be a positive 3.5 percent," he said.
 
. . . as Consumer Prices Inch Up
 
Consumer prices crept up, but only by a smidgeon. They rose by 0.2 percent in April, according to the Labor Department. "Commodity prices are falling, and prices are rising mainly in the services," said Kevin Logan, chief economist at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. Medical services were up. So were personal and educational services like college and private school tuition. Health club memberships cost more, too. A concern, yes, but nothing that the economy cannot sustain. "My overall outlook is for a decline in the rate of inflation," he said.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
A Defender of the Mark Resigns
 
Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, has a line in its charter saying it must defend the mark. Karl Otto Pohl,who said that he will resign in October as the bank's president, did that job well. The mark never varied as Europe's strongest currency during his 10-year tenure. But lately Mr. Pohl has despaired. The economic merger between the two Germanys is a disaster -- his word. Economists agree. "Since the merger, there has been no true price stability." said Carl Weinberg of High Frequency Economics in New York. "I give Hans Tietmeyer, who's on the bank council, 70 percent odds of getting the job."
 
Burning Renoirs and van Goghs?
 
Last week the badly slumping art market received a jolt. Ryoei Saito, the Japanese industrialist who controls Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Company, said his paintings would be cremated with him when he dies. Mr. Saito owns van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet," which he bought for $82.5 million last year, and "At the Moulin de la Galette" by Renoir. Having the paintings burned would cut inheritance taxes, Mr. Saito said. When the art world gasped, Mr. Saito reconsidered. Maybe the masterpieces would go into storage.

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Business Diary column on May 19 describing CBS's efforts to attract viewers referred incorrectly to a promotional plan, based on airlines' frequent flyer programs, that would reward customers for watching more CBS programming. The promotional idea was one of many considered by the company, but has not been carried out.

HEADLINE: The Region;
Leading The Sacred Cow Of Rent Control To Slaughter?

 BODY:
FOR 44 years, New York City's system of rent-control laws, which affect more than a million apartments, has been politically unassailable. But as the city's economic problems deepen, and a rising rental vacancy rate chews at the law's legal foundation, some of the city's leaders have begun to think about ending controls on some higher-priced apartments in order to save the rest of the law.
 "That is an option, in myopinion, that has got to be loked at," said Archie Spigner, the Queens Democrat who heads the City Council's housing committee, and who helped renew the law for three years last month. "It can't be dismissed." 
 Mr. Spigner was reacting to the likelihood that the vacancy rate in the rental apartment market may already have passed 5 percent, the legal threshold that signals an end to the city's housing-availability crisis - and to rent regulations.
 Earlier this month, the city's largest landlord group sued the city to end the rent rules, citing the city's inability to take the legally required steps toprove the law was needed.
 Although the vacancy rate was only 2.47 percent in 1987, when the last triennial vacancy survey was made, the trend has been steadilyupward since then. Although no one knows how many apartments have become vacant in the interval, the rate over the last 10 years has risen with the addition of more than 100,000 new dwellin units - most of them higher-priced apartments. In the current real-estate slump, developers have added many unsold co-ops and condominiums to the rental market. And thousands of new condominum apartments have been turned into rentals by speculators.
 The rgulated rental market is divided into two categories: controlled and stabilized. Rent-controlled apartments, which number about 155,000, are those built before 1947 that have been continuously occupied by the current tenant, or a legal successor, since 1971. These tenants have no leases but a statutory right to occupancy for as long as they want. Compared with stabilized apartments, rent increases in controlled units are more restrictive, so rents tend to be quite low. Once such an apartment is vacated, it comes under rent stabilization.
 About 850,000 apartments are managegd under the Rent Stabilization Law, which sets a percentage limit on annual rent increases based on an index of operating costs, and applies to buildings built between 1947 and 1974. Those built after that date are subject to stabilization only if their owners choose one of the city's tax abatement programs, which they invariably do. The controls end when the abatement expires after 10 or 12 years, now widely occurring around the city.
 Last year the city could not conduct a new vacancy survey because the Census Bureau, which establishes a vacancy rate from studying about 18,000 apartments, was taking the national census. Needing a low vacancy figure to renew the law, the city cited the first quarter 1990 statistics from a much smaller Census Bureau survey, which showed a vacancy rate of 4.8 while ignoring the same study's conclusion that the rate rose over the limit to 5.2 percent from July to December.
 On May 7, the Rent Stabilization Associateion, the landlords' group, sued the city in State Supreme Court to end controls outright. The landlords' double-barreled argument: the stopgap vacancy survey failed to meet the terms of the law, and if it did, the 5.2 percent vacancy rate shoudl apply. Either way, the landlords argued, the law is dead.
 The city will respond to the suit by the end of the month. Both sides are sure to appeal an adverse ruling, pushing any legal outcome into the future.
 "It may be the case that a differential solution is wanted," said Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan BoroughPresident, whose constituents have the highest rate of regulated housing. But, she said, the rising vacancy rate may be due to the large number of co-ops and condominiums that have gone on the rental market in recent years and are not subject to rent rules.
 Regardless, the rent law, which predates the co-op-condominium boom, counts those units. But the landlords would probably settle - in the short term at least - for the deregulation of the approximately 100,000 apartments renting for $750 and above, which would take in most condominiums and co-ops. The landlords suggest such an outcome in their suit, and add that the apartments would be decontrolled only at the expiration of current leases.
 Such a partial decontrol might also buy more time for the law, since the overall vacancy rate would be more likely to drop below 5 percent.
 The landlords' willingness to compromise shows no extraordinary generosity. While the regulated system has tended to concentrate its benefits in the richest parts of the city, it has become almost irrelevent in many poorer areas, according to several studies. Outside Manhattan's core residential areas, regulated rents are close to market levels.
 Earlier this month, a Citizens Budget Commission study reported that the city would take in an additional $80 to $100 milion a year in real estate taxes by limiting rent protection to renters earning less than $57,000 for a family of four.
 But city officials dispute any windfalls soon after decontrol, and scoff at the likelihood of being able to collect and verify income statements from a million prickly renters a year.
 John Gilbert 3d, head of the landlord's group, said the Citizens Budget Commission study on lost real estate taxes had special meaning during the current fiscal crisis.
 "There are a lot of legislators in New York City who do not represent a high incidence of controlled renters," Mr. Gilbert said. "They are the ones who will be facing the choice between closing a library or closing a pool and deregulating luxury apartments."
 To Ms. Messinger, however, fiddling with rent rules during a recession could send the wrong signal to New Yorkers. "The one thing we don't want in this city, especially in a time of fiscal crisis, is a change so dramatic that literally tens of thousands of people use it as a reason to leave the city," she said.
 The sweep of Ms. Messinger's warning gives some hint at the passions that rent protections can inspire, and any attempt to modify the law would have to go through the City Council, where powerful tenant lobbies have demonstrated consistent strength to repulse attacks on the law.

HEADLINE: An African Park in Peril

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ ;JANE PERLEZ is chief of the Nairobi bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
KENYA's Amboseli National Park is advertised as an extraordinary wildlife experience for visitors to Africa. Set beneath the snowy dome of Mount Kilimanjaro, Amboseli offers lions, cheetah, elephant and buffalo. A photographer's dream shot -- a giraffe or an elephant browsing on a green plain with the blue-tinged mountain as the backdrop -- is usually displayed in tourist brochures.
The pitch has little to do with reality. It is based on the old Amboseli, the place where veteran Kenya guides once took their big-money safari clients to view game in an unsurpassed setting. Today's Amboseli resembles a moonscape, shrouded in swirls of yellowish dust. The vegetation is reduced to broken tree trunks. Many of the animals have disappeared. 
 In a way, Amboseli has become, over the last decade or two, nature's equivalent of a once-elegant inner city block, now vandalized. Why? One reason is too many tourists. Another reason is what the tourists come for: hundreds of elephants -- too many, in fact.
Amboseli -- about 150 square miles -- is a small park by African standards, but . more than 750 elephants have crowded into the area in the past decade to seek sanctuary from poachers. In search of food, the elephants have destroyed the once lush woodlands, transforming the trees into dry, scattered shrubs. The thinning of the vegetation has pushed giraffes, monkeys and bush bucks into feeding areas outside the park's boundaries.
Damage by the elephants has been compounded by tourists, who pour into the park at the rate of 200,000 a year, said Dr. David Western, the director of Wildlife Conservation International, the research and conservation division of the New York Zoological Society. "The areas that were thick woodland have been eaten by the elephants, making it easier for the tourists to careen through in their vehicles," Dr. Western said. "The vans are often driven at 50 to 60 kilometers an hour. It's like a racetrack."
In theory, it is easy to understand the attraction of Amboseli to a first-time safari-goer. The park is only 150 miles from Nairobi.And it offers the highest density of elephants anywhere on the continent, according to Dr. Western. The smallness of the park makes it possible to see the so-called "big five" African game animals -- elephant, buffalo, leopard, lion and rhinoceros -- in one morning. About 20 percent of the park's visitors fly up from beach holidays at Mombasa on the Kenyan coast for a 90-minute drive around the park and then leave, after lunch at one of the park's lodges.
This short amount of time in the park makes it imperative for the tour driver to find as many of the popular animals as possible. (The driver's tip often depends on whether he has been able to pull off the "big five" in one drive). Thus, it is not unusual to see 40 vehicles circled bumper-to-bumper around a couple of lions, who, as is their habit during the day, are usually dozing.
The former quiet of the Amboseli wilderness has been shattered by the clicking of cameras, the hum of video recorders and the chorus of exclamations from hundreds ofvisitors gaping at a few animals. Tourists tend to peer at the animals for only as long as it takes to snap a few pictures. Research by zoologists working with Dr. Western shows that tourists spend an average of only eight to ten minutes looking at lions. "Then people get bored. The lion is still lying there, they've thrown a film cannister to try and wake it up, and they move on," said Dr. Western. "The average time is four to five minutes with elephants -- they are less attractive to the tourists than lions and cheetahs."
The invasion of the mini-vans has been bad for the animals. In the mid-1970's, Dr. Western estimates there were 12 to 15 cheetah in the park. Now there are less than eight. The crowding of the vans around the cheetahs -- sometimes vans even chase the animals -- has disturbed the cheetahs' hunting patterns, and they have departed for less crowded regions. In the Masai Mara National Reserve, another popular Kenyan game-viewing area, but one less visited by tourists, Dr. Western found that the cheetahs had been forced to change their hunting hours from dawn and dusk (favorite game-viewing periods) to the middle of the day.
 Two years ago there were 40 to 50 lions in Amboseli; today only two or three remain, according to Dr. Western. The drop is due in part to the poisoning of some of them by Masai tribesmen. (The lions frequently attack the Masai's cattle.) Interference in the lions' hunting patterns by tour vans has also contributed to their decline in Amboseli, Dr. Western said.
That Amboseli is in such perilous shape is no secret to the managers of Kenya's parks or to tour operators. Some of the more discerning outfitters, including Ker & Downey, have scratched Amboseli from their itineraries. Still, many tourists are willing to pay the $175 for an overnight excursion into the park, offered by many Nairobi-based operators. Or they can fly in from Nairobi for $125 day trips, which are offered by some of the park's lodges.
Dr. Richard E. Leakey, the director of the Kenya Wildlife Service, sums up Amboseli: "It has become one big dust-bowl." Ever the optimist, Dr. Leakey believes the park can be rescued. So does Dr. Western, although the zoologist wonders whether the Kenya Wildlife Service has the capability to do what is necessary.
At one point, Dr. Leakey contemplated shutting the park down in order to give the vegetation time to restore itself. But economic necessities dictate otherwise. Gate receipts, at about $10 a person,make Amboseli one of the biggest money earners for the Wildlife Service. In turn, tourism is the biggest source of foreign exchange for Kenya, a poor country, which has seen a decline in its coffee and tea earnings, due to the worldwide drop in prices.
The idea of fencing off areas of the park to stop the elephants feeding on the trees was also scotched. "To recover sufficient woodland you would need to fence off large parts of the park, which would be totally anti-tourist," said Dr. Leakey. "My impression is that Amboseli can be rehabilitated if you ban off-the-road driving and move the tourists further out into the park."
Road reconstruction is already underway. Initially, about 14 miles of road are being resurfaced to make a one-way circuit for vans. This new roadway is designed to prevent two-way traffic and to discourage off-the-road driving. The poor quality of Amboseli's roads has encouraged tour drivers to make their own rutted tracks as they dash from one cluster of animals to another.
Dr. Leakey is also considering different pricing policies within the park as a way of encouraging tourists to explore larger areas. At the moment, Dr. Western estimates that 90 percent of the tourist vans use 10 percent of the park -- that 10 percent includes most of the park's watering holes, the parts frequented by wildlife. A recent gimmick by some tour operators has aggravated the problem: some drivers are given financial incentives by the operators to drive fewer miles as a way of saving gas. But driving less has the deleterious side effect of keeping vans in the overused central core of the park.
Under differential pricing, visitors would actually pay more to drive on the inner circuit of the park.
There is also the possibility that Amboseli will become the bottom layer of a three-tiered tourism plan for Kenya. Dr. Leakey envisions a "more eco-friendly" top tier involving walking trips and camel safaris into the remoter areas of Kenya. Other areas, such as Masai Mara, Mount Kenya and parts of the Tsavo National Park, would be medium-priced and retain some exclusivity. And Amboseli would remain what it has become -- an enclave for inexpensive, mass tourism.

An article on May 19 about the Amboseli National Park in Kenya included an outdated reference to Wildlife Conservation International's specialist in the region. As the organization pointed out in a letter on July 8, Dr. David Western is senior conservationist, in charge of East African projects; Dr. John Robinson became the organization's director in February 1990.

HEADLINE: What Is Chris Whittle Teaching Our Children?

BYLINE: By N. R. Kleinfield; N. R. Kleinfield is a reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
It was warm in the living room of Chris Whittle's relentlessly neat living quarters. Outside, rain began to spit from the troubled Tennessee skies, spoiling the arboreal view. Sitting on the couch, straight as a furled umbrella, Whittle placed a phone call to Phil Guarascio, the head of advertising at General Motors. Earlier, he had booked a call with him at this time. But Guarascio was not there. Whittle gave a withering look. "Some day, someone is going to invent a phone system that will automatically find people," he said. "They could be in another city, but the phone will get them. It has to happen. One of the biggest wastes of time is not being able to reach people, even if, like now, you've made an appointment to call them."
The way Chris Whittle figures it, if he doesn't like something, then someone -- often himself -- ought to reinvent it. Over the last two decades, Whittle has acquired a national profile as something of the bete noire of the media industry. His proliferating array of unorthodox magazines, posters and video systems go out to highly targeted audiences or are planted in veterinarians' offices, dentists' offices, health clubs, doctors' waiting rooms and schools. He once considered muffler shops. 
 Whittle has almost no compunctions about where you can put advertising, and thus in propagating his projects he has tapped into some raw emotions. Last year, much of the nation seemed caught in passionate debate over the ethics of Channel One, Whittle's newscast for secondary schools that contains plugs for hamburgers and corn chips. The uproar over Channel One has quieted down, but last week Whittle was all set to stir up fresh commotion with the disclosure of his most ambitious and jarring undertaking. He plans to establish a laboratory called the Edison Project in Knoxville, Tenn., where his Whittle Communications empire is based, staffed by 100 yet-unselected people culled from education, business and science who will try to sketch out a blueprint for a new breed of elementary and secondary schools.
Once the outline is complete, Whittle intends to build 200 schools around the country, to open in the fall of 1996. The cost, he imagines, could approach $3 billion, which he might raise by selling shares to large companies. Within 15 years, Whittle foresees 1,000 Whittle schools educating as many as two million students. Whittle's initiative will run parallel to the new education plan unveiled by President Bush and Education Secretary Lamar Alexander (a Whittle friend and former member of the Channel One board), which calls for grants to invent experimental public schools and for the building of 535 model schools by 1996.
What makes Chris Whittle think he can educate our kids? After his bruising experience with Channel One, his bravura has clearly increased. He is bent on transforming Whittle Communications into a multibillion-dollar company that will touch people virtually every place they venture.
WHITTLE HAD BEEN GNAWING ON A PEN, DRINKING in the zealous discussion among his development team of a project code-named Doc TV. Whittle's expression had veered from quizzical to displeased to keenly interested. Now he absently pulled at his ear and asked what he ultimately always wants to know: What's the potential?
"It doesn't sound completely crazy to me that this is a $200 million property," someone said. "The possibilities are 100,000 doctors have the system and 50,000 watch it daily."
Wearing his trademark bow tie, with his floppy brown hair jouncing about, Whittle drifted over to a side table, where there were piles of sandwiches and fruit salad. He asked, "How much is spent on medical detail forces?" (The drug company salesmen who personally visit doctors.)
"Merck alone spends half a billion bucks," came the answer. "We want to tell them to fire 10 percent of these people, pocket $30 million and give us $25 million."
"Sounds good," Whittle said grandly, and a vulpine smile crossed his face. "Sounds very good."
The airy conference room at Whittle's New York offices in the Seagram Building contained seven members of a development team, gathered several months ago to plot Doc TV, a product still a year away from being tested. It was to be a television system to go into either doctors' offices or their homes. Every day, a 12-minute broadcast informing physicians of the latest doings in their specialty would be sent via satellite or cable and automatically recorded on video tape. (As with Channel One, Whittle would chip in all the electronic gear.) Each of the daily programs would carry a commercial plug from a drug company.
Several constituencies are likely to bewail the project. Whittle expects to grab perhaps 20 percent of the $452 million of ads carried by medical trade journals. He smugly says some journals will doubtless fold. Further money should be siphoned out of the vast outlays by drug houses on detail men. A fair number of them, Whittle believes, will lose their jobs.
As the development meeting wore on, someone said, "Now we ought to think what else could we do to make this thing as attractive as possible."
Whittle joined the discussion: "How about, you push a button at the end of the show and samples come pouring out like a slot machine?"
That got excited nods.
Alan Greenberg, a Whittle vice chairman, said: "Well, there could be sweepstakes."
"Yeah, Wingo," someone threw in.
Everyone seemed really happy.
At the age of 43, Herbert Christopher Whittle is both lampooned as a flimflam man and hailed as an ingenious marketer.
"He has set the bar rather high for expectations of advertising creativity," says David R. Verklin, senior vice president and corporate media director of Hal Riney Partners.
On the other hand, Whittle gives competitors conniptions. "He tells people: 'Why are you bothering to buy space in that magazine that doesn't care about you? All I care about, Mr. Advertiser, is selling your product,' " says John R. MacArthur, publisher of Harper's Magazine. "We hear all the time, 'Why can't you come up with a Whittle-like package?' We've been asked to do a short-story contest where the winner has to name the advertiser's product in the story. We constantly get asked to sell the Harper's Index, have it be the Acme Screw Index or something. We say no to this stuff, but we do it at our peril."
Increasingly, marketers have concluded that traditional mass-market media are flawed. Thus, Whittle has managed, beneath his somewhat fulsome hype, to persuade a small but swelling list of about 30 clients that his products do work. And while both Whittle and his customers are wary of sharing specifics, Whittle spent several hours with me poring through studies that indicated products advertised in his media gained in consumer awareness. One well-known service firm, according to one report, picked up 8 percent in brand awareness in a print project. A snack advertiser on Channel One went up from a 29 percent awareness to 53 percent.
For 17 years, Nissan has been merrily sponsoring Whittle's biannual Student Traveler magazine for college students. Francis Gace, the president of Lewis & Gace, an advertising agency that has used several Whittle medical publications, says: "Whittle has produced some very convincing independent research that shows his products stand up. In a cluttered world, here is a less cluttered medium, and that makes it attractive."
Nevertheless, all research can be ambiguous, and since so many Whittle properties appear in odd locations, advertisers have trouble judging the true size and attentiveness of the audiences. At times, the task can seem as slippery as trying to gauge how many motorists flashing by a billboard actually spied the sun-screen ad. Moreover, marketers say Whittle generally seeks a fat premium over comparable ways to spend marketing dollars. Part of Whittle's wiliness is that he has invented products that are maddeningly difficult to compare with anything else. Still, agency people estimate that Whittle prices sometimes run two or three times above competing possibilities. Often, princely sums are paid well before a new idea has proved itself, a practice that makes some marketers feel as if they're being asked to fund a wild-eyed experiment.
"The world of media is changing, and he's going in the correct direction," says Jack Irving, head of media operations at the Saatchi & Saatchi agency. "But there's been no overwhelming evidence yet to convince the ad community that his properties work." What's more, Whittle's biggest products -- like Channel One and Special Reports TV, a feature-type television system that began in October 1990 in doctors' waiting rooms -- are still young and face intensifying competition. Healthlink, for instance, is a rival doctors' system, and Turner Broadcasting runs a plug-free program for schools.
But the Whittle bandwagon rolls on. Last year, Whittle introduced a series of short books called "The Larger Agenda," written by respected authors and sent free to 150,000 politicians and officers of influential corporations. About six books appear each year, all sprinkled with advertisements from Federal Express. The series has been so profitable that he just began another series, and has organized a book division presided over by William S. Rukeyser, a former managing editor of Fortune magazine, and Hamilton Jordan, chief of staff for President Jimmy Carter.
Next year, Whittle expects to try displaying consumer products in malls. He won't reveal the products, though he has attracted interest among manufacturers. The idea would work like this: Whittle stores would show models of competing brands of a product -- say, lawn mowers. The mowers, according to Whittle people, would be more attractively displayed and in wider assortment than in conventional stores. Since the Whittle outlets would contain nothing else, the mowers presumably would lure a focused audience. There would be no stock. If you found the mower of your dreams, you would snatch up a phone in the store and order it for shipment to your home.
Whittle's pride and hope, however, are what he calls place-based television systems. These systems can be viewed only in locations outside the home, where Whittle knows precisely who is watching. This is a world in which there are no remote controls to switch stations when commercials blare, because there are no other channels. Whittle envisions systems for bankers, school administrators -- who knows, maybe circus performers. His projection is that revenues from place-based TV will grow from less than $100,000 in 1990 to almost $3 billion by the year 2000. The entire cable industry has revenues of about $2 billion. The three commercial networks together bring in $9 billion.
"WE'LL DO $220 MILLION in revenues in 1990," Chris Whittle said. "We have 1,000 employees. Increasingly we will be a television force. We are one of the media industry's fastest-growing companies."
Whittle was addressing executives from FCB/Leber Katz Partners at the ad agency's Manhattan offices, his notable reserves of charm on glaring display. He had recently begun paying courtesy calls on agencies to try to redress past snubbing. In doing his selling, Whittle had typically called directly on advertisers and bypassed their agencies, unlike conventional publishers and broadcasters, and there is a chasm of animosity and suspicion between many agencies and Whittle.
Whittle has come a ways. Five years ago, his company, which for the last two years has been half-owned by Time Warner, collected just $80 million in revenues, and the largest property was a poster in dentists' offices that brought in $7 million. Whittle says pretax earnings averaged 15 percent of revenues over the last five years, with the bulk of the profits from a total of 30-odd magazines and wall posters devoted to such advertiser-friendly subjects as travel, health and beauty.
Whittle told the Leber group that his company has two major goals: to provide new services to advertisers and readers and to bring greater value to advertisers. "I'm going to pick one arena to illustrate this -- television."
He went on: "When we look at television, we see a medium in serious decline. We think the commercial audience erosion is worse than admitted. We think the remote control has been a disaster in this regard and the full story of this has not been told. "
Laurel Cutler, the agency's vice chairman, nodded, and said, "I watch my teen-agers and they watch with their thumb."
"We estimate that upward of 40 percent of Americans rarely see commercials, even the biggest campaigns," Whittle said. (While network officials admit that many TV viewers otherwise occupy themselves during commercials, they contend that the figure is far below 40 percent. Yet no one knows for sure.)
Whittle went on to tell about his plans for place-based networks: "What are the advantages? There is much greater targeting. I can promise you that everyone in a high school is a teen-ager. I can promise you everyone in a pediatrician's has a child."
He paused, then sped on: "This fact will surprise you. Ninety-five percent of television activity is followed by one activity -- sleep. Because it happens at night. That's not true of place-based television. For example, some 61 percent of people who leave a doctor's office have a prescription. They are going to a retail environment. So that changes the impact of the commercial."
(Subsequently, Whittle admitted he couldn't support the surprising sleep "fact.")
"We look at media differently," Whittle continued. "We ask, 'Is a commercial that is seen more valuable than one that is not?' Most media evaluations don't take that into account. In homes, what is the zap level? We ask, 'Is the first impression on an individual more valuable than the 100th?' "
Joseph W. Ostrow, the Leber agency's worldwide media director, said: "We have a client who feels that a commercial seen the 100th or 99th time is wasted money. So we set frequency levels."
Whittle nodded and went on: "Is a person who will never see your competitor's commercial more valuable than one who will see it 100 times? We think absolutely, yet most agencies don't care about proprietary levels."
Cutler: "I think that is overstated. You say 'never see your competitor's commercial.' But take your waiting-room example. You only own that person for an hour."
"It is overstated to make a point," Whittle conceded.
Whittle invited ideas, and Ellen W. Oppenheim, the senior vice president and media director, said: "I'd like to see you come to us during the planning stage of a project. And listen. Because as much as you accuse the agencies of not listening, I don't think you always have. It's been, O.K., if we don't get what we want today, we'll go to the client. Goodbye."
IN THE AIR, FLYING between Knoxville and Columbus, Ohio, Chris Whittle said: "One of the frightening things is the media terrain is going to radically change. It's not frightening to me, but it will be to others. I don't think the major media will become extinct, just smaller and different."
Of course, not all Whittle media work, either. The latest of the dozen or so failures over the years include American Style, a magazine for beauty parlors, which was unable to capture requisite advertising and was recently shut down. It meant a loss of several million dollars, the worst Whittle flop. He hit rocky shoals, as well, with his six magazines for doctors' waiting rooms. By bungling relations with ad agencies, Whittle caused them to bad-mouth the project; some advertisers withdrew. So Whittle brought out a television system, reduced the magazines to three publications and gave advertisers who buy spots on the TV system free ads in the magazines.
If the Whittle ventures sound more like marketing than media, it's because marketing is all he has ever known.
He grew up in Etowah, Tenn., the son of a country doctor. While attending the University of Tennessee, he embarked on a college magazine project called "Knoxville in a Nutshell" with Phillip Moffitt and two other students. They formed a company called 13-30, alluding to the age group they wished to reach, and out of a former pillow factory engineered Nutshells for other campuses. Whittle was always the glad-handing salesman.
The company grew too fast, the other Nutshells fared less well and 13-30 creaked with debt. One magical day, it found bliss when it agreed to develop a magazine for Nissan in which the car maker was the sole advertiser. This single-sponsorship notion caught fire and life went along beautifully. Still, the company was obscure until 1979, when it bought and revitalized Esquire magazine. In 1986, Whittle and Moffitt tired of each other, and a vinegary divorce took place. Moffitt retained Esquire, which he soon sold to Hearst. Whittle kept the stable of magazines and wall posters and renamed the company Whittle Communications.
Even as it has expanded, Whittle Communications has operated in emphatically entrepreneurial fashion. The fuel of the company is ideas. At any given time, some 20 development teams are devising fresh possibilities, and employees often find themselves shuttled from development team to working property back to development team.
Whittle readily confesses that he is not much of a reader or watcher: he sees news and movies on TV and reads a daily paper, but he studies no magazines on a regular basis and finishes perhaps three or four nonfiction books a year. If an advertiser wishes to catch Whittle's attention, he says, "I am damn near impossible to reach." But he does act on ads that do penetrate him. He recently spied an ad for Polo/Ralph Lauren pants and went out and bought some.
While most of Whittle's magazines and wall posters are no longer backed by a single advertiser, competing brands are forbidden. Although the publications are slick-looking, the majority are rather pallid echoes of well-established magazines like Time or The Atlantic. Who gets them is strictly controlled.
David Halberstam has mused a good bit about Whittle. He contracted to do a Whittle book, but withdrew when he encountered editorial resistance. Published by Morrow, "The Next Century" became a best seller. Despite that episode, Halberstam says he likes Whittle and feels the book idea is a sensible one. But he dislikes Channel One and he wonders about Whittle's convictions. "I don't want to underestimate what he is," Halberstam said. "He's smart. His ideas are original. There is no doubt he has an instinct for marketing. But I didn't get a feeling that anything matters to him. I don't know what he really cares about."
JOE MANCINI squinted down the hall, bustling with students flowing to their next class. Then Mancini, the principal of Bishop Ready High School in Columbus, Ohio, turned his attention to his special guests. "Welcome, and c'mon into my office," he said. Straightening his bow tie, Chris Whittle, trailed by Bill Rukeyser, followed him into a drab room.
Since Channel One has been his biggest gamble (for one thing, Whittle last year spent $70 million for about 9 percent of all the 19-inch color TV sets sold in this country) and since he is plunging deeper into education, Whittle likes to make periodic trips to see how things are going.
Channel One can best be described as an MTV-like newscast -- a compression of news, features tailored for teen-agers, trivia questions and a series on a topical issue like the Soviet Union or the handicapped. Everything is boppy. The smily anchors are in their 20's, and the pace is snappy and the graphics flashy. The commercials, though sometimes identical to those on regular TV, are increasingly shot specifically for Channel One. While many shamelessly encourage consumption of candy bars and costly footwear, some are message-oriented. Burger King ran a five-part ad that chronicled the pitiful plight of "Tiny," a school dropout who degenerated into a prostitute, drug addict and alcoholic.
"How long you been on?" Whittle asked.
"March 4," Mancini said. "We were on the first day. Our kids are excited. We like the quality. We have, though, made some calls with some complaints. Slow down the presentation was the main one."
"What about the parents?" Whittle asked.
"They're thrilled," Mancini said. "Of course, I also get the nasty letters about why are you tainting our kids."
"What can we do better?" Whittle asked.
"Well, we have a problem with geography here," Mancini said. "You have these flat maps that are sometimes hard to understand where something is. Maybe you could make them spin like they do on 'Wide World of Sports.' "
While many teachers and students extol the 12-minute newscast, others will never accept the infusion of commercialism. Whittle often likes to defend the project by pointing out that there is already commercialism in the free skin creams given out in home economics classes and the ads on stadium scoreboards. For Whittle the matter has largely been detoxified by the project's economic viability. Whittle has gotten the 8,600 schools he sought to cover his capital costs and achieve the audience size he felt would interest advertisers. (As an incentive, Whittle rains $50,000 of free TV's, VCR's and satellite dishes on schools that take the system.)
Whittle now envisions further expansion, and does not rule out a program geared for elementary grades. It is little known that for years Whittle has had a wall display called "Big Picture" (actually a set of three wall posters boasting short articles and graphics with ads running along the bottom) in 11,000 elementary schools, and it is not uncommon for grade-schoolers to be surveyed by Whittle-funded researchers to see how vividly they recall brands like M & M's that advertise in Big Picture.
At some places, Channel One has roused boiling emotions. There was a walkout of students in Fargo, N.D., protesting what they felt was dull and condescending programming. Rhode Island and New York prohibit the system in public schools, and similar legislation has been introduced in California. What's more, Whittle finds it necessary to agree to occasional odd stipulations. Whittle said one that school demanded contractual assurance that the programming would contain no subliminal advertising. School board members mentioned that they feared that the Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi might sponsor subliminal messages. Whittle swears he is not kidding.
Under a sun that glazed the trees, Whittle was taken on the 20-minute drive to Grove City High School. Thomas D. Rutan, the principal, told him that teachers had complained that the school personnel weren't always starting the show at the same time, and so three alarm clocks were arranged atop the receiver set to shriek at the appointed moment. Whittle chuckled.
"What do the teachers think?" Whittle asked.
"Some really like it," the principal said. "And some get so engrossed in what they're teaching that they get annoyed when the TV comes on and they just pull the plug."
Whittle looked horrified.
Upstairs, in a sophomore English class, Whittle wedged himself into a desk to watch the day's broadcast. It embraced some coverage of the gulf war, a study suggesting that too much TV viewing could be bad for the heart, a feature on agriculture, a segment on mentally handicapped students and part of a series on American Indians.
After the show ended, Whittle rose to ask questions. The class was sullen and reticent.
"Have you learned where places are?" Whittle wondered. "For instance, have you learned where Hussein lives?"
"Not really," a boy said, "because we already learned that on other news or in the newspapers."
Whittle had noticed that a number of students did homework or doodled throughout the program. The teacher said the rule is that they don't have to watch, but they must be quiet.
"Was this a typical experience with just a few doing homework?" Whittle said.
"I think more were watching it because you were here," another boy said.
The teacher added, "I would say half work on homework and half watch."
Driving away with Rukeyser, Whittle said, "Interesting visit."
"Every one's different," Rukeyser said.
OUTSIDE THE CAR window, leafy streets, tracts of lush farmland and then a tight strip of commercialism flicked by beneath the emergent light. Accompanied by a bleary-eyed team, Whittle has been rousted out of bed early to descend on a small Midwestern city to try to wring $5.5 million from a major advertiser, a maker of household products, for Whittle's waiting-room television system.
On sales pitches, Whittle's pattern is always the same: two or three people show up with a tornado of charts and printed material and, for a video sale, a television and a VCR. Whittle also insists on two hours of the client's time. If he shows up for an appointment and is told there's now only an hour, he will reschedule. Sometimes he flies hundreds of miles only to make a new scribbling in his appointment book.
Whittle spoke in a soothing, sociable voice, often in a tone of wonder, and in short, simple sentences. "In conventional media, there is no competitive advantage," he said. "You have to outspend or outcreate. You don't outflank. We allow you to outflank."
Then he let Bill Connell, president of Whittle Communications, say a few words before Alan Greenberg delivered the core pitch. "You're doing a good job on commercial television," he said to the group, "but I'll tell you, 40 percent are not seeing your ads. We have the ability to fundamentally change the way in which spending is delivered to consumers."
Whittle cut in: "A typical response of an agency is, 'We buy around that.' You can't buy around that. You can't get people who don't watch television to watch television."
"With us," Greenberg said, "you can't zap, you can't graze, you can't plug your Nintendo into the set."
The case was hitting the right ears. The company had recently hired a new president who wanted to market the company's products more effectively. In particular, the company needed to reach mothers, and it had found commercial television frustratingly inefficient.
Whittle spoke about how company trucks delivered magazines and new broadcasts to the doctors' offices every two weeks. "One thing to think about," he said, "is those trucks have room on them. We could take other stuff. Samples of yours."
Once the presentation was over, the president leaned back and said: "This just fits so perfectly. And it ought to be something we'll say yes to right now, and we'll figure out the details later."
Just like that, $5.5 million was committed.
"In closing," Whittle said, "I'd like to say that, like all media, we're not perfect. After a meeting like this, people say, 'Hooray, we've found the Holy Grail.' We ain't the Holy Grail. But we're far better than anything else out there."
That said, the team dispersed. On the way to the airport, Whittle allowed his grin to widen until it was huge.
THE DINNER HOUR was ripening, and as a ragged line of tables at the stylish Memphis restaurant on the Upper West Side of Manhattan filled up, voices lunged forward and overlapped one another. Around the long dark bar, men and women stalked one another.
Whittle and Rinker Buck, the editorial director of AdWeek's Marketing Week, were meeting to get to know one another better. Whittle had made the overture because he had been miffed at some rather blistering coverage in Buck's publication.
Whittle sipped a drink, as Buck spun an anecdote that had to do with keeping recipes on his refrigerator.
"We've thought of ads on refrigerators," Whittle interrupted.
Buck laughed.
It wasn't a joke.
In fact, Whittle later told me, the company had thought of trying to interest a maker like Whirlpool into building frames for wall media on its refrigerators, and then homeowners could pick up the material at the supermarket and slide it in.
Buck lit into Whittle on Channel One. He told Whittle how irritating it is to watch commercial-ridden Saturday-morning television with his 5-year-old daughter. "The other day, I asked her what she wanted to do," he said, "and she said, 'I want to be an actress in commercials.' Not movies or TV, in commercials. So I pretty profoundly disagree with the concept of Channel One."
"Advertising is making available a good program," Whittle said. "It is a trade-off."
After some back and forth, Buck said, "Listen, you're an alternative medium. You consider the high schools a segment. Have you considered the churches?"
Slight embarrassment prickled his face, but Whittle just laughed. (Later on, he told me he hadn't ruled out churches, but couldn't think of anything he might do there.)
I walked a few blocks with Buck. "You look at Whittle and you have to realize he still doesn't have that much of a track record," he said. "Something doesn't work, and he's quickly into something else. He's like a chameleon. If something doesn't work, he becomes something else."
THE HOME CHRIS Whittle owns in Knoxville resembles an old mansion of buff bricks. In fact, it is a converted apartment house with four sizable three-bedroom apartments. The place suits Whittle fine, though most nights he's there alone. He was married for the first time last August, to Priscilla Rattazzi, niece of the Fiat magnate Gianni Agnelli, and in January they had a daughter. (She has a son by a previous marriage.) His wife prefers their showy New York dwelling in the Dakota apartment house, and so Whittle sees his family mostly on the weekends.
Channel One, Whittle said, has radically revised his career aspirations. Until a year ago, Whittle intended to retire from business in 1994 and enter politics. Not any more. "Channel One has such an impact on education that I realized I could never do anything like this in four years of politics. So I decided I would rather stay in business."
It seems certain that Whittle will be the focus of continued truculence and agitation. In the years to come, he faces more serious obstacles. His projects are much riskier and his reach is bumping up against more powerful franchises and constituencies, none of which is likely to concede territory without a vicious battle. Whittle is unlikely to emerge unscathed.
Whittle grabbed some gym clothes and prepared to work out. As he bent into his blue Porsche, he admitted something about himself, perhaps a serious flaw. "I'm not a good competitor," he said. "I don't think competitively." For a long time, he hasn't really had to. He has gone where others have not, but now he is playing in a bigger and rougher league.

Encountering Those Mercurial Days in the Bullpens

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Dennis Eckersley of Oakland, generally considered the best relief pitcher working today, has raised eyebrows by already giving up four home runs (double his total for the entire 1990 season), allowing seven earned runs (two more than all of last season) and failing in two save situations (as many as all of last season).
 Rob Dibble of Cincinnati, on the other hand, has pitched with eye-popping precision, striking out 34 batters and walking only four in 19 2/3 innings while registering a perfect save record in 10 chances. 
Those have been some of the more intriguing developments in the fraternity of closing relief pitchers in the early weeks of the season. Some others:
 *Dibble's dominance has been in stark contrast with the problems encountered by his bullpen mate, Randy Myers, who has three saves in six save situations and a strikeout-to-walk ratio slightly less impressive than Dibble's: 14 walks and 13 strikeouts in 16 innings.
 *Veterans Jeff Reardon of Boston and Lee Smith of St. Louis have pitched impressively, Reardon registering 12 saves, including his first 8 in a 9-victory, 11-game span, and Smith reeling off 11 saves in a dominating performance that continues to belie the four-year-old whispers that he no longer could be effective because of problems with his knees. Duane Ward, stepping in for the injured Tom Henke, has matched Reardon with 12 saves for Toronto.
 *The Yankees don't miss Dave Righetti, their career saves leader, who defected to San Francisco during the winter. They don't miss him because they haven't had many games to be saved: four, to be exact. The Giants, on the other hand, haven't overused the $10 million Righetti. He has relieved in only two save situations, succeeding once and squandering his chance the other time.
 *Doug Jones of Cleveland, who in the previous three seasons amassed 112 saves, has temporarily pitched himself out of his closing role with four successive ineffective efforts, including three that lost games.
 *Before getting his seventh save Friday night, Bobby Thigpen of the Chicago White Sox had not had a save in the team's previous 14 games. Last year, when Thigpen had a major league record 57 saves, his longest stretch without a save was eight games, and that was the only time he went beyond five games without one.
 
They're Not Machines
 Closing relief pitchers, of course, are notorious for their mercurial performances, both from season to season and month to month. Rare is the reliever who avoids a slump the entire season or doesn't have a below-par season.
 Eckersley, whose ascent to late-inning stardom parallels the Athletics' dominance of the American League, is not having a poor season by any means. True, he has given up more home runs and runs than he did all of last season, when he registered 48 saves in 50 save situations, but he nevertheless has 9 saves in 11 opportunities.
 "Guys are so good for so long, you come to expect perfection," Dave Duncan, the Oakland pitching coach, said. "A guy gives up a hit, and people wonder what's wrong with him. He's human. That's what's the matter. He's not a machine."
 Speaking specifically of Eckersley, Duncan said he was "going through a period where he's making mistakes and not getting away with them."
 "They haven't hit any good pitches off him; he's made bad pitches," the coach added.
 Why should Eckersley throw poor pitches?
 "Maybe he's distracted," Duncan said. "When everything is going well, everything flows. He's not getting the results he's accustomed to so that can be a little distracting to him."
 When a pitcher is distracted, the coach explained, instead of hitting the corners with his pitches, he could "leave the ball in the middle." That's when batters can hit home runs, as Alvin Davis, Greg Gagne, Matt Nokes and Beau Allred have done against Eckersley.
 Dave Smith, who moved from the Houston Astros to the Chicago Cubs as a free agent, has had six successive seasons of 23 or more saves. Yet after getting four saves in the Cubs' first six victories, he encountered a rough period in which he lost three saves in four days, twice after Andre Dawson hit grand slams that either gave the Cubs the lead or increased it.
 Jones, who will temporarily work in middle relief while Shawn Hillegas does his job with the Indians, hasn't had a save since April 28, and it's not because he hasn't had the opportunity. Once three games before that date and three times in six games after, Jones was called on to preserve victories, but the Indians lost all four games.
 The last-place Giants haven't given Righetti the chance to lose that many victories. They asked him to save a 9-6 victory against San Diego on April 11, but he gave up a pinch-hit three-run home run to Marty Barrett, who has not driven in another run. Righetti did save a victory five days later, but he has not relieved in a save situation since. Jeff Brantley has, but he has blown three of six chances. Righetti was asked to preserve a 5-1 victory last Thursday night (not a save situation), but all four batters he faced got hits and three scored.
 
Having Fun at the Top
 Sure, Dave Henderson said, "You always look at the averages in the Sunday paper to check out your buddies." But his buddies haven't had to wait until Sunday to check out Henderson.
 "It's kind of nice," Oakland's center fielder said, "to see your name on top of a lot of offensive categories. The guys around the league who know you, they know you're doing well without talking to them."
 In recent days, Henderson has led the American League in just about every major category -- batting average, slugging percentage, home runs, runs batted in, runs scored, hits, extra-base hits, total bases. "I had a good month," he said modestly, then added, "I think people are more surprised because it's at the beginning of the year rather than at the end of the year. I think players around the league know I'm capable of this."
 Henderson, 32 years old, had his best season in 1988, batting .304 with 24 home runs and 94 r.b.i. But he is best known for his post-season hitting, especially the home runs.
 "This guy has hit as many big home runs as a lot of guys," said Reggie Jackson, a part-time Oakland coach, who hit more big home runs than most.
 
Status and Deflation
 Scott Sanderson obviously adopted the wrong strategy in his effort to play for the Athletics again this year. A 17-game winner for them last season, Sanderson was a free agent who wanted to remain with Oakland, but the salary-heavy Athletics opted to go with lower-paid pitchers.
 So Sanderson winds up with the Yankees and becomes their biggest winner. Meanwhile, Andy Hawkins pitches so dreadfully for the Yankees that they release him, and he goes off and signs with -- the Athletics. His price is right: less than $80,000 based on the $100,000 minimum, with the Yankees responsible for the remainder of his guaranteed salary. Suddenly, Hawkins, if he can pitch at all effectively, can wind up in the World Series while Sanderson can finish in last place.
 With batting averages that didn't total .300 and one r.b.i. between them, Jim Leyritz and Mike Blowers provided a stunning example of the deflation of major league standards when they openly complained about their lack of playing time, saying the Yankees should play them or trade them (Blowers got his wish Friday, going to the Mariners; Leyritz was sent to the minors). Not long ago, it seems, a player had to have attained some semblance of status to be able to utter such ultimatums.
 Another example: This being the first week 50 years later of Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak, the television and radio announcers who talk about John Doe's seven-game hitting streak and the public relations directors who provide that information should feel sufficiently embarrassed and cease and desist.
 
Now for the Hard Part
 The owners, in settling their collusion crime against free agents, are getting the last laugh. They are paying the players $280 million, but the Players Association must determine how much money should go to which players, and it is no easy task. Hundreds of players will file claims by tomorrow's deadline.
 The real tipoff on the bizarre ramifications of the settlement came last Thursday when Richard Moss, who as the union's general counsel won some of the most significant arbitration cases in baseball labor history, debated union lawyers before two arbitrators in Los Angeles.
 Moss, who represents about 50 players making claims, had filed an objection to the framework of the payment of claims on behalf of some players who lost jobs because of collusion. Other lawyers and agents presented other arguments in other hearings.
 The union probably missed a chance to add funds to the collusion treasury. They should have charged admission to the hearings. Management officials surely would have paid top prices to see players' representatives squabbling among themselves over money.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN: Providence

BYLINE: By MARCIA R. LIEBERMAN; MARCIA R. LIEBERMAN lives in Providence.

 BODY:
When I moved to Providence over a dozen years ago, a friend who grew up in New York said, "Oh, that's the place where my father always got lost when we drove to Cape Cod." Now that the final Interstate connections are in place, motorists can zip right through Providence. What they are missing is a city with one of the largest and finest collections of 18th- and 19th-century buildings in the country.
Although handsome buildings are scattered throughout the city, the College Hill district takes pride of place. It is one of 15 Urban National Historic Landmark Districts designated by the Department of the Interior. Benefit Street, near the base of College Hill, is surely one of the most distinctive streets in America. 
 Eminently walkable because of its scale, the city has many inviting areas like the old downtown waterfront, where the Woonasquatucket and Moshassuck rivers merge. These rivers, rerouted and then paved over in the 19th century, have now been uncovered; bridges, walkways and gardens will be completed by 1993.
Providence is not merely quaint, however. Its population of 160,728 includes sizable groups of recent immigrants from Asia, including Cambodians and Hmong, as well as Dominicans. The city also has a distinct Portuguese heritage; the language is widely spoken.
There is also a large college population, notably at Brown University and the Rhode Island School of Design (R.I.S.D., pronounced locally as RIZ-dee). The art students, a frisky crowd in funky clothes, lend a lively air.
 
Architecture
 Benefit Street, near the base of College Hill, is a quietly stunning thoroughfare that displays in one mile a timeline of architectural history, from Colonial through Federal, Greek Revival, Gothic Revival and Victorian. The oldest houses, dating from the mid to late 1700's, are severely beautiful in their simplicity and proportions. Many small streets like John and Arnold, above the southern end of Benefit, are lined with these forthright little houses. The 18th-century merchants who prospered in the China trade erected grander houses, with elegant fanlights and porticos.
The annual Festival of Historic Houses (June 7, 8 and 9), co-sponsored by the Providence Preservation Society and The Providence Journal-Bulletin, gives people a chance to get inside about three dozen houses. There are three separate events. On Friday and Saturday evenings, a gala "Night of a Thousand Candles" tour covers about a dozen Colonial and Federal houses. Among them is the Thomas Hoppin House, scene of a brilliant reception for President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1877 that earned it the epithet "The House of a Thousand Candles." Saturday will feature a lecture on decorative painting, highlighting the 1863 Gov. Henry Lippitt House at 199 Hope Street, (401) 751-2110, which is set to open on July 1 as a museum, and "Houses in Bloom," a tour of Victorian, Queen Anne and Colonial Revival houses, with floral arrangements adorning the interiors.
Following the candlelight tour on Saturday, there will be a dessert and Champagne reception in the 18th-century John Brown House. On Sunday afternoon there will be a tour of the city's Victorian Armory District, an area being restored. Visitors on the tours are free to come and go as they wish, although guides are on hand. Tour tickets cost $17.50; the Decorative Arts Lecture is $5; the Saturday night tour is $25; a Deluxe Festival Package (Saturday only) is $60.
Visitors who cannot attend the Festival can see the exteriors of College Hill's private homes and other historic sites on their own. The Providence Preservation Society at 21 Meeting Street, (401) 831-7440, has tours on tape, maps and other publications. The society's office is open weekdays from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.
 
Other Sights
 Benefit Street is also the setting for other fine buildings, including two splendid churches. The First Baptist Church in America (1775) is a classic New England meetinghouse with a steeple 185 feet high. At Benefit and Benevolent Streets, the First Unitarian Church (1816), a Federal structure, has the largest bell cast by Paul Revere & Son in Canton, Mass.
Between the churches, at Benefit and College Streets, is the Providence Athenaeum Library (1838). The austere gray Greek revival building gives no hint of the cozy interior, reminiscent of an English club. Open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from 8:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.; Wednesday 8:30 A.M. to 8:30 P.M.; Saturday 9:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.
The Museum of Art of the Rhode Island School of Design is at 224 Benefit. Its holdings include 19th-century French Impressionist paintings and the Colonial art and furnishings in Pendleton House, the first American wing created by any museum, with 4 paintings by John Singleton Copley and 2 of 10 surviving Townsend and Goddard secretary desks (c. 1770). Scheduled for June 21 to Sept. 1 is "The English Eye," a show of British art from the 18th century to the present (the museum owns a superlative collection of British watercolors, including 18 Turners). The museum is open Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday from 10:30 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Thursday noon to 8 P.M.; Sunday 2 to 5 P.M.; from June 16 to Aug. 31: Tuesday to Saturday from noon to 5 P.M.; $2, $1 for those 60 and over, 50 cents for those 5 to 18.
The Gov. Stephen Hopkins House, 15 Hopkins Street on the corner of Benefit, is a small, beautifully preserved house dating from 1743. Open from April to December, Wednesday and Saturday from 1 to 4 P.M.; free. In striking contrast is the John Brown House, across Benefit Street (entrance at 52 Power Street). This imposing Georgian house is a showcase of period furniture, wallpaper, porcelain, silver and fabric. Open Tuesday to Saturday from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M.; Sunday 1 to 4 P.M.; $5.
On the crest of College Hill, at Brown University, are fine Colonial, Greek Revival and Victorian buildings around the College Green. University Hall (1770 to 1771) was used as a hospital for Colonial troops in 1776. The university's Bell Gallery at the List Art Center, 64 College Street, will exhibit prints by Elizabeth Murray until June 2. Open Monday to Friday from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M.; Saturday and Sunday from 1 to 4 P.M.
 
Diversions
 The Trinity Repertory Company, (401) 351-4242, one of the country's leading regional theaters, performs on two stages at 201 Washington Street. Jerome Sterner's "Other People's Money" plays upstairs to June 9; "The Stick Wife," by Darrah Cloud, is downstairs to June 2. Tickets: $22 to $30.
At the Providence Performing Arts Center, 220 Weybosset Street, (401) 421-2787, Mikhail Baryshnikov will perform with the White Oak Dance Project on Thursday at 8 P.M.; $35 to $75. Diana Ross will appear June 20 at 7:30 P.M.; $28.50 to $38.50.
On May 27, starting at 8:30 A.M. prior to Brown University's commencement at the First Baptist Church, faculty, graduating students and bands will march down College Street and along Benefit Street to the church, then at about 10:30 A.M. up Angel and George Streets back to the campus.
 On July 7, there will be a Cape Verdean outdoor festival in India Point Park at the head of Narragansett Bay, with food and folk dancing.
On the Fourth of July in Bristol, about a half-hour's drive from Providence, the 206th Bristol Civic, Military and Fireman's Parade, billed as the country's oldest continuous Independence Day parade, starts at 10:30 A.M. and marches down Hope and High Streets, with floats and bands. For a good view, get there by 8 A.M.; the town is closed to traffic afterward. Details: Bristol County Chamber of Commerce; (401) 245-0750.

HEADLINE: Focus: Speculative Mansions;
Making Fantasy a Reality -- and Selling It

BYLINE: By LETTICE STUART

DATELINE: BOCA RATON, FLA.

 BODY:
AT night, Sam Caliendo lies awake thinking of interior waterfalls, indoor lagoons and rooftop pools. He is always thinking of unusual features for the multimillion-dollar homes he designs and builds to sell on speculation here.
By day, the 40-year-old builder travels the world selecting art, artifacts and furniture to adorn his showcase residences, which he sells fully furnished. He has bought handpainted silks in India and China, marble and leathers in Italy, golf carts in Poland, a 2,000-pound solid teak elephant sculpture in Africa, sharkskin furniture in Thailand and an antique wedding dress in Morocco to use as a wall hanging. 
 Mr. Caliendo is among a handful of people who specialize in building multimillion-dollar mansions speculatively. Most such homes are built as vacation retreats in resort areas, but some are also built as primary residences in metropolitan areas. In Montgomery County, Md., for example, a $4 million speculative house is on the market and one builder in Houston has been producing mansions speculatively since 1982.
"We're not seeing the wild speculative building of luxury homes that was the national craze in the mid to late 80's," said Stuart Siegel, executive vice president of Sotheby's International Realty Company. But there still is activity in areas with high concentrations of wealth, he said.
In Palm Beach, Fla., the dream of home ownership has catapulted into the realm of fantasy. The most expensive speculative house on the market there now is an unfurnished Italian villa-style oceanfront mansion for $11.5 million. The 27,300-square-foot home has 7 bedrooms; 10 full and 4 half baths; a heated saltwater swimming pool of marble with a 2,200-square-foot cabana; a tennis pavilion with a fireplace and wet bar, and separate tasting rooms for red and white wine, each 22 by 16 feet.
The house has been on the market a year. "But it usually takes 18 to 24 months to sell this kind of property," said Martha Gottfried, the listing broker for the property and the wife of the builder, Robert W. Gottfried.
The Gottfrieds also own the 115- by 491-foot vacant oceanfront lot next door, which they have on the market for $6.5 million. Mr. Gottfried has just started building three smaller inland speculative homes of 7,000 to 9,000 square feet that will be priced at $3.5 million and $4 million.
"We put a lot of our own money in the houses, but we have no trouble getting financing for the rest from the bank," Mrs. Gottfried said. "There are buyers out there more than willing to pay for this kind of property." Her sales have exceeded $100 million each year for the last five years.
"These buyers are people looking for instant gratification," she said, "People who walk into a Rolls-Royce dealership with cash and drive home in a new car."
THE demand for such luxury has slackened somewhat because of the recession, said Ken Dodson, a real estate agent here, but by no means has it dried up. Mr. Dodson's office receives calls regularly from potential buyers from all over the country looking for lavish homes in Florida.
These are typically impulse buyers, Mr. Dodson said, weighty on cash but short on the time, patience and imagination necessary to have homes custom-built for themselves. They are usually retired executives from the North looking for a second or third vacation home where they can spend a month or two a year in a tropical climate.
Despite their taste for flash and glitz, such wealthy buyers are generally "conservative types who might just as well show up in a rented car with Bermuda shorts, dark socks and tie-up shoes," he said.
Most of the "megahomes" are sold turnkey, or fully furnished so that buyers can move right in. But Mr. Caliendo has elevated the turnkey concept to new levels. His homes come complete with monogrammed bathrobes and custom-designed nightclothes hanging in the closets. Dining tables are set with fine china and crystal, freezers are filled with prime beef and the wine cellar is stocked. A custom-designed limousine may even be parked in an air-conditioned garage.
The amenities in Mr. Caliendo's homes are limited only by his imagination, which seems boundless. Who else would think of a lynx throw for the master bed, a handcarved lighted Lucite staircase, a tropical garden surrounded by a moat in the entrance foyer, etched glass walls, a bar trimmed in snakeskin, a carved stone and frogskin desk, and glass elevators?
He piles it on: fully equipped exercise rooms with padded floors; walk-in, climate-controlled bank vaults for fur storage; $40,000 entrance doors; theaters; media rooms with state-of-the-art video equipment, electronic juke boxes; oversized saunas and Jacuzzis; stereo systems with 82 speakers inside and out; sunken living rooms, and three-level entertaining rooms.
Mr. Caliendo's most recent creation is a $4.5 million home on a half-acre waterfront lot in Boca Raton's Royal Palm Yacht and Country Club. It is a 10,000-square-foot 17-room house. The $250,000 kitchen has mother-of-pearl cabinets. A two-story waterfall cascades inside the front entrance.
The developer, who also builds equally grandiose custom homes, said he builds his speculative homes "out of pocket" with his own capital or puts up 50 percent equity and borrows the rest from a bank.
Not all builders in Boca Raton are so fortunate, however. Mr. Dodson, the broker, recently lost the sale of a $1.5 million lot to a builder who could not get financing to produce a speculative house. Lack of real estate financing has not hurt buyers because they buy with cash, he said, but there is no question it has hurt builders.
Even in Aspen, Colo., where the average price of a single-family home has risen to $1.1 million, the unavailability of financing has thrown a wet blanket on the once-hot speculative home building market. "Banks here are only lending 50 percent of cost or one-third of the final appraised value on spec homes," Robert D. Ritchie, a real estate broker, said.
GORDON MATHEWS, a real estate developer in Pittsburgh, has been building and selling multimillion-dollar homes in Aspen and the nearby ski resort community of Snowmass for 10 years. He recently completed a 10,000-square-foot home on Red Mountain overlooking Aspen that is on the market, fully furnished, for $5.4 million. It has five bedrooms, six baths and a heated outdoor pool.
The biggest mistake a speculative builder of such houses can make is not providing sufficient living area. "But if done right, a builder can get $400 to $500 a square foot," he said. Most multimillion-dollar speculative homes in Aspen sell within months of completion, but Mr. Ritchie cites the example of one poorly planned home still on the market after three and a half years, despite a price reduction of $800,000, to $3.5 million.
Houston, unlike the resort areas of Colorado and Florida, has multimillion-dollar speculative homes being built as primary residences, but the perspective of the buyer is basically the same. Diane Lokey, the listing agent for a newly built 10,000-square-foot Georgian-style mansion priced at $2.95 million, said her customers are either too busy making money or too busy spending it to put in the time and energy needed to have a home custom built.
The mansion is in the River Oaks neighborhood, where half-acre lots sell for $1.1 million. A Houston builder, Ted Lazarides, who has a $2.4 million speculative home under construction in River Oaks, said his company has run out of land to build on. "We use our own money, so we can carry two or three houses at a time," he said. "If they don't sell quickly, obviously we don't sleep at night, but we don't face financial ruin either."

A Rare Breed of Speculators Who Builds Mansions

He recently completed a 10,000-square-foot home on Red Mountain overlooking Aspen that is on the market, fully furnished, for $5.4 million. It has five bedrooms, six baths and a heated outdoor swimming pool.
The biggest mistake a speculative builder of such houses can make is not providing sufficient living area. "But if done right, a builder can get $400 to $500 a square foot," he said. Most multimillion-dollar speculative homes in Aspen sell within months of completion, but Mr. Ritchie cites the example of one poorly planned home still on the market after three and a half years, despite a price reduction of $800,000, to $3.5 million.
Houston, unlike the resort areas of Colorado and Florida, has multimillion-dollar speculative homes being built as primary residences, but the perspective of the buyer is basically the same. Diane Lokey, the listing agent for a newly built 10,000-square-foot Georgian-style mansion priced at $2.95 million, said her customers are either too busy making money or too busy spending it to put in the time and energy needed to have a home custom built.
The mansion is in the River Oaks neighborhood, where half-acre lots sell for $1.1 million. A Houston builder, Ted Lazarides, who has a $2.4 million speculative home under construction in River Oaks, said his company has run out of land to build on. "We use our own money, so we can carry two or three houses at a time," he said. "If they don't sell quickly, obviously we don't sleep at night, but we don't face financial ruin either."

HEADLINE: In Oyster Bay, Old Order Changeth Slowly

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
IN the early 1900's, when Theodore Roosevelt established his summer White House in the Victorian mansion of Sagamore Hill, he was lured by the beauty of the sheltered bay and surrounding woodlands, the quiet streets of Oyster Bay and the village's importance in American history.
Through the years, residents of the hamlet, many of them third and fourth generations of the same families, have fought to preserve the history and charm of their village. 
 On numerous occasions they have resisted intrusions into their historic 1.24-square-mile community, whose roots have been traced from the early 1600's. Recent community opposition blocked a proposal to develop one of the last vacant waterfront parcels.
But in Oyster Bay, as elsewhere, change has been inevitable. Last month the Town of Oyster Bay approved an application for a McDonald's on Pine Hollow Road, near the entrance to the hamlet. If the site plan is also approved, a fast-food restaurant will soon become part of the village for the first time.
On an adjacent parcel, formerly the site of a car dealership and a Carvel ice-cream store, land has been cleared and bulldozed for a strip shopping center that will include a large discount pharmacy and a video-rental chain.
Residents' reactions are mixed.
Everything in the town generates several schools of thought, the executive director of the Chamber of Commerce, Myralee Machol, said.
Although some residents have complained that McDonald's will create too much traffic and will prevent people from coming into the hamlet, she said,others argue that it will help to keep people in the community because they will not have to go to another town for fast food.
"There is a great fear of change, especially among longtime residents who want to keep everything the way it was," Mrs. Machol said. "Then there is a new generation of young families who want modernization and new goods and services, but they still want the old facades and to retain the historic quality of the town. Oyster Bay is due for a lot of changes. It's a throwback from an earlier era. But let's face it. We can't buy a nickel Coke anymore."
McDonald's application for a restaurant was a result of a comprehensive study, said Jeffrey Forchelli, whose law firm in Mineola represents the company. The community needs that type of restaurant, he said, adding that although at a hearing concerns were expressed over traffic and a precedent for fast-food, there was also a groundswell of support, particularly from the elderly and firefighters.
Mrs. Machol said McDonald's was known for its good-neighbor policy. "They like to put back into the community what they take out," she said. "They are known to use local services, to hire senior citizens and teen-agers from the community to fill their jobs."
But many residents and merchants said they feared that the restaurant and mall would be another step in changing the small-town flavor of their community. The community began to feel the changes several years ago, when its lone supermarket in the heart of the hamlet closed and moved south along Pine Hollow Road. There was no longer a base store in the village, and merchants suffered, said Larry Sussman, owner of the East Norwich Pharmacy in the Pine Hollow shopping center. Residents were forced to leave the hamlet to shop, signifying a shift from the friendly home atmosphere that Oyster Bay has always stood for, he said.
"The feeling in the village has always been the service-oriented mom-and-pop stores, where owners know their customers by their first names," Mr. Sussman added. "The more impersonal chain stores can only hurt the older stores, because there's just not enough business to go around."
The community is losing some of its identification with a small-town feeling, said Rose Kester, president of the East Norwich Civic Association and a resident for 36 years. The decision to allow a McDonald's will destroy luncheonettes and delis, she said, adding that approving a drive-in window would worsen traffic and pollution from idling cars.
 
'Another Jericho Turnpike'
 "The Town Board acted against the best interests of the local community," she said. "I am concerned that Pine Hollow Road will eventually deteriorate to another Jericho Turnpike."
There are many empty stores, from businesses that have closed, said Bob Basta, a resident. "If we make the town more convenient with a McDonald's, maybe we can bring business into the town," he said.
"It's interesting that in these hard economic times the company feels strong enough about our village, which is off the beaten track, to want to open up here. The Sleepy Hollow aura of Oyster Bay and its history make it a unique village and have kept it, even in hard times, from falling apart."
The sleepiness of the hamlet is often a draw for homeowners, said Vera Wiedenhaefer, a resident and a real-estate agent for Daniel Gale Associates. Victorian houses, she said, sell for an average of $350,000. Even during the hardest hit market, houses sell, she said, adding that there are 36 homes on multiple listings in the hamlet, a small number in comparison with nearby communities.
Built around the waterfront, Oyster Bay is different from most other shore communities on the Island. There are no restaurants on the water, and most of the waterfront development is industrial.
 
A Waterfront Flavor
 Yet the flavor is still of a waterfront community, Ms. Wiedenhaefer said, adding that most people move to the hamlet because they want to be near the water and boats.
Fear of overdevelopment in the hamlet and concerns about water quality in the harbor are not new. For years opposition has been growing to a proposal to convert seven acres of waterfront land, including the Jakobson Shipyard and an adjacent parcel, into a condominium complex, with a full-service marina and boat-repair center.
In response to opposition, Oyster Bay imposed a moratorium on waterfront building and authorized environmental studies. This year the town rejected the plan for development and decided to purchase the land for open space, said a spokeswoman for the town, Phyllis Barry.
The commitment from the town has just been verbal, said Ralph Naranjo, executive director of Friends of the Bay. The 4,000-member organization was instrumental in blocking the project. The group is primarily concerned about water quality.
Mr. Naranjo said a preliminary study showed that marina development and associated problems were not compatible with the harbor. The results of a final study of the effects are expected next month, he said.
 
Master Plan Is Sought
 "We hope that once it is complete, the town will adopt a zoning master plan," Mr. Naranjo said. "The Federal Government has committed to help subsidize a marine-education center, which we would welcome on this site. In the village, we're now seeing the eradication of the old and the intrusion of the new. We are not opposed to change, but want to see a better plan, so that there are not disastrous effects on the water quality."
If development is not conducted properly, the water in the bay will be degraded, and the oyster business will be destroyed, said Frank Flower, a descendant of a family running a 100-year-old oyster company, Frank Flower & Sons Inc., the last family owned oyster operation on the Island.
Oyster Bay and Cold Spring Harbor are the last Long Island bays open to shellfishing.
The hamlet's historical richness is evident in its buildings and its people.
Best known for Sagamore Hill, Oyster Bay is also the home of Raynam Hall, a colonial salt-box structure dating from the Revolution, when it was a Loyalist headquarters.
 
Early Telephone Switchboard
 The first Presbyterian Church on East Main Street, a Stick-style church built in 1873, is on the National Register of Landmarks.
The Town has designated landmarks like Snouder's corner drugstore, where the first telephone switchboard in Oyster Bay was installed in 1887 and where Roosevelt received his phone messages. Others are the Wightman House, built in 1720; the Masonic Temple, built as the Oyster Bay Inn in 1902, and the Printery, the original home of The Oyster Bay Guardian, founded in 1899.
Among the hamlet's population of 7,500 are many third- and fourth-generation families who continue to live and work in the village.
Oyster Bay is a multigenerational community, and people want to keep it that way, said Barbara Hadel, a longtime resident.
"I'd say that more than half of the residents work in town, and many walk to work and go home for lunch," she said. "There are many homes in which the same families have lived for several generations, and there are many kids in the high school whose parents and grandparents went through the schools. It's the old and new mixed together that makes the village unique."
 
Schools Also Feel Change
 But the inevitability of change has recently been felt even by the small Oyster Bay-East Norwich School District. Last month Superintendent Sidney Freund announced that he would move to the Herricks School District by the end of the school year.
Planning for reorganizing the district to eliminate overcrowding also divides the community. A school board proposal to expand the middle school in two phases at a cost of $2.8 million was voted down on Jan. 30, after which the board approved a modified plan with no extra cost for taxpayers.
The community is still divided on the issue, the president of the board, John Specce, said. One side wants to move the seventh and eighth grades to the high school. He said that based on demographic studies the board felt that would be shortsighted and was looking at long-range planning.
"Oyster Bay is a unique community that tries to hold on to its past," Mr. Specce said. "Each time change is seen in this town, there's an uproar before it's finally accepted. But change is inevitable. We can't bring back the horse and buggy. We must carefully plan for change and bring the 20th century into this village."

HEADLINE: FILM;
How the 'Homeboys' Got That Way

BYLINE: By CHARLES SALZBERG; Charles Salzberg has written about film for Elle and Moviegoer.

 BODY:
It's early spring, six months after principal photography has been completed on "Hangin' With the Homeboys," and the director/screenwriter, Joe Vasquez, is back in the South Bronx neighborhood where he grew up and where most of his film was shot.
"The neighborhood has changed a lot in the past several years," he says, as he walks the familiar streets, the air punctuated by salsa music blaring from storefronts. "Drugs. Especially crack. I think what happened was a lot of people said, 'Hey, another drug you smoke, so it can't be that bad.' There's this girl I grew up with. Everybody was always saying, 'Oh, Zenobia, is so beautiful, man.' Now you can buy Zenobia for $5 dollars." 
 "Hangin' With the Homeboys," which opens in New York City on Friday, is the third film by the 28-year-old Jospeh B. Vasquez. Made on a modest budget of $2 million, it is a gentle, autobiographical film that chronicles the adventures of four young men -- two black, two hispanic -- from the Mott Haven section of the Bronx -- on a typical Friday night as they cruise the neighborhood. They get tossed out of a party, are nearly arrested for turnstile jumping, wreck their car and sneak into a disco.
 Along the way, their friendship is tested, as they confront the issue of race and the direction their lives will take. In the tradition of "Breaking Away" and "Diner," "Hangin' With the Homeboys" is an episodic male-bonding film with a difference. It's about minorities, although, as Mr. Vasqueza, whose father was Hispanic and mother black, points out: "It could have been about anybody. What I wanted to say by making them black and Hispanic is that you expect certain things of us that are sometimes negative, but it doesn't have to be that way."
 The events were based on a compilation of some of the wildest nights he and his own "homeboys" had, says Mr. Vasquez, who shared best screenwriter award (with Hal Hartley for "Trust") this year at the Sundance Film Festival. "The four guys are really me at different stages of my life."
 As Mr. Vasquez walks through his old neighborhood, he talks about how the four characters developed from a blending of the real-life indicidents, his own evolving persona and push-and-pull discussions between him and the actors during filming. Later, in talking to the actors themselves, there emerges a clearer portrait of how the four homeboys came to life on screen.
 
Johnny
The Quiet One, the Innocent One
 "When I was 17 or 18, I was a Johnny," Mr. Vasquez explains. "Very innocent, scared of girls."
 Johnny is quiet, introspective, the one most likely to make it out of the ghetto by going to college. Yet he is conflicted. Shy, paralyzed by his incredible naivete, he works in a supermarket while struggling with his aspirations.
 "Joe has a definite idea of who my caracter was," says John Leguizamo, as he strectches out in a chair in his tiny, one-room Manhattan apartment only a few blocks from the American Palace Theater, where he performs his highly praised one-man show, "Mambo Mouth." I wanted to make him more hip-hop, Red Zone, with big, baggy jeans and bright shirts. If I'd been able to play Johnny the way I wanted, he would've been seriously smoking. I had all the moves down. But Joe wanted him to be more Everyman Hispanic Kid."
 Johnny's innocence puzzled Mr. Leguizamo, who grew up in the Jackson Heights section of Queens. "I has a hard time because I was dating when I was 13, I used to say 'Joe, nobody's this naive.' And he'd go, 'You wannt bet?' "
 "It's embarassing," Mr. Vasquez says, reflecting on the conversation with Mr. Leguizamo months earlier on the set. Passing a carnival set up in a vacant lot, he tries to explain the forces that retarded his own social development. "I was really screwed up by Catholicism by my grandmother. John Leguizamo's the same way. One day, we were on the set of what was supposed to be his apartment. We'd built a little altar for his mother, thinking she'd be into religion, and I saw John flicking his finger at a picture of Jesus. I said, 'You too, huh?' "
 Mr. Lequizamo recalls: "Yeah, I remember that. My grandmother was a religious fanatic. Everything was the devil and God. Those were the only two forces she would listen to. There was nothing in between. Not even CNN. When I saw the 'The Exorcist,' I thought it was a documentary. You grow up thinking, 'God, I want to be so good.' And whenever you do something bad, you think, 'Oh, the devil is in me.' And then you rebel and you don't want to be thinking that way. You hate all that 3-D and velvet Jesus stuff. But later, you find you need something spiritual, something to hope for. Johnny's in that first stage. He wants to be so good, so kind, so gentle. Johnny the saint. He hasn't rebelled yet, but he will when he gets to college.
For Mr. Vasquez, this struggle with Catholicism resulted in a good deal of anger, which found its way into his earlier films, "Street Story" (1988) and "Bronx Wars" (1989), which made the rounds of film festivals but received no commercial release.
"I'm not always conscious of it," he says, "but it's there. In 'Homeboys,' I thought I'd completely left religion out of it, but then I saw the early screenings of a scene in the supermarket with Johnny and this girl he likes and there she is reaching for an apple. I said, 'Man, that's Adam and Eve.' " He shakes his head. "I guess I can't help it. It's so deep-rooted in me."
 
Willie
Confused, Heading Nowhere
 In a prologue scene, Willie is sitting in a welfare office confronted
by a black woman welfare worker berating him for not attending his job-training programs. She threatens to take away his welfare check.
Looking crazed and angry, Willie sputters, "You're just doing this to me because I'm black."
This was Joe Vasquez in his second phase.
"After college, I was trying to get work in the industry," he explains. "I couldn't get in the front door and I'd say, "This is because I'm a Puerto Rican guy. That was always my reason for everything. Sometimes I was right, but sometimes I was wrong."
Doug E. Doug, a 20-year-old standup comedian from the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn who plays the role, says: "I thought I knew what was Willie was all about when I read the script. But Joe's interpretation was a little different from mine. He viewed Willie as being angry at the world and not wanting to do anything about it. I told Joe, 'I been a Willie. I've seen a trillion Willies, and it's not the fact that they don't want to do something; it's more like they need something to inspire them. I thought Willie was not that far gone, and Joe saw him as almost hopeless. We came in at someplace in the middle."
What Mr. Doug brings to Willie, who is confused, unemployed and totally without direction, is a sense of irony, an ambiguity which results in the suspicion that to some extent he uses his anger to manipulate people. "He uses that 'You're just doing this to me because I'm black stuff,' almost like a line in a bar to a girl," explains Mr. Doug, who, unlike Willie, has a ready smile and has made a living performing in comedy clubs starting when he was a student at St. John's University. He has also appeared in Spike Lee's 1990 film "Mo Better Blues."
"Willie might be a lot angrier in a Spike Lee movie," admits Mr. Vasquez, "because Spike would probably find my Willie a little insulting. I can see myself getting a call from Spike about this saying, 'What are you trying to say about our people ?' What I'm trying to say is you can use anything as a crutch, if you want to. Sure, there are some moments when it's justified, but not always. That's why I made the woman in the welfare office black, because if I made her white, people might say, 'Oh, yeah, he's got a point.' The thing is, in this instance, he doesn't have a point."
 
Tom
The Normal One, the Shallow One
 Tom, played by the 29-year-old stand-up comedian Mario Joyner, Tom is the most normal and probably the shallowest of the four homeboys. An aspiring actor, he makes his living trying to sell magazine by telephone. His claim to fame is that he would have played a waiter in "Rain Man," if the part hadn't been cut. He owns the car, allowing the homeboys mobility.
"The Tom character is me when I started getting settled," explains Mr. Vasquez. "I had a job as a film editor and a steady girl friend. Tom is the one I see out of the four of them as being most normal. He's got the girlfriend, the car, the 9 to 5 job, and the goal he's going after."
 
Vinnie
Faux Italian, He's Just a Gigolo
 Vinnie is a gigolo. His given name is Fernando, but he insists everyone call him Vinnie, so he can be mistaken for being Italian, which he thinks will make him more desirable to women. At 26, he's the oldest of the group and, as Mr. Vasquez describes him, he's the type who, "when he's 50, with a belly out to here, playing dominoes on a street corner, will still be hanging out with guys twenty years younger than he is."
"The Italian thing came from the guys I used to hang out with. They called me Vinnie, because I got into this fashion where I wore my hair slicked back. They accused me of trying to be Italian. It wasn't that I had an identity crisis; it's just they thought I did."
Mr. Vasquez, who is also an actor, originally planned to take the role of Vinnie himself, but he was eventually convinced the the film would be better served if he concentrated on directing. As a result, Vinnie is played by the 35-year-old Nestor Serrano, who has appeared opposite Robert DeNiro in the Broadway play "Cuba and His Teddy Bear," as well as in the films "Lethal Weapon 2" and The Money Pit." "I knew that character," says Mr. Serrano. "Those were the guys I hated. They were obnoxious and thought they were better than anyone else."
As it turned out, Mr. Serrano was so strong in his characterization that he was overpowering the rest of the ensemble. "He qas bugging me out," said Mr. Doug. "When I first saw hem, I said to myself, 'This is not a Vinnie.' But when I saw him act, I said, 'Oh, my God, you couldn't have picked a better Vinnie.
 To maintain the balance of the ensemble, the role was trimmed during editing. "I knew that would happen," says Mr. Vasquez, "because I was biased, since Vinnie was going to be played by me and because that whoring phase was the one I'd most recently been through."
As to what phase of his life Mr. Vasquez is in now, audiences will have to guess, since in his next project, "The Writing on the Wall," he will be working from someone else's script. Nevertheless, chances are it will still turn out to be a singularly personal film.
 
 
 
HAZARDS OF THE TRADE
 Filming "Hangin' With the Homeboys" late at night in the South Bronx was an adventure that included the mugging of several crew members and the occasional sound of gunfire. "They must have said, 'Let's get the 50 worst locations in one city and put them in a film,' " says Doug E. Doug. The area around Willis Avenue and 138th Street in Mott Haven was so bad that Nestor Serrano, who, like Joe Vasquez, was brought up in the Bronx, said to the director: "I can act like we're in the ghetto; I don't have to be in the ghetto."
One step that Richard Brick, the producer, took to minimize potential problems was to hire local residents as trouble spotters. "We had people who could tell from 100 meters away if someone was on crack, simply by their body language," he said.
Unlike his fellow actors, John Leguizamo appreciated shooting on location. "It's always nice to be in the real place, because even when you're not aware of it, while you're hanging around waiting for your scene, you pick up a lot of stuff," he says. "The neighborhood feeds you. You see people passing by and talking, and it's real and it sinks in."
Some of the film takes place in a car that was towed through the streets so slowly that local residents could run alongside. "They would sometimes throw things, or yell things at us," says Mr. Doug. "Everybody associated everybody with something else. Like they'd go, 'Oh, Mario Joyner, MTV guy.' For me they'd go, 'Oh, comedy guy.' Others would ask, 'Who's in the movie?' We'd say, 'Just us.' They'd say, 'Is Eddie Murphy in the movie?' We'd say, 'No.' They'd say, 'Then you're not in a movie.' "

HEADLINE: Brazil Denial On Currency

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, May 19

 BODY:
The Economy Minister of Brazil, Marcilio Marques Moreira, has denied rumors that Latin America's biggest economy would imitate Argentina's latest anti-inflation plan and link its currency to the United States dollar.
"In Brazil no type of dollarization scheme is being considered," Mr. Moreira said at a news conference after meeting with his Argentine counterpart, Domingo Cavallo. 
 Mr. Cavallo's sudden arrival in Rio de Janeiro for a meeting with Mr. Moreira led to speculation in the local press that Brazil might be considering its own version of Argentina's anti-inflation measures, which began March 20.
Before the meeting, Mr. Cavallo said, "It will be interesting for us and the Brazilian team to exchange ideas on some specific aspects of our respective economic management." He refused to speculate on whether linking Brazil's currency to the dollar would work.
Under "dollarization," a government guarantees the local currency's value against the dollar at a fixed rate. The aim is to halt inflation and restore confidence in local currencies ravaged by galloping prices.
Like Argentina, Brazil in recent years has suffered repeated bouts of extremely high inflation, each followed by a drastic economic shock plan that has not had long-term success.

HEADLINE: Darman Sees Signs of Revival

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
President Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, said today that the economy was starting to recover from the recession, but that he could not predict how strong or how long the recovery would be.
"We are coming out of the recession," Mr. Darman said in an interview on the NBC News program "Meet the Press." 
 He predicted that the Federal budget deficit would ease slightly for the coming fiscal year, to less than $300 billion, but not enough below the earlier estimate of $318 billion to allow any increase in Government spending.
"We are exactly on course with our own forecast," Mr. Darman said. "We said it would be turning in this quarter; it is turning in this quarter."
After 10 months of contraction, the economy has begun to show signs of recovery, but analysts say they expect to see mixed signals from housing, industry, construction and employment figures for the next few months.
Mr. Darman's views echoed those of Michael Boskin, the White House's chief economic adviser, and Treasury Under Secretary David Mulford, who told Congress last week that the economy was turning around.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Upward Pressure Seen for Rates

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Wall Street, still struggling to digest a record $37 billion worth of securities sold at the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions this month, is about to be served another heaping pile of paper.
This week, in what some analysts have called a shadow refunding, the Treasury will sell $37.5 billion worth of securities. Analysts said the auctions would probably put upward pressure on short-term interest rates. 
 An important reason these rates may rise is that the Treasury needs to drum up much more demand for the securities to be auctioned this week than it did earlier this month.
 
$27.5 Billion in New Cash
 The refunding auctions raised $19.5 billion in new cash. The securities to be sold this week, which include new two-year and five-year notes and $16 billion of cash management bills that have a one-year maturity, will raise $27.5 billion in new cash.
"These auctions may appeal to a variety of financial institutions, both domestic and foreign, as well as to investors seeking shelter from a nervous bond market," Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers, wrote in the firm's weekly Comments on Credit. "However, the market may need much more help in the form of favorable economic news to absorb this new rush of supply."
That sort of news is unlikely to emerge this week, as few substantive reports on the economy are expected.
 
Spread Likely to Flatten
 With the Federal Reserve's target for the overnight Federal funds rate anchored at 5 7/8 percent, short-term rates are not likely to head up sharply, analysts said. But the difference, or spread, between rates on two-year notes and 30-year bonds is likely to flatten from what has been the widest gap in years. At the end of last week the spread between two-year notes and 30-year bonds stood at 1.45 percentage points.
After this week's auctions, "I would bet that the spread would drop to 135 basis points," said Steven Slifer, a senior vice president and financial market economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. "The supply problem will continue to be a focus for the market." A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In addition to the Treasury auctions, the State of Massachusetts, troubled by the recession, is expected to tap the municipal bond market this week. In its first offering since Gov. William F. Weld took office, Massachusetts, which has the lowest debt rating of any state, will offer investors $475 million worth of securities.
 
Test of Confidence
 The offering will be a test of investor confidence in the Governor's recently proposed budget for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1.
To help close a budget gap that may reach $2 billion, Mr. Weld has proposed more than $800 million in spending cuts. Property tax increases are almost certain to follow, analysts said.
The stern measures will not be unique to Massachusetts, and are an important reason economists say that an economic recovery, when it finally arrives, will be muted.
"State and local governments were an engine of growth in the 1980's, but I expect they will be a drag on the recovery," said Cynthia Latta, senior financial economist at Data Resources Inc., an economic forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass.
With some 15 million employees, state and local government spending accounts for slightly more than 10 percent of gross national product.
In California, where the new Governor, Pete Wilson, has recently proposed a sales tax that would halve a projected $13 billion deficit, "our growth rate is going to be less than half what it was in the prior three years," said Jerry L. Jordan, a senior vice president at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "That is a very substantial decline. And it is the best we are going to do."
Aside from cutting spending, layoffs will probably be widespread. And the effects of the layoffs are just beginning. For the first time in many months, employment at state and local governments declined in April,as some 18,000 people lost their jobs.
 
Crisis Called Severe
 "This is probably the most severe state and local government crisis since the Depression," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence Inc. "Operating-budget deficits in the early 1980's were nowhere near as severe as they are now."
The good news for cash-strapped borrowers is that demand for tax-exempt securities remains very strong.
Underwriters at the First Boston Corporation, which is acting as lead manager for the negotiated sale of the Massachusetts bonds, would not speculate on what level of interest rates it would take to sell the new securities. At the end of last week, however, yields on outstanding Massachusetts bonds stood at 7.75 percent. The outstanding bonds carry ratings of Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: Exams in Other Nations Studied in U.S. for Ideas

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
In France, students must write a four-hour essay on what it means to be free. Germany's national test asks the significance of the French Revolution. Japan's examination demands that high school students hoping to make it into college identify the astronomer Ptolemy and Voltaire.
A month after President Bush called for a voluntary national test to improve American education, the National Endowment for the Humanities has entered a national debate with a report, "National Tests: What Other Countries Expect Their Students to Know," which compares the examinations given in other Western countries. The study, made public yesterday, raises an increasingly urgent question: what can America learn from its competitors, and what should it shun? 
 In many other countries, national tests are used to select the elite that goes on to a university education and high-paying, high status jobs. Americans say they do not want that kind of test, leading to questions about what an American national test should be. What kind of test should be given? Who should decide the contents? What should the stakes be? How could a test raise standards while preserving the American ideals of democracy and opportunity for all?
 
Learning From Others
 A host of competing interest groups, from politicians to educators, are vying to answer these questions. Lynne V. Cheney, the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, argues in the report that other countries' experiences provide some clues.
Americans can learn from these nations' high educational standards, the challenging questions on their tests and the explicit connection between what students study in school and what they will be tested on, Ms. Cheney said.
The closest American version of a national test, the Scholastic Aptitude Test, or S.A.T., deliberately avoids testing specific knowledge, so that schools can adopt their own curriculums. Because it does not test what students have learned, the S.A.T. is not comparable to other countries' national tests.
But an American national test would also have to be considerably different from European or Japanese models, say Ms. Cheney and others who endorse a national test.
 
Molding Test to U.S.
 "As we progress through this, people interested in education need to watch very closely to be sure the test we get reflects the country we are," she said.
While in Europe and Japan, most national tests are taken by a college- bound elite, President Bush has called for tests and high standards to be applied to every student, in 4th, 8th, and 12th grades. Such tests, his advisers argued, would show students why they need to study, enforce higher educational standards and help parents evaluate schools.
Europe and Japan use their tests to sort out students, allowing the successful few to move on to college and relegating the less successful to lower-paying, lower-prestige jobs. But an American test should be used to find and help those children who are not doing well, backers of the idea argue.
"What's tragic now is that these people are stuck with $4-an-hour jobs at McDonald's for the rest of their lives, and we're not admitting it," said Thomas H. Kean, the former Governor of New Jersey who is president of Drew University and heads Educate America, Inc., an organization that calls for a national test. "If we identify these people, we have some chance of saving people."
 
Ambition and Depth
 The most important lesson America can learn from other countries' examinations, according to the Cheney report and other testing experts, is their ambition and intellectual depth.
The French baccalaureat examination, for example, determines whether students can advance to college. The tests in history and geography offer detailed chronologies, maps, graphs, flow charts, political cartoons and excerpts from speeches, and ask students to use the materials in essays on subjects like resistance to the Nazis in Europe, debt in developing countries and the value of space in China.
Perhaps the closest parallel to the proposed American national examination among the examples offered in the report is the General Certificate of Secondary Education test given to most 16-year-olds in England and Wales. Low grades on this examination mean students will not be able to continue with advanced studies leading to college entrance.
Using such materials as historical drawings, lists of exports, population charts and excerpts from textbooks, students must be able to write essays that balance contradictory or opinionated historical sources. The topics include British colonization, the economic impact of enclosure (when fields once regarded as common lands were fenced off), social order in Tudor England and 16th-century education in Britain.
The only comparable American test that asks these kinds of sophisticated, open-ended questions is the Advanced Placement test, which can lead to students' receiving college credit. But that test is taken by only about 7 percent of American students, Ms. Cheney said. The achievement tests given by the Educational Testing Service do test what students have learned, but they also use multiple choice questions.
While the National Endowment for the Humanities report included only history, geography, philosophy and literature tests, similar kinds of open-ended questions are included on mathematics and science tests in many other countries.
"The European exam systems have a lot of the features we're looking for," said Lauren B. Resnick, director of the Learning Research and Development Center of the University of Pittsburgh. "They have extended, complicated kinds of tasks that students perform. In many of these countries, the day after the tests, the questions show up in the newspapers and are discussed on television. There is a whole culture that shapes the public's understanding of what the standards are."
In her report, Ms. Cheney also drew another lesson from other countries: a national examination system does not have to mean that every student takes the same test. In England, France and Germany, for example, different regions or states offer different examinations, which are checked to make sure they are equally difficult and are graded according to a single standard.
The National Governors' Association, one of several groups working to spell out how to meet President Bush's education goals, has called for a series of regional exams, with scores adjusted so that students could rank themselves nationally. Ms. Resnick said she was working on several ways to do that. But Gregory R. Anrig, president of the Educational Testing Service, which developed the S.A.T., the Advanced Placement and the Achievement tests, warned that would be an expensive and difficult undertaking.
Other experts said the examples in the report also showed what Americans should not imitate. Japan's entrance examination, for example, is fiendishly difficult and requires memorization of arcane facts in a numbing multiple-choice format.
"What we're going to be building is a uniquely American system," Dr. Resnick said. The United States' cultural diversity and the need to give tests to everybody mean that an American test would have to include more varied questions geared to several age levels, she said.
 
A Question of Cost
 The format of any national examination is just one of several unknowns about President Bush's proposal. Although more detailed announcements are expected in the next few weeks, it is not clear who would decide the contents of a test, how long a good test would take to develop, and how much it would cost.
Many educators, among them Joe Nathan of the University of Minnesota, remain worried that a national test, even if drawn up by different regions, could impose curriculums and inhibit teachers' creativity and responsiveness to their students' interests. In France, Japan, and England, for example, national education ministries do set curriculums.
The National Endowment report does not say how much it costs to develop and administer the tests in other countries, and statistics are hard to come by. A press officer at England's Department of Education said she had no national figure because tests are drawn up by different regional examining boards. But it is clear that tests with essay questions are expensive.
The S.A.T. now costs $16 per student, and the Advanced Placement exam costs $65 per student, Mr. Anrig said. A preliminary estimate places the cost of England's General Certificate of Secondary Education exam at $110 per student, according to the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment.

HEADLINE: New Shopping Center Opens in South Bronx

BYLINE: By LEE A. DANIELS

 BODY:
Concourse Plaza, a $150 million shopping center just off the Grand Concourse in the South Bronx that has come to symbolize the area's quest for economic well-being, opened for business yesterday with overflow crowds thronging its stores but with the shadow of the city's fiscal problems hanging over it.
The opening seemed to underscore subtly the dismay Bronx officials feel at the possibility that New York City's fiscal troubles may severely undermine other facets of their broader boroughwide development plan. 
 That plan seeks to tie various housing, commercial and city-government construction projects into a minutely coordinated whole. Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, has made its fruition the major test of his term in office.
But the city's fiscal crisis has dealt those plans a series of setbacks recently. A new $200 million Police Academy, that was to have been built on 153d Street, east of the Grand Concourse, has been shelved for the time being. Instead, the city will renovate the present Police Academy near Gramercy Park in Manhattan.
 
'Welcome to the New Bronx'
 And financing for an expansion of the Bronx Museum of the Arts, which is also part of the plan to lace significant development from one end of the Bronx to the other, may also be in jeopardy.
Such uncertainty prompted Mr. Ferrer to remark to an outburst of applause from the audience that while Concourse Plaza "means jobs and a furthering of the economic development of our community, we're not going to stop."
"We're still going to fight for the Police Academy," he added.
"Welcome to the new Bronx," Mr. Ferrer declared to the scores of people who watched the brief opening ceremonies in the center's parking lot. "Yes, this, too, is in the South Bronx."
The 10-acre development on 161st Street just east of the Grand Concourse includes a 60,000-square-foot Waldbaum's supermarket that will be open 24 hours, a 10-screen cinema, 40 retail shops, and a 3,300-car garage. Construction will begin on the center's final piece, a 10-story office building, next month, Bronx officials said.
 
Relatively Moderate Prices
 Bronx residents and officials have long complained that they lacked a huge supermarket that could accommodate large crowds -- and bring the relatively moderate prices and fresher produce that chain stores could offer.
Scarlet Pellecer, a senior at Bronx Comprehensive High School and a part-time cashier at the Waldbaum's, said that the line of customers for the store had already formed when she arrived for work at 7:30 A.M. The line to enter the supermarket stretched nearly 70 yards.
That line enabled Bernard Rosenshein, whose New Rochelle, N.Y.-based firm, Rosenshein Associates, developed the shopping park, to pose and answer the oratorical question of whether such a development could work in the South Bronx.
"There's your answer," he said, beaming. "The jury's in."
Stanley Lang, president of Waldbaum's, said studies showing that 1.5 million people live within a two-mile radius of the site convinced them that the project could work.
 
'Just Like Everyone Else'
 "When we found that out, we knew there was no risk," Mr. Lang said. "The people of the Bronx are just like everyone else. They want good food and good service. We've seen before that when you bring something to the community, they'll turn out for you."
Jose Caban, a maintenance worker at the Bronxchester Houses, was one of those who did, arriving at the Waldbaum's line in the late morning. The line was so long that Mr. Caban and his friends decided to wait until the evening to go shopping. But he was far from upset as he browsed through the rest of the center.
"This is the best thing that ever happened to the South Bronx," Mr. Caban, 33 years old, said, holding 3-year-old Melissa Sergera, the daughter of a friend. "A big supermarket like this will help people save because you can take advantage of coupons and sales. There's the movies and parking, and lots of security, too. This is a place you can bring the family."
That Concourse Plaza was built solely by private funds, and that Mr. Rosenshein and James Hyland, Waldbaum's executive vice president had grown up in the Bronx, as he had, seemed to be a particular point of pride to Mr. Ferrer.
"They said it couldn't be done," he said with a smile before snipping the ceremonial ribbon to the development. "Some said it shouldn't be done, But it's here and it's all ours."

HEADLINE: AUSTIN JOURNAL;
Ham's Kissing Cousin Gets a Hug

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Minn., May 18

 BODY:
Geo. A. Hormel & Com pany threw itself one humdinger of a 100th birthday party today. There was a hot-air balloon, rock music and more cans of Spam, the company's most famous product, than seemed remotely digestible.
It was a day to celebrate how George Hormel, a German immigrant, chanced upon southern Minnesota's "cool blue skies," and stayed to found a meat-packing empire whose sales last year topped $2.6 billion. Along the way, the company claims to have invented Canadian bacon, marketed the first canned ham and sent 200 million pigs to hog heaven. 
 Chilly, windy weather eroded the expected turnout of 5,000 people. But it did nothing to spoil the fun of the hundreds on hand.
For Hormel, it was most of all a day to sing the praises of Spam, albeit just one of the company's 1,600 products. There were Spam breakfasts, a Spam eating contest, Spam sculptures and a pageant to choose the children who would reign as king and queen of Spam. Prowling tirelessly about was Spam Man, dressed to resemble a can of you-know-what.
The self-portrait clearly intended to emerge from this "Spam Jamboree Day" was of a company robustly back on track after labor battles that peaked in early 1986 when the Governor called in the National Guard. Name-calling, vandalism and violence marked the 13-month battle, which ended with hundreds of union workers losing their jobs.
There remains bitterness against the company long known for its benevolence, as reflected by its 1938 initiation of one of the nation's earliest profit-sharing plans. The worst acrimony, though, was between friends and relatives who diverged on whether to cross the picket line.
Some say the passions are cooling. "Everyone is coming around and looking up," said Cheryl Cook, who works in Hormel's consumer affairs department. "It's a healing process."
Others disagree. "It's like toasting the executioner, the guy who pulls the lever," said Pete Winkles, who is business agent for Local P-9 of the United Food and Commercial Workers union.
And some see deeper motives. "They're trying to control how people remember history," said Peter Rachleff, a labor historian at Macalester College in St. Paul.
Since before it employed George Burns, Gracie Allen and a pig named Spammy to star in radio commercials, Hormel has been aggressively promotional. It seems never to tire of disseminating Spam lore -- from its much-maligned role in feeding troops to the boggling statistic that Americans down 3.8 seven-ounce cans of the stuff a second.
The company even revels in the abuse heaped on Spam, calling it "the Rodney Dangerfield of the food world." Hormel recalls the old Army line that Spam is ham that couldn't pass its physical. Spam, short for spiced ham, is made from chopped pork shoulder meat and ham.
Today's events evoked a sort of America one associates with country fairs. Instead of pie contests, people were invited to concoct original creations from Spam. There was Spam fried rice, Spam wild rice casserole, and much more.
After the judging, people lined up to heap plates with samples of the Spam masterpieces. Some then wandered over to watch people making sculptures from Spam, including fair likenesses of Rodin's "The Thinker."
The contest to be Spam King and Queen, limited to those 5 to 8 years old, was to die for. David, 6, was asked when he last had Spam. "I can't remember," he said. The announcer pressed on: "Was it a short time or a long time?" The reply: "A long time." Ashley, shivering in a pink leotard and a pig snout, was asked how much Spam she could eat at one time. "A spoonful," she said.
Justin, 8, was chosen king, perhaps because he said he would eat 10 million cans if given the opportunity and wouldn't share with anybody.
The eating contest was most frenetic. Contestants raced to see who could most rapidly consume a can of Spam and glass of water. Some picked up the entire pink block and ate it like a candy bar, and others nipped like terriers.
The winner, with a time of 56.71 seconds, was Steve Kirschenman. Mr. Kirschenman attributed his victory to his mother, but did not explain.
It is doubtful Hormel's birthday party changed much of anything. Those who led the strike are still bitter. "They're trying so hard to make this thing go away, and it won't go away," declared Jim Retterath, a former Hormel worker and union officer who now does maintenance work in a nursing home.
Others cited Hormel's big contribution to the economy and charities of Austin, a town of 23,000. "It's a blessed community, all the way," said Gordon S. Anderson, who owns a contracting company.

HEADLINE: Americans Find Royal Visit Moving Some to Adulation, Others to Outrage

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, May 19

 BODY:
Americans see Queen Elizabeth II as an anachronism, a touchstone of history or the epitome of all this democratic nation's most cherished fantasies of royalty. As she and her husband make their stately way through a 13-day visit to the United States, they are evoking reactions from adulation to outrage, amusement to befuddlement.
The famous breach of protocol in Washington, in which an enthusiastic woman wrapped her arms around the Queen in a spontaneous hug on Wednesday, was a tangible demonstration of many Americans' fascination with the British monarchy. So are the huge sales of supermarket tabloids and popular magazines filled with tidbits about the royal family. 
During the Queen's 12-hour visit to Miami this weekend, the local NBC-TV affiliate offered continuous coverage and a special telephone line, in English and Spanish, to tell callers the best places to spot the Queen. And many people treated the royal visitor and her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, with a reverence they would be unlikely to show almost any American.
 
'Various Stages of Grovel'
 "It has been hilarious watching social Miami, in various stages of grovel, trying to figure out how to act in front of this short lady who never says anything," said Dave Barry, The Miami Herald humor columnist.
But others have found the pomp and circumstance distasteful, an extravagance unbecoming in hard economic times. "The Queen is such an anachronism," said Trudy Harris, a retired librarian from Willingboro, N.J., who was visiting her daughter here. "The U.S. shouldn't pay that kind of money for such a grand reception and tour. It's not healthy thinking in our time to be spending our energies on this cardboard figure."
The Queen is not cardboard, but neither is she a movie star who climbed her way to opulence and privilege. Nor is she a saintly humanist like Mother Teresa. The Queen exists on a plane few others inhabit. The mixed reactions of Americans, from blue-collar baseball fans in Baltimore to socialites from Highland Park in Dallas, reflect that rare reality.
Amitai Etzioni, a sociologist at George Washington University, sees a distinction between Americans' interest in the Queen and their interest in younger figures -- not only celebrities like Madonna and Michael Jackson, but even other members of the royal family.
"The latter are part of the youth culture, of risque behavior," said Professor Etzioni. "The Queen has her own pedestal. We used to see this in our Presidency, but we've always been ambivalent about treating our Presidents with too much awe. They are, after all, politicians.
"But the Queen, she's above politics. She's not anti-abortion or anti-anything. She's a symbol rather than a person. We can all project on her our own values and views. There is no controversy with her."
To be sure, not everyone along the Queen's journey has felt that way. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts, and several other Congressional colleagues boycotted her historic first speech to Congress on Friday "in protest to the British occupation in Northern Ireland," Mr. Kennedy said. Irish-Americans protested her visit in Baltimore and Washington.
Here in Miami, a group of blacks and whites gathered on the sidewalk in front of the Hotel Intercontinental, a short distance from where the royal yacht Britannia was moored, to protest the city's welcome for the Queen. The protest was organized by Boycott Miami, a black group that lobbies against Miami as a convention site until more blacks are included in the tourist industry.
 
Examples of Democracy
 Leibole Muchnik, a Honduran Jew who recently immigrated to the United States from Tegucigalpa, operates a hot-dog stand near the hotel. For him, the combination of American fascination and protest over the Queen's visit to Miami epitomized what had brought him to this country.
"To me this is democracy," said Mr. Muchnik, who was doing a brisk business in both hot dogs and interviews. "Over here, you've got protesters against the Queen. Over there, you've got people who love her. Me, I've got business from both."
Richard Green, a seafood supplier, said the Queen's visit was "nice."
"It represents a bygone era, part of history that wasn't torn down," he said.
At Booker T. Washington, a school that the Queen visited here, the royal visit was a rare opportunity for Luz Rivera, a seventh grader, to curtsy, although the gesture is not required of Americans. It was, she said, an occasion to "walk straight, sit down properly and talk properly."
Friday evening, over by the Port of Miami's Terminal 12 where the royal yacht Britannia was anchored, Maria Fuentes Howard and her husband, Henry Howard, stood several hours with their baby, Alexander Joseph, hoping for a glimpse of the Queen and of former President Ronald Reagan, who was one of her dinner guests. The Howards' baby's carriage sported a British flag.
"We like the Queen," said Mrs. Howard. "And I wanted to see President Reagan because I'm originally from Nicaragua and he supported our fight for democracy."
For Janet Bryant of Washington, however, the Queen's visit to the capital was one big inconvenience.
"I only thought about her when it was time to go home since I have to go up Pennsylvania Avenue and it was always blocked off," said Mrs. Bryant, who is an office manager for a law firm. "For two or three days it was just madness. I don't see the point. She doesn't pay taxes. Her children don't work. She doesn't lift a finger to do much of anything."
In Tampa, where the the Queen is to arrive on her yacht on Monday morning for a two-and-a-half-hour visit that will include a meeting with Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, invitations to royal events are much sought after. "People who are business or corporate types who usually don't get ruffled, when it comes to the Queen, they lose it," said John Dunn, a spokesman for Mayor Sandra W. Freedman. "People who ordinarily wouldn't stoop so low to call in chits are doing it to see the Queen."
Is it a love of human hierarchy that prompts Americans to go all goosey over the Windsors? Is it a hankering for hauteur after almost three centuries of leveling? Or is it the triumph of a toney accent over common sense?
"Every time I go to London, I feel it," said Mr. Barry, the columnist. "Americans just don't feel as classy as the British. I mean, I tell myself, I know I'm as smart as this person -- he's lying down drunk on the subway -- but he's got this accent like Alistair Cooke, and that intimidates me."

At Notre Dame, a Call to 'Be Informed'

 BODY:
Margaret O'Brien Steinfels, the editor of Commonweal magazine, advised graduates at the University of Notre Dame yesterday not to ignore the poverty and suffering of millions of people around the world but to "be informed, think carefully and take responsibility."
Speaking to the 1,700 undergraduates and 578 recipients of advanced degrees at Notre Dame's 146th commencement, Ms. Steinfels said: "We all start out in very ordinary ways. Our responsibilities lie before us, in the work we choose, in the friends we make and keep, in the prayers we offer." 
 Ms. Steinfels, author of "Who's Minding the Children -- The History and Politics of Day Care in America" (Simon & Schuster, 1973), received an honorary law degree at the commencement ceremonies.
Former Representative Lindy Boggs from Louisiana, in addition to receiving an honorary degree, received the Laetare Medal, given by the university each year to honor the contributions of an American Catholic.
Marva Collins, founder of the Westside Preparatory School in Chicago and a pioneer in inner-city education, was also honored.
Other honorary degrees were given to Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey or Ireland, Jane Pauley of NBC News, Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco and Surgeon General Antonia Novello.
 
University of Wisconsin
John T. Darnton, weekend news editor of The New York Times and winner of the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting, spoke at two ceremonies on Saturday, for undergraduates in the College of Letters and Science in the afternoon and for master's and bachelor's degree recipients in journalism, social work and science in the evening. He called on graduates to move away from the materialism of the 1980's.
The 138th commencement at University of Wisconsin at Madison was held in five ceremonies over the weekend for the 3,392 undergraduate and 1,416 graduate students.
"It's time for something new, for commitment, involvement, altruism," said Mr. Darnton, a 1967 graduate of the university. "It's time for a new political activism. We need sacrifice and ideals to fill the vacuum of the Cold War."
James Crow, professor emeritus of genetics and zoology, urged yesterday's group, those receiving degrees in education, agricultural science, nursing and medicine, to "keep on learning for the rest of their lives."
 
Smith College
The author Robert Fulghum delivered the 113th commencement address yesterday at Smith College.
Mr. Fulghum, a Unitarian minister who describes himself as a philosopher, wrote the best-selling book "All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten" (Villard, 1988).
Smith awarded 742 diplomas at its campus in Northampton, Mass. Honorary degrees were awarded to Toni Morrison, who won a Pulitzer Prize for her book "Beloved" (Knopf, 1987); Dame R. Nita Barrow, Governor-General of Barbados, and Mildred Berendsen, headmistress of the Chapin School in New York.
 
Haverford College
Haverford College awarded four honorary degrees to individuals distinguished in the fields of government, journalism, nuclear physics and women's legal rights at the college's 158th commencement. The ceremony for 306 graduating seniors was held yesterday in front of Roberts Hall on the college's campus near Philadelphia.
Haverford awarded a Doctor of Letters degree to Dave Barry, a nationally syndicated humor columnist, who is a 1969 Haverford graduate and a 1988 Pulitzer Prize winner for commentary. A Doctor of Laws degree was awarded to Catharine A. MacKinnon, a law professor who pioneered the legal theory defining sexual harassment as an actionable form of sex discrimination.
Diane J. Abbott, the first black woman elected to the British Parliament, received a Doctor of Laws degree. The last honorary degree was awarded to Freeman J. Dyson. Mr. Dyson received a Doctor of Science degree for his achievement in nuclear physics at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University.
 
Bryn Mawr College
Harris Wofford, the newly appointed United States Senator from Pennsylvania, was one of several speakers at the 105th commencement yesterday at Bryn Mawr College.
Senator Wofford, a Democrat appointed by Gov. Robert P. Casey to succeed the late Senator John Heinz, served as president of the College from 1970 to 1978 and was a special assistant to President John F. Kennedy on civil rights.
The commencement ceremonies began on Saturday and were held over two days in Bryn Mawr, Pa.
Barbara Ehrenreich, who has written seven books including "Fear of Falling" (Pantheon, 1989) and "The Worst Years of Our Lives" (Pantheon, 1990), addressed the graduates on Saturday.
Bryn Mawr, an all female institution for undergraduates, awarded 294 bachelor degrees. The graduate schools, which are co-educational, awarded 33 doctorates, 124 masters.
 
Pennsylvania State University
Pennsylvania State University awarded 7,547 diplomas at the University Park campus over the weekend.
Penn State held 11 different ceremonies: 10 for undergraduate colleges and another for its graduate school. It is the 130th year the university has held commencements.
In his address before the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, William A. Schreyer, chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch and Company, told students not to be too discouraged if they have a hard time finding a job.
"Things weren't much different when I graduated from Penn State in 1948," he said. "Inflation was heating up and most people suspected we were heading back toward depression. How could we know, just over the horizon, the biggest economic boom in history was about to start?"
Speakers at other graduations included David R. Jones, assistant managing editor of The New York Times, who graduated from the university in 1954, at the School of Communication, and State Senator Chaka Fattah at the College of Education.
 
University of Virginia
The American Ambassador to Kuwait, W. Nathaniel Howell, told graduates at the University of Virginia yesterday to use "a healthy dose of informed skepticism" in judging how news events are presented by the media.
Mr. Howell is an alumnus of the University of Virginia, which awarded 4,105 diplomas yesterday in Charlottesville.
Mr. Howell kept the Embassy in Kuwait open for more than four months after the invasion by Iraq last August.
He said many journalists in the Middle East were not well-informed about the cultures of the different countries and, therefore, were unable to properly present information.
 
Spelman College
Spelman College's commencement exercises were held yesterday morning in the Atlanta Civic Center. The keynote address was delivered to 365 senoirs by Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon of Washington. Other speakers included the actress Ruby Dee, Miriam Makeba, the South African folk singer, and Marguerite Ross Barnett, the first black female president of the University of Houston.
Mayor Dixon made history in November by becoming the first female leader of the capital. She is also the first black woman to serve as mayor of a major American city.
 
Morehouse College
Representative William H. Gray 3d, Democrat of Pennsylvania, was the keynote speaker at Morehouse College's 107th commencement yesterday on the campus in Atlanta.
Honorary Doctor of Law degrees were awarded to Condoleezza Rice, former Special Assistant to President Bush for National Security Affairs, and Dr. Asa Yancey Sr., medical director of Grady Memorial Hospital and a 1937 graduate of Morehouse.
 
SUNY
Mathilde Krim, an AIDS researcher and educator, told the 4,278 graduates at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, "AIDS is giving us a lesson in humility," yesterday during the school's 31st commencement exercises. Dr. Krim, who was a recipient of an honorary degree, explained, "It teaches us that the relentless evolutionary forces at play in nature continue to create new forms of life, and that for all mankind's arrogance and destructive powers, we are not yet the masters of the universe, nor even necessarily nature's most favored creature."
 Dr. Krim is the founder of the AIDS Medical Foundation, a group that fosters support for AIDS research, and merged with the American Foundation for AIDS Research in 1985. In her speech, she referred to the nondiscriminate nature of the AIDS virus, and urged graduates to "enjoy the love, the friendships, the work and the beauties the world offers you." "Because AIDS makes us suffer," she said, "and grieve for those we have lost, it is teaching us to value life."
Also honored with a degree was the author Isabel Allende, the niece of Salvador Allende, the assassinated President of Chile. Other university campuses enjoyed a sunny, pleasant day of mass exodus. At SUNY New Paltz, 1,600 students gathered at the college's old main quadrangle for its 104th commencement exercises. The speaker and honorary degree recipient was Robert Jay Lifton, an award-winning writer and psychiatrist.
At SUNY Buffalo's 145th commencement, 6,500 students received degrees during 12 exercises over the weekend. Barber B. Conable Jr., president of the World Bank, was awarded the Chancellor Norton Medal for his contributions to national and world affairs. Receiving honorary degrees were Dr. John W. Gardner, founder of philanthropic organizations; Dr. James P. Comer, an urban education reformer and Dr. Jerome Kassirer, who becomes the editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine in July.
 
St. John's University
In a speech at St. John's University's 121st commencement this weekend, the university's president told students to be conscious of the effects of violence on the world, especially after the Persian Gulf war. "We must not overlook the pain and suffering which still is being endured by many as a result of this war." the Rev. Donald J. Harrington said. "Whenever there is such violence, there is great ambiguity in victory."
 More than 2,000 students at both the Queens and Staten Island campuses participated in the commencement. In Jamaica, Queens, 900 diplomas were awarded to students at St. Vincent's College, part of the university's system, yesterday. Honorary degrees were awarded to Delores Bernadette Grier, the Vice Chancellor from Community Relations of the Archdiocese of New York, and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
 On Saturday, when 800 students graduated from the colleges of business administration and pharmacy in Jamaica, Queens, two former students were awarded honorary doctorates. They were Patricia D. Collins, a New York State Supreme Court Justice, and John T. Roche, president of his own company that specializes in investments and the securities trade. Earlier Saturday, at the university's Grymes Hill campus in Staten Island, the Notre Dame College, the College of Business Administration and St. Vincent's awarded degrees to 386 undergraduates.
 
University of Hartford
Dr. Carl E. Sagan, the astronomer and author, told students "to care for, preserve, protect and cherish" the earth's environment in his keynote address at the University of Hartford's 34th commencement yesterday. Dr. Sagan received an honorary degree from the university, which graduated about 1,300 undergraduates and graduate students.
Also honored were Dr. Frederick G. Adams, a former state health commissioner; Nicolaas Bloembergen, a Nobel laureate and physics professor at Harvard University; the author Francine du Plessix Gray; Lloyd Richards, the dean of the Yale School of Drama, and James D. Wolfensohn, the head of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.
 
University of Connecticut
The President of Hungary and the children's television host Mister Rogers were the keynote speakers at the 108th commencement of the University of Connecticut in Storrs this weekend. More than 5,000 students graduated. On Saturday, Arpad Goncz, Hungary's President, spoke to 1,066 graduate students about what the recently democratized country can offer the American investor. Fred Rogers, the host of "Mister Rogers's Neighborhood," spoke at dual ceremonies yesterday. "Listen to the children, he told the 3,500 undergraduates. "Learn from them." The two received honorary degrees, as did James Comer, an innovator in child education, and Harold Seidman, who served six Presidents at the Bureau of the Budget.
 
Manhattan College
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former Republican candidate for New York City mayor, told the graduates of Manhattan College yesterday to shun the advice of cynics who say "problems are so complex that is useless to try and solve them." Speaking at the college's 143d commencement, he told the 550 graduates from four schools to enter public service and try to reverse the growing tolerance of crime, including violence on the streets and "the white-collar crime and business crime which create some of our most pressing political and social problems."
He urged that drug-treatment programs be improved and that law and ethics be made required courses in primary and secondary schools. The Roman Catholic college awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree to Mr. Guiliani, a 1965 graduate of the college.
 
Colgate University
More than 700 graduates at Colgate University's 170th commencement heard Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana, encourage them to make American society more nurturing of the arts and education. Senator Lugar was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the university in Hamilton, N.Y. Other honorary degree recipients were: the Rev. Dr. Samuel Proctor, pastor emiritus of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem; Judith Jamison, artistic director of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater; Kevin Phillips, a political commentator; Judy Woodruff, a correspondent for the "MacNeil-Lehrer" television news program, and E. Garrett Bewkes, the retiring chairman of the Colgate board.
 
Adelphi University
Adelphi University in Garden City, L.I., conferred 2,400 degrees yesterday at its 95th commencement. The university's president, Peter Diamandopoulos, urged the graduates to "make the most of your education" by seeking the truth through critical thought. "You ought to do what your intellectually cultivated individuality obliges you to do," he said. "That is, become good by doing good." Adelphi awarded honorary degrees to Dr. Martin Feldstein, the economist and Harvard University professor; Dr. Leszek Kolakowski, a philosophy professor at the University of Chicago; Ilias Lalaounis, an artist, and Dr. Tsung-Dao Lee, a Nobel laureate and physics professor at Columbia University.
 
St. Lawrence University
More than 500 graduates at St. Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y., were told yesterday by Mark H. McCormack, a sports agent, that they should find their genius and make it their occupation, in the university's 136th commencement. The university awarded honorary degrees to four people including Mr. McCormack, the founder and chief executive of International Management Group. The others were Virginia Hazzard, an advocate for charities; Wilcomb E. Washburn, a scholar of American history, and John R. Dunne, assistant United States Attorney General for civil rights and a former New York State Senator.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Democrats Stick Toes In Waters of 1992 Race

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
Nine months before the Presidential contests begin, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts remains the only official candidate for the Democratic nomination, but a number of Democrats are suddenly sniffing the air.
Politics, after all, abhors a vacuum. Ambitious men can see opportunity where others see only a doomed battle against a popular incumbent. The political heavyweights, like Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, continue to hang back. But a new cadre of potential candidates is moving onto the scene, from Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia to Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. 
 They are, by and large, newcomers to Presidential politics, with a chance of making a name in a wide-open contest, and perhaps with less to lose than those higher on the ladder of Democratic leadership.
As the clock winds down, this disparate collection of Democrats is struggling with decisions that are equal parts electoral calculus, simple faith and raw desire. Here is a look at some of the most-watched "potentials," as they are known in Democratic circles, with the caveat that this is an ever-expanding and contracting field:
Senator Lloyd Bentsen Friends have long said that Mr. Bentsen was "considering a race but not actively exploring it." With his name recognition and fund-raising ability, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has more time than most to ruminate over a decision. But there are very few signs of fire in the belly, and more and more Democrats are convinced that Mr. Bentsen will not run.
"My sense is that while he hasn't slammed the door shut, he's done everything but," said Robert Strauss, the former national party chairman and longtime friend. One Democratic House member noted that Mr. Bentsen is building a new vacation home in San Diego, not customary behavior for a man beginning the forced march of a presidential campaign.
Gov. Bill Clinton The Arkansas Democrat said he would serve out his four-year term when he ran for re-election last year, but he clearly enjoys the Presidential speculation now swirling around him. Betsey Wright, the state Democratic chairwoman and a longtime Clinton adviser, said she saw "no signs that he has been seriously seduced by it."
But Mr. Clinton has a national platform as chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of centrist and conservative Democrats, and he has been traveling the country honing a domestic message. When pressed on his presidential ambitions in a recent interview, Mr. Clinton said: "It's not anything I've ruled out over the long run. It's just a question of whether it should be done now."
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo He said he has "no plans and no plans to make plans" for a Presidential campaign. He said: "I'm not a candidate. I'm not a potential candidate. I'm not a make-believe candidate." But the Governor of New York sends other signals that he wants to be a national player: Once the state budget is put to rest, he says he wants to travel the country to challenge President Bush's domestic policies. He has mixed it up with the Democratic Leadership Council. He is proposing a new Federal investment tax credit and assailing supply side economics.
Ronald H. Brown, the national Democratic chairman, said Friday that he believed Mr. Cuomo was "looking seriously" at a race and that his decision would be clear by the end of summer. When asked about that, Mr. Cuomo shot back, "He didn't say that." But he did -- one of the few hard facts in the miasma of hints and conflicting signals surrounding Mr. Cuomo's presidential ambitions.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt "He's gone hot and cold at least three or four times since January," said a Democratic House member close to Mr. Gephardt. As House majority leader, Mr. Gephardt is on a glide path to the speakership and arguably has the most to lose by a second, unsuccessful campaign for the Presidency. Perhaps that explains his insistence in recent weeks that "I am not running."
But Mr. Gephardt seems a tad conflicted. He sounds like a Presidential candidate in his speeches. And he is raising money very aggressively for his Congressional campaign fund, which can be rolled over for a Presidential campaign; he held more than a dozen fund-raising events during a recent swing through California. Mr. Gephardt, in short, seems to be keeping his options open.
Senator Al Gore The Senator from Tennessee is still considered among the most likely Presidential contenders, although he has yet to make his move. "He's said over and over again that there's a deadline out there, but he doesn't see it on the horizon yet," said his spokeswoman, Marla Romash.
Senator Tom Harkin This liberal Iowan never throttled back from his 1990 re-election campaign. He is traveling the country, bashing Mr. Bush and the Republicans, often before labor crowds. He is a key mover in the Coalition for Democratic Values, a group arguing for a full-throated "progressive" message for the Democratic Party; its members warn of the dangers of "shadow Republicans" in the party.
Should he enter the race, Mr. Harkin could radically change, probably devalue, the Iowa caucuses. He could give other Democrats an excuse to skip this first contest of the nominating season, a prospect that has already caused some nervousness among Iowa Democrats.
Rev. Jesse Jackson His Presidential plans are one of the biggest variables in the race. Mr. Jackson consistently says he will decide sometime this fall whether to seek the Democratic nomination for a third time. His recent spat with the Democratic Leadership Council, which pointedly did not invite him to speak at its meeting in Cleveland, shows that he wants to remain a player -- at the very least.
Senator Bob Kerrey Steve Jarding, a spokesman for the Nebraska Democrat, said, "He says he has no desire to be President at this time. but he's also said he doesn't feel it necessary to close any doors."
Former Senator George S. McGovern The South Dakota Democrat said he was resolved to think through his decision this weekend and announce it next Thursday in a speech to the National Press Club in Washington. "It's basically a struggle between personal factors that say no and the public service side that says yes," Mr. McGovern said in an interview last week.
The 1972 Democratic nominee, who lost in a landslide, said it "makes a difference" that other liberals like Mr. Harkin are considering a race. "I'm a liberal Democrat and I don't run away from that," he said. "That's the message I want heard in '92. If I were sure that case were going to be made, I'd bow out."
Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th Early on, the West Virginia Democrat seemed something of a dabbler in Presidential politics, acknowledging i March that he was not really interested in a race in 1992. But he reopened the door to '92 two weeks ago and headed off to New Hampshire this weekend. "He is surprisingly serious about this," said one Democrat close to Mr. Rockefeller. His focus, so far, has been on health care.
Name recognition is not a problem, thanks to John D., John D. 2d and John D. 3d, a background he handles with humor. "When I was growing up, there were a lot of reasons for me to become a Republican," he says, "a lot of reasons." But Mr. Rockefeller is untested in national politics, and at times it shows, as in his on-again, off-again stance on 1992.
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder The Governor of Virginia, building his national message on a promise of "progressive" domestic policies tempered with fiscal responsibility, said again last week that he would decide whether to seek the nomination by mid-summer.

HEADLINE: Council Flexing New Muscles For New York's Middle Class

SERIES: Playing for Power: The Council's Bid for Influence - First of a series of articles.

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
From the shadows of City Hall, the New York City Council is emerging as the greatest beneficiary of a historic fight to make government more reflective of the city's under-represented and often impoverished minorities.
On the verge of its greatest expansion and change, the Council has challenged the Mayor on some major initiatives, developed a staff of some competence in areas like municipal finance and even put a City Commissioner under oath when he testified before it, all in a dogged effort to be taken seriously after more than a century as an ineffectual joke. 
 Yet even as it amasses great powers under the new City Charter, which took effect a year ago, the Council is also becoming something unintended by many of those who fought to rework the city government: a strong voice for middle-class values, in which different minorities with often competing priorities may have less of a voice than before.
 
Different View on Cuts
 With the jury still out, the Council is in the spotlight on the most pressing civic question of the day: what to do about New York's deepest fiscal problems since the crisis of the mid-70's. And its leader, Speaker Peter F. Vallone, has vowed to challenge Mayor David N. Dinkins's proposals to help close a $3.5 billion budget deficit with a $1 billion tax increase and cuts in a wide range of services.
Invoking the values of middle-class New York, Mr. Vallone and the Council have called for reducing the tax increases by roughly half and looking harder at making cuts in some social services, while minimizing cuts in what they see as such basic services as schools, street-cleaning, parks and cultural programs that all New Yorkers depend on.
Because the Council now has the sole power to approve the budget -- a power that former Mayor Edward I. Koch says, with some hyperbole, makes it stronger than the mayoralty itself -- the positions it takes could make a difference to millions of taxpayers, thousands of city workers facing layoffs and a giant population of poor people, which endured the sharpest cuts during the 1975 fiscal crisis.
The Council is dominated by Mr. Vallone, a regular Democrat and part-time lawyer from the sidewalks of Astoria, Queens. He has used his control of committee chairmanships, which carry extra pay, to reward loyalists and punish dissenters. He has surrounded himself with a core of sophisticated aides making six-figure salaries comparable to those of commissioners and top mayoral aides. And he has more than doubled the Council's budget and tripled the central staff directly under his control.
As a result of these big-shouldered political maneuvers, Mr. Vallone has consolidated power in a 34-member majority, including the six black and three Hispanic members. A battle over drawing new districts to increase the Council to 51 seats from 35 in a special election this fall, as required by the Charter, may change the proportion of minority members from one in four to perhaps one in three. But, Mr. Vallone's closest aides say, the Council's political stance will probably not change at all, because its membership is likely to remain middle class.
"The goal for the 90's has to be a leaner more responsive efficient government that can still deliver the basic services as well as the services that make New York City unique," Mr. Vallone said last winter in a speech outlining his vision of the city. "The reality is that we have an extremely small taxpayer base and we can't drive out those who pay the freight."
The question is how far the Speaker, who has had a reputation for accommodation, will go in exerting the Council's new powers to press this philosophy.
"Right now, most people in the city don't know the Council exists," Mr. Vallone conceded. "It's going to take a long time to re-educate the public that we're as good a body as they are, and that's pretty good."
His critics are less charitable.
"I don't think Dinkins is going to have to have sleepless nights worrying about the Council as a serious competitor unless the Council works a lot harder than it does now," said Gene Russianoff, a lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group, a consumer and citizen advocacy group. "If they're going to be co-equal, they're going to have to write more laws, ask tougher questions and show up at oversight hearings with more than a second's worth of thought. At tops, a third of the Council members are doing the job they were elected to do. We know. We talk to them."
 
Stuck With Early Image Of 'Trained Seals'
 From the creation of the modern city of five boroughs at the turn of the century, the Council was overshadowed by the Board of Estimate, a hybrid of the mayor, comptroller, council president and borough presidents that controlled zoning and contracts and shared power on the budget.
The early Council was derided as "the 40 Thieves" for its corruption. Years later, Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia dismissed its members as "trained seals" who took their orders from their county political bosses.
But in 1989, the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional because each of the borough presidents had one vote while representing populations that varied widely in size. The new Charter abolished the board and gave the Council broad new powers. Not only will it continue to approve local laws and hold hearings, it now has final say over the budget and can review all land-use decisions.
Several members have won praise from civic groups for diligence and seriousness. But more than anything, the Council may be held back by many of its other members, a quaint and unabashedly ordinary collection which includes a former orchestra leader, a former livery-cab driver, a part-time soap opera actor and 10 lawyers, some of whom earn $100,000 a year in fees while practicing from their district offices.
In twice-monthly meetings in their dusky Victorian chamber on the second floor of City Hall, they drift in and out while mayoral aides, reporters and lobbyists mill about amid droning recitations of bills and resolutions.
The members are paid $55,000 a year, but most earn considerably more. "Lulus" for chairing committees and subcommittees range from $2,500 to $22,500, with only some full committees required to meet even once a month. The members each control $187,687 to spend on staffs and district offices, without oversight by the Council leadership.
The Council's growing flashes of aggressiveness contrast with its continuing lassitude. In the last year, one of its committees (on committees) did nothing except hold a buffet luncheon, and another, a subcommittee on pensions, never met publicly, though changes in the pension investment policy have been a major bone of contention in the city's current fiscal problems. Meanwhile, a panel on medical alternatives held repeated hearings on the merits of acupuncture and the chairman of the Economic Development Committee, Jerome X. O'Donovan of Staten Island, went on a trade mission to Romania.
Several committees violate the rule that they must meet at least once a month. The Committee on Civil Service and Labor held 11 meetings last year, and its chairman, Rafael Castaneira Colon, earned $10,000 for heading it. Two of the meetings were organizational and two were part of group hearings with other committees on the budget; none involved the municipal labor issues that have dominated the current fiscal crisis.
When Arthur J. Katzman of Queens, who once suggested that black and Hispanic children had "no liking for learning," retired as chairman of the Education Committee, he was replaced by Priscilla Wooten, a former bus matron from Brooklyn and a Vallone loyalist. Ms. Wooten once suggested that the city should permanently keep recruits in its Police Academy, whether it had the money to hire them or not, ignoring that the recruits must be paid.
Mr. Vallone also drew much criticism for naming his good friend and supporter, Jerry L. Crispino of the Bronx, to lead the all-important Land Use Committee. Mr. Crispino went around proclaiming his ignorance of land use so often that Council aides urged him to stop lest he be believed.
Eric Lane, who was counsel to the Charter Revision Commission, which drafted the new Charter, said it was unfair to focus too much on the foibles of individual members.
"Legislatures are supposed to be typical of their constituencies, and no consitituency will elect a person that's too dissimilar," he said. "It's the greatest means of accountability."
 
The New Priorities: Not Just Street Names
 For generations, perhaps the classic measure of the Council's limited stature was its fondness for changing street names. Of the 84 bills passed last year, 35 did just that. But now, the Council passes a handful of important laws each year, instead of one or two every few years.
In the last year, the Council passed bills cracking down on illegal social clubs, restricting minors' access to cigarettes and tightening restrictions on doing business with companies that have ties to South Africa. It outflanked Mr. Dinkins by passing a law setting deadlines to close large shelters for the homeless (which he had long opposed) faster than the Mayor believed possible.
The Council's laws also reflect its middle-class priorities, like one to let homeowners do construction work on weekends. On the hottest issues of the day, the Council still often finds itself following public debate.
It held a hearing and issued a report that harshly criticized Mr. Dinkins's handling of a black-led boycott of two Korean-owned groceries in Brooklyn, but only after the dispute had run for months and the Mayor's approach had been widely condemned. Mr. Vallone cited this as one of the biggest achievements of the year.
"If I were a commissioner, I wouldn't take the Council seriously because we're not prepared half the time," said Sal F. Albanese, a Councilman from Brooklyn.
One of the most important new powers the Council received under the new Charter, control over land use, has yet to be fully tested because the recession has slowed development to a trickle. It is in the area of its most significant power, the authority to remold and approve the budget, that the Council has made perhaps its greatest strides.
To lead his finance staff, Mr. Vallone hired Marc V. Shaw, a veteran of the State Senate Republican staff in Albany. The Council has asserted its prerogatives over spending at almost every turn, jockeying over its institutional role with the Mayor, though its bedrock priorities have changed little.
The Council has long stood for neighborhood interests, while mayors have always had to appeal to a citywide constituency. But the budget debate underlines the central paradox of the new Council, created to reflect growing ethnic and racial diversity: To Mr. Vallone and the Council leadership, the new balance of power between the Mayor and the Council is what diversity is all about.
All government tends toward the middle, and Mr. Dinkins has struck many of the same themes as the Council, for example, in building up the police force to the dismay of some liberals who elected him. But on matters involving millions of dollars, thousands of jobs and critical services, a battle is takingshape.
The Council has called for cutting Mr. Dinkins's proposal for $1 billion in higher taxes nearly in half, sparing proposed cuts in schools, parks and libraries and making cuts in social services. It has also proposed such maneuvers as consolidating other agencies.
The Council has just six weeks to dicker with the budget before the new fiscal year begins, and the depth of the city's fiscal problems will tie its hands somewhat. But in other ways, it has the tactical advantage. To win help from municipal unions and the state, Mr. Dinkins proposed cuts not only in programs that he knew the Council would fight to restore, but in some of his own pet programs, like health services for the poor, that the Council might be only too happy to let stand and blame him for.
The Council has more room to maneuver because it outfinessed Mr. Dinkins last year on hiring police officers, which was often the old Council's first and last budget goal. Last summer even before a spate of highly publicized crimes put Mr. Dinkins on the defensive, the Council had proposed hiring thousands of new officers by using a surcharge on state lottery tickets. That eventually led the Mayor to respond with a far more costly plan, which both sides finally agreed to finance.
 
The Gorgeous Mosaic Vs. the Melting Pot
 Mr. Shaw of Mr. Vallone's finance staff said that much of the struggling so far has been institutional, rather than philosophical, with the Council seeking to be taken seriously by the west wing of City Hall.
But a philosophical fight is looming on whether New York can afford to maintain such a vast government and system of social services. In that debate Mr. Vallone has staked his turf, growing passionate over broken traffic lights and bus-stop shelters.
"I really do believe that we're spending, we're wasting a lot of money in H.R.A. It's up to $7 billion now," he said, referring to the city Human Resources Administration. Of the city's public hospitals, he said, "I really do believe that health services are absolutely essential, but the City of New York should not be paying for them." The Federal and state governments should pay, he said.
Mr. Vallone's approach is widely shared by his Council colleagues, including the minority members.
Archie Spigner of Queens, one of the Council's senior black members, said: "I don't see a radical shift in the makeup of the Council. You just look at the black members of the Council," pointing to a group that supported Mr. Koch for much of his tenure when others in the black community complained that he was insensitive to their needs. "Unless strong measures are taken to keep the middle class, black and white, we're going to be in real trouble."
But David R. Jones, executive director of the Community Service Society, a nonprofit social-service group, said Mr. Vallone and his members did not adequately address the needs of dispossessed constituencies whose distress could divide the city.
"If he wants to take the leadership position," Mr. Jones said, "he's going to have to start not only crying out for his narrow constituency, but for all the people of New York, a majority of whom happen to be either poor or nonwhite."
Mr. Vallone wants to be seen as aware of the demands upon him, and often speaks of his and the Council's concern for the homeless. But he hews to a more assimilationist vision. He says all groups should strive for representation, but rejects the notion that they must be represented by someone from the same ethnic or racial group.
Unlike the Mayor, who wanted to craft a top staff reflective of what he calls New York's "gorgeous mosaic," Mr. Vallone, saying his only criteria was picking the best person for the job, recruited a core staff that basically reflects pre-war New York.
"Forget this mosaic," he said. "I like the melting pot." Because there are talented members of all races and ethnic groups, he added, the staff will balance out over time.
What Mr. Vallone will ultimately do with his power, and how long he can keep it, remains to be seen.
"If there is real power in the City Council, people will throw out representatives who don't produce," said Richard D. Emery, the civil rights lawyer who brought the lawsuit that led to the Council's ascendancy.
"If that dynamic doesn't work," he said, "it means that the voters don't care at all and any form of democracy is meaningless."

HEADLINE: The Primary for Mayor Is Leaving Many in Philadelphia Befuddled

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, May 19

 BODY:
Against the backdrop of yet another bribery scandal in City Hall, a resurgent fiscal crisis and the likelihood of more municipal chaos, a sales tax increase and severe service reductions this year, seven candidates are vying to become Philadelphia's 127th mayor in Tuesday's primary election.
There are so many candidates saying similar things that voters have become more and more confused in four months of campaigning. "I'm so undecided, it's a sin," said Naomi Lingham, a 73-year-old from North Philadelphia. In polls, the ranks of the undecided have swollen in the last month and now include almost one of three Democrats and one of six Republicans.
 
Two Are Given an Edge
 Experts say this trend foreshadows a low turnout for the primary, giving a significant edge to the Republican Party's endorsed candidate, Ronald D. Castille, and the Democratic front-runner, Edward G. Rendell. Both are white, 47-year-old former district attorneys who pledge to put city spending on a crash diet and squeeze millions from Washington and Harrisburg. 
 Mayor W. Wilson Goode, a Democrat and the city's first black mayor, is finishing his second four-year term and is prevented from running for a third. His administration, scarred by the worsening fiscal crisis and the death and destruction caused by his 1985 decision to bomb the fortified home of the radical black group called Move, has led to a pent-up demand for sweeping change.
The Republicans see this as their best opportunity in 40 years for capturing the mayor's office. Democrats, who outnumber Republicans by a 5-to-2 ratio, are talking about saving money by reducing city workers' health benefits and hiring private contractors to collect the trash and perform other city services. Some Republicans say the same things.
The fiscal crisis has permitted candidates to be candid about their plans for rescuing the city, said Paul Seidenstat, an associate professor of economics at Temple University. "They are more open and have a more coherent point of view than candidates ever did in the past," he said.
 
Diverse Field of Candidates
 The times have spawned an unusually diverse field of candidates, including the two former district attorneys; Lucien E. Blackwell and George R. Burrell Jr., two black Democrats who have been relatively inactive as members of the City Council, and Peter Hearn, a former chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar Association who is running as an outsider and reformer but has drawn very little support.
There are also two Democrats-turned-Republicans, Sam Katz, a municipal finance expert who has become a serious contender, and former Mayor Frank L. Rizzo who is, for the fifth time in 20 years, bearing the standard of law and order here in what he calls "Dodge City." Mr. Rizzo, who lost the last election to Mayor Goode by only 17,000 votes, has said he would find the money to hire 1,500 more police officers by doing things like eliminating programs for AIDS victims and the homeless.
In each party's primary, the candidate with the most votes wins. The two primary winners will face off in the general election on Nov. 5.
In a city where blacks represent 40 percent of the population of 1.5 million people and nearly 60 percent of the 650,000 registered Democrats, this campaign has been remarkably free of racial tension. Political analysts say it signals a growing acceptance by whites and a political maturity on the part of blacks, who now hold many positions of power.
The two black candidates, Mr. Burrell, a former safety with the Denver Broncos of the National Football League, and Mr. Blackwell, a former longshoreman and boxer, have traded charges all through the campaign.
 
Majority Whip Joins Fray
 Joining the fray last week was United States Representative William H. Gray 3d, the House's majority whip and the most powerful black Democrat in Philadelphia. Mr. Gray, who is sponsoring the candidacy of Mr. Burrell,charged that Mr. Blackwell had accepted a $1,000 campaign contribution from his brother, who the Pennsylvania Crime Commission has said runs a numbers racket in the city.
Mr. Blackwell vehemently denied the charge, saying that the contribution came from his cousin, and not from his brother. Both share the same name, Junious Blackwell Jr. "The bum made a mistake," the candidate said of Mr. Gray.
The Democratic candidates debated on television Tuesday, the same day that a Federal grand jury indicted a veteran City Councilman, James J. Tayoun, on charges of bribery and racketeering. With that indictment in the background, the candidates traded charges of wrongdoing involving gas bills, loan defaults and parking tickets.
Dr. Sandra Featherman, director of the Center for Public Policy at Temple University, who occasionally gives a speech entitled "Why Philadelphians Elect Felons and Corpses to Public Office," said the mayoral candidates were guilty of "pecadillos" compared to the norm. "One of the depressing problems in Philadelphia is how willing Philadelphians are to tolerate improper behavior by their politicians," Dr. Featherman said.
The Republicans' televised debate on May 8 was more civilized, in part because the debate's inflexible structure provided no interaction between candidates. The 70-year-old Mr. Rizzo was uncharacteristically mild in the debate.
Mr. Rizzo, trailing in the polls and embittered at losing the endorsement of party bosses, had repeatedly lashed out at Mr. Castille, the front-runner, calling him a "mental case," a "drunk." Mr. Castille complained about some charges to the Fellowship Commission.
The commission, an independent committee that tries to clean up local elections, examined Mr. Rizzo's charges and determined that the drinking charge was unfounded. But it waffled on the other charge, stating: "Reasonable people might debate what the terminology 'mental case' suggests."

HEADLINE: 83 Brand-New Condos and a Harbor View: What Am I Bid?

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Battery Park City was a real-estate developer's dream: an opportunity to build apartments with unobstructed views of the Statue of Liberty and New York Harbor, which would attract the up-and-comers of Wall Street working in the gleaming skyscrapers just steps away.
But while the buildings went up on the narrow strip of filled land that is the World Trade Center's backyard, the stock market plummeted, dragging New York's economy and the real-estate market down with it. 
 So the low-key sales pitch intended to attract the well-heeled Wall Streeters has instead emerged as the burbling patter of the auctioneer, as a developer, Goodstein Properties, yesterday auctioned off 83 brand-new condominiums in the Cove Club, one of the latest luxury developments in Battery Park City.
The auction, at the Marriott Marquis in midtown, was also testament to New Yorkers' uncanny ability to mine silver in every dark cloud. More than 700 prospective buyers registered to bid on the apartments, and several found bargains, if not outright steals, on condominiums with the latest amenities and unparalleled views.
"You can look at this as an end of one era or the beginning of another," said Luk Sun Wong, who works for another real-estate company and hoped to pick up a couple of apartments for himself as an investment. "It's a chance to bring real-estate prices back down to earth and give normal people a chance to live in New York." Many of those who attended yesterday already live in Battery Park City, and like it. Edward and Alison Simioni, who have rented there for the last three years, say they like the esplanade just steps away from their front door, the quiet, clean streets and the tastefully landscaped parks and courtyards.
"We've been watching buildings go up and this just seemed like it might be a good opportunity," Mr. Simioni said.
The Simionis had their eye on three apartments in the Cove Club, corner units with wraparound views of the New Jersey shoreline and the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. They bid on the first one and got it for $332,000 -- less than the $350,000 they were prepared to pay and a bargain compared with the $411,000 asking price. But Mr. Simioni was still nervous.
"You never know -- the other two could go for even less," he said as he was whisked into another room to make the financing arrangements for his new home.
The auction itself seemed to flummox some bidders new to the process. The bid ding, conducted by ruddy men with names like Rocky and Mel, moved rapidly, taking broad leaps of $10,000 and even $25,000 when an apartment was initially placed on the block and then little skips of $2,500 or $1,000 at the end, until the chief auctioneer yelled, "Sold!" into the microphone.
"This sure isn't Sotheby's," said Richard Milbank, poking his Hewlett-Packard to calculate how much of a bargain had just transpired.
For Mr. Milbank and many others, the auction was less a chance to buy than a chance to witness what until recently would have been a rare curiosity -- a New York City real-estate transaction that seemed to favor the buyer instead of the seller.
They did not abandon their skepticism, however. "Deals? Who's talking about deals?" asked Virginia Young, the high bidder on a 552-square-foot penthouse studio with a view of a sliver of the estuary. "Nothing is a good deal."
Mrs. Young, her husband, Yoon, and their son, William, will use the apartment as a pied-a-terre where they can escape the tranquillity of their home on two acres in Croton, N.Y. They bid $150,000 for their slice of city life, 16 percent less than the $179,000 original asking price.
"I like the view. I like the garden," Mrs. Young said. "I like the garden and I don't have to work to enjoy it."
The Youngs got less of a discount than other bidders, who bought for as little as 53 percent of the original offering prices during the first 90 minutes of the auction. A town house with two terraces, three bathrooms and a view of Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, listed at $648,000, went for $383,000. A large one-bedroom with a balcony sold for $192,000, 29 percent less than the $272,000 offering price.
 
'Expedited Marketing Approach'
 Some of those views may be worth a bit less in coming years, since ground is being broken adjacent to the Cove Club for a new tower.
Andrew Goodstein, the president of Goodstein Properties, said that although his company would take some losses in the auction, there were advantages as well.
"This is an expedited marketing approach," he said. "It allows us to sell 50 percent of the units quickly, saving us money, and it creates interest that will be useful in the future."
The Cove Club was the first new condominium in New York City to open with the bang of a gavel, although groups of apartments in several older co-ops have been auctioned off. Mr. Goodstein said he expected the event to increase awareness of the property and attract buyers for the other 80 units in the building.
David A. Emil, the president and chief executive of the Battery Park City Authority, said that although he had had misgivings about the auction, the sale prices yesterday were a pleasant surprise. The first 42 apartments to go on the block had all sold, he said.
"I think although auctions generally have tended to indicate a real distressed situation, the prices that were bid there today show there's still a good market for Battery Park City residential property," he said.
For Mr. Goodstein, the auction was also a way to quickly sell the minimum 15 percent of the project that state law requires for a condominium plan to become effective. The rest of the apartments and town houses in the Cove Club will probably be rented at first and sold after the market has picked up, Mr. Goodstein said.
Although he said his company may take a loss on this development, Mr. Goodstein did not rule out future projects in Battery Park City. The Goodstein family were also partners in Liberty House, Liberty Terrace and Liberty Court, three other developments in Battery Park City.
"The area has come a long way -- it will go a long way," he said.

HEADLINE: Soviets Cooperating on Military Books in the West

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
With the change in East-West relations, the Soviet Union is now cooperating with Western publishers on books about the Soviet military, providing the sort of facts, figures and even photographs that spies had for decades risked life and limb to obtain.
"If the Soviets knew you'd had this kind of material five or six years ago, they'd have come after you with their agents," said Moise Feder, the editor of the Military Book Club. "Now they're helping make it available to us in the West." 
 The books are remarkable for detailing everything from Soviet military training methods to specification of the most modern Soviet submarines and airplanes, and publishers are gambling that American readers will be sufficiently intrigued by the revelations of what was once classified information to make the books big sellers.
Some of the information in the books has come from unofficial Soviet sources and some from ranking military and intelligence sources in Eastern Europe. But most was supplied by Soviet officials who, for political and economic reasons, have been willing to provide Western publishers with facts, figures and photographs that were formerly kept secret.
 
Soviets Are More Open
 "We're now at the end of the cold war, we hope, and the Soviets are much more open at every level," said John W. R. Taylor, who for 30 years was editor of "Jane's All the World's Aircraft," one of the series of authoritative military reference books published in London.
Mr. Taylor is also the editor of "Soviet Wings: Modern Soviet Military Aircraft," just published by Presidio Press in Novato, Calif. and simultaneously by publishers in England, Canada, France, Japan, Yugoslavia, Italy and Germany. The book consists of 141 color photographs never before published in the West, including some featuring the latest Soviet combat aircraft. All the photos are by Aleksandr M. Dzhus, a Soviet aerial photographer.
Soviet aircraft have sometimes participated in air shows in the West, but Mr. Taylor and others said those planes were usually photographed sitting on runways, their weapons covered up. But "Soviet Wings" shows them taking off from carrier decks, shows their armament and electronic jamming equipment and has detailed specifications.
"We had so few good pictures of Soviet aircraft that the joke in aviation and intelligence circles was that they built only blurred aircraft," said Lionel Leventhal, the head of Greenhill Books in London, a leading publisher of military books. Mr. Leventhal acquired the photographs for "Soviet Wings" from a Moscow publisher and arranged for the book's simultaneous publication on three continents (but not in the Soviet Union).
The book is a main selection of the Military Book Club. "It's something of a gamble for us," Mr. Feder said, "because it's an expensive book." (It retails for $50, and the club price is $30.) "But some of those planes haven't been seen before, and most of the photographs compare well to those of American aviation photographers."
 
A Year With the Soviet Military
 Next month, AbbevillePress will publish "Inside the Soviet Military" by Carey Schofield, a British journalist, with photographs by Leonid Yakutin, a Soviet naval officer and military photographer. They spent a year with the Soviet military, visiting a naval base at Vladivostok, covering parachute training at Ryazan, watching the winter maneuvers of Warsaw Pact troops and visiting many other bases, units and warships.
In his foreword to the book, Christopher Donnelly, Sovietologist in residence for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, wrote that never before had a Western observer been allowed to see and report on the Soviet armed forces from the inside, and never had such unrestricted access to military installations and personnel been granted.
"That it was granted at all is amazing," Mr. Donnelly said. "That it has been granted so completely and free from official restraint is one of the most heartening signs for the development of that dialogue essential to a permanent improvement of relations between the U.S.S.R. and the West."
The reasons for such cooperation are not always clear, although the authors and publishers of those books attribute it to the new Soviet policies of openness. But there may be other motivations as well. Asked what inspired the Soviet authorities to make available the revealing photographs of Soviet planes, Mr. Leventhal replied: "Money. I'm paying them in Western currency." He declined to say how much.
 
Airplanes and Submarines
 Norman Polmar, a naval analyst and a consultant to the Department of Defense, said: "The Soviets for years have wanted to sell commercial airplanes, and 'Soviet Wings' is a reflection of that goal. But they're not as open about their submarine fleet, because they're not trying to sell submarines."
Nevertheless, Mr. Polmar received greater cooperation from Soviet officials than he expected while writing "Submarines of the Russian and Soviet Navies, 1718-1990." Just published by the Naval Institute Press , the detailed book is co-authored with Jurrien Noot, a research analyst on the staff of the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic.
Mr. Polmar said his requests for photographs and certain specifications were honored sometimes and disregarded at other times with no discernable pattern. Nevertheless, he said he had noticed big differences in Soviet attitudes about its military.
"I sat down with the new Soviet naval attache a few weeks ago," he said, "and at that first meeting he told me he was a Soviet nuclear submariner. Ten years ago when you met a Soviet attache, they would always say there are in headquarters, or on staff work, or served on surface ships. They just didn't talk about who they were and what they did."
The Soviet Union is not forthcoming about everything pertaining to its military, said Milan Vego, a former Yugoslav naval officer who teaches at the Defense Intelligence College and is a consultant at the Center for Naval Analyses.
"They have opened up some archives, and it's possible to subscribe to Soviet magazines that were formerly forbidden, so for the first time you can consult originals on military subjects," Mr. Vego said. "But the Soviets still are not forthcoming about tactics; those you have to pursue in East European magazines."
Despite such detours, publishers say they expect the openness to continue. Aristide D. Caratzas, which publishes books in the humanities and modern history, is planning a range of books from the Soviet Union, including geographical handbooks. And Presidio Press has contracts with high-ranking Soviet military officers for four books, including one on the Afghan war told from the Soviet perspective, and another describing Soviet military aid to North Korea and North Vietnam, and to Egypt and Syria in their wars against Israel.

HEADLINE: Protect Deposits -- and the Economy

 BODY:
A House banking subcommittee last week rejected two White House proposals to cut back Federal deposit insurance. That might seem odd at a time when the fund that insures depositors is low and sinking. But the subcommittee showed shrewd judgment. There's a much sounder way to fix up bank insurance:
Give regulators more authority to close failing banks -- long before the insurance fund, and taxpayers, are threatened. 
 Once that is done, there will be no need to reduce insurance or punish depositors, actions that would only destabilize banks and threaten the economy.
 One of the Administration's proposals rejected by the subcommittee would limit insurance for an individual to a single non-retirement account of up to $100,000 per bank. The subcommittee also voted to permit healthy banks to issue insured deposits through brokerage firms, a practice the Bush Administration wants to end. These decisions might appear to do little more than protect fat cats. But the truth is more complicated.
Many middle-income workers receive large lump-sum payments at retirement and anxiously seek safe havens for the money. Nonprofit institutions are not fat cats either, but many hold large uninsured deposits, as was sadly demonstrated last year in the collapse of Freedom National Bank of Harlem.
Protecting these and ordinary savers is reason enough to preserve widespread Federal deposit insurance. But there's another, more compelling reason: to stabilize the banking system.
In times of crisis, panicky withdrawals by uninsured depositors can close an otherwise solvent bank. That, in turn, can trip withdrawals from neighboring banks. And large banks typically hold uninsured deposits from smaller banks, which would be threatened by the large bank's collapse. By exposing more depositors to losses, Congress would jeopardize a regulatory system that has for half a century brilliantly insulated the economy against ruinous panics.
The reason for preserving insured brokered deposits is more subtle. Some large brokerage firms allow their clients to withdraw their money early without the usual penalty. To do this, the brokerage firms hold inventories of certificates, giving them a vested interest in dealing only with creditworthy banks. In effect, brokered deposits turn private institutions into financial overseers of banks -- a useful protection.
Taxpayers are justifiably angry that, once again, they are threatened by collapse of financial institutions. That anger impels politicians to lash out at attractive targets like rich depositors and brokerage firms. But when they are targeted unjustly, such action is demagogic and dangerous.
Final House and Senate votes will not come until summer, and not every subcommittee vote has been wise. But last week's votes are an optimistic sign that Congress can resist destructive temptation.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS SCENE;
Outsiders' Role In Mexico Pact

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
FOREIGN-OWNED factories in the United States, a spreading phenomenon in the 1980's, left many Americans wondering if the nation's industrial power had been diluted. Now the proposed free-trade agreement with Mexico is renewing debate over that concern.
The Mexican agreement is to come on top of a similar pact already in force between the United States and Canada. The goal is to remove all the barriers to trade and investment among the three countries. A company that makes auto engines or shirts in, say, Monterrey will enjoy the same easy access to American customers as companies that make those products in Cleveland or Toronto. Mexico, in effect, would become an industrial zone within the United States. 
 But should an "outsider" -- a German or a Japanese company, for example, with a factory in Mexico -- gain the same free access to the huge United States market as do companies owned by the "insiders," Americans, Mexicans and Canadians? The answer will probably be yes, but only if the "outsiders" agree to rules intended to make them look like "insiders."
"This will be one of the critical issues in the negotiations," said Roger Wallace, a Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce. "We will have to define what constitutes a North American product."
The definition will probably be that a forklift, for example, assembled in Mexico, is "North American" if most of the parts are made in Mexico, the United States or Canada. Caterpillar Inc. makes such forklifts today near Monterrey. But a forklift assembled by a German or Japanese company from parts brought mostly from Europe and Asia would not qualify. More than 50 percent of the parts or the work done on the forklift would probably have to originate within the new free-trade region, says Julius Katz, a deputy in the United States trade representative's office.
So far, most foreign manufacturing companies in Mexico are American-owned. But once a North American common market is in place, "outsider" investment is likely to mushroom, over the objections of some who say that "outsiders" should not have easy access to United States markets, even if they comply with stiff local-origin requirements.
Put another way, should Germany's Volkswagen, which closed an auto factory in Pennsylvania in 1988 as unprofitable, be encouraged to expand its Mexican operation and re-enter the American market through unrestricted exports from that plant? Or, should a Taiwan shirt maker be allowed to get around United States import quotas for apparel and textiles by relocating to Mexico, where a chief requirement for unlimited access would be shirts made mostly from fabrics purchased in Mexico or the Carolinas? The Bush Administration seems to say yes, as long as local-origin rules are observed. The Mexicans apparently are not so sure. In a recent speech, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mexico's President, appealed to Asians to build high-technology factories in Mexico, arguing that his country was becoming a platform for penetrating the United States market. He did not dwell on local-origin rules.
Mexico has a highly skilled but low-paid work force. The combination has already prompted American companies, particularly auto manufacturers, to put state-of-the-art factories in Mexico. Mr. Salinas has accelerated the process by reducing trade barriers with the United States, even in advance of a free-trade agreement.
Once one is securely in place, a European or a Japanese company planning to put a factory in Chicago might put it in Monterrey instead to save on wages, depriving Americans of jobs, argues Mark Anderson, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. economist.
Others maintain that local-origin rules are not an impediment. Japanese auto makers, already investing in Mexico, will be able to ignore them. The only penalty would be payment of the standard United States tariff, which is 2.5 percent for autos. A proposed solution would be to levy higher penalty tariffs for violating the local-origin rules.
Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute, takes solutions a step further. He would require "outsider" car manufacturers, for example, to export one car to another part of the world for every car sold within the region. And "outsiders" would have to buy their factory machinery from North American companies.
Mr. Prestowitz's approach is intended to give United States-owned companies a competitive advantage in their own low-wage backyard. But that runs counter to Administration policy, which favors tariff-free trade for everyone everywhere in the world. The compromise is likely to be stiff rules of local origin. Other forms of special treatment would be unconscionable, Mr. Katz says.

Fare Wars Start Anew At Airlines

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DALLAS, May 20

 BODY:
Domestic airlines cut their summer ticket prices today by as much as 20 percent, and said children could come along for half-price.
Northwest Airlines started the fare promotion over the weekend. American, Continental, Delta Air Lines, United and USAir matched it today. 
 "We're trying to stimulate travel as much as we can for the summer period," said Doug Miller, a Northwest spokesman. "As we were looking out at our advanced bookings for summer, they were just slightly below where we hoped they would be."
 
New York to Chicago: $278
 Under the promotion, a round-trip ticket from New York to Chicago would cost $278 during peak hours and $238 during off-peak hours. A child could accompany an adult for $168 or $118, respectively.
Off-peak travel generally is defined as noon on Monday through noon on Thursday. Peak travel is noon on Thursday through noon on Monday.
The offer extends through May 31 for travel through Sept. 8. The nonrefundable fares apply to round-trip flights with reservations made at least seven days before travel.
Children 17 and under must be accompanied by an adult for the half-off fare. A Saturday night stay is generally required.
The offer is aimed at families trying to decide between driving and flying for summer vacations, or whether to make a trip at all, Mr. Miller said.
Domestic airlines are trying to lure more passengers to raise revenues and return to profitability. The industry lost nearly $4 billion last year, a record, as carriers were assaulted by the recession, higher jet-fuel prices and a loss of passengers stemming from the Persian Gulf war.
 
America West Starts Round
 Two weeks ago, America West Airlines lowered all of its fares, some by as much as 40 percent, in a promotion aimed at business travelers. But the cuts did not catch on in an industry where airlines often scurry to keep up with the competition.
Nor did the carriers match Southwest Airlines when it announced a summertime promotion two weeks ago in which children would fly free. The offer expires on Wednesday.
Jackie Pate, a Delta spokeswoman, said the airline was surprised by the newest round of price-cutting. "Our bookings for the summer are very strong," she said.
But she added: "In the airline business, you must remain competitive. If the competitors are offering a lower fare, you have to match it."

HEADLINE: Banks Avoid Some F.D.I.C. Fees

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
As the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation prepares to increase insurance premiums charged on bank deposits, a handful of banks are taking advantage of a financing technique that allows them to borrow funds in a way that does not require payment for deposit insurance.
Following the rules of the F.D.I.C., banks may issue notes that are a general obligation, like a deposit, but are not called deposits and are not insured by the Government. The notes are sold in multimillion-dollar minimums to institutions like money market mutual funds, whose investments are so large that in theory they benefit little from the $100,000 of Government insurance per account, which would apply to large certificates of deposit. 
 Bankers are eager to sell notes to such large investors because the notes usually carry a lower interest rate than would be required for notes issued by a bank's parent holding company and the notes do not require payment of deposit insurance premiums. Annual deposit insurance premiums are scheduled to increase to $2,300 per $1 million on July 1, up from $1,950 currently, and nearly three times as high as the $830 premium charged until the end of 1989.
"We have had inquiries from many other banks who are considering notes because they do not like to pay the F.D.I.C. insurance premium," said Edward Z. Emmer, a banking analyst at the Standard & Poor's Corporation. S.& P. already rates bank notes of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, the Republic National Bank and the American Express Centurion Bank, all of New York, and the U.S. National Bank of Washington, a Seattle-based subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp of Portland, Ore.
Morgan Guaranty, with about $600 million of notes outstanding at the end of 1990, has issued the most notes, and analysts noted that its top-notch credit rating had attracted many investors. The American Express Centurion Bank has plans to issue notes, but has not yet done so.
Securities dealers who asked not to be identified said that an additional half-dozen banks had sold uninsured notes occasionally. The perception that weakness in the banking industry is not fatal, as reflected in higher prices for bank stocks, has strengthened demand for the bank notes.
 
Many Banks Unsure
 "But there are lots of banks sitting on the sidelines right now because they are unsure about the banking legislation in Washington," an investment banker said. "Their fear is that the laws will change so that insurance premiums are charged on a broader base of assets or liabilities."
Bruce Mauger, senior vice president at U.S. Bancorp, which has issued about $230 million of the notes in the last month, said the bank planned to issue as much as $1 billion as it replaced its maturing certificates of deposit with the lower-cost notes.
"The absence of F.D.I.C. insurance premiums is the driving force behind the note sales," Mr. Mauger said. He added that the instititional investors who buy the notes "are relying on the quality of the bank, not the presence of deposit insurance."
Mr. Mauger said the notes had been sold recently with an interest rate that is only five-hundredths of a percentage point greater than certificates of deposit. The extra interest cost is more than offset, he noted, by avoiding payment of the deposit insurance premium of 23-hundredths of a percentage point on certificates of deposit.
 
More Options for Banks
 Richard Kendrick, an expert on bank securities at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, said many investors were wary of buying notes issued by a bank's holding company "but are quite interested in notes issued by banks." The issuance of notes, which he expects will increase, "helps open up the market for banks, and gives them more options," he said.
Analysts said that for many banks, the interest rates on the notes due in about two years were only about three-tenths of a percentage point higher than Treasury notes of similar maturity, while two-year notes issued by the holding company could carry rates that were a percentage point or more above Treasury notes.
The growing bank interest in the notes comes at a time when the F.D.I.C.'s financial condition has been so weakened by bank failures that Congress is considering ways of strengthening its finances by allowing it to borrow from the Treasury or the Federal Reserve.
Roger Hood, a lawyer and deposit insurance expert at the F.D.I.C., said the agency was not considering any measures to limit the sale of bank notes. But he said the possibility of imposing limits was discussed a few years ago "and if the practice becomes prevalent, we will take a look at it."

HEADLINE: New Study of Older Workers Finds They Can Become Good Investments

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Dan Young of Atlanta came out of an unwanted retirement four years ago, took a job booking hotel rooms and now at the age of 74 helps supervise hundreds of reservation agents.
Christine Shelley, a widow who was retired, became restless and went back to work. She learned to use a computer and earned six annual pay increases. Now 73 years old, she advises other older workers, "Never be afraid to accept a challenge." 
 Their experiences illustrate the findings of a new study of two American corporations and a British retail chain. It concluded that older workers can be retrained in new technologies, have lower absenteeism and are often better salespeople than younger workers.
"The biggest single barrier for employers to hire older workers was the lack of any verifiable evidence that it made good sense economically to do so," said Thomas W. Moloney, senior vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, which commissioned the study.
 
'Hard-Nose Economic Analysis'
 "We have here the first systematic, hard-nosed economic analysis showing older workers are good investments," he said of the study made by ICF, a Washington consulting concern specializing in labor market studies.
Earlier studies made for the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation based in New York, estimate that six million unemployed Americans over the age of 55 are ready and able to work. They would join 13.5 million others over 55 who are already in the work force.
The Census Bureau said nearly 50.5 million Americans, or 20.3 percent of the nation's population, were over 55 in 1989, the latest such figures available.
"With each passing year there will be more and more upper-age Americans interested, able and desirous of working," said Dr. Eli Ginzberg, director of the Eisenhower Center for the Conservation of Human Resources at Columbia University. "Unless the country wants to pay additional taxes to support a lot of elderly people, it makes more sense to offer them the opportunity to work and earn an income."
 
The Recession as an Excuse
 Dr. Ginzberg, who is 80 and completing his 56th year of teaching, added, "One can always find an excuse, such as the current recession, to justify a prejudice about hiring policies."
The studies were conducted at the Atlanta headquarters of Days Inns of America Inc., the hotel chain; the Travelers Corporation of Hartford, a holding company and subsidiary of the Travelers Companies, and B&Q, Britain's largest chain of do-it-yourself hardware stores.
All three concerns were chosen for the study because of their long-term experience in hiring workers 50 and over and their willingness to permit analysts to examine their business records. Days Inns, in particular, had been experiencing high staff turnover and was looking for workers more likely to stay on the job.
"Three years ago we were out there beating the bushes to get other companies to learn from our experience," said Carol Bivins, a vice president at Days Inns who began in 1986 to organize job fairs where business representatives and older people could meet.
 
Some Changing Demographics
 The first event attracted 50 businesses. Last Saturday, 85 Days Inns hotels in 31 states threw open their conference rooms for job-seekers, attracting more than 1,700 concerns,
At the Atlanta job fair, which drew 200 job-seekers and representatives of 30 companies, Jerry Mabe, vice president of a temporary personnel service in Atlanta, said the demographics of the older work force were changing. Older men laid off or forced into early retirement by the recession now represent a larger portion of the older work force, he said.
Virtually all of the employers at the job fair said older workers were more reliable. "Older workers have a better work ethic, a lower rate of absenteeism and more dedication to the job," said Janice L. Moran of Spiegel Inc.
The Travelers, which employs 10,000 workers, adopted hiring practices that include affirmative action for older workers because demographic projections showed a diminishing number of young people applying for jobs.
"We had to find a labor source other than college and high school graduates," said Peter Libassi, the company's senior vice president.
So Travelers started a job bank project, recruiting its retired employees to return to part-time or, in some cases, full-time employment. When Travelers had more job opportunities than workers, it opened the program up to former employees of other companies in Hartford.
"On any day, there are 250 former retirees showing up for work," said Mr. Libassi. "We didn't do it just to make our retirees happy. We did it first and foremost because it was in the best interests of the company to hire, train or retrain older workers."
At Days Inns, both Mr. Young and Mrs. Shelley are part of a work force that operates a nationwide computerized reservation service from the concern's Atlanta headquarters.
Mr. Young, a former Air Force captain, said he was stunned when, at the age of 69, he was told he no longer had a job. He said he heard about Days Inns seeking older workers, applied for a job and, after three days' training, joined the pool of agents who make hotel reservations.
 
A Higher Success Rate
 The analysis of employees' productivity, made by ICF, measured how quickly agents worked, their success rate in making reservations, absentee and job-turnover rates, said Michael C. Barth, senior vice president of ICF and director of the Commonwealth Fund's study.
Analysts found, for example, that at Days Inns older workers might take a minute longer talking with callers, but they had a higher rate of success in making reservations. And older workers tended to stay on the job longer.
In Britain, the B&Q company found an additional benefit: older workers tended to be homeowners and were therefore more familiar than younger workers with the houseware and construction products sold by the chain.
To prove the capabilities of older workers to their skeptical store managers, the company staffed a new store entirely with workers over 50. The study found the store was 18 percent more profitable than five other B&Q outlets. It also found that the turnover rate was six times lower and that older workers were absent 39 percent less often than in the other stores.
B&Q was so impressed that another store employing workers over 50 was opened, and the company set a goal of 10 percent employment of older workers by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Notes and Bonds Narrowly Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds were narrowly mixed in quiet trading yesterday, as dealers began to prepare for a huge supply of new short-term securities.
This week the Treasury will sell $37.5 billion worth of new two-year and five-year notes as well as a 335-day cash management bill. 
 Those auctions follow yesterday's weekly sale of three-month and six-month bills.
At the bill auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.50 percent, unchanged from a week ago.
Bids on six-month bills produced an average rate of 5.66 percent, up slightly from the 5.63 percent average rate at last week's sale.
In advance of the note auctions, which will be held tomorrow and Thursday, traders said rates on the new securities to be sold look attractive. But they added that the sheer weight of the issues might force up yields even higher to attract demand.
"Distribution is everything," one Government securities trader said. "When everybody already owns securities and there is no business, the market tends to sag."
In lat trading, the new two-year notes, which will be sold tomorrow, were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.87 percent. The new five-year notes, which will be sold on Thursday, were offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 7.76 percent.
Indeed, some portfolio managers said that at this point it is difficult to justify committing large amounts of additional capital to the market.
"In the United States, along with a lot of other major markets, you won't get hurt a whole lot," said Robert Sinche, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Alliance Capital. "but you won't make a lot of money in them either."
Mr. Sinche said it would take a "convincing" change in the fundamental outlook to alter his view.
"Evidence of a relapse in the economy or signs that inflation is not going to moderate" would push interest rates out of their current range, he said.
 
Economy Still in Recession
 Despite some evidence that has suggested the economy may be turning, Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, told reporters in Washington yesterday that the economy was still in recession, and that the credit crunch had not abated.
Mr. Greenspan's comments stand in marked contrast to those made on Sunday by Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget.
In a television interview, Mr. Darman said that economic recovery had already begun.
Mr. Greenspan's comments did not provoke much of a reaction in the credit markets.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 98 10/32, up 1/32, to yield 8.27 percent, the same level as late Friday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 15/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 8.07 percent. And the 7 percent three-year notes were offered at 99 19/32, down 2/32, to yield 7.15 percent.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities was very slow, traders said.
Prices of most issues in both markets were essentially unchanged on the day.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo.

HEADLINE: Two Big California Utilities Plan to Cut CO<2> Emissions

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The Southern California Edison Company and the municipal utility that serves Los Angeles said yesterday that they would cut their emissions of carbon dioxide, which is believed to cause climate change, by 20 percent in the next 20 years.
The companies, the first American utilities to make such a promise, said the reductions would be achieved primarily through improving the efficiency with which electricity is used in lighting, cooling, heating and other uses. Other reductions would come by rebuilding plants that now burn oil and natural gas at low efficiency to burning gas at high efficiency and by buying more power made from wind, solar energy and geothermal heat. 
 Most of the steps would be required anyway, to reduce smog and keep electric rates as low as possible, the companies said. But environmentalists said the announcement showed the potential for utilities around the country to cut the emission of "greenhouse gases" at low cost.
At the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental group based in Washington, Daniel A. Lashof, the group's senior climate scientist, said, "It's something that all utilities could achieve."
The United States will have to be prominent in any effort to control greenhouse gases, Mr. Lashof said, adding that Southern California Edison, with a population area of 10 million, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, with 3.5 million people in its service territory, now emit more carbon dioxide than Portugal, Ireland or New Zealand emit from all sources.
The European Community has promised to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions in 2000 at 1990 levels, and some countries, especially Germany, have promised to go further. In international negotiations, the Bush Administration has refused to commit the United States to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, which would essentially mean reducing the use of fuel, especially coal.
The Administration has said, however, that it expects American emissions of all greenhouse gases to stabilize by 2000, as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, are phased out. CFC's are greenhouse gases that also destroy the ozone and that are being eliminated by treaty.
At the Environmental Protection Agency, Dennis A. Tirpak, director of the global climate change division, said that the ability of utilities to cut their carbon dioxide emissions would differ from company to company, but that the two California companies "certainly would be serving as an example for what other uiltiies might want to look at."
Southern California Edison, the nation's second-largest utility after the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal company, said that with no action, rapid growth of population and demand in their service areas would cause their emissions of carbon dioxide to grow rapidly.
Scientists disagree about how fast or how much the climate will change because of the man-made change in the concentration of carbon dixoide and other atmospheric gases. But John E. Bryson, the chairman and chief executive of Southern California Edison, said at a news conference in New York yesterday, "Taking prudent, reasonably economical steps to reduce carbon dioxide is warranted by the current state of knowledge."
The reductions, he said, were based on a "no regrets policy," meaning that most of the steps made sense for other reasons as well. Encouraging more efficient use of electricity is generally cheaper than building new power plants, he continued.
And state and local regulations in California will require the companies to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides about 75 percent in coming years, he said. Nitrogen oxides react with other gases in sunlight to form smog.
But the promise announced yesterday will require the companies to go further than other factors would push them. Vern Pruitt, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, estimated that his department would spend about $12 million a year, entailing rate increases of one-tenth of 1 percent, to pay for the program.
Mr. Bryson said that the additional cost for his company would be small, that he was not able to say how much it would be, but that the company would seek a rate increase.
 
Efforts Already Being Made
 Southern California Edison, a holding of SCEcorp, is already paying bonuses to home builders who construct energy-efficient houses, subsidizing customers who buy energy-efficient fluorescent light bulbs and adding "renewable energy" -- mostly solar, wind or geothermal, produced by small companies. Last month the company, with Texas Instruments Inc., announced a breakthrough in photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight directly into electricity.
While no American utilities have been ordered to cut carbon dioxide emissions, many expect carbon dioxide to be added to the list of pollutants they must minimize. Mr. Pruitt of the Department of Water and Power said his department would rather cut emissions itself than wait to be told to act.
"If you wait for the voters to begin a ballot initiative, you've waited too long," he said.

Two Chains Post Mixed Results

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The K Mart Corporation said yesterday that its earnings rose 7.3 percent in the first quarter, but profits fell nearly a third at Toys "R" Us Inc.
K Mart attributed its gains to new business from bargain-hunting consumers in the recession and to a shift in its merchandising strategy. 
 K Mart, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and several other discount retailers have thrived recently while others have lost sales because of the recession.
Following are the details of the companies' results:
 
K Mart
The retailer, based in Troy, Mich., said its earnings in the quarter that ended on May 1 totaled $107.5 million, or 53 cents a share, compared with $100.1 million, or 50 cents a share.
Overall sales rose 8.5 percent, to $7.64 billion from $7.04 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year, which are considered the best barometer of a retailer's performance, rose 4.3 percent, a strong showing during difficult times for the industry.
Some retailing analysts said K Mart's earnings exceeded their predictions and showed the strength of discounters during the economic slump.
Daniel Barry of Kidder, Peabody & Company said K Mart had also made several moves that were helping its sales, including the conversion to scanning checkout counters and the lowering of prices on household products.
K Mart operates more than 4,000 retail outlets in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada. That consists of 2,337 K Mart stores, as well as the company's Pay Less Drug Stores, Builders Square, Waldenbooks, Pace Membership Warehouse and Sports Authority stores.
K Mart's stock rose $1.375 yesterday, to $41.25 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
 
 
Toys 'R' Us
 Toys "R" Us, based in Rochelle Park, N.J., said it earned $22.3 million, or 8 cents a share, in the quarter that ended on May 4, down 32 percent from $33.2 million, or 11 cents a share.
The company said its overall sales rose to $1.03 billion from $944.8 million. Those from stores open at least a year fell 4.7 percent.
Toys "R" Us gave no reason for the earnings decline, but like other retailers, it has been hit hard as consumers scale back their spending. Although consumers were not expected to scrimp on purchases for their children, Toys "R" Us and other toy retailers saw their sales slump during the Persian Gulf crisis and remain depressed after the end of the war in early March.
The company's shares fell 12.5 cents each, to $27.625, yesterday on the Big Board.
The retailer operates 451 toy stores in the United States, 97 overseas, as well as 180 Kids "R" Us clothing stores.

HEADLINE: British Skills Are Winners at Indy

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIXWORTH, England

 BODY:
This Sunday's Indianapolis 500, which usually attract's the world's largest crowd for a one-day sporting event, will once again be a showcase of British automotive design and engineering skills.
There are no made-in-Britain labels on the sleek, spider-like racing cars at the Brickyard, where cars are plastered nose to tail with American brand names like Miller, Marlboro, Hertz and Pennzoil. But the engines and car bodies that dominate the Indy-class races are made mainly by specialized companies in England, whose workshops are a blend of high technology and hand craftsmanship. The dozens of specialist English manufacturers, foundries and suppliers in the Midlands and southern England comprise the Silicon Valley of auto racing. 
 In Britain, the motor-racing industry is a little-known success story that earns the country an estimated $1 billion a year from abroad in the sale of cars and parts and from international sponsorship attracted by British-based racing teams.
The British influence in Indy racing is repeated in Formula One, the top-performance racing series outside the United States. Roughly three-quarters of the Formula One cars are made in England by leading teams like McLaren, Williams and Lotus, although the Japanese, led by a team involving McLaren, which makes the bodies, and Honda, which makes successful racing engines, has made inroads on the Formula One circuit.
 
Going for 4th-Straight Indy Win
 The Chevrolet Indy V-8 engine has won the last three Indy 500's, and the winners of all 16 Indy-series races around the United States last season were equipped with Chevy power plants. Besides its nameplate, Chevrolet contributes mostly development money and a computerized engine-management system. The engine is designed and produced here in the English Midlands by Ilmor Engineering Ltd. The top chassis and body makers are Lola Cars Ltd. and Penske Cars Ltd., both in southern England.
In the qualifying rounds for the Indy 500, a Buick engine actually beat out speeds set by the Chevrolet Indy V-8. The Buick engine, which is built entirely in the United States, recorded the fastest speed, an average of 224.468 miles an hour over four laps, in a car driven by Gary Bettenhausen.
Of the 33 engines in the race on Sunday, the two most prevalent engines are the Chevrolet Indy V-8, which will power a dozen cars, and the Buick engine, which will be in 10 others. The Buick engine, which is made from a passenger car V-6 engine block, has never won an Indy race. It benefits from Indy 500 regulations that allow it have a larger piston displacement and greater turbocharge boost than specially designed racing engines.
England is the center of innovation and production in the auto-racing industry partly for historical reasons. Motor racing, like tennis, got its start as a sport here. But Britain has retained its traditional edge in auto racing by displaying a nimbleness in adapting quickly to changing technology and practices that the country has often lacked in other industries. Many people involved in auto racing recall the "club car" days of about 30 years ago, when a racing team meant a tweed-coated designer hunched over some drawings and surrounded by a couple of men in overalls who were building a car in a glorified garage.
Today, by contrast, the cars are designed with the aid of computers and months of wind-tunnel testing, and the chassis are predominantly made of vacuum-cured carbon fiber, which is fabricated in the pristine manufacturing environment of a "clean room."
Now, behind every car at Indianapolis is a team of more than a hundred manufacturing and racing specialists. Advancing the frontiers of automotive technology is expensive. That has meant attracting big-company sponsors to finance the multimillion-dollar effort of putting a car on the speedway. And those sponsors want their brandnames on winners.
"The technology, money and increased competitive pressures have transformed this industry in the past decade or so," said Nick Goozee, managing director of Penske Cars in Poole, where a 71-member work force designs and manufactures Indy car bodies for the Penske race team.
 
New Interest in Detroit
 The 1980's also marked a big shift in Detroit's thinking about auto racing. Because of the oil-price shocks of the 1970's, the racing programs of the Detroit auto makers took a back seat during that decade. "Muscle cars" were suddenly seen as unsafe and economically and environmentally gauche. Detroit was preoccupied with making cars lighter and cleaner.
Yet by the 1980's, Detroit again toyed with racing. The engineering challenges of Indy racing -- packaging a powerful but fuel-efficient engine in an aerodynamic body were the same ones Detroit faced in family sedans. In short, the technology transfer from racing seemed less tenuous than before. In addition, the General Motors Corporation decided that it wanted to burnish its image as a maker of high-performance cars by having its name on Indy winners.
The announcement by General Motors' Chevrolet division in October 1984 that it was going to back Ilmor Engineering was viewed as a sign of racing's genuine return to respectability in Detroit. "Chevrolet decided that it needed to win at Indianapolis," said Leon Mandel, publisher of AutoWeek magazine. "Backing Ilmor was the ultimate affirmation of its commitment to motor racing."
At the time, Ilmor was little more than the dream of its two founders, Mario Illien and Paul Morgan. They were supported by Roger Penske, the former race car driver, chairman of the car retailing and truck leasing company that bears his name, as well as the head of a leading Indy-car team.
Both of Ilmor's founders came from Cosworth Engineering Ltd., then the dominant producer of Indy-car engines, and just eight miles down the road from where Ilmor set up shop. Mr. Morgan had for years been a field representative for Cosworth, visiting the race teams using Cosworth engines. Mr. Penske was intrigued and agreed to back them financially in the early stages, even though the engine design did not yet exist. "I felt those two guys could do it," Mr. Penske explained last week.
"Not a line was on paper then," recalled Mr. Illien, a Swiss-born engine designer, who was convinced he could design an engine more poerful than the Cosworth offering. By the time Chevrolet agreed to fund the development costs and take a 25-percent stake in Ilmor (Mr. Penske and the two founders own the rest), the blueprints for the 32-valve V-8 engine were complete.
Seven months later, a prototype had been built and in August 1985 the driver Rick Mears gave the Chevy engine its first test run. Its race debut came in April 1986 at the Phoenix International Speedway in a car driven by Al Unser; a broken rear aerodynamic wing forced it to pull out.
 
Some Early Problems
 The Chevy engine had problems of its own during the first year or so. At the outset, the engines finished about two thirds of the races they started compared with more than 90 percent today. The two founders were constantly shuttling across the Atlantic, Mr. Illien especially. He can stand at the curve of a race track, listen for a ping, a whine or a murmur to detect an engine malady like a doctor with a stethoscope.
The constant attention to detail raised the Chevy engine's winning percentage. In 1987, the engine powered five winners; 14 in 1988; 12 in 1989; and all the Indy-series car races last year.
The Chevy engines are light, muscular and reliable -- and cost about $100,000 each. The V-8 packs 720 horsepower into 300 pounds of aluminum and steel. By contrast, a five liter, Chevy V-8 engine, which powers the full-sized Chevrolet Caprice used by many New York cabdrivers, weighs 606 pounds with an automatic transmission, and produces 170 horsepower.
Of the 3,000 parts in the Chevy Indy engine, 587 were designed, redesigned and refined by Ilmor. In the rigorous stress of racing, the durability of each part is crucial. In 1987 Indy 500, with just 22 laps of the 200-lap race remaining, Mario Andretti's Chevy-powered car was leading by a full lap. Then a valve spring broke, and the car lost. "We lost because a $10-part failed," Mr. Morgan said.
 
12-Hour Days
 The Ilmor production system is a tightly controlled team of 110 people at the Brixworth factory, backed up by a core of 20 suppliers from small foundries to specialized machine shops, all within 60 miles of Ilmor, each typically with the owner working in the shop. "You know you're going to get quality and performance from that type of firm," Mr. Morgan said.
At Brixworth, 12-hour days are the norm, weekend work is common and there is no overtime pay. "All that matters is getting an engine built on time in perfect working order," noted Paul Skelton, a senior production worker. Since Ilmor was founded with 10 refugees from Cosworth, only two workers have left, and Mr. Morgan gets three letters a day from job seekers.
Chevrolet executives decline to say precisely how much money they have invested in Ilmor or in racing overall. But they insist their multimillion-dollar investment in the Chevy engine pays dividends.
Herb Fishel, director of the Chevrolet Raceshop, which manages the company's racing program, says that the lessons learned on the track about engine packaging, electronics and reliability can be applied to enhancing the performance of future family cars. And the production discipline of racing is invaluable for young engineers at a time when Detroit is straining to hasten its development of new models and engines. "Racing is no ivory tower environment," Mr. Fishel said. "You find out very quickly come Sunday afternoon whether something works or it doesn't."
The marketing payoff from racing is often measured by the number of "impressions" or "mentions" of the Chevrolet in the press, television and at the race track. For his part, Mr. Fishel measures it more simply. "Winning the Indy 500 is one hell of a marketing tool," he said.

HEADLINE: SOVIET ECONOMISTS IN HARVARD TALKS

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 20

 BODY:
Reflecting a sense of desperation in the Soviet Union, a team of high-level Soviet economists began meetings here today with American professors to draw up a plan that they hope could save the Russian economy by offering sweeping reforms in exchange for a huge program of Western aid. 
 Graham Allison, a former dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University who is acting as host for the talks, said the group was looking for "Marshall Plan scale aid," ranging from $15 billion to $30 billion a year for several years.
Mr. Allison said he and the others envisioned the trade of economic and political change in the Soviet Union for Western aid as "a grand bargain."
Several specialists at Harvard who are not participating in the talks immediately expressed skepticism over where the money would come from at a time of economic difficulty in the United States and Europe. They also questioned whether any real reform program could be carried out now in the Soviet Union, as both the political and economic systems face paralysis.
But Stanley Fischer, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that the Soviet team for the first time had shown evidence that it was prepared to do serious economic analysis, which he said had been missing from a series of earlier Soviet reform plans and is a precondition for any Western aid.
 
'The Grand Bargain'
 "If we can get this right, then the grand bargain makes sense," said Mr. Fischer, a former chief economist for the World Bank.
The team of seven Russian economists is headed by Grigory A. Yavlinsky, considered by many Western experts to be the most competent Soviet economist well-placed in the Kremlin. At a news conference at the Kennedy School today, Mr. Yavlinsky said the talks had the support of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whom he met on Saturday in Moscow before leaving for the United States.
Many of the changes, including the creation of a market economy, privatization and political decentralization, have been proposed over the last two years, only to be rejected by Mr. Gorbachev or to fall victim to opposition from hard-line Communists. The 39-year-old Mr. Yavlinksy was himself the main architect of one of the rebuffed programs, known as the 500-day plan.
But he stressed that there is now both a greater sense of crisis in the Soviet Union and a greater opportunity for change, following the agreement worked out in April between President Gorbachev and the heads of 9 of the 15 Soviet republics to share power. "The train is coming to the station," Mr. Yavlinsky said, speaking in English.
 
Role for Group of Seven
 In addition, Mr. Yavlinsky said this is also the first major plan to include an active role for the Group of Seven industrialized powers, which are scheduled to meet in London in July.
At the news conference, Mr. Allison said the group's immediate objective was to produce a 25-page working paper this week that could be given to Mr. Gorbachev and officials of the Group of Seven -- the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Japan. Mr. Allison said the talks are a continuation of discussions he had with the Russian team in Moscow last week.
The Americans taking part in the discussions besides Mr. Allison and Mr. Fischer are Jeffrey D. Sachs, a professor of economics at Harvard who helped draw up the blueprint for transforming Poland's economy, and Robert D. Blackwill, a professor at the Kennedy School who until last September was President Bush's special assistant on the National Security Council for the Soviet Union and Western Europe.
In addition to Mr. Yavlinsky, the others in the Soviet group are Tatyana Yarygina, Mikhail Zadornov, Aleksei Mikhailov, Aleksei Makushkin, Aleksei Melnikov and Olga Radaeva.
 
Pledge From Soviet Expert
 Mr. Fischer, who acknowledged he himself had previously been somewhat skeptical of Soviet liberalization plans, said he had agreed to participate because Mr. Yavlinsky insisted the Russians had now decided to do detailed economic analysis before asking for Western aid. Mr. Fischer said it would be possible to do such an analysis in only a few days because the group could draw on a study done last year by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for the Group of Seven.
The invitation for the Russians' visit to Harvard was extended by Mr. Allison, who has been traveling to the Soviet Union at least once a month over the last year and a half as a consultant. Mr. Allison, who returned to Cambridge only Sunday after meeting with Mr. Yavlinsky last week in Moscow, also put together the team of American specialists. The project has been funded by the Carnegie Corporation.
Some other specialists at Harvard were caught by surprise by the arrival of the Russian team, and they expressed doubt about the outcome.
"The odds of this thing working out without the collapse of the Soviet Union are unlikely," said Marshall Goldman, a professor of economics at Wellesley College and deputy director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard.
"I give them credit for trying," Mr. Goldman said. "But even if we could come up with our part of the deal, there's no guarantee the Soviets can do theirs. I'm not sure anyone is in control in the Soviet Union," he said.

HEADLINE: Panel Finds Wide Abuse in Student Loan Program

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
The Federal student loan program is "plagued with fraud and abuse at every level," allowing shady trade school operators to prey on the poor and rob taxpayers of billions of dollars, a yearlong Senate investigation concluded today.
The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said the Department of Education, through "gross mismanagement, ineptitude and neglect," had "all but abdicated its responsibility" to students and taxpayers alike. 
 As a result, the program's future is "hanging in the balance," said Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia and chairman of the panel.
These conclusions come as Congress is expected to approve major changes this year in the student loan program, as part of its reconsideration of the laws governing higher education, which expire this year.
Education Secretary Lamar Alexander has acknowledged the need for major changes and proposed new guidelines last month. In a statement today, Michael J. Farrell, Mr. Alexander's chief aide for the loan program, said the Senate report "provides significant and very usable information, and this will make my job easier."In eight years, losses under the program have risen more than 500 percent, to $2.7 billion last year from $448 million in 1983. Losses to taxpayers over that time total almost $13 billion.
The investigation traced many of the program abuses to profit-seeking trade schools, which account for 22 percent of the loans but 44 percent of the defaults. While 10 percent of the students at four-year schools default on their loans, the report said, 39 percent of the students at trade schools do so.
Many of the trade schools aggressively recruit the poor, passing out leaflets in housing projects and welfare offices. School representatives help the students sign up federally guaranteed loans for thousands of dollars, much of which is turned over to the schools.
Those trade schools promise lucrative jobs as, for example, truck drivers, beauticians or medical assistants, but the students often lack the ability to complete the courses. In other cases, the courses themselves are flawed, taught in ill-equipped buildings by unqualified teachers. As a result, the investigation concluded, many students wind up worse off than they started, still unemployed and now deeply in debt. When they default on the loans, the taxpayers pay through the loan guarantees to the banks.
Examples of abuses heard in testimony included that of a Texas truck driving school that arranged $5,000 in loans for a student who could not get a state license because she had only one foot.
Some industry representatives said abuses were limited. Stephen Blair, president of the National Association of Trade and Technical Schools, a lobbying group, said in a statement today that the trade schools play a central role in training Americans for skilled jobs. But he added, "We agree that Federal student aid programs must be reformed."
The schools are regulated by three layers of authority, from state licensing agencies, private accrediting groups and the Education Department. But state agencies are often "woefully undermanned," the report said, "accreditation can be bought," and the Education Department has "a dismal record" of indifference to the abuses.
The panel also faulted unscrupulous lenders and collection agencies.

HEADLINE: Indian Treaty Accord in Wisconsin

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 20

 BODY:
After several years of ugly confrontations between whites and Indians in northern Wisconsin, state officials and the Chippewa Indians today announced an end to a 17-year legal battle over 19th-century treaty rights.
The agreement came after rulings in March by Federal District Judge Barbara Crabb in Madison, Wis., that both sides agreed not to appeal. One ruling prevents the Chippewas from seeking $325 million in damages over loss of treaty rights, while another protects the tribe's right to gather plants, hunt and spearfish off reservations in northern Wisconsin. 
 "The spearfishing dispute has captured the imagination," Jim Haney, a spokesman for Attorney General James Doyle Jr. of Wisconsin, said today. "But this case has involved an awful lot more than fish."
The rulings also put strict limits on the number of fish the Chippewa can catch and prevents the band from harvesting timber off the reservation. Timber and tourism are two staples of the area's economy.
 
A Battle Over Spearfishing
 Since the mid-1980's, spearfishing has been the most sharply disputed element of the long fight over the treaties. In the spring, angry whites held demonstrations at dozens of lakes in northern Wisconsin as Chippewa Indians, largely from the Lac du Flambeau Reservation, followed their ancient practice of spearfishing for walleye pike spawning in the shallow water.
Although the larger legal battle began in the 1970's, the spearfishing dispute intensified after a 1983 Federal court decision affirming Chippewa rights to take fish from lakes in the northern third of Wisconsin. In treaties signed in 1837 and 1842, the Chippewa ceded the territory, including the lakes, to the Federal Government. In return, they were guaranteed the right to hunt, fish and cut timber.
Today most of those lakes are surrounded by cottages, resorts and businesses owned by non-Indians. Their livelihoods depend on tourism and sport fishing.
The whites accused the Indians of exploiting tribal fishing rights to strip some lakes of valuable sporting fish. Spearfishing is illegal for non-Indians.
The spearfishing season starts in April, soon after the ice begins to break. The fishing season for everyone else in Wisconsin opens on May 1.
At first the protests consisted mainly of name-calling and death threats, but in 1989 a few demonstrators in motor boats began speeding across the lakes to disrupt the spearfishing.
That spring more than 200 whites were arrested in protests. In 1990 about 100 were arrested. But this spring there were only three arrests.
Dean Crist, a spokesman for Stop Treaty Abuse-Wisconsin, a group of non-Indians opposed to spearfishing, said the intensity of the protests had decreased because "we knew the state would win on appeal, so why bother?"
He said he felt betrayed by the Attorney General's decision not to appeal.
"It's a right afforded to one group and not to another," Mr. Crist said. "We have two sets of rules, two laws, and that's nuts. There's no sport to spearfishing. It's like shoveling up potatoes."
There also was uncertainty among the Chippewa about the announcement.
Nick Hockings, a spearfisherman, expressed doubts about the decision not to appeal the ruling that prevents the Chippewa from harvesting timber and seeking damages. "I just hope it doesn't come back to haunt the tribal council on another day," he said.
Mr. Haney, the State Attorney General's spokesman, said the Chippewa decision not to appeal was a major factor in the agreement. He said a similar case involving Indian claims of damages against Alaska was being considered by the United States Supreme Court. If the Court rules in favor of the Indians, he added, the Chippewa case will have have been strengthened.
Mr. Doyle, the State Attorney General, said the agreement not only puts to rest "a long and costly legal battle," but also "allows us to open a new chapter in state and tribal relations."

LTV Puts Past Glory On Block

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, May 20

 BODY:
The LTV Corporation, which had long insisted it would not sell its once-renowned aircraft and military electronics operations, said today that it was putting those glamour assets on the block to help meet future pension obligations.
The decision to sell the division that has built combat planes since shortly after World War I raised fresh anxieties for the aircraft unit's 16,100 employees. It also underscored the high price LTV must pay to make good on pledges made more than 10 years ago to pay income and health benefits to its current and future retirees. 
 The steel company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 1986, saying it could not afford to finance $2 billion in future pension liabilities. But the Supreme Court ruled in June that bankrupt companies could not force the Federal Government to assume pension obligations.
 
Could Happen to Others
 Industry consultants said that a prolonged recession could place other companies with underfinanced pension obligations and their creditors in a similar trap of being forced to raise cash for retirement programs by selling operations.
"In a recession, some of these companies are going to hit financial hard times," said Harry Conaway, a principal in the Washington office of William M. Mercer, a benefits consulting firm. "Their unfunded pension liabilities are going to become big burdens."
Other major companies that had funded less than two-thirds of their pension obligations at the end of last year included Pan American World Airways; the Western Union Corporation (now the New Valley Corporation); Carter Hawley Hale Stores, and the Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company, according to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Federal agency that insures business pension programs.
 
Payroll Has Shrunk
 LTV's payroll has shrunk with the rest of the domestic steel industry, so that the company today supports four retirees for every worker, compared with just one retiree for every worker in 1980.
LTV's president and chief executive, David H. Hoag, said he wanted to use cash from the sale of the LTV Aerospace and Defense Company to reduce the burden of pension obligations, now increased to $3.1 billion, that LTV's steel operations would carry after the company emerged from bankruptcy. Some analysts said LTV might have difficulty finding a buyer for the unit and might sell it piecemeal.
Mr. Hoag's predecessor as chief executive, Raymond A. Hay, who is chairman, had said often that the aerospace and defense company would continue as part of LTV under any reorganization plan.
Creditors of the aircraft unit assailed the move. They said that a cash transfer into the steel division would slash the amount of money available to repay $170 million in unsecured loans that they advanced to the LTV aircraft unit before the bankruptcy.
 
Few Buyers Seen
 Attempts to sell the aircraft unit this year may draw few bidders and a painfully low price because of recession in the aerospace industry and Pentagon budget cuts.
Paul H. Nisbet, an aerospace analyst at Prudential Securities Inc., said few rivals could afford to bid for the company, with the possible exceptions of the Boeing Company and the Lockheed Corporation. "There is not a great deal of demand for aerospace companies, particularly defense properties," he said. "The price would have to be awfully low."
The company said it would receive investment banking help from Lehman Brothers to negotiate a sale.
Current projects of the aerospace and defense company include making parts of the B-2 stealth bomber and parts of the C-17 cargo aircraft. It has large plants in Buffalo, Dallas, Indianapolis and several other cities. Revenues at the aerospace and missiles unit were $2 billion last year, and have declined steadily from $2.56 billion in 1987. Its order backlog amounts to $5 billion.
Just this month the company won a $1.5 billion order from Boeing to make sections of its 747 jumbo jet and parts for 757 and 767 airliners.
 
Posted Recent Losses
 The unit, including missiles and electronics, earned $165 million from operations in 1987 but has since been buffeted by Pentagon reductions and its own troubles with cost overruns. It lost $84.7 million in 1989 and $17.3 million in 1990.
LTV's steel operations, the nation's third largest after United States Steel and Bethlehem, contributed more than $4 billion of the company's total revenues last year.
Mark Feldman, a lawyer for the aerospace creditors committee, called plans to sell the aerospace company "a cynical and ill-conceived attempt to confiscate the value which rightfully belongs to the aerospace creditors."
"There is no business justification whatsoever to sell aerospace at this time," he continued.
The group is one of five creditor councils whose members have not received payments on $4.9 billion in debts since LTV entered bankruptcy. Earlier this month, LTV proposed a reorganization plan that would pay creditors 7 cents to 26 cents on the dollar in new stock.
 
Value Has Decreased
 The aerospace unit might have attracted bids of $2 billion in 1987, but the current value probably is less than $500 million, analysts said. LTV said earlier this month it had to raise $300 million in cash soon as part of its proposed, 30-year funding program for the retiree funds. Howard A. Rubel, an analyst at C.J. Lawrence Inc., said the aerospace unit probably would be sold piecemeal to several bidders.
LTV was founded in Dallas in 1961 as the result of a series of mergers and acquisitions by James Ling. Ling Electric acquired Temco, an electronics and missile company, in 1960, and the next year Ling-Temco acquired Chance Vought, which had been founded on Long Island in 1917. The company's colorful legacy in aviation includes the VE-7, the first plane to fly from a naval carrier in the 1920's; the F4U Corsair that downed Japanese foes at a rate of 11 to 1 in World War II, and the A-7 Corsair II, which pilots have flown in combat from Vietnam to Iraq.
The missiles and electronics unit makes the Army's multiple launching rocket systems and the Hummer, the modern replacement of the Jeep.

Orion Is Revising Debt To Lower Its Payments

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
The Orion Pictures Corporation announced a extensive restructuring yesterday, intended to reduce its interest payments by about $400 million through the 1998 fiscal year.
"If the bondholders buy the deal, the controlling shareholder, John Kluge, is accepting a reduced ownership position in exchange for increasing Orion's chances of survival," said Mark Manson, an analyst at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation. Mr. Kluge, the chairman of the Metromedia Company, owns 68 percent of Orion. 
 Despite the release of two recent hit films, "Dances with Wolves" and "Silence of the Lambs," Orion reported a loss of $62.9 million for the fiscal year that ended on Feb. 28, compared with a profit of $15 million the previous year. Despite revenues from the two films, which were released near the end of the fiscal year, Orion's future cash-flow problems were sufficiently severe to force a restructuring.
 
$32.8 Million in Losses
 The company said that its revenues for the year had risen to $584 million, from $485 million, but that it had $32.8 million in losses that were attributed to write-downs. Those were related to certain theatrical films, as a result of reduced estimates of future revenues in American markets.
Movie companies have discretion in writing off their film costs. They can project what they believe a film's revenues will be in various markets -- theatrical, pay television or network television, for example. Then a company can write off a film's costs based on the projections.
If the projections were optimistic for pay TV, for example, Orion could write off more of a movie's costs in later years, when it is shown on pay TV. That would help current profits. Apparently, Orion had made optimistic projections that it was now revising, causing it to take heavy write-downs in its most recent fiscal year.
William Bernstein, Orion's president, said yesterday that many of the markets had declined in value because of the recession.
 
$285 Million in Debt
 Orion, based in New York, said it would replace about $285 million principal amount of six classes of its subordinated debt. Debtholders are to receive $750 million in zero-coupon convertible senior subordinated debentures due on May 15, 1998, and either 42 or 37 shares of Orion common stock, depending upon the ranking of the subordinated debt to be exchanged, for each $1,000 principal amount of the subordinated debt.
The deal depends on 80 percent of the outstanding subordinated debt being tendered in response to the offer.
The restructuring is expected to meet some resistence from bondholders, who are being asked to swap high-interest notes for zero-coupon bonds and stock that pay no dividend. The offer could dilute Orion's 22 million common shares to as many as 48 million.
"They have to assess what the company's position would be if we got no relief from the debt payments that we have," Mr. Bernstein said.
 
Debt Breakdown
 The exchange offer covers $200 million principal amount of senior subordinated reset notes due in August 1998, $50 million principal amount of 10 percent subordinated debentures due in February 1994, $22.2 million principal amount of 11 percent subordinated sinking-fund debentures due in July 1998, $8 million principal amount of 10 percent subordinated sinking-fund debentures due in March 1999 and $2 million principal amount of 6 percent class A senior subordinated note and 12 percent class B senior subordinated notes due in February 1992.
The convertible debentures to be issued in exchange for the outstanding debt will be convertible into Orion common stock at $11 a share or at a conversion ratio of about 48.45 shares for every $750 principal amount of the convertible debentures, assuming an exchange date of June 15.
The convertible debentures can also be sold to Orion in 1996 at a price of $682.26 for every $750 principal amount of the convertible debentures, also assuming an exchange date of June 15.

Vice President Dan Quayle pressed Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and other officials today to open Japan to more American exports and investments as a crucial step toward improving relations with the United States.
But Japanese officials were still resisting American demands in several trade disputes that were being negotiated while Mr. Quayle held meetings with Japanese leaders. The American negotiators said that in many cases Japan's stance was "disappointing." 
 At a news conference this morning, Mr. Quayle emphasized the importance of Japanese concessions in easing its ban on rice imports as a spur to the so-called Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations.
 
'This Is a Must'
 "Everything, including sensitive agricultural commodities, will have to be put on the table," he said of the trade talks. "This isn't a maybe. This is a must."
The Vice President also stressed, once again, the importance of making it easier for American auto manufacturers to distribute cars in Japan.
Asked about Japanese criticism of the United States' economic record, specifically regarding the savings rate and the Federal deficit, Mr. Quayle said, "It's a point well taken." But he added that budget deficits would fall somewhat in the next five years.
Mr. Quayle had held rounds of meetings on Monday with American and Japanese business leaders, as well as with Mr. Kaifu and members of his Cabinet. Among the discussions were expressions of American gratitude for Japan's financial contribution to the Persian Gulf war.
Mr. Quayle was also said to have thanked Japan for agreeing last week to increase its emergency aid to Nicaragua to $70 million, from $50 million, to help the Managua Government pay its debts.
Aides to Mr. Quayle said the Vice President appealed to Japan's "enlightened self-interest" by urging Tokyo to open Japanese markets to the rice imports, American-made computer chips, construction companies and others seeking access.
These aides said the Vice President stressed that he was a friend of Japan and defended Tokyo against demands for more trade sanctions during the 1988 Presidential election, but that Japan had to do more to preserve its "overall relationship" with the United States.
 
Specifics on Automobiles
 Mr. Quayle was said to have avoided specifics in most of his requests, except in the case of the automobile industry, in which he asked for specific steps that would allow more imports of American-made auto parts and let American car makers sell vehicles through Japanese dealers.
The main negotiations this week had to do with the initiative to remove "structural impediments" to trade. The United States, for instance, wants Japan to crack down on interlocking corporate cartels that stifle competition and prevent sales of foreign-made products. The Japanese are resisting these demands.

HEADLINE: U.S. Lauds Soviet Law but Wants to Read Details

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
The Bush Administration praised the Soviet legistature's passage today of a long-anticipated free emigration bill, but the White House said it wanted to read the fine print before it decided to grant Moscow the trade benefits that were conditioned on the bill's passage.
The White House also said it was considering but had not yet decided how to respond to an appeal from the Soviets to join directly in drafting and financing a plan for economic and political reform that Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet President, wants to discuss with the leaders of the major Western industrialized nations at their mid-July summit conference in London. 
 Passage of the Soviet emigration bill, and the latest economic proposals, coincided with the arrival in Washington of Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, the Soviet Chief of General Staff, for negotiations with senior Administration officials aimed at resolving the last disputes holding up the conventional arms reduction agreement for Europe. General Moiseyev held daylong talks with an American delegation headed by Reginald Bartholomew, Under Secretary of State for Security Affairs.
President Bush, after meeting with the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, said "not much progress" had been made in the arms talks. But he made it plain that if that hurdle could be cleared, he was eager for a summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev.
 
New Level of Cooperation
 These various developments, while seemingly unrelated and involving both economic and arms-control issues, are in fact part of a series of tradeoffs that the White House and the Kremlin are hoping to make, not only to pave the way for wide-ranging talks between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev, probably in Moscow in late June or early July, but also to take Soviet-American cooperation to a new level.
The Soviets seem to be turning increasingly to the United States to help dig them out of their economic depression, and the Administration is having to decide how far it wants to go and what recompense it might seek.
Mr. Bush agreed at his summit meeting in Washington in 1990 to give the Soviet Union most-favored-nation trading status, which would enable the Soviets to export their goods to the United States at lower tariffs. The status was contingent on the emigration bill. Today the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, adopted a cautiously optimistic approach about the next step.
"We have not seen the text of the legislation or the implementing resolution as passed, and would prefer to withhold judgment on specifics until we have been able to review it in detail," she said. "The very fact that procedures once subject to the arbitrary application of unpublished regulations are now established in law in our view is a positive development."
The new law gives most Soviet citizens the right to travel abroad but does not state when travel restrictions would be lifted. The Supreme Soviet approved a separate resolution establishing a target date of Jan. 1, 1993 for the law to take effect. The bill also requests that the Cabinet report within two weeks on whether some elements of the law can take effect earlier.
"Obviously, we would prefer to see it implemented faster," said Miss Tutwiler, "but that does not detract from something that we have been fighting for for two decades, and that is why we also want to have more clarity and understanding concerning the step-by-step implementation. The other part of this that we understand was passed also, we have not yet seen the detail and fine print in that."
On the visit from General Moiseyev, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Administration was not looking to cut any deals with the Soviets but rather to convince the General to abide by the treaty as written.
"We want compliance with the original treaty," he said.
The dispute is over four naval infantry regiments, equipped with 1,100 tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery pieces. The Soviets have argued that this equipment, which is restricted by the treaty, should be free of limitations. The Soviets contend that, because the treaty deals only with ground forces, such forces under naval command should not be limited.
This interpretation is not shared by any other signatories, and it reflects the disgruntlement of the Soviet military over political leaders' failure to insist that the treaty limit naval forces, where the West has superiority. Washington was expected to agree that the equipment of these naval infantry units could be excluded -- provided a similar amount of ground equipment from their regular army forces was withdrawn or destroyed instead.
A similar compromise formula was used to resolve an almost identical dispute raised by the Soviet military over its coastal defense units, which it also wanted excluded from the treaty.
General Moiseyev is to meet tomorrow with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in an effort to resolve the dispute, which has strained relations between Moscow and Washington.
On the question of the President Gorbachev's request to attend the economic summit, Mr. Fitzwater said the President "will be consulting with" leaders of the other industrialized nations, "but we have not resolved this matter now." A senior State Department official said the British, as hosts, would take the lead in deciding the question, and Mr. Kohl and Mr. Bush both left the matter open when they met reporters in the White House Rose Garden this evening after their talks.
Nor would either leader make any substantive comment about the new Soviet economic proposals, which were discussed today in Cambridge, Mass.
But a senior State Department official said that Mr. Kohl had insisted that any Western participation in drafting or financing the program should include a large measure of what he described as "self-help" by the Soviets and not just grants from the West. Mr. Bush was also said to be opposed to large new credits at this time.

HEADLINE: SOVIETS ENACT LAW FREEING MIGRATION AND TRIPS ABROAD

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 20

 BODY:
The Soviet Parliament today overwhemingly approved the country's first law granting citizens the right to travel and emigrate freely.
It enacted a separate resolution putting the law into effect by January 1993. The delay was the result of widespread misgivings about the country's ability to handle the high costs that will result from the legislation. The law originally proposed was to go into effect a year earlier. 
 Its passage by the Supreme Soviet removes a major obstacle to American trade concessions and credits, which are sorely needed to help bolster the ailing Soviet economy.
 
Obstacle to Soviet Trade
 Under American law, the Soviet Union is barred from obtaining most-favored-nation trading status, which fixes the tariffs on a country's exports to the United States at the lowest prevailing rate, and credits from the Export-Import Bank until free emigration is allowed.
[The Bush Administration praised the Soviet Parliament's passage of the emigration bill, but the White House said it wanted to read the fine print before it decided to grant Moscow the trade benefits that were conditioned on the bill's passage. Page A8.]
The so-called freedom-of-movement bill endured two years of delays in Parliament, numerous revisions in committee and hours of debate about its potential drain on the country's economy and manpower. Only a week ago, the bill was sent back to committee, a move that some feared would delay it at least three months.
 
'Building a Law-Based State'
 In the end, the lawmakers seemed to have decided that the bill's moral consequence outweighed practical considerations, and voted 320 to 37, with 32 abstentions, for its approval.
"This is a sign, finally, that the Soviet Union values human rights, as do people all over the world," said Fyodor M. Burlatsky, editor of Literaturnaya Gazeta and a legislator who lobbied for the measure. "It is truly a breakthrough moment for us in building a law-based state."
The new law is likely to cause concern in Western countries fearful of a huge exodus of Soviet people of all ethnic and religious groups. Currently, the only Soviet citizens leaving in any number are Jews and ethnic Germans, many of them headed to Israel and Germany. Those countries may now require visas, thereby limiting the entry of Soviet citizens.
Supporters of the bill said its passage was critical to breaking both the centuries-old isolation of the country and a mind-set that views the outside world as inherently threatening.
"There can never again be such an us-versus-them mentality," said Vladimir I. Samarin, a lawmaker. "This was not only important for appearances to the West, but more so for the rights and lives of our own people."
Opponents of the bill had succeeded in obstructing its path to becoming law, insisting until the last moment that putting it into practice would cost billions of dollars and only satisfy a selfish minority. Further, they argued, the money could be better spent on needs more pressing for the average Soviet worker.
Officials have estimated that the law will cost about $20 billion in expanding customs and passport services as well as transport and border patrols.
Many people active in protecting human rights here said such financial considerations were raised as a smokescreen by hard-line Communists who oppose the very idea of allowing Soviet citizens the freedom to travel and emigrate.
Supporters of the bill said that such pressure was sufficient to stall the bill for two years, but that the situation began to turn around two weeks ago, when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came out strongly behind the law.
 
Economic Impact
 Mr. Burlatsky and other legislators familiar with the back-room negotiations on the bill said Mr. Gorbachev had grave concerns about the economic effects of the bill and the "brain drain" that might follow if borders were opened.
These lawmakers said that the Soviet President had long ago been given erroneous information that eight million of the country's best and brightest people would leave in the first year after the law was passed, and that it took much lobbying to persuade him such numbers were exaggerations intended to thwart passage of the legislation.
"He kept saying, 'We won't have anyone to help us build perestroika,' " Mr. Burlatsky related. "He was very worried and he is still worried that so many talented people will leave."
Although Mr. Gorbachev did not attend the legislative debates on the bill, as he often does when he is keenly interested in assuring the outcome of an issue important to him, members of Parliament said there was a noticeable change in the proceedings once the President spoke out.
"People began to understand that the law was not a burden to society," said Yuri A. Reshetov, head of a Foreign Ministry department on international cooperation and human rights. "There are international obligations that are a higher priority, like human rights."
Under pressure from the West and in the more democratic political climate fostered by Mr. Gorbachev, the Soviet authorities have in recent years considerably relaxed travel and emigration restrictions that for decades stood in the way of arms control and other negotiations.
Last year, about 400,000 people emigrated from the Soviet Union, many of them Jews leaving for Israel , and nearly four million traveled abroad on business or personal trips.
Even without a free-travel law, Soviet travel and emigration has soared in the Gorbachev era. In the mid-1970's, the number of emigrants fluctuated between 20,000 and 40,000. and during much of the Reagan Administration, the level was well below 10,000 departures a year.
 
Codifying a Trend
 The new law transforms these recent trends into legal guarantees. It sets specific time limits for issuing passports and strict guidelines for refusing permission.
It limits to five years the time that a person can be refused a passport for having worked in a job involving state secrets. The Government must also inform people if they are working in such a job, so that they have a right to refuse the assignment. Previously, the Government greatly abused the so-called secrecy law as a means of preventing emigration.
And the law establishes an appeals process for those whose applications are rejected.
Although Parliament voted to postpone full application of the law, it gave the Government a two-week deadline to draw up plans for it, so that certain articles will be put into effect immediately and the law will be completely in place as of the Jan. 1, 1993. deadline.
 
Dual Citizenship Possible
 Among those articles expected to be approved immediately is an end to current legislation that automatically strips emigrants to Israel of Soviet citizenship.
By gaining the right to travel and emigrate, Soviet citizens are by no means guaranteed the opportunity to move to other countries. The United States and Western Europe have strict immigration quotas that will curb any large-scale wave of emigration.
While disappointed with the delay, Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F. Petrovsky said it was the "optimum solution" given the bill's arduous progress into law.
"Personally, my ministry would like to have it as soon as possible," said Mr. Petrovsky, an ardent advocate of the bill. But he added that "we have finally put our domestic legislation in line with international law."

HEADLINE: No Sword and No Kneeling, Schwarzkopf Is Knighted

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., May 20

 BODY:
In a brief private ceremony in his office at MacDill Air Force Base here, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf today became the ninth American military officer to receive an honorary knighthood from a King or Queen of England.
Because he is not a British subject, General Schwarzkopf did not have to kneel and be tapped on the shoulder by Queen Elizabeth II when he was knighted. The Queen simply handed him a box containing the cross and silver star of the Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, British Embassy officials said. The ceremony was closed to the news media and public. 
 In recent days, the Queen's intention to honor General Schwarzkopf only added to widespread speculation about a political future for the victorious commander of the Persian Gulf war. But today the general seemed to flatly rule out any such move.
 
An Emphatic Answer
 As he stood outside Central Command Headquarters here moments before the Queen arrived this morning, reporters who were positioned about 20 yards away shouted questions at him.
Would he run for public office, the General was asked.
"No," he said.
And in case anyone had any doubts, he mouthed an "N" and an "O" and drew the two letters in the air before him.
Then the Queen arrived with her retinue. Before the ceremony, the Queen was led by General Schwarzkopf on a tour of the war room. There she saw a four-minute video of fighting from the gulf war.
Next, she was shown the crisis situation room with five lights -- labeled "cocked pistol," "fast pace," "roundhouse," "double take," and "fade out" -- designating different levels of alert for the Central Command forces.
In a light rain, the Queen was given a quick tour, which included seeing two F-16 fighter jets and a receiving line filled with military personnel who had served in the gulf war and their families.
 
Big Crowd in Texas
 The Queen, Prince Philip and their party then boarded a Concorde jet and flew to Texas, the next stop on the royal couple's 13-day official visit to the United States. Upon landing at Bergstrom Air Force Base in Austin, Queen Elizabeth became the first British monrach to visit Texas, according to the British Consul General in Houston, John Garner.
The royal entourage was driven to the state capitol, where a crowd of thousands spilled over the broad lawn. Many women wore flower-bedecked straw hats. Little girls, some carrying ruffled parasols, looked as though they had dressed for an English tea party as they waited in the sun.
The Salute Battery of the Texas Army Guard gave a 21-gun salute when the Queen stepped from her limousine. When she was led by Gov. Ann Richards through a saber arch to the Capitol steps, the University of Texas Longhorn Band burst into "The Yellow Rose of Texas."
Mayor Lee Cooke welcomed the Queen and told of how the Capitol, a red granite Italian Renaissance Revival structure completed in 1888, was built with the help of British investors. Texas, cash-poor and land-rich at the time, traded three million acres to a Chicago syndicate with British stockholders to build the capitol.
 
Praise for Texans
 The Queen gave a brief speech on the Capitol steps that centered on a theme of mutual economic ties between Texas and Britain.
"The strength of Texas expertise has notably helped us to find and use the oil fields in the North Sea," she said. "The New World has returned to develop the Old."
There was tumultuous cheering when the Queen observed that "lesser mortals are pitied for their misfortune in not being born Texan."
The honorary knighthood is the highest honor Britain can bestow on a foreigner. The knighthood has two ranks. Britain bestowed the top rank, Knight Grand Cross, on Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower and five other American commanders: two generals, George C. Marshall and Douglas MacArthur, and three admirals, Chester W. Nimitz, William D. Leahy and Ernest J. King.
General Schwarzkopf received the second rank, that of knight commander, as did Gens. Mark Clark and Matthew Ridgway before him.
Other Americans, including former President Ronald Reagan in 1989 have also received honorary knighthoods.
A similar honor has been given to Lieut. Gen. Khaled Bin Sultan, the Saudi field commander in the gulf war.
Foreign recipients do not use the title "sir," and after the Queen's departure, General Schwarzkopf told reporters: "Nobody is going to call me 'sir.' A few may call me 'General Sir.' "
He said he had thanked the Queen for the honor, adding that Americans and British were "brothers in arms, comrades in arms," and that the knighthood honored them as well.
He called the Queen and Prince Philip, whom he first met at a White House state dinner last week, "lovely, charming people."
Asked if he had been nervous about meeting the Queen and receiving the knighthood, the general said that by comparison, "Saddam was a piece of cake."
But he added that the royal couple "go out of their way to make sure people like me aren't nervous."
 
Awards in New York
 Former First Lady Nancy Reagan and General Schwarzkopf shared a stage last night when they received 1991 Albert Schweitzer Leadership Awards at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan.
Also honored was Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, chairman of Merck & Company, a pharmaceutical concern. The awards were presented by the Hugh O'Brian Youth Foundation, an organization started by the actor to recognize and develop leadership qualities among high school sophomores.
General Schwarzkopf's award was presented by Andrea Turnbough, a 10-year-old fifth grader from El Paso, Tex., who became the General's pen pal during the Persian Gulf war.
In her first letter to him last fall, written as part of a class project to correspond with troops, Andrea said she was writing to him because she thought he as the commander might not get any letters.
She said that, in her view, his most important job was to "make sure that your soldiers don't give up, no matter how hard things get."
She added in a postscript: "I live in the desert all the time. It's not so bad."
General Schwarzkopf told the 800 guests at last night's dinner that Andrea's letter had come at a "very low point" when fears about the allied effort were considerable, but that her letter "provided me just the inspiration I needed to try a little harder to take care of my troops."
He also added a postscript, "You're right, the desert is not so bad."
Mrs. Reagan's award was for her "Just Say No" campaign to fight drug abuse. Dr. Vagelos was honored for his efforts to provide drugs needed in third world countries at minimal or no cost.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Bush Links End Of Trading Ban To Hussein Exit

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
President Bush said today that the United States would oppose the lifting of the worldwide ban against trading with Iraq until President Saddam Hussein is forced out of power in Baghdad.
His statement, along with earlier remarks by the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, indicated strongly that the United States has decided to try to drive Mr. Hussein from power through a postwar policy of economic strangulation. 
 Implicit in the statements by Mr. Bush and his spokesman was a threat to use the veto authority that the United States holds in the United Nations Security Council as one of its five permanent members to oppose lifting the sanctions against Iraq.
In his first comments on the trials of Kuwaitis accused of collaboration with Iraqi occupation forces, Mr. Bush today said Kuwait should extend fair-trial protections to the accused. [Page A10.]
 
Security Council Acts
 A mechanism for a controlled lifting of the trade ban, approved today by the Security Council, would permit Mr. Hussein's Government to begin selling its crude oil to pay for reparations to Kuwait. Also, Iraq has asked for permission to finance urgent cargos of food, medicine and basic raw materials by selling its oil.
But the Council has not taken the decisive action to allow the sale of oil to begin. The statements by Washington and earlier comments by the British Government indicate that such a move may be a long time in coming as long as Mr. Hussein remains in power.
Mr. Bush, speaking at the White House with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, said the United States "will abide by the United Nations resolutions, of course," and he added, "There are certain areas where Iraq, in order to comply with United Nations sanctions, must sell abroad."
But the President added that, "at this juncture, my view is we don't want to lift these sanctions as long as Saddam Hussein is in power."
Mr. Bush's statement came on a day when the Security Council passed a resolution formally setting up a procedure, yet to be activated, for processing damage claims against Iraq and docking future oil earnings to pay for them. Kuwait is asking that half of Iraq's future oil earnings be diverted under United Nations authority to pay for $60 billion or more in damages.
The Security Council will have to vote on the sanctions question after it is satisfied Baghdad is cooperating with plans for destroying its nuclear, chemical and biological research installations and its ballistic missile plants.
Today's resolution established a 15-nation body, the Governing Council of the United Nations Compensation Commission, with members drawn from the Security Council nations.
The commission is to process claims and provide compensation from Iraqi oil revenue once shipments are flowing again, something Mr. Bush now indicates the United States will oppose while Mr. Hussein remains in power.
Mr. Bush's statement echoed a similiar statement by the British Prime Minister, John Major, to his Conservative Party on May 11. Mr. Major said Britain might veto any move in the Security Council to lift sanctions as long as Mr. Hussein is in power.
Earlier in the day at the White House, Mr. Fitzwater referred reporters to a May 7 speech by the deputy national security adviser, Robert M. Gates. Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Gates's strong formulation on the sanctions question represented American policy.
In the speech to the American Newspaper Publishers Association, Mr. Gates, who has been nominated to be Director of Central Intelligence, said of Mr. Hussein, "Iraqis will pay the price while he is in power."
"All possible sanctions will be maintained until he is gone," Mr. Gates continued.
He said Iraq "will be nothing but a pariah state" as long as Mr. Hussein rules and that "Iraqis will not participate in post-crisis political, economic and security arrangements until there is a change in regime."
Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Gates's remarks at the publishers' meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, were "extremely underreported" but reflected a determination by the United States that, "because of the invasion and occupation of Kuwait and the brutal repression of his own people, Saddam is discredited and cannot be redeemed."
In recent weeks, Mr. Bush has repeatedly stated that the United States would not have normal relations with Iraq while Mr. Hussein was in power, but he has demurred on saying how he would treat requests by Iraq to sell oil for various urgent requirements.
Kuwait's United Nations representative, Mohammed A. Abulhasan, said today that he had told the Security Council that his Government wanted Baghdad to pay up to 50 percent of its future revenue to settle compensation claims once the embargo is lifted.
This would mean that as much as $10 billion of the $20 billion Iraq is expected to earn annually from selling oil at current prices would be available to meet damage claims, which Mr. Abulhasan estimated at around $60 billion.
"We favor a high level of payments because we want all claims paid within 10 years," he said, adding that Kuwait's claims are growing by $120 million a day to cover losses from the wells Iraqi troops set aflame. While Washington, like Kuwait, has spoken of fixing payments as high as 50 percent of Iraq's oil revenue, Britain, France and the Soviet Union -- all Council members with a veto -- expect a ceiling of 25 to 30 percent, with an actual first-year payment of about 25 percent.
This means that Iraq would be required to hand over about $5 billion of its annual oil income, approximately what it was spending on foreign arms before the Persian Gulf war.

HEADLINE: To Preserve Their Health and Heritage, Arizona Indians Reclaim Ancient Foods

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

DATELINE: TUCSON, Ariz.

 BODY:
GOING back to one's roots could soon take on a more literal meaning for the Indians of the American Southwest, as well as for peoples elsewhere in the world who are poorly adapted to rich, refined foods.
For the sake of their health, as well as their cultural heritage, the Pima and Tohono O'odham tribes of Arizona are being urged to rediscover the desert foods their people traditionally consumed until as recently as the 1940's. 
 Studies strongly indicate that people who evolved in these arid lands are metabolically best suited to the feast-and-famine cycles of their forebears who survived on the desert's unpredictable bounty, both wild and cultivated.
By contrast, the modern North American diet is making them sick. With rich food perpetually available, weights in the high 200's and 300's are not uncommon among these once-lean people. As many as half the Pima and Tohono O'odham (formerly Papago) Indians now develop diabetes by the age of 35, an incidence 15 times higher than for Americans as a whole. Yet before World War II, diabetes was rare in this population.
Similar problems have been found among Australian aborigines, Pacific Islanders and other peoples whose survival historically depended on their ability to stash away calories in times of plenty to sustain them during droughts and crop failures. The Pima and Tohono O'odham Indians seem unusually efficient at turning calories to body fat; nutritionists say they gain weight readily on the kinds and amounts of foods people of European descent can eat with no problem.
Preliminary studies have indicated that a change in the Indian diet back to the beans, corn, grains, greens and other low-fat, high-fiber plant foods that their ancestors depended upon can normalize blood sugar, suppress between-meal hunger and probably also foster weight loss.
These findings may also prove valuable to non-Indians who are susceptible to overweight and diabetes, and perhaps also those prone to high blood pressure and heart disease. The benefits, which are also found in a few more familiar foods like oat bran and okra, stem primarily from two characteristics of the native foods: their high content of soluble fibers that form edible gels, gums and mucilages, and a type of starch called amylose that is digested very slowly. The combined effect is to prevent wide swings in blood sugar, slow down the digestive process and delay the return of hunger.
Peaks in blood sugar increase the body's need for insulin and dips in blood sugar can trigger feelings of hunger. In the form of diabetes that strikes these Indians the overweight body becomes insensitive to insulin. Weight loss increases the body's sensitivity to insulin and slow digestion diminishes the need for insulin.
On the Arizona desert, the desirable food ingredients are found in edible parts of such indigenous plants as the mesquite (mes-KEET) tree, cholla (CHOY-a) and prickly pear cactus, as well as in tepary (TEP-a-ree) beans, chia (CHEE-a) seeds and acorns from live oaks. Tribal elders speak fondly of these one-time favorites, which in recent decades have been all but forgotten as hamburgers, fries, soft drinks and other fatty, sugary, overly refined fast and packaged foods gained favor.
Even those Indians who still rely heavily on beans and corn are today consuming varieties that have little or none of the nutritive advantages found in the staples of their historic diet. For example, the sweet corn familiar to Americans contains rapidly digested starches and sugars, which raise sugar levels in the blood, while the hominy-type corn of the traditional Indian diet has little sugar and mostly starch that is slowly digested.
Similarly, the pinto beans that the Federal Government now gives to the Indians (along with lard, refined wheat flour, sugar, coffee and processed cereals) are far more rapidly digested than the tepary beans the Tohon O'odham once depended upon. Indeed, their former tribal name is a distorted version of the Indian word meaning "the Bean People."
When Earl Ray, a Pima Indian who lives near Phoenix, switched to a more traditional native diet of mesquite meal, tepary beans, cholla buds and chaparral tea, he dropped from 239 pounds to less than 150 and brought his severe diabetes under control without medication. In a federally financed study of 11 Indian volunteers predisposed to diabetes, a diet of native foods rich in fiber and complex carbohydrates kept blood sugar levels on an even keel and increased the effectiveness of insulin. When switched back to a low-fiber "convenience-market diet" containing the same number of calories, the volunteers' blood sugar skyrocketed and their sensitivity to insulin declined.
 
Much Foliage, Few Beans
 In addition to the potential health benefits of traditional desert foods, agricultural and economic factors strongly favor their production. Marty Eberhardt, the director of the Tucson Botanical Gardens, pointed out that the plants that produce these foods are naturally adapted to growing under conditions of high heat and little water.
Martha Burgess, education director of Native Seeds/Search, a seed bank and research and education organization here that studies and promotes the use of native desert plant foods, said, for example, that "if tepary bean plants are given lots of water, they produce tons of foliage and few beans," adding, "But if the plants are starved of water, they put their effort into flowers and seeds and produce beans that can have as much protein as soybeans."
Under the direction of Dr. Gary Paul Nabhan, Native Seeds/Search, the (the acronym stands for Southwestern Endangered Aridlands Resource Clearing House) is studying the value of native desert foods for controlling diabetes among Indians and Hispanic Americans of the border region. Dr. Nabhan, an ethnobotanist, was recently named a recipient of a MacArthur Foundation grant to pursue his studies of the agronomic characteristics and health value of desert food plants.
The group, which is housed on the grounds of the Tucson Botanical Gardens, teaches health professionals about native foods and promotes their use through school and community programs, seed distribution and cooking instruction.
"We should be eating the foods that grow here naturally instead of spending so much to bring in packaged foods," Ms. Eberhardt said. "People find themselves shin-deep in mesquite beans they don't know what to do with, and some of us feel guilty throwing them into the landfill."
Although most Arizonans consider mesquite, which occupies 70 million acres in the American Southwest, a pesky weed, it is loaded with nutritious pods that have a natural caramel-like sweetness. Carolyn J. Niethammer, the author of "American Indian Food and Lore" and "The Tumbelweed Gourmet," a cookbook published by the University of Arizona Press that features desert plants, said that mesquite pods were good sources of calcium, manganese, iron and zinc. The seeds within them are about 40 percent protein, almost double the protein content of common legumes. Even during a drought, mesquite is a prolific producer of seed-filled pods.
 
The Value of Mesquite
 Carlos Nagel, who heads Friends of Pronatura, an American affiliate of a Mexican conservation agency, remarked that "a healthy stand of mesquite produces as much food value through its pods as does a wheat field under cultivation, and the mesquite does it without capitalization, pesticides, fertilizer or irrigation and with minimal cultivation."
Dr. Nabhan, who has participated in medical studies of mesquite and other desert foods, said that despite its sweetness, mesquite flour (made by grinding whole pods) "is extremely effective in controlling blood sugar levels" in people with diabetes. The sweetness comes from fructose, which the body can process without insulin. In addition, soluble fibers, such as galactomannin gum, in the seeds and pods slow absorbtion of nutrients, resulting in a flattened blood sugar curve, unlike the peaks that follow consumption of wheat flour, corn meal and other common staples.
"The gel-forming fiber allows foods to be slowly digested and absorbed over a four- to six-hour period, rather than in one or two hours, which produces a rapid rise in blood sugar," Dr. Nabhan explained. He likened this "slow-release" New World food to two Old World legumes, guar and carob, that are being used in Europe to help control blood sugar levels in people with diabetes.
Dr. Nabhan, who has scoured the Southwest for remnants of nutritious wild and once-cultivated plants, said: "Prior to World War II, mesquite was the single most important wild food staple for the native desert peoples and probably protected them from developing diabetes. However, such wild foods were discouraged by the forces of 'civilization' and they dropped out of native diets."
Mesquite pods and acorns from the Emory Oak, a nondeciduous oak of the arid Southwest, are among the 10 best foods ever tested in terms of maintaining stable blood sugar levels, Dr. Nabhan said. After falling from the trees, these small, tasty, oval nuts are naturally toasted by the hot desert sun. They can be shelled and eaten whole as a snack or ground into meal to make burgers and muffins.
Also rich in health-promoting fiber are the drought-hardy tepary beans, the only cultivated beans with heat-resistant enzymes that can withstand the 100-plus degrees of the Sonoran Desert, Mr. Burgess said. Teparies, rich in protein, iron and calcium, once sustained many Indians of the Southwest, as well as the famed Tarahumara Indian runners of Mexico. But when post-war Government welfare programs began giving pintos to the Tohono O'odham and Pima Indians, they lost their incentive to grow teparies, which are better for them because they are digested more slowly.
 
'Jell-O of the Desert'
 Today Mr. Nagel is trying to reverse the trend. In a cooperative program with Mexican farmers, he is fostering cultivation of a variety of tepary beans, which are already being grown commercially by Pima Indians in Sacaton, Ariz.
Amaranth, known to some gardeners as pigweed, is another nutritious, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in the desert, producing both greens and seeds that once nourished the Indians. The seeds are rich in high-quality protein, and both the seeds and greens are loaded with calcium. Mrs. Burgess said that amaranth is but one of many edible weeds commonly discarded by home gardeners, who fail to appreciate their nutritive and culinary value.
Mrs. Burgess is also enthusiastic about protein-rich chia seeds from a salvia plant that produces two seed crops a year. When mixed with water, the fiber in chia forms a gel that lowers cholesterol and keeps blood sugar stable. She tells Native American children that chia is "the Jell-O of the desert."
Cactus, the signature plants of the desert landscape, round out the nutritious native-foods diet. Buds from the cholla are rich in calcium; one tablespoon has the calcium equivalent of eight ounces of milk. Cholla buds and the fruits and pads of the prickly pear are also rich in soluble fibers that help to normalize blood sugar.
Dr. Nabhan said that 20 other native desert foods were now being analyzed for their fiber and starch content, and he predicted the availability of an ever-widening menu of nutritious ingredients.
Among the main remaining hurdles is the need to develop commercial sources of foods like mesquite meal and to convince diabetes-prone Indians that it is worth the trouble to prepare and consume their traditional foods. Native American interns are assisting in the effort, which is being pursued in school lunchrooms and classrooms and at reservation clinics and health fairs.
Still, Mrs. Burgess said, habits are hard to change. "The most frequent question from potential consumers is, 'If I eat these foods can I then eat all the hamburgers and ice cream I want?' " she said. "Everyone is looking for a quick fix."


GRAPHIC: As Indians of the Southwest abandon the diet of their ancestors, nutrition-related diseases like diabetes have soared. For example, Government food programs replaced the tepary bean, upper left, which is rich in fiber, protein, iron and calcium, with the pinto bean, which is far more quickly digested and also lower in protein.
 
Mesquite
 
Mesquite pods were once a treasured part of the Pima and Tohono O'odham diet. The sweet pods are a good source of calcium, manganese, iron and zinc. The seeds within are 40 percent protein. Mesquite flour from grinding the whole pods produces fructose, which can be processed without insulin, and soluble fibers, which are slowly absorbed, without a rapid rise in blood sugar.
 
Prickly pear cactus
 
Both fruits and pads of the prickly pear cactus are rich in slowly absorbed soluble fibers that help keep blood sugar stable.

Cholla cactus
 
One tablespoon of buds from the cholla cactus has as much calcium as eight ounces of milk. The buds are rich in soluble fiber that helps regulate blood sugar.
 
Amaranth
 
Seeds are rich in high-quality protein. Both greens and seeds have large amounts of calcium. Raw greens are high in vitamins A and C and iron.
 
Tumbleweed
 
Nutritious tumbleweed sprouts grow quickly after spring and summer rains. When they are 2 to 3 inches tall, they can be steamed or used raw in salads.
 
Live oak
 
Acorns from live oaks are among the 10 best foods ever tested in terms of maintaining stable blood sugar levels. They can be eaten whole or ground into meal.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
If I Were a Rich Man

BYLINE: A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
When I was about 17 years old, I used to daydream about earning some money beyond what I needed for carfare and lunches in the college cafeteria. I mean real money, something like thirty or forty dollars.
In my reverie, I would go straight down to Macy's book department, whose stock I knew by heart from hours of wandering cashless along the shelves. 
 There I would spend my dream money, selecting Poe and O'Neill in the satisfyingly hefty Modern Library Giants edition, that three-volume Shakespeare for $4.95, or a book of India travels for a dollar, careful not to go over my lavish budget, enjoying every moment while I strolled, enjoying it even in retrospect when I shook myself into reality and got off at the City College subway stop.
Now, somewhat older, I daydream in larger terms, about what I would do if the Government showed up at my office one day and asked me how to spend bigger money -- say $2.5 billion for foreign aid, or even $150 billion.
We are told that the United States must lend at least $2.5 billion to the Soviet Union this year for agricultural products -- $1 billion already provided and an additional $1.5 billion the Bush Administration seems determined to give to Moscow. Various governments and economists say it would cost the West about $30 billion a year for at least five years to bolster the Soviet economy, and they tell us it is a bargain.
I don't know about that. Loans guaranteed by the U.S. -- low rate, long term and non-collateralized -- to a bankrupt country with hidden assets are tax-paid foreign aid. So part of that money is mine and yours, which should concentrate our minds on how it is spent. Let's start small, with a dream stake of that $2.5 billion in agricultural credits.
Nobody wants Soviet citizens to go hungry. But if hunger-relief is the goal, the Soviet Union does not seem in worse condition than Ethiopia, the Sudan or Bangladesh.
If the goal is economic assistance to shore up countries emerging from the disaster of Communism I would pick from the shelf those that have already emerged. How about more for Poland? The Poles are not only jumping fully into the rough currents of free enterprise but were the victims of the Soviet Union, where Mr. Gorbachev still has not dipped a toe into the water. And though the Soviet Parliament passed a law allowing free emigration, it won't take effect until 1993.
If the goal is to help countries that have overthrown dictatorship, here's an idea. How about Haiti, Nicaragua and Panama? It would certainly be nice if for once the U.S. devoted enough money and continuous attention to making economic showcases out of impoverished neighbors who fought for political freedom.
The heart of the issue, of course, is whether money spent now for Mr. Gorbachev's Government will solve or perpetuate the Soviet crisis. The problem is that Mr. Gorbachev's Government cannot get food from the Soviet field to the Soviet stomach any better than could Stalin's. It is not just money credit but political credit Mr. Gorbachev wants -- economic help now against economic change tomorrow.
Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey has asked the President to look into the realities of the Soviet system that cause the problem. How much is lost to waste, corruption, and policies that make the black markets and shortages inevitable? Is the centralized system being used to coerce the republics, by holding back food from certain maverick regions? (Yes.) Here's a question from Soviet dissidents: How many officials and ex-officials of the Communist bureaucracy are selling contracts to the West and battening on food profits?
And what about collateral? If the Gorbachev Government needs food supplies, it has plenty of resources it could put up -- billions in gold bullion and diamonds, for instance. It could avoid need for credits if it just stopped spending billions for arms to the Afghan Government and for Castro-propping.
Answers received, Americans can decide on the urgency of additional Soviet agricultural credits.
But after that we should wait until Mr. Gorbachev or his successor make fundamental changes in the Soviet economic system, which of course would make it totally un-Soviet. Until then, we should take that $150 billion in hand and spend a little time strolling in our minds, dreaming of how it could be spent, and for whom.

HEADLINE: After Mexico, the Main Event

 BODY:
Fast-track trade legislation, committing Congress to voting on trade agreements promptly and without amendment, is scheduled for vote early this week. Without such protection, foreign governments won't negotiate trade pacts, fearing that hard-fought deals could then be picked apart by special interests. That's why opponents of the Administration's free-trade pact with Mexico have targeted fast-track for attack.
The economic benefits of the Mexican agreement will be small on both sides of the border. Thus a no vote on fast-track might seem unimportant. But that view would be myopic: Mexican trade is a sideshow to what's really at stake, the five-year Uruguay Round of international trade talks scheduled to be completed this year. It will slash tariffs and other trade barriers, thereby adding trillions to the world's economies by the end of the decade. Few, if any, government policies in the U.S. or anywhere else will do more for economic growth. 
 The Uruguay Round has been stalled over Europe's refusal to scale back policies that lock out food imports. But once this roadblock is overcome, the benefits will be enormous. Third-world countries will gain access to developed countries for exports of food and textiles; in turn, industrialized countries will gain important protections for exports of services and intellectual property.
After the Uruguay agreement knocks down barriers everywhere, free trade with Mexico will pale in significance. Indeed, the case for the Mexican pact is mainly political. Mexico has launched brave market reforms the U.S. can now reward.
Organized labor has objected to the pact because, it argues, factories will flee to take advantage of low Mexican wages and poor working conditions. But most studies show that free trade will increase U.S. jobs. Some industries, like textiles and autos, will suffer. But the Administration has offered the right answer: generous retraining and re-employment services for dislocated workers.
Mr. Bush has also reassured environmentalists that free trade won't compromise high U.S. standards and has granted them a role in negotiating the pact. The National Wildlife Foundation cited these assurances last week as the basis for its endorsement of fast-track.
Finally, there is the charge that fast-track is undemocratic because at the end of the process Congress is given an all-or-nothing package. But that accusation ignores the rest of the process -- one of constant consultation between trade negotiators and Congressional committees.
Freer trade is Congress's golden opportunity to boost productivity and growth. But before that can happen, it needs to approve fast-track. Mr. Bush has addressed legitimate objections; the ones that remain are nakedly protectionist.

HEADLINE: Square Deals Will Sell American Cars

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is with great sadness that I read about the $2 billion loss suffered by Ford and G.M. in the last quarter (Business Day, May 1) and the economic woes that the United States suffers as a result. American car makers claim that they are victims of our economic malaise and foreign competition, but that is only part of the problem. The American people are shunning not just the big three auto makers but their dealers' methods of selling cars. 
 For years automobile dealers have been perceived as greedy rip-off artists who rarely deal openly with their customers about their fat profit margins over factory invoice or about the numerous hidden costs that are associated with buying accessories. The American people are fed up and have turned to foreigners for value at a fair cost.
It is time for a new way of thinking. Instead of discounting to dealers, who try not to pass the savings along, United States car makers should give the discounts directly to the customers by cutting sticker prices. Dealers should be forced by car makers to be upfront about the true cost of a car and its options and add only a 3 percent commission. Let's get the scam out of the deal!
Replacing the car dealers' book of tricks with a fair transaction on each automobile will prompt the American consumer to start buying American again. At the expense only of unscrupulous dealers, U.S. car makers will be able to return to profitability, increase production, rehire laid-off workers, help decrease the foreign debt and perhaps singlehandedly pull America out of the recession. Americans want to buy from Detroit, not Tokyo. Detroit ought to help them do it!

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Fleet/Norstar Fills Massachusetts Post

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Leo R. Breitman worked at the Bank of New England in its heydey and he was around for its demise. Now, at age 50, he is the most senior official to be offered a job by the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, which acquired the Boston-based bank last month.
Mr. Breitman will be chief executive of Fleet/Norstar's $7 billion Massachusetts banking unit, which consists primarily of the old Bank of New England business plus a small Fleet/ Norstar operation. After nearly 20 years at the Bank of New England, Mr. Breitman has the knowledge of an insider but has not been tainted with the real estate lending mistakes that led the Bank of New England to insolvency. 
 Starting as a specialist in leasing and other kinds of secured lending in 1971, Mr. Breitman was a leading player in the development during the 1970's and 1980's of the Bank of New England's strong connections with small- and medium-sized businesses in New England. Even today, he said, in the midst of a recession, "the middle-market lending activity has held up very well." The problems with bad loans "are clearly within acceptable standards," he added.
After leaving the Bank of New England in 1985 to become president of the Patriot Bank in Boston, Mr. Breitman found himself back home in 1987 after the Bank of New England acquired the Conifer Group, which owned Patriot.
Shortly after his return, Mr. Breitman emerged as a trouble-shooter, spending time at the company's troubled Connecticut bank unit. Since June 1990, he has served as the company's senior credit policy officer with responsiblity for improving and managing the loan-approval process.
In his new position as head of the Massachusetts bank unit of Fleet/ Norstar, Mr. Breitman said his top priority would be to create more stability for employees and customers.
"We have suffered attrition of people who were worried about their careers, and I can't say to those remaining, 'Don't worry, you won't be fired,' " Mr. Beitman said. "But because I know the people and the contributions they have made and their capacity, I can make the necessary changes in a thoughtful and high-quality way."
Customers of the Bank of New England will soon notice a difference, Mr. Breitman said, because the financial strength that results from the acquisition by Fleet means the bank will have more money to lend.
Mr. Breitman says he enjoys playing golf, but he has enough of a competive streak to be coy about admitting to a 16-stroke handicap. Opportunities to play have become scarce enough, he said, "that my handicap could be 20 by the next time I play."

Who's in Charge Here? Chances Are It's a Woman

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OSLO

 BODY:
The Prime Minister of Norway is a woman, and half her Cabinet are women. So are the leaders of two of the main opposition political parties. So are the two candidates running next fall for Mayor of Oslo. And so are 59 of the 165 members of the Norwegian Parliament.
"Sometimes I meet some men who think that women have too much influence," said Astrid Noeklebye Heiberg, a professor of psychiatry at Oslo University and the Conservative Party nominee for Mayor. "But I remind the men they should not be too fearful. They still have two-thirds of the Parliament." 
 In no other country do women play such a large and highly visible role in both national politics and government as Norway. In Britain, for example, only 7 percent of the Members of Parliament are women, and in Washington, fewer than 6 percent of the lawmakers in Congress are women -- 29 of 435 members in the House of Representatives and 2 of 100 Senators.
 
Premier Is the Inspiration
 Gro Harlem Brundtland, a 52-year-old Harvard-trained physician who is serving as Norway's Prime Minister for the third time, is both the inspiration and the symbol of the growing influence of women in public life here, a trend that she attributes to her nation's deeply held democratic beliefs and longtime commitment to social reform.
"If you look at the 70's, in the U.S. and in other European countries, feminism was a kind of high-level intellectual and cultural debate, focused through novels, through speeches," she said. "It never came deep into reality."
But in Norway there is broad agreement with the idea that women must take part fully and equally in politics. To that end, Dr. Brundtland's Labor Party adopted a rule in 1983 requiring that no fewer than 40 percent and no more than 60 percent of its nominees must be women. Soon other parties followed.
Such questions are probably more easily addressed in a small, prosperous and racially homogenous country like Norway, where civil rights mostly revolve around questions of age and sex.
Even so, there are those who believe that feminism alone cannot explain what has happened. Four years ago a Norwegian research institute commissioned a study called Scenario 2000, in which a group of scholars, business executives and politicians suggested that one reason that women were becoming more prominent in public life was that men had conceded them the field.
As Norway's economy became more internationalized, the theory goes, real power was no longer confined within the nation's borders. That meant, in turn, that the brightest men were deliberately avoiding public service and choosing to move into higher-paying, higher-status jobs in the private sector.
The report concluded, "Women may be moving from a marginal minority to a marginal majority."
Dr. Brundtland acknowledges that women have made few gains in Norway's private sector, but says women have come to power as Government influence is expanding.
"During the 1970's and the 1980's, there was an increase in public expenditures, an increase in the number of new Government programs and new reforms," she said. "If you want to use the power discussion, this certainly was not a phase in Norwegian postwar history where political questions were uninteresting, or where there was no growth."
She also argues that women have made a difference in reshaping Norway's national agenda. With more women in politics, she says, there has been a much stronger emphasis on issues like child care, education and family life.
 
Equality Issue Wanes
 Dr. Brundtland herself is the mother of four. Kaci Kullman Five, who is the head of the rival Conservative Party, has two children, and Anne Inger Lahnstein of the rural Center Party has three. Their parties attract 70 percent of the national electorate.
Although some critics say the changes are mostly symbolic and merely an extension of Norway's traditional emphasis on social welfare, there are broader discussions in Government now about expanding day care programs for the children of working parents, and lengthening the number of hours that children are in school.
Bernt Aardal, a political researcher at the Institute for Social Research, says the number of women means that there is virtually no political debate anymore over questions of sexual equality. Referring to a televised debate on whether Norway should seek membership in the European Community, in which Dr. Brundtland appeared on a panel with Mrs. Lahnstein and Mrs. Five, he said: "You no longer think: These are three women talking. Where are the men?"
On second thought, Mr. Aardal said, there was one thing. "You notice that they all call each other by the first names," he said. "The men would never have been so informal."
But Dr. Brundtland's opponents find her an increasingly difficult target. In the last election, for example, the Conservatives tried to profit from the fact that her husband, Arne Olav, had once been a longtime member of their party.
"Do as Gro did," a campaign slogan went. "Choose a Conservative." Dr. Brundtland was quick with her riposte: "Do as Arne Olav did," she said. "Choose Gro."

HEADLINE: Bush Tells Belgrade That U.S. May Consider Restoring Aid

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
President Bush has informed the Government of Yugoslavia that he would consider lifting suspension of all United States economic assistance to that country, a White House spokesman said today.
The aid cutoff began automatically on May 6 as a result of legislation enacted in November decreeing that unless Yugoslavia and its constituent republics ceased systematic human rights violations American aid would be terminated in six months. The law stipulates that unless the Secretary of State certified that Yugoslavia had met this test, the suspension would automatically go into effect. But Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d allowed the deadline to pass without comment. 
 The legislation in question is the Nickles amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for the 1991 fiscal year and is named for its principal author, Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma.
Although the legislation did not single out any part of Yugoslavia on the human rights issue, its main supporters made clear that their target was the Republic of Serbia because of Serbian maltreatment of its large minority of ethnic Albanians.
On Monday, Mr. Bush telephoned Yugoslavia's federal Prime Minister, Ante Markovic, to assure him that the Administration still supports him, his economic reform program and the unity of Yugoslavia.
 
'No Decision One Way or Other'
 Explaining Mr. Bush's stance on the Nickles amendment and his message to Mr. Markovic, Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, said: "We made no decision one way or the other, so that put the Nickles amendment into effect. What the President was saying is that we're going to take a look at our decision, which was basically no decision, and see if we can certify if they are complying or not."
In Belgrade today, the chief American delegate, Warren Zimmerman, told Tanyug, the Yugoslav press agency, that the Bush Administration would be more favorably disposed to restoring economic aid if Yugoslavia resolved its constitutional crisis, which has left the country without a head of state.
Referring to an impasse over the installation of Stipe Mesic of Croatia as the head of the federal presidency, Mr. Zimmerman said, "A softening of the consequences of the Nickles amendment will depend partly on whether Mr. Mesic will be allowed to take over the post of President." Serbia is leading the effort in the eight-member federal presidency that has prevented Mr. Mesic from assuming the post.
While only $5 million in American aid has been halted by the suspension and no other programs are under consideration, Yugoslavia could run into grave problems when it seeks a $1.1 billion standby loan from the International Monetary Fund later this year. The suspension calls on the Administration to oppose loans for Yugoslavia in the I.M.F.
Mr. Baker conferred today on the aid suspension issue with senior aides, including Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, a former Ambassador to Yugoslavia, but apparently without immediate result.

Dollar Continues Retreat; Gold Little Changed in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted lower yesterday in quiet, uneventful trading following reports of central bank intervention in Europe.
Gold prices were little changed after rising overseas. 
 On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $357.20 an ounce, off 20 cents from Monday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $356.50 an ounce, unchanged.
The dollar started out lower in Asia, then continued to fall in Europe after some reported dollar selling by the German Bundesbank and Sweden's Riksbank.
 
Central Banks Intervention
 The central banks had intervened to keep the dollar in check after Sweden's announcement last week that it would link the krona with the European Currency Unit. The dollar had soared on the expectation that Swedish banks would have to buy dollars to adjust their foreign exchange holdings.
Traders said the dollar has since settled down domestically after the Swedish commotion.
"I think the Swedish situation is finally out of the market, and people are trying to assess the U.S. economy," said Earl I. Johnson, a vice president at the Harris Trust and Company in Chicago.
Mr. Johnson said there was "not a strong incentive to buy or sell the dollar right now" in the absence of fresh economic data and as the Memorial Day holiday neared.
Traders predicted the dollar would trade in a fairly stable range in the near term.
In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar fell 0.65 yen to close at 138.15 yen. It was quoted at 137.40 yen in London, and 137.30 yen in New York, down from 138.50 Monday.
The dollar was weaker against the British pound compared with late Monday. Sterling bought $1.7365 in London, up from $1.7195, and $1.7370 in New York, up from $1.7170.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's quotes, included: 1.7128 West German marks, down from 1.7320; 1.4485 Swiss francs, down from 1.4615; 5.8140 French francs, down from 5.8690; 1,272 Italian lire, down from 1,285, and 1.14895 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14925.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $356.80 a troy ounce, from $355.50 late Monday. In Zurich, gold closed at $356.45 an ounce, up from $355.10.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.37 to close at a bid $357.13 an ounce.
Silver prices headed higher. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.035 a troy ounce, up from $4.02 Monday.

Treasury Bond Prices Increase

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices moved higher and long-term interest rates fell a bit yesterday, as investors seeking higher yields purchased long-term securities. Shorter-term note prices, by contrast, posted more modest gains.
"We have seen some real buying in the long end," one trader in government securities said. "A large part, if not all, of the bonds sold at the refunding have been distributed." 
 Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank North America, said "the last couple of sets of price data should engender the thinking that inflation is coming down," a favorable development for bonds.
 
'A Bit Less Nervous'
 "Also, the market seems a bit less nervous about the supply of bonds" left over from the Treasury's quarterly refunding, he added.
While the near-term outlook for bonds seems favorable, traders were less confident about the effect that the coming auctions of two-year and five-year notes might have on short-term rates. "There is the potential for a minor setback," one trader said. "But by the middle of next week we should be set up for a decent rally. After these auctions, we aren't going to have any supply of coupon-bearing securities for a month. These days, that is about as long as you get."
An auction yesterday of $16 billion worth of new 335-day cash management bills went fairly well, traders said, given the issue's enormous size. The new bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.89 percent.
 
Two- and Five-Year Notes
 Today the Treasury will sell $12.25 billion of new two-year notes. That auction will be followed tomorrow by the sale of $9.25 billion of new five-year notes.
In when-issued trading yesterday the new two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 6.83 percent, down from 6.87 percent late Monday. The five-year notes were offered at a price to yield 7.70 percent late yesterday, compared to 7.76 percent on Monday.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 98 21/32 late yesterday, up 10/32, to yield 8.24 percent, down from 8.27 percent on Monday.
 
Narrow Yield Differential
 For much of the year, to lock in higher yields "many investors have been buying corporate or mortgage-backed securities," rather than Treasury bonds, said James Kochan, chief of fixed-income money management at R. W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee. "Now the yield differential between those securities and governments is so narrow that investors are beginning to sense that the government market is cheap," he added.
Among note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price of 99 23/32, up a quarter of a point, to yield 8.04 percent. And the 7 percent three-year notes were offered at 99 22/32, up 2/32, to yield 7.11 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were little changed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.47 percent, down one basis point, or a hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 5.65 percent.
Activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was highlighted by close to $1 billion in new offerings. Underwriters said that for the most part the deals were well received.
Meanwhile, prices of the most widely quoted issues in the secondary market for municipal securities were unchanged, dealers said.
 
Ryder Systems Notes
 In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Ryder Systems Inc. priced $100 million worth of 10-year notes through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 9 1/4 percent notes, which mature May 15, 2001, were priced at 99.15 to yield 9.382 percent, 1.33 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing. The securities are rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues rose by an eighth of a point to a quarter of a point in active trading.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks to Avoid Gorbachev Talks

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
President Bush has decided that the idea of inviting President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to a seven-nation summit meeting in London in July is "a non-starter" and is trying to scuttle the plan without embarrassing the Soviet leader, Administration officials said today.
Although Soviet-American relations are going through a smoother period now than they were late last year, as Mr. Gorbachev appears to be steering his Government back toward political and economic change, the officials said the prospects were also becoming dimmer for holding the next superpower summit conference in Moscow in late June, as envisioned by an agreement reached earlier this year. 
 Lingering problems in arms control and unsettled questions about the extent to which the United States will be able to help the Soviet Union financially make it increasingly likely that the meeting will not be held until later in the summer, officials said.
"There is a strong predisposition on the President's part to go to Moscow, but the final hurdles have not been passed," an official said.
 
Talk With Soviet General
 The United States has been holding back from setting a date for the summit meeting in hopes of putting pressure on the Soviet Union to compromise in a dispute over the carrying out of a treaty reducing conventional armed forces in Europe.
Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, Chief of the Soviet General Staff, talked for about 15 minutes today with Mr. Bush in the office of his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft. Mr. Scowcroft and General Moiseyev talked alone for about 15 minutes as well, the White House said.
Earlier, the general met with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Administration officials said the first round of discussions, on Monday, had been disappointing and there were no reports of any major progress after today's talks either.
 
Gorbachev Trip to London
 With the timing of his next summit meeting with Mr. Bush unsettled, Mr. Gorbachev has raised the idea of going to London in July to attend the annual meeting of the seven most powerful industrial democracies, whose help he is seeking as he tries to save his country's foundering economy.
After meeting in the White House on Monday, Mr. Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany appeared to leave the door open for such a trip. But American officials said today that the United States did not support the idea and that Mr. Kohl had not made a strong pitch for it either.
Administration officials said Mr. Bush was eager to help the Soviet Union financially but was still not certain how far he could go and feared that having Mr. Gorbachev in London could force his hand.
"We don't foresee a meeting in London," an official said. "It's a non-starter from our perspective because of a number of concerns, the most important of which is that having him come to a meeting like that puts him in the grandstand position of asking for money and puts pressure on us to respond."
 
Economic Issues in Forefront
 The official continued: "There are also political concerns about other countries in Eastern Europe that might more obviously warrant inclusion in a meeting like the London summit. We can't come out and say 'No,' because the British are the hosts and because the President doesn't want it to appear to be a slap in the face at Gorbachev. But basically, we're going to make sure everyone is on board and then we're going to make this not happen."
As the ideological and military confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union have become less important, Administration officials said economic issues have started to move to the forefront of the way Washington views its ties with the Soviet Union and are increasingly dominating the Soviet-American relationship.
One clear sign of that, they said, was the recent appointment of Edward Hewett, an expert on the Soviet economy, as the chief Soviet adviser on the staff of the National Security Council. Mr. Hewett's predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, was a specialist in arms control, the Soviet military and Kremlinology.
But one official said the more traditional Soviet-American problems had not disappeared and that was one reason that Mr. Bush was still wary of becoming more deeply engaged with the Soviet Union economically.
"If arms control doesn't work out, then the whole relationship could be dominated by that issue once again and there won't be any question of Congress approving moves to give more financial aid to the Soviet Union," an official said.

Cummins Lowers Dividend 50

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ind., May 21

 BODY:
The Cummins Engine Company, suffering under continued losses and a bleak outlook for North American heavy-duty truck sales, said today that it was sharply cutting its quarterly dividend from 55 cents a share, to 5 cents.
The Columbus-based diesel engine maker, which had maintained its dividends in the face of a string of operating losses, also said it expected to post a loss for the second quarter that would be less than its $34.3 million first-quarter loss. Cummins had a $119 million loss for the fourth quarter of 1990. 
 Henry B. Schacht, chairman of Cummins, said the company's board had delayed cutting the dividend until a special meeting on Monday because it was hoping to get a clearer picture on when its business might improve.
"We see nothing to indicate that a recovery is in sight," Mr. Schacht said. "As a result, the board determined that it would be prudent to reduce the dividend to a level more consistent with existing business conditions."
Cummins said last month that the market for North American heavy-duty trucks had declined 45 percent over the last two years and that it expected the market to drop more during the current quarter.
"It continues to be our objective to move to break-even levels later in the year," Mr. Schacht said. "At the same time, continued economic uncertainty and soft demand for the company's heavy-duty truck engines make it difficult to forecast financial results."
The 5-cent dividend is payable June 14 to stockholders of record on May 31. Cummins stock lost $1.625 a share on the New York Stock Exchange today, closing at $36.

Many Readers, Few Ads for Bauer

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
As the recession in the magazine industry worsens, the battle to grab readers at supermarket checkout counters has intensified. And no company has been more aggressive at expanding its American operations than the German publisher of Woman's World and First for Women.
Both magazines have attracted millions of readers but the Bauer Publishing Group has yet to woo the advertisers it needs to make a profit. 
 Bauer, based in Hamburg, Germany, is one of Europe's largest magazine publishers, with titles like TV Horen und Sehen and Auf Einen Blick, which are family and women's magazines combined with TV guides. Its troubles in the United States, American magazine executives say, illustrate how a foreign company, in a rush to become global, refused to take the time to learn all the rules of the American market -- and suffered financially as a result.
 
Acknowledges Mistakes
 They assert that Bauer disregarded the way Americans do business. Bauer executives acknowledge the company's troubles but attribute them to naivete rather than arrogance and maintain that its problems are behind them. In fact, the first magazine it started in the United States, Woman's World, has been a success without much advertising.
Two years ago, Bauer started the supermarket weekly First for Women, filled with tips on dieting, money management, shopping and housework aimed at women in their early 30's. First for Women competes almost directly with Woman's Day, a Hachette publication, and Family Circle, published by The New York Times Company.
Bauer, which is privately held, does not disclose financial data, but rivals estimate that the company spent $75 million to get First for Women to the American shopping public. Hubert Bohle, a Bauer executive vice president, said the figure was much too high but would not be specific.
First for Women has built a circulation of 2.6 million, according to the most recent audit statements, and Mr. Bohle called it "the only new magazine launch that has been as successful as People," which was an instant hit with readers and advertisers.
That claim might startle almost any American magazine publisher accustomed to the difficulties of attracting regular readers. While First for Women's circulation is impressive, its early moves, particularly in setting ad rates, hurt ad sales and undermined its credibility with some executives at major ad agencies.
As a result, First for Women is probably a big money loser, though Bauer executives refuse to talk about that. Several publishing executives said Bauer might have lost $60 million or more since it was begun. After some missteps, the company seems to be adjusting to the American way of courting advertisers. But it still has a long way to go. Even if First for Women makes it, the question is how much more money it will lose.
Part of the problem may have been that Bauer was not well versed in how to approach American advertisers.
"In Germany we run mass circulation magazines that depend on circulation much more than advertising," Mr. Bohle said in an interview. "Perhaps we were naive about the advertising side of the business. The American publisher defines a target group in the way the advertiser sees it. He would try via subscriptions to obtain those readers to sell to advertisers."
 
'Start With the Readers'
 In Germany, "We start with the readers," he continued. "We say: 'We have a concept. How many readers are there for that concept?' "
Woman's World, Bauer's first American publication, worked fine using that approach. A weekly tabloid with a circulation of 1.5 million readers, it is now believed to produce operating profits of about $15 million annually.
It takes in a maximum of five pages of advertising an issue, but, like Bauer's German publications, sales of individual copies at $1.10 each account for most of the profit. Moreover, the product is different. Instead of the magazine format of its competitors, Woman's World mixes entertainment and advice for women, especially housewives, in its tabloid form.
But First for Women, which is edited by Jackie Highe, was hardly a new idea. Woman's Day, with a circulation of 4.8 million and Family Circle, with 5.4 million, have long since built strong followings at the checkout counter. All three are service publications aimed at helping a woman with home and family.
 
Paid for Rack Space
 Bauer used its financial muscle for some big moves to insure that First for Women reached its intended target. The company paid millions for supermarket rack space, raising the cost of rack space for the whole industry. Then it offered eight million copies of the inaugural issue at 25 cents each to get shoppers to try the magazine.
The start-up was accompanied by an extensive promotional advertising campaign, estimated at $20 million. For the second issue, the magazine raised its price to $1 and the magazine sold about four million copies.
Bauer, which had initially guaranteed advertisers that First for Women would deliver two million readers, was so encouraged by early sales that it suddenly raised that guarantee to four million.
But sales dropped to 2.7 million copies, below the company's expectations. Even at the end of 1990, it was charging advertisers for a circulation of three million when actually its circulation was 2.6 million. It has since lowered its rate base and Bauer soon realized it needed more emphasis on advertising to make money from the new magazine.
 
Hired British Company
 "They are charging $1.50 a copy," said one magazine executive of First for Women. "They keep about 90 cents of that. If they sell 2.6 million copies, that is $2.3 million at the newstands."
And every company prints more copies than it sells. First for Women may print 3.4 million copies. At 50 cents a copy, that is $1.7 million. Then there are charges for rack space, wholesalers and other fees. Clearly circulation revenue is not enough.
To increase advertising pages, Bauer hired a British company, the Magazine Consultancy, which had represented Bauer in Britain. The Consultancy's first attempt to sell advertising here was a disaster, the company acknowledged. Its major mistake was to offer advertising agencies a discount available to all clients.
"Naturally, large advertisers were furious that the smaller ones were getting the same benefits," said an agency executive, who asked not to be named. "
 
Worked Well in London
 Craig Vander Ploeg, vice president of the Consultancy, who is in charge of advertising sales for Bauer, acknowledged that the plan was a poor one and had to be scrapped very quickly. "Our London office uses that strategy and it works very well there," he said. "But it didn't work here at all."
Mr. Vander Ploeg is using more traditional sales strategies now, offering volume discounts and other incentives.
What First for Women does have in its favor is that it delivers the younger readers many advertisers desire, because their buying patterns are not yet set. Family Circle and Woman's Day do not attract that market as successfully. But even after Bauer changed its advertising sales approach, advertising has been slow to follow.
The most recent issue carried 37.5 pages of advertising, down from 38 pages in the comparable issue a year ago. But Mr. Bohle said that many of the 1990 pages were part of deals given to advertisers, and on a dollar basis the company was getting more money a page this year.
The company is planning to start a third magazine for the American checkout counter sometime in the next two years, though it is typically secretive about what kind of publication it will be.

HEADLINE: Health Crisis Said to Grip Iraq In Wake of War's Destruction

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
Public health in Iraq is rapidly deteriorating under the strain of postwar epidemics, power disruptions, shortages of doctors, nurses and medicines and the closing of many overloaded hospitals and clinics, according to a Harvard University medical team that conducted a survey in major cities this month.
"Throughout Iraq gastroenteritis, cholera and typhoid are now epidemic," the study said. "Contrary to the statement of both the Iraqi Government and Western journalists that the health situation is stable and will continue to improve, the study team finds that the state of medical care is desperate and -- unless conditions change substantially -- will continue to deteriorate in every region and at nearly every provider level."
 
Rise in Infectious Disease
 Child mortality soared in the first four months of the year, the study said. It calculated that 55,000 more children died than in the comparable period the previous year. 
 While the dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg, who was not a member of the study team but reviewed its findings, said in an interview that he could not confirm mortality projections, because "specific figures are speculative," the medical team concluded that the child mortality figure was likely to increase to at least 170,000 additional deaths by the end of the year. The figures were based on data collected in four major Iraqi hospitals.
But Dr. Fineberg added that "in the aftermath of the disruption of war, the conditions have fostered an increase in epidemic infectious disease and other threats to health that have substantially increased the loss of life."
"My reading of the evidence," he continued, "is that there will be a substantial increase in infant mortality in Iraq, and the severity of the conditions speaks to a real crisis."
The "main message" of the study, Dr. Fineberg said, "is that the consequences of war are not fully realized during the time of active conflict, and the aftermath carries with it a very real burden of death and disability."
The medical team's report raises new questions about whether the Bush Administration's postwar strategy of continued economic sanctions against Iraq will lead to rising mortality rates in the nation of 18 million, where health problems, disease and malnutrition are reported to be growing out of control.
Senior Bush Administration officials have said in the past that they will not allow Iraqi civilians to starve as Washington calibrates a postwar pressure campaign to keep tight trade sanctions on Iraq to force President Saddam Hussein from power. But the Harvard study suggests that a combination of disease, food shortages and high prices is already causing thousands of deaths.
The 10-member Harvard team of doctors, lawyers and public health specialists was sponsored by the MacArthur Foundation and seven other private groups.
Their report, which was distributed to news organizations this week, said there was a direct correlation between the allied decision to bomb most of Iraq's electrical generating plants and the subsequent breakdown in public health and medical care.
"Without electricity," the report said, "hospitals cannot function, perishable medicines spoil, water cannot be purified and raw sewage cannot be processed."
By all indications, Bush Administration officials did not foresee that their bombing strategy would lead to a public health crisis among Iraqi civilians. In a briefing on Jan. 30, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the allied commander in the Persian Gulf, said: "We never had any intention of destroying 100 percent of all the Iraqi electrical power. Because of our interest in making sure that civilians did not suffer unduly, we felt that we have to leave some of the electrical power in effect."
The new findings call into question the ability of the military and its targeting analysts to make judgments about how a percentage reduction of electrical generating capacity will affect a civilian population.
The Harvard team conducted the most thorough survey to date of bomb damage to power plants in Iraq and found that in the first days of the war, 13 of Iraq's 20 generating plants were incapacitated or destroyed and by the end of the fighting, Iraq was generating only 4 percent of its prewar capacity.
Nearly three months later, the country's electrical output still is barely 22 percent of the prewar level, and without a lifting of the trade sanctions, electrical output is not expect to grow further, thus complicating the public health situation with the approach of searing summer heat.
The team members said they could move freely and were barred only from one infectious disease hospital where they suspected Iraqi officials were diverting many cholera cases in an effort to cover up their loss of control over the health crisis.

Spotlight Is on Software at Show

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 21

 BODY:
With manufacturers of small computers continuing to report bad news this week, software publishers took the spotlight here as the personal computer industry convened for the spring version of the semiannual computer show, Comdex.
Although the number of exhibitors is the same as last year, there are 70 percent more software publishers among the 900 computer companies showing wares to 60,000 people at the four-day show ending on Thursday. 
 Several leading personal computer companies that had skipped this convention in previous years -- I.B.M., Microsoft and Lotus Development -- returned with business software products designed to take advantage of faster, more powerful hardware.
On Monday, Microsoft introduced a new version of its Basic computer language designed to exploit its graphical user interface, Windows. A separate section of Comdex was opened this year for some 200 companies offering software that operates with Windows.
"For the last few years, the hardware -- the computers, printers, networks -- have had the focus of this show," said Cheryl C. Currid, a former computer executive at the Coca-Cola Company who now has her own consulting firm.
"The software companies are playing leapfrog now that they've had the chance to exploit the new hardware," she said. "The software people are finally getting a chance to play."
Hardware makers, by contrast, were taking a beating. On Monday, Apple Computer announced a restructuring that the company said would result in a 10 percent staff reduction. Last week, Compaq Computer said second-quarter earnings would be about 25 cents a share, down from $1.18 a share a year earlier, and the stock plunged.
"There are still going to be innovations in hardware, but the innovations which drive the industry aren't going to be merely in bigger, faster computers," said Gene R. Talsky, president of Promark, a Huntington Beach, Calif., computer consulting service. "Most people who own personal computers today can't take full advantage of them."
Sheldon Adelson, chairman of the Interface Group, the show's sponsor, said: "It's always been difficult for software to keep up with the changes in hardware. Now that they've caught up, the mission is to rise above the clutter of their competitors. That's what is bringing them here."
Mr. Adelson noted that there were 5 percent fewer manufacturers of printers and other computer peripheral products at the show. There have been similar reductions in the number of computer makers and suppliers of computer services. But software publishers, who accounted for 18 percent of the computer vendors at the 1990 show, account for 31 percent of all products this year.
Nevertheless, Mr. Adelson said the pessimism of the financial community about computer makers was unwarranted. "No one has ever said we would see negative growth in the computer industry," he said. "Even when there was a recession in the computer market in 1985-86, it only meant that growth dropped from 50 percent per year to 20 percent."
Computer makers were cheered by news today that the East European computer market might expand more rapidly than first thought. During a session focusing on European trade, Andrzej Dabkowski, managing director of a Polish trading company, said privatization of Eastern European companies was moving more quickly than had been expected.
"Six months ago, I was saying that probably 50 companies a month would go private in Poland," he said. "Today, it's closer to 200 per month. When companies adopt Western-style financial structures, they need Western computers and software to make it work."

HEADLINE: Business Tax Breaks Are Hurting Schools, Educators Complain

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
Many American companies in recent years have made a crusade of trying to rescue the nation's deteriorating public schools, casting themselves as white knights whose donations help the cause.
But at the same time, many of these companies are extracting as many sizable tax breaks as they can from their communities, cutting off money needed to finance public education. 
 Now educators are fighting back, trying to make businesses pay their full share of taxes. In Washington State, corporate loopholes were a major issues, along with pay increases and benefits, in a statewide teachers' strike this spring. In Kansas, Texas, Minnesota, Ohio and other states, legislation and lawsuits are being used to try to eliminate corporate tax exemptions.
"Companies are caught in a contradictory situation," said Michael W. Apple, an education professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who wrote several books on the financing of public education. "They want more spent on education but preferring that it not come out of their own pockets."
Tax exemptions take many forms, but the most common concession reduces or eliminates property taxes for long periods, and in most areas the bulk of property tax revenue goes to support public schools. Such concessions must end, educators say, not only because the recession is squeezing public budgets, but also because the extra revenue is needed to pay for the many improvements mandated by school reform legislation. Such measures are often backed by businesses.
But many municipalities say that ending corporate tax exemptions will provoke businesses to relocate, leaving the public treasuries even poorer.
For their part, businesses defend the exemptions as necessary for many reasons, including remaining competitive with foreign firms. "It would be ridiculous to expect companies not to negotiate for exemptions," said William H. Kolberg, president of the National Alliance of Business. "Economic development has always been a quid pro quo. Cities want these developments."
 
Experiences in States
 While there are no reliable national statistics on corporate contributions to public schools or corporate tax breaks, a survey of several school systems and states suggest that educators may have a point.
*In Corpus Christi, Tex., the local school system estimated it received $250,000 in the last school year from local companies in money, equipment and donated time from employees, but said it also lost $900,000 in tax revenue for the district because of exemptions.
*The Wichita, Kan., public schools said local businesses this school year contributed $1.1 million in a variety of areas. But the district also said that businesses did not pay $1.6 million in school taxes because of concessions.
*In Florida, $32 million has been given to public education this school year, the state Department of Education said. But that amount is dwarfed by roughly $500 million in tax concessions this year, including breaks on sales taxes, machinery and fuel costs, according to an analysis by the state Department of Revenue.
 
Issue Under Scrutiny
 The issue has so concerned the National Governors' Association that it plans an October meeting on the matter, and the National Association of School Boards two months ago formed a committee to investigate the effects of corporate exemptions on public school finances.
For their part, businesses defend their exemptions as necessary to remain competitive, and maintain that their contributions are helpful to the national effort to improve schools.
But some educators contend that such contributions are usually targeted for a specific program and are not entirely altruistic.
"They can turn contributions off and on and use it to leverage things they want done," said Chris Pipho, director of state relations for the Education Commission of the States, a Denver research and policy organization.
Although tax breaks are not new, their use has drastically grown over the last two decades, as more states, counties and cities compete for businesses. They assemble packages that include the elimination or reduction of sales or property taxes or both, exemptions on new equipment, tax breaks for training new employees and reductions on taxes for school improvements. Some states, like Florida, even award companies tax breaks for fuel use.
"Companies are saying, 'Look, this is a competition we basically didn't create,' " said Jay Kayne, director of policy studies for the National Governors' Association. "In a sense they are right."
 
Accountability and Revenue
 Nonetheless, educators assert that if they are to be held more accountable for school performance, then they need a stronger revenue base to pay for things like improved academic programs, building new schools or replacing aging buildings. A lawsuit filed in January by the Cleveland Public Schools helps illustrate the growing national debate.
The complaint filed in state court maintains that the Cleveland Public Schools system, currently facing a $34 million deficit for the 1991-92 school year, has been significantly hurt by the tax breaks granted to businesses and others in the name of economic development.
In one example cited by Timothy J. Armstrong, a Cleveland lawyer representing the school system, the city's new Society Center, a multiuse development that includes a hotel and a bank, would pay a 2.1 percent tax rate, or $8 million, on the development's $400 million value. But Mr. Armstrong said the entire $8 million in tax proceeds was abated, or eliminated, by the city as an incentive for the developer. Of that $8 million, 60 percent would have gone to the school system, he said.
"Our City Council hasn't seen a tax abatement that it didn't like," said Mr. Armstrong, adding that school systems in the state are routinely excluded from participating in city or county decisions on tax exemptions for economic development.
But the city responded that the abatement was necessary to get the hotel built. Cleveland does not have enough hotels for conventions, a shortage that has caused the city to lose several gatherings in the past, said Craig S. Miller, the city's law director. He said the shrinking pool of Federal money for city development projects had forced a heavier reliance by Cleveland, as well as other cities, on tax concessions to prod development.
The issue of corporate exemptions reached such a boil two months ago in Washington State that teachers included a protest against corporate tax breaks in the list of grievances when they walked off their jobs.
Legislation proposed by the Washington Education Association, the teachers' union and Washington Citizen Action, a citizens' consumer group, would end several business exemptions and would raise more than $700 million over two years for education spending.
"Businesses are demanding everything from the system, but they are not willing to put anything back in," said Karin Goodro, a fifth-grade teacher in Tacoma who walked off her job.
The Boeing Company took the brunt of the criticism because it is the state's largest employer and because of the tax concessions it receives. Although the company has said that it does not maintain records on the extent of its sales tax exemption, the Washington Citizen Action group analyzed state Department of Revenue records filed by the company and asserted that in the 1989-1991 period the company was exempted from more than $900 million in sales taxes on its products, including commercial and military aircraft.
 
Boeing Response to Critics
 Boeing defended its contributions and exemptions, and contended that without accountability in school performance, real improvements would remain elusive.
"First they say, 'Give us more money,' " said Forrest Coffey, corporate vice president for government affairs at Boeing. "Why should I give you more money? What do I get?"
One reason business has come under increasing scrutiny over exemptions is their vocal criticism of schools and their public displays of gift-giving to schools that have soured some educators. Last year, Minnesota closed a loophole through which potential school funds were drained.
Under a widely used state development program, cities were luring companies into blighted areas with low-interest bonds. But the resulting increase in property values and taxes paid only went to pay off the bonds, with no funds going to help schools. In 1988, the last year for which statistics are available, $60 million in potential school funds was lost, said State Representative Ann H. Rest, who successfully sponsored legislation forcing the cities to reimburse school systems for revenue lost as a result of the practice.
"There is a myth that has been perpetrated, and it's a fallout from the Reagan Administration," said Thomas A. Shannon, executive director of the National Association of School Boards. "And that is: 'You can't fix education by throwing money at it.' It's a crock."

Advice to Patriots: Save, Don't Spend

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SUPPOSE there were Americans so patriotic as to decide to ignore their own material well-being and to deploy their money with the sole aim of benefiting the national economy.
Are these self-sacrificing citizens best advised to go out and buy, say, new cars or wardrobes, in hopes that the extra spending will help shorten what has recently been declared the nation's ninth postwar recession? Or, given Alan Greenspan's warning that the country's biggest domestic problem is a lack of savings, is it better to put the money aside, as the increasingly quaint phrase goes, "for a rainy day"? 
 The answer, not unusual in economics, is not clear. It depends on how long the economic patriots stick with their choices and how many others might join them.
It is, however, widely agreed that the long-held Keynesian focus on insuring adequate buying power, thereby stimulating the necessary production, is largely discredited as inflation-prone and thus cannot serve as a policy prescription.
On the other hand, the Ben Franklin assumption that thrift is always a good thing is also erroneous, particularly in a recession when higher savings tends to depress economic activity further. According to a textbook staple known as the paradox of thrift, if too many people try to save more money, the result is likely to be less total savings, not more.
According to "Economics," Paul A. Samuelson's classic text, "the individuals who save cut down on their consumption. They pass on less purchasing power than before; therefore, someone else's income is reduced, since one person's outgo is another person's income."
So what should the patriot do? An informal sampling of economists found broad support for the idea that virtue -- the savings paradox notwithstanding -- lies in socking the money away rather than visiting car dealers or clothing stores.
"I think he should save -- invest in an active way," said Herbert Stein, a longtime Washington policy maker. Buy stocks, bonds, even a house "to induce a larger flow of investments for the future," he added.
Charls E. Walker, a lobbyist and sometime academic as well as a former Treasury official, agreed. "I would pick out a strongly investing corporation and buy stock in it," he said. Newly issued stock would be best because the company would probably use the capital to expand its -- and the nation's -- productive base.
This recommendation implies not only considerable pain for retailers and producers of consumer goods but also a longer and more severe recession than otherwise. But the potential benefits over time -- and the savings versus spending issue is best viewed as a trade-off between the short term and the long term -- are immense if the nation can forgo some current consumption and shift these resources into investment.
"Inadequate domestic savings is impairing our economic prospects for the long run," Mr. Greenspan told a Senate panel considering a new type of individual retirement account last week. "By choosing to consume more now and to save less, we are limiting our ability to expand and upgrade our stock of capital." This, together with technology and the labor force, ultimately determines a country's standard of living, he added.
Compared with almost any other developed country -- and even with a considerable chunk of America's history -- today's 4 1/2 percent rate of personal savings is puny. The overall savings rate is even less because the Federal and other governments, running deficits, are "dissavers."
Policy makers regularly despair of the world's richest country needing to import huge amounts of capital but they see little hope of inducing Americans to save more. One reason for low savings, of course, is a relatively generous Social Security system for retirement and disability. Without it people would no doubt take greater financial precautions.
There is no proof, in fact, that making contributions to I.R.A.'s fully deductible for half the 1980's raised savings rates at all. Perhaps they induced people only to shift money from one account to another. It is known, however, that savings are notoriously unresponsive to interest rates. Income counts for much more.
Alan C. Lerner, an analyst for the Bankers Trust Company, suggests a middle ground for economic patriots: Buy a car now but promise to save increasing amounts as business activity revives.
Not everyone will be able, financially or psychologically, to become such a contracyclical economic force. But most people could help the country by saving more.

HEADLINE: Trenton Treasurer Finds Bigger Budget Shortfall

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 21

 BODY:
Blaming a weak economy, the State Treasurer said today that New Jersey was facing an additional budget shortfall of $768 million for the fiscal year that begins July 1.
The Treasurer, Douglas C. Berman, said that disappointing revenues from sales, income and other taxes would make it more difficult than expected to balance the $14.3 billion budget for the next fiscal year that Gov. Jim Florio had proposed in January. 
 In addition, Mr. Berman said the falloff in tax revenues is expected to enlarge the shortfall for the current fiscal year to $773 million from the $600 million estimated by the Governor in January.
"Our problems are real but manageable," Mr. Berman told a joint meeting of the Assembly and Senate finance committees. "We will eliminate our shortfall without raising taxes or reducing the property tax relief we promised New Jersey residents last year."
 
Harsh Choice for Unions
 Although the growing budget gap here is considerably smaller than those facing New York City, New York State or Connecticut, Mr. Florio is more limited in his options than leaders in other states. After angering the public with $2.8 billion in new taxes last year, Mr. Florio has promised to balance the budget, as required by the State Constitution, without raising more taxes.
In a related move, the Florio administration this week presented unions representing state workers with a harsh choice: either agree to take $40 million worth of unpaid furloughs starting July 1 or face up to 10,000 layoffs.
The union representing the largest number of the state's 70,000 employees, the Communication Workers of America, is asking its members this week to vote to authorize a strike, which the union threatens to use unless the Florio administration becomes more conciliatory.
The estimate of exactly how much money the state needs to have a balanced budget is, in fact, a highly political decision that depends on what revenues are counted and what are not, and which accounting techniques an official decides to use.
In his testimony today, Mr. Berman assumed the state would realize close to $800 million in savings and new revenues as a result of two strategies that Mr. Florio proposed in his budget announcement in January.
 
$181 Million Drop in Revenue
 At that time Mr. Florio suggested that the state raise $400 million by selling a public highway to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. He also said the state would require public employee unions to give up $370 million in raises and benefits already agreed to in current contracts. If either of those strategies fails, the state's shortfall would probably top $1 billion.
In addition, Mr. Berman estimated that falloffs in tax revenues had created an additional shortfall for the current fiscal year of $181 milllion. But he said that gap could be addressed by a number of measures, including the current hiring freeze, changing the date of state contributions to a police and firemen's fund, and using $43 million from a capital expense account for operating expenses.
But Republican legislators today questioned whether the Florio administration's estimates were accurate and accused Mr. Berman and his staff of incompetence in making fiscal projections.
"Why not submit a balanced budget?" Assemblyman C. Richard Kamin, a Republican from Franklin Lakes, asked Mr. Berman. "We are going through the same scenario again of overstating revenues."
Another Republican, Senator Henry P. McNamara of Franklin Lakes, criticized Mr. Berman for taking money from funds dedicated to purposes like hazardous waste cleanups and capital expansion to pay for the state's operating expenses.

HEADLINE: Yields Fall For C.D.'s

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts, down for the last three months, fell again for the one-week period ended yesterday.
Dennis R. Kosovac, a senior vice president in the consumer banking group of Chemical Bank, said that many depositors had been buying certificates with maturities as long as 60 months whose yields are about 300 basis points higher than the very-liquid savings, or passbook, rates. He said rational depositors were taking some cash and giving up a little liquidity for the higher yields, or stacking accounts to take advantage of higher-tier yields. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 He expects the Fed may still lower rates at least a couple of times more to help the economy, but the lower short-term rates will have an impact on bank rates, he added.
 
Treasury Weekly Auction
 At the Treasury Department's weekly auction Monday, the average discount rates were only slightly different from a week ago, but still at their lowest levels in three years. The results of these bill auctions often indicate what many banks may eventually pay on money market accounts and certificates of deposit.
The three-month bill was unchanged at 5.50 percent for the third consecutive week, while the six-month bill increased a few basis points, to 5.66 percent.
The largest yield changes in the New York area this week were recorded at the Howard Savings Bank in New Jersey, which cut 52 basis points off its money market account, to 5.13 percent. Connecticut Bank and Trust reduced the yield on its three-month certificate by 16 basis points, to 6 percent, while Marine Midland Bank reduced its six-month certificate by 22 basis points, to 5.65 percent.
Commercial banks cut back deposit yields only slightly less than savings institutions. Money market accounts were lowered by an average of 2 basis points, to 5.235 percent, while three-month certificates were lowered by 4 basis points, to 5.62 percent, and six-month certificate were lowered by 5 basis points, to 5.74 percent.
Savings institutions lowered the yield on money market accounts an average of 9 basis points, to 5.63 percent, while cutting 4 basis points off the yield on a three-month certificate, to 5.95 percent. The average cut on a six-month certificate yield was 6 basis points, to 6.17 percent.

HEADLINE: History Suggests Bush's Popularity Will Ebb

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY

 BODY:
President Bush's high approval ratings, increased by the Persian Gulf war, are not likely to last for long, if the experiences of his nine immediate predecessors are a reliable guide, according to a new study by researchers at the Gallup Organization.
Mr. Bush's historic peak of 89 percent approval in a Gallup poll in early March, just after the fighting ended in the gulf region, has already begun to fade, standing at 77 percent in the latest Gallup poll. Taken by telephone with 1,002 adults nationwide from May 16 to 19, the poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. 
 According to the new Gallup historical study, Mr. Bush's rating can be expected to continue to decline over the next several months until it reverts to the mid-60 percent range, his level before the gulf crisis began.
Still, Mr. Bush's surge in popularity in mid-January, when the air war began, was one of the largest rises in the 50-year history of polling and has already lasted longer than the average rise experienced by his nine predecessors, from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan.
 
Five Decades of Polling
 In the new study, " 'Rally Events' and Presidential Approval," Larry Hugick, vice president of the Gallup Organization, and Alec M. Gallup, co-chairman, analyzed hundreds of Gallup polls from more than five decades -- beginning in 1938 during Roosevelt's second term -- to measure the impact of international crises, diplomatic events and military operations on Presidential popularity.
Past studies, like the book "War, Presidents and Public Opinion" (John Wiley & Sons; 1973), by John Mueller of the University of Rochester, have identified the tendency of the public to rally round their flag, troops and President during many foreign crises. Though the magnitude of such surges have been documented, the new study is the first to look closely at their duration, and it finds they do not last long.
The findings, reported at the annual meeting of the American Association for Public Opinion Research that ended on Sunday in Phoenix, showed that each of the last 10 Presidents experienced at least one such rally of opinion over a foreign event. The 42 rallies studied have occurred on average every 1.2 years.
Increases in support for previous Presidents from these events averaged eight percentage points. The smallest examined by the researchers was three percentage points, while the largest was 19 percentage points.
 
10 Weeks of Higher Favor
 Mr. Bush's 18-percentage-point surge, registered in mid-January as the air war on Iraq began, was one of the three largest rises in Presidential popularity ever recorded by Gallup. Jimmy Carter saw a 19-percentage-point increase when American hostages were seized in Iran in November 1979, and Richard M. Nixon saw a 16-percentage point lift at the time of the Vietnam peace agreements in January 1973.
Rallies in support for previous Presidents lasted an average of 10 weeks. The briefest were over in a week, while the longest disappeared after about seven months. Mr. Bush's surge has persisted for four months, well beyond the average.
 
Holding Goodwill Till '92
 The most long-lived increases in public favor were the 30 weeks for Franklin D. Roosevelt after Pearl Harbor in 1941, the 31 weeks for John F. Kennedy after the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and the 30 weeks for Jimmy Carter after the American hostages were seized in Iran in 1979.
Mr. Hugick and Mr. Gallup concluded: "Based on our analysis of rally events throughout polling history, the effects of the Persian Gulf war on George Bush's approval seem likely to be sustained for several more months. It is highly unlikely, however, that the approval boost resulting from the gulf war will carry over into election year 1992."
But some other analysts believe Mr. Bush's increase in favor from the gulf war may prove more long-lived, similar to that resulting from the 1982 Falklands war. "In the British General Election of 1983, a year after the Falklands war, British voters rewarded its successful outcome" by returning the incumbent party, said Helmut Norpoth, professor of political science at the State University of New York, Stony Brook.
George C. Edwards 3d, director of the Center for Presidential Studies at Texas A&M University, said: "The key to the whole thing is what topics are salient in 1992. The gulf victory may be sustained by multiple homecomings, but won't remain salient throughout the Presidential campaign. We can't have ticker tape parades forever."

HEADLINE: Hartford Plan Would Raise New Funds The Old Way

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 21

 BODY:
Legislators leading the charge against Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s income tax plan released a package today to resolve the state's fiscal crisis through expanded sales and business taxes, deeper cuts in spending and a system of spending limits written into the State Constitution.
Leaders of both parties expressed confidence that the package would pass, based on headcounts conducted in closed-door meetings this afternoon and evening, and they said they planned to bring it to a vote in the Senate on Thursday as one all-inclusive bill that includes both the tax increases and the long-term spending changes. The House would not get the plan until next week at the earliest. 
 The bill would raise $960 million in new revenue -- putting it in roughly the same orbit as Mr. Weicker's plan as one of the largest one-year tax increases in state history.
But unlike the sharp departure that Mr. Weicker proposed in February, when he urged cutting most state taxes, especially the 8 percent sales tax, and substituting instead a long-avoided tax on wages, the legislative plan would essentially give Connecticut residents more of the same of what they have -- much more.
 
Assortment of New Taxes
 The 8 percent sales tax, already the highest statewide rate in the nation, would be kept at its current rate but expanded to include everything from house and car repairs to newspapers and magazine subscriptions, haircuts, inexpensive clothing and nonpresecription drugs. A new assortment of fees and special taxes would also be introduced, including a mortgage tax on homes costing over $150,000, a 12 percent occupancy tax for people who use campgrounds and a 5.75 percent sales tax on gasoline.
The Weicker administration immediately denounced the plan as laden with gimmicks and short-term solutions that could chase employers from the state and cripple Connecticut's recovery from the recession.
 
Support for General Idea
 A critique of the plan issued by the state's Office of Policy and Management also said that lawmakers had included "make-believe cuts" in spending that would give Connecticut a shortfall of $896 million for the year that begins on July 1. If the state took no action at all, it would face a projected shortfall of more than $2.7 billion over the next 13 months in a preliminary budget of $8.6 billion.
The legislative plan, which was drafted by a coalition led by Republicans in both chambers of the General Assembly and Democrats in the Senate, received increasing support over the last week from many lawmakers who are opposed to the income tax. But those voices of support had also, until today, been pledged to a fairly general framework of ideas. Lawmakers and special interest groups who support Mr. Weicker's budget package said the hard reality of what is involved in avoiding an income tax could jar some people into rethinking their positions. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Richard J. Balducci, a Democrat from Newington, declined to speculate on the alternative plan's chances, though he said earlier this week that "the votes just aren't there" for an income tax in either chamber. Mr. Balducci has said he supports the concept of an income tax but refused to say how he would vote on the alternative plan.
The alternative plan includes a projected $842 million in revenue from new taxes for the general fund -- led by the sales tax changes -- and $118 million in new taxes for the transportation fund, led by raising the per-gallon tax on gasoline to 25 cents from 23 and an increase in the annual motor vehicle registration fee to $90 from $62.
The 2-cent gasoline tax increase would be in addition to the 5.75 percent gasoline sales for the general fund.
Coalition leaders, who presented the plan to other legislators in closed meetings this afternoon and into the evening, framed their package as essentially a spending control plan, according to budget documents obtained from lawmakers.
The centerpiece would be a cap on state spending, written into the State Constitution, which would prohibit growth in the general fund from exceeding the rate of growth in personal income or inflation. A constitutional amendment would require voter approval and passage by a 75 percent majority in both the House and Senate.
The plan would also require the governor to present a two-year spending plan to try to control spending growth and would create a nonpartisan revenue forecasting board composed of budget officials from the administration and the legislature.
"For too long, budgets have been approved with the state's immediate future in mind, containing no vision toward years to come," the budget document proclaims. "That nightmare is now over."
Income-tax advocates charged instead that the plan would bring new nightmares of its own.
"This plan is bad for business, bad for consumers, bad for the elderly, and bad for Connecticut's poor, working- and middle-class families," said Ethan Rome, political director of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, a liberal lobbying group.
Mr. Weicker's supporters might rally around the proposal's approach to business taxes. Mr. Weicker proposed reducing the corporate profits tax to 11.5 percent from 13.8 percent and reducing the sales tax -- about 40 percent of which is paid by business -- to 4.25 percent. The legislative plan would keep the corporate tax structure intact and would raise $66 million in additional revenue by applying the tax more broadly.

Caterpillar Sees Bleaker Outlook

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., May 21

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. warned investors that it could lose money for a second consecutive quarter because the weak world economy had depressed sales. The maker of construction equipment lost $32 million in the first quarter, and it has revised its earnings outlook downward twice in two months.
"This doesn't say we definitely will have a loss," said a spokesman, Dick Stober. "It just means we've seen enough weakness in sales and felt we need to get out a revised outlook statement." The company said it did not have immediate plans for layoffs.

HEADLINE: REVIEW/FILM;
Where the Streets Are Mean and People Are Even Meaner

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Matty Rich's "Straight Out of Brooklyn" portrays the downfall of a black working-class family from the Red Hook section of Brooklyn in a style that used to be called kitchen-sink realism. At times gawky and plodding, the film, which represents the producing, directing and screen writing debut of the 19-year-old Mr. Rich, also has an affecting earnestness as it explores the social and economic pressures that drive the Browns, a family of four, to self-destruct.
Ray Brown (George T. Odom), the head of the household, is an embittered gas station attendant heading into middle age. He despairs of ever doing better. Although he loves his family, his passion curdles into violence when he drinks. He stormsthrough the family's tidy little apartment, beating up his wife, Frankie (Ann D. Sanders), smashing dishes and angrily soliloquizing to an invisible white oppressor. 
 Frankie, who works part time as a cleaning woman, accepts his beatings with a remarkable equanimity. Even when unable to find employment because of the bruises and welts on her face, she refuses to utter a word of criticism about her husband.
Quivering in their beds during these drunken rages are the couple's two adolescent children, Dennis (Lawrence Gilliard Jr.) and his younger sister, Carolyn (Barbara Sanon). Ray's violence stimulates fantasies of patricide in the young man, who longs to escape from the neighborhood and live in Manhattan with his girlfriend, Shirley (Reana E. Drummond).
Determined to make some quick money, the son engages his two best friends, Larry (Mr. Rich) and Kevin (Mark Malone), in a scheme to rob a low-level neighborhood drug dealer. The robbery has repercussions that go far beyond anything the young men could have imagined.
"Straight Out of Brooklyn," which opens today at the Plaza and Village East Cinemas, has a contemporary setting, but the literalness of its dialogue and its careful cinematography give it the feeling of a 1950's problem play adapted for the screen and moved up to the present. It is the kind of film in which a conversation about working-class expectations and the American dream takes place on a rooftop with the Statue of Liberty shown plainly in the background.
The Browns are portrayed as decent people who are stretched to the breaking point by forces outside their control. But beyond being sympathetic victims of hard times, racism and the plagues of inner-city life, their characters remain unclear.
Ray is the most fully drawn, but even he is defined almost entirely by his rage. Frankie is the sort of long-suffering martyr and fortress of goodness satirized in the playwright George C. Wolfe's sketch "The Last Mama-on-the-Couch Play" from "The Colored Museum." The two children are effervescent but vague.
But if the situation is familiar almost to the point of cliche, Mr. Rich is able to squeeze some emotional juice from it. At moments, Mr. Odom's performance assumes a towering intensity. The late-night speeches he delivers to a blank wall about racism and oppression may have a clunky oratorical ring, but the actor infuses them with an angry passion that stirs the heart. Ms. Sanders's Frankie, who seems poised on the brink of tears most of the time, is entirely sympathetic. Mr. Gilliard's Dennis seems a bit too bland and callow for an inner-city youth about to pull his first robbery, but the scenes in which he goofs around with his pals have a engaging, easygoing energy. In a movie that primarily deals with society's rebuke to black male self-esteem, the daughter, Carolyn, is a strictly marginal figure.
"Straight Out of Brooklyn" is a promising film-making debut, but it is also an odd one. Where first-time directors tend to explode their feelings onto the screen nowadays, Mr. Rich's film echoes the formal, socially responsible dramas from an earlier and more emotionally temperate era of American film making.
"Straight Out of Brooklyn" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes strong language and some nudity.

HEADLINE: New York Has One True Barbecue And Here Are All Eight of Them

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
FOR those who live by barbecue, Kansas City brisket and "burnt ends" sound one siren's call, the ribs and shredded pork of Memphis another. From the pits of Greensboro, N.C., vinegar-basted pork issues a hickory-scented invitation. Lubbock, Tex., where the fuel is mesquite or oak and the meat is brisket of beef, has an allure of a different aroma.
New York City, on the other hand, lacks barbecue mystique. Among connoisseurs, the term "New York barbecue" is more likely to elicit a guffaw than an anticipatory licking of the chops. 
 This lack of respect appalls the maestros of the city's terrace-based grills and sidewalk smokers; it is downright loathsome to the pioneers who have bravely brought a barbecue mosaic to the restaurants in this urban frontier.
Enough, already! A New York barbecue summit was called. Representatives of eight disparate schools of barbecue recently gathered in a midtown apartment to address the politics and public image of their hometown barbecue.
Sylvia Woods, the 65-year-old grande dame of South Carolina-style oven barbecue and doyenne of the Harlem restaurant that bears her given name, delegated her daughter, Bedelia Woods. She arrived wearing a red silk blouse that nicely complemented the sauce on the 20 pounds of ribs she carried.
Rusty Staub, the former New York Met who owns Rusty's on the Upper East Side and Rusty's on Fifth in midtown, represented a Louisiana-style oven barbecue. He wore the sort of chalk-striped gray suit that one sees a lot at Hall of Fame dinners and exuded a pregame "We're gonna win this one, guys," attitude.
Robert Pearson, the owner of Stick to Your Ribs, a restaurant in Stratford, Conn., that caters barbecue in New York, was the Texas-style cool-smoke delegate, and he wore acid-washed jeans with a white cowboy-cut shirt.
Simon Oren, an owner of Brother's Bar-B-Q on Houston Street, was the deputy of a Kentucky-style smoked barbecue and a prototype of downtown fashion.
Martin Yerdon and Eileen Weinberg, the owners of Carolina restaurant in midtown, represented the North Carolina style, though the brisket they brought was a cut of meat more commonly barbecued in Texas. They acknowledged that the meat had been cooked in a closed, rather than open, pit, using post oak and apple wood that are indigenous to New York, rather than the hickory used in the low country. This revelation brought a slight lift of the collective brow, but Mr. Yerdon waved it aside.
"We have to address the issue of modifications and the limits of the urban setting," he said in the tone of a Presidential adviser acquiescing in the full disclosure of classified material. With furrowed brow, the group nodded.
"But look at this," Mr. Yerdon said, waving to the group and toward the platters of barbecue crowding the summit table. "How can anybody say that we can't barbecue! This city has more transplanted sons and daughters of Dixie than the entire city of Atlanta!"
Mr. Oren, who grew up in Israel, shifted slightly in his T-shirt and loose linen jacket. His reaction was mitigated by the arrival of Yon Suk Choi, who owns the Woo Chon Korean restaurants in Manhattan and Queens and who looked like an exotic travel poster come to life in her Korean ceremonial dress. "Famous Barbecue Beef," she said, offering a platter of her specialty. She also brought an interpreter.
Michael Tong, who owns Shun Lee Palace, Shun Lee West and Shun Lee Cafe, followed. He wore a well-tailored business suit and, although empty-handed, assured the crowd that he would "call and have some barbecue ribs and duck delivered."
"We, uh, have gotten the delivery thing down," he said.
While Mr. Tong called his restaurant, Allan Vernon entered. He wore a blue blazer and a baseball cap that read "Vernon's: Number One Jerk in the U.S.A." and carried 20 pounds of Jamaican barbecue.
The demographics of the assembled delegates were emblematic of a basic pathos of New York barbecue. The city's repertory is so diverse that it lacks a single identifying flavor. Barbecue fanatics tend toward monolithic passions and are therefore confounded by New York. In addition, what one master reverently calls barbecue another calls burned meat. In the past, this has limited conversations between New York barbecue experts. It was no coincidence that the first items on the summit agenda emphasized commonality.
"We all live outside the barbecue belts," Mr. Pearson said. A former hairdresser, the British-born 44-year-old was reborn a " 'cue master" after studying the craft from the Carolinas to Texas.
Like most aficionados, when Mr. Pearson looks at a map, he sees one great barbecue belt that stretches from the Carolinas and the Southeast to Kentucky and Tennessee and features marinated pork cooked slowly in an open pit. The other barbecue belt stretches from Texas and the Southwest through Kansas and most of the Midwest and features beef cooked slowly in an open pit and basted with myriad dry and wet "mops," or tenderizing sauces.
Those two vast barbecue regions are credited with taking "barbacoa," the Spanish barbecue, and turning it into an all-American art form -- and eventually all-American fanaticism. Barbecue freaks won't be swayed by anything other than the precise form they were raised on and resist all attempts at expanding their definition of barbecue.
That is bad news for New Yorkers, who live and 'cue in the epicenter of innovation and cross-cultural culinary exchange. Despite their varying approaches, the delegates felt united.
"I call this barbecue," Mr. Staub said, sinking his teeth into one of the Chinese barbecued ribs that Mr. Tong had supplied. Mr. Tong said his ribs, like Yon Suk Choi's sliced beef, are cooked over a slow fire (or grilled) rather than surrounded by slow smoke (as in traditional barbecuing). Mr. Staub paused, appeared to gulp, and then continued. "Good meat-to-bone ratio," he said approvingly.
Secretly, the traditional camps of American barbecue wouldn't go so far as to use rice wine, hoisin sauce or sesame oil in their sauces, but they have an abiding empathy for nontraditional flavor enhancers. "Traditionally, it was the flavor of your fuel that permeated your 'cue," Mr. Yerdon said. "Not many people in this city are set up to cook a hunk of meat for 12 hours over a load of oak."
The barbecue delegates agreed that open-pit options are limited in New York City, though Mr. Vernon did refer to one particular pothole on Park Avenue South and Mr. Oren nodded enthusiastically. "I could do a whole pig in that one," he said.
Others expounded on their attempts to simulate pit cooking. Mr. Yerdon and Ms. Weinberg began experimenting with barbecue in the winter of 1982, using a grill on the terrace of their East Side apartment. "We had flare-ups and the thing caught on fire so I ended up serving 35 firemen," recalled Mr. Yerdon, who later spent $18,000 to built his first steel and brick smoker at Carolina. "It burned down, too," he said. "I rebuilt in '83."
The other delegates shook their heads sympathetically. "Flare-ups are a real problem," said Mr. Pearson, who places a pan of water on the floor of his smoker-type oven to catch the combustible dripping grease. It's not the fires he minds so much; it's the charring of the meat or -- quelle horreur -- "raising the internal meat temperature above 210 degrees and boiling the juice in the meat." Long, slow, moist heat breaks down the fat and the tough membranes in the inexpensive cuts typically barbecued.
Slow smoking can be simulated in a backyard (or terrace or sidewalk) grill by waiting until the coals turn white, placing the meat on the grill and placing the lid over the grill with the vents open to promote a flow of smoke. The fire should be fed gradually so the cooking temperature never goes above 200 degrees. "Then you just have to allow sufficient time to achieve desired results," Mr. Pearson said. "Say, 15 hours for briskets, 10 hours for pork shoulders, 5 hours for pork ribs, chicken and beef ribs."
"That's about right," said Mr. Oren, who uses electric smokers at Brother's Barbecue. Along with the other 'cue masters, he acknowledged that taking 15 hours to cook a brisket is somewhat at odds with the spirit of a town where that cut of meat is usually cured and called corned beef.
Just as the outside world doesn't understand the effect of New York City on barbecue, the city doesn't fully appreciate what the finer points of the craft require of a New Yorker. In addition to building Rube Goldberg smokers and having the patience to stoke them, skilled labor is a problem. "A good pitman is about as easy to find as an unemployed sheepherder in this town," Mr. Yerdon said.
Which may be why some local 'cue masters turned from the pit to the oven. "My daddy used half a tin drum in the backyard and I get the same result in the oven," said Mr. Staub, who grew up in New Orleans. He said careful marinating and saucing and long slow braising can perform magic on meat, though it is no less time-consuming. Ms. Woods of Sylvia's said the magic is in the marination: "We hire people just to massage the meat every night before we cook it. That's the only way you can get that falling-off-the-bone effect."
"I can get that with peppers, baby," said Mr. Vernon, adjusting the bill of his cap. "The philosophy of jerk is to use your jerk sauce to tenderize the meat and then just add a little smoke at the end," he said, noting that after marination, he oven-braises and finishes his meat, chicken or fish on a low grill.
Both Michael Tong and Yon Suk Choi use similar methods. "We don't have much of a history of open-pit cooking in China," he said. "Waste of fuel," she said through her interpreter. She held one of Mr. Staub's baby back ribs at arm's length and, in an effort to save her costume a splatter, leaned forward for a nibble. "Ummm," she said.
The other delegates followed suit. Flushed with sampling more than 100 pounds of barbecue and comforted by the smoking grill on the terrace near the conference table, they began sharing cooking techniques and pondering the quandary of 'cue. It was a brotherhood of barbecue. A rare moment. The beginning, said each delegate loudly, of building a positive local barbecue image.
Quietly, however, they said other things. "Look at the gristle on his ribs," whispered one. "He uses liquid smoke," hissed another. You can take barbecue out of the country, but you can't take a Hatfield and McCoy tone away from the pursuit of barbecue perfection.
Walking away from the table, two delegates noted that another had not been particularly forthcoming on his cooking technique. "I bet he uses a hair dryer," said one. "Ummm," said the other, wiping his barbecue-slathered hands on his silk ascot. "Gives a good flavor, doesn't it?"

VERNON'S JERK PARADISE, 254 West 29th Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues; (212) 268-7020. Jamaican-style jerked meat, fish and chicken.
 
OF A FIRE IN THE BACKYARD
 FOR most barbecue, a kettle-style grill with a cover is the best model for backyard attempts.
Stack the coals evenly in the bottom of the grill and light them. When the coals are white and powdery, the grill is generally around 200 degrees. At that point, a drip pan can be placed directly on the coals if the recipe calls for one.
Next, place the rack three to four inches from the highest coal and put the meat, chicken or fish directly on it. Cover the grill and open the vents in the cover slightly, to pull the smoke through.
During the cooking, the temperature should never go above 200 degrees; so replenish the coals slowly, adding several new pieces every 45 minutes. Keep a spray bottle of water handy and if there is a flare-up, mist the coals to extinguish it.

1. To prepare the dry mop, combine the paprika, pepper and salt in a small bowl. To prepare the wet mop, dissolve the coffee in the water in a medium-size saucepan; then add the ketchup and Worcestershire. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in butter.
2. Rub the dry mop all over the brisket, and set brisket aside.
3. Prepare the grill (one with a cover works best). After the coals turn a powdery gray-red, put a pan of water on top of the coals to catch the grease. Put the brisket on the grill over the water, and cover. Baste brisket with wet mop every half-hour for first 2 hours and once an hour after that. The longer you cook it the better the texture. At Carolina it is cooked for 24 hours; it needs at least 15 hours. Replenish charcoal and water regularly. The brisket is cooked when the meat registers 150 degrees on a meat thermometer.
4. While meat cooks, make the sauce. In a large heavy skillet over medium heat cook onion in olive oil until translucent. Add remaining ingredients except vinegar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar. When brisket is cooked, slice it thin and serve with sauce.
Yield: 6 servings.

HEADLINE: University Research Depends on 'Overhead'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
My research is supported by a grant from the United States Department of Energy. My colleagues and I often grumble about the fraction of our grants that go to "overhead," since the indirect charges paid to the university reduce the amount of money we have for our research. But the indirect charges are crucial in that they support the infrastructure -- offices, laboratories, libraries, etc. -- without which our research universities would cease to function. 
 Certainly these charges must be assessed fairly, and perhaps this system is in need of major overhaul, but in the frenzy of the moment let's not throw the baby out with the bath water. Our research universities are vital to the nation and worthy of both our pride and support. They are imitated throughout the world, and undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and senior researchers from virtually every country -- including our staunchest economic competitors, Japan and Germany -- pay our institutions of higher learning the highest compliment each year by seeking to study or work at them.

HEADLINE: Eximbank Helps U.S. Exporters Compete

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Corporate America has recovered from its sinking spell and is re-emerging as the world's pre-eminent industrial nation. This is due almost entirely to producers' renewed emphasis on quality, productivity and design. While there is still enormous room for improvement, these changes have transformed the United States into an export-driven economy for the first time in history.
The challenge remains for those of us in the financial sector to insure that our exporters have access to the competitive financing needed to get their products overseas. 
 Unfortunately, many of our commercial banks are hesitant to participate in trade financing, although there are some encouraging signs this is changing. But exporters should know that a source of financing is available to them. The Eximbank's mission is to facilitate the export of U.S. goods and services. Last year it helped finance nearly $10 billion in exports that otherwise would have not occurred. It provided short-, medium- and long-term financing and insurance. More important, the bank also leveraged its resources by guaranteeing commercial bank lending. These guarantees eliminate commercial and political risks for private lenders and increase the pool of funds available to exporters.
Guarantees get local institutions involved that can better service local exporters. The local lender profits from servicing the loan and the exporter benefits from the lower cost of the transaction. The Eximbank also gains. Its costs are reduced by dealing with financial institutions that know its export support programs.
I agree with the view that foreign trade is likely to power the economy for years to come. But I believe further that exports almost by definition must be the engine of future growth.
We have no choice. The world's economies are growing faster than ours. About 75 percent of the world's gross national product lies outside our border. Most important, there is hardly an American-made product that doesn't face foreign competition both here and abroad. Any U.S. producer that cannot compete overseas will soon find that it cannot compete at home.

HEADLINE: A Creative Council Reaps an Array of Benefits

SERIES: Playing for Power: The Council's Bid for Influence -- Third of four articles.

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB with DEAN BAQUET

 BODY:
Respect has never come easily to the New York City Council. And even as the revised City Charter has given it vast new responsibilities, power has remained in short supply for all but a handful of its members.
Nonetheless, this most demeaned of public offices does have its attractions. 
 By blurring the lines of their personal, political and official lives, the 35 Council members can wind up with hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in public and private money at their disposal. With little oversight, the members can use much of this to buy items from microwaves to cars, hire political cronies, and wine and dine constituents and contributors.
Each Council member receives a $55,000 salary for what is officially a part-time job. But this is just the beginning. Including perks and office-expense allocations, the most restrained Council member controls nearly $250,000 a year in government money.
And with the Council's new power has come new cash: the Council and its members have joined a high-stakes political money game financed by big businesses, labor unions and other interests courting their influence.
Six years ago, Council members raised a total of $1.2 million for their re-election campaigns. In 1989, as the Council was about to assume greater responsibility on budget and land-use issues, its members raised more than $2 million, much of it through a new political action committee. That figure promises to be dwarfed this year.
Noach Dear, a Democrat from the Borough Park section of Brooklyn, may have used his various funds more expansively than any other member. He has disbursed campaign donations to buy and insure a car; to contribute to his favorite charities; to take frequent trips to Israel and the Soviet Union, and to cover tens of thousands of dollars in American Express and Visa bills that have been paid without an itemization of individual charges.
But while few, if any, members have been as skillful as Mr. Dear, many have used their part-time jobs to enhance their life styles by mastering a handful of simple devices.
 
No. 1: The Lulu
 Essential to the financial enhancement of Council members is a simple rule: be kind to Peter F. Vallone, the all-powerful Speaker of the Council. The most direct way for Mr. Vallone to show his appreciation for loyalty is through the "lulu."
Twenty-nine of the 35 Council members receive these annual lulus -- payments in lieu of expenses -- of between $2,500 and $22,500, for taking on such added responsibilities as running committees, some of which rarely meet. Mr. Vallone did not invent these bonuses, but his first order of business upon assuming the title of Speaker last year was to increase their total value by more $113,000. Mr. Vallone, who himself gets a $35,000 lulu, decides who gets lulus and who doesn't.
Since early last year, two of his biggest critics, Michael DeMarco of the Bronx and Sal Albanese of Brooklyn, lost lulus worth $20,000 and $6,000, respectively.
Mr. Vallone says he expects loyalty from his committee chairmen on crucial issues because they are members of his leadership team. He staunchly defends the competence of his appointees.
Perhaps the most easily earned bonus belongs to Alfred C. Cerullo 3d, Republican of Staten Island, who gets $20,000 a year, plus a car and driver, to serve as council minority leader. As the only non-Democrat on the Council, Mr. Cerullo constitutes the entire Council minority.
 
'I Don't Abuse It'
 Mr. Cerullo, 29 years old, a lawyer and part-time soap opera actor, said his bonus was a longstanding, built-in part of the minority leader's pay. Of his car -- one of 12 assigned to the Council, up from 4 three years ago -- he said: "If that is a privilege of the office, I'm concerned about relinquishing that. But I don't abuse it in any way."
Councilman Jose Rivera of the Bronx gets $2,500 a year for running the subcommittee on pensions. Often the member with the worst attendance record, Mr. Rivera maintains that he has been getting better, and said, "You will see that I've always been present when there has been a committee meeting." Reminded that records show that his committee has never met, he said that it did meet, but not in public. "The pension committee always meets internally," he said. "You cannot blame me for the past tradition of meeting internally."
 
2. The Gold Apple
 Among the desks, computers, picture frames and plane tickets for which Council members bill the city, no single item symbolizes the petty extravagances better than the gold apple lapel pin, the unofficial mark of a member. At least a dozen members have invested in thousands of these items, at about 75 cents each, which are handed out to passers-by everywhere from the streets of New York to Puerto Rico and Israel.
"We always focus on the negatives of the city of New York," said Councilman Victor L. Robles of Brooklyn. "These little apples say that whatever you read, whatever you see, the city of New York is the best place to be."
Mr. Robles's goodwill gestures go beyond apples; he has also spent more than $1,000 of city money on birthday cards. He said his staff maintains a computer printout of the birthdays of every constituent approaching 65.
"It was my way of keeping in contact with those who reach their golden years, as I call them," he explained. "Every time a senior returns my card, I can look at the letter and tell they've been crying."
 
Goodwill Trips
 Sometime the goodwill gestures are more expensive.
Mr. Rivera has spent the most public money on trips. Council records show that since September he has spent at least $2,400 on flights to Puerto Rico, Washington and other destinations. "Yes, I have made a couple of goodwill trips to Puerto Rico," he said, including one after Hurricane Hugo.
Mr. Robles and other Council members also used their district office funds to buy video and still cameras. Mr. Robles said he uses his to record community events.
A major chunk of a Council member's expense money is used for personnel, and with this money members have hired business associates, campaign aides, losing candidates whom they supported, and relatives of political backers.
Councilman Jerry Crispino, for example, pays $38,263 to Sandra Prosnitz, a lawyer who is an associate in his firm. Martin Lasher, the father of Assemblyman Howard Lasher, receives $6,000 as a part-time aide to Councilman Sam Horwitz. Assemblyman Lasher and Councilman Horwitz share office space. Councilman Joseph Lisa hired Frank Sansivieri, a losing candidate for the state Senate and former district leader, to work for him part time. Councilman Morton Povman employs Bruce Eiber, son of an appellate division justice, a former Assembly candidate and a tennis partner of Mayor David N. Dinkins. And so on.
 
3. The Witching Hour
 If there is a witching hour for Council members, it is midnight on the last day of a fiscal year. Council members know that whatever expense money they have not spent by July 1 goes back to the city treasury. Last year, they went through $140,094 during the last week of the fiscal year, spending $107,782 on the last day, June 29, alone.
Among the big-ticket items were $21,603 in computers, copiers, software and printers; Mr. Cerullo spent $13,344 and Abraham G. Gerges $6,438.
 There was also a spate of spending on office supplies -- $5,055, with Councilman Robert Dryfoos absorbing more than $2,000 of it himself.
But for many members, the imagination runs out before the budget line. The standard response: buy stamps. In the last week of the year, 18 council members bought a total of $34,888 worth of postage stamps. Several members said they used the stamps to mail newsletters to constituents.
Mr. Cerullo said that he could hardly be blamed for spending money on office equipment since he had just assumed his Council post that month after winning a special election. Mr. Gerges, who bought his elaborate computer set-up half a year before leaving office to take a seat on the state Supreme Court, said he shopped around for the best price and eschewed such purchases as greeting cards and apple pins to save up for it.
 
4. Generous Supporters
 Campaign funds have historically been a source of largely unmonitored income for Council members, but they are now easier to come by and more plentiful than ever. The $2 million raised in 1989 went toward campaigns that with two or three exceptions attracted no serious opposition, leading to healthy surpluses that many members used for purposes other than campaign needs.
A three-year-old political action committee controlled by Mr. Vallone amassed more than $500,000, mostly from builders, unions, contractors, lawyers and lobbyists with continuing interests before the Council. Mr. Vallone disbursed much of this money to Council incumbents and to enhance the reputation of the institution he controls.
 
Major Contributions
 Nearly one-fifth of the money raised by the Council Political Action Committee, known as C-PAC, came from real-estate developers, including Donald J. Trump, who gave $5,000. More than $87,000 came from unions.
Roughly $15,000 of C-PAC's money came from powerful government lobbyists and advisers like Howard Rubenstein, the longtime adviser to a succession of mayors, who gave $4,000. Another $31,000 came from lawyers, including such government-oriented firms as Shea & Gould and Davidoff & Malito, each of which contributed $4,000.
The giving is not limited to C-PAC. Records show that, as in most legislative bodies, chairmen and members of Council committees often receive sizable contributions from the interests they are supposed to monitor.
For example, Rafael Castaneira Colon, chairman of the Civil Service Committee -- a job for which he receives a $10,000 lulu -- raised $29,705 of his $92,210 fund from municipal unions. Jerome X. O'Donovan, chairman of the Economic Development Committee, received $1,760 from the Political Action Committee of the Real Estate Board of New York, $2,000 from the Building Industry of New York, $1,000 from another real-estate group, the Neighborhood Preservation PAC, and $1,000 from the General Contractors Association.
Councilman Sheldon Leffler, who received more than $10,000 from real-estate interests in his last campaign, said he got the contributions because of contacts he made as the swing man on a 4-to-3 vote in the Economic Development Committee that killed a proposal for commercial rent control. "I think they felt I was somebody who was not an anti-landlord demagogue, who understands development in the city," he said.
Because of his leadership of C-PAC, Mr. Vallone did not actively raise money on his own behalf after 1987 and took in only $4,224 during the 1989 campaign year. Of this, $1,500 was from the General Contractors Association, which recently lobbied the Council fiercely to stop construction of a municipal asphalt plant, and $2,000 from the union local representing school paraprofessionals.
 
Broad Range of Expenditures
 This union, Local 372 of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, is a longtime supporter of Priscilla Wooten, whose recent appointment as chairwoman of the Education Committee brings her a $10,000 lulu. The local was her largest contributor at $4,500.
Councilwoman Wooten said she would not be compromised by the strong union backing.
As Council members know, the campaign funds can be spent on far more than campaigns. It has been used, legally, to pay for car phones, dinners, and contributions to other candidates and to charities.
Until recently, virtually none of these funds were audited. State election law permits wide discretion in their use, prohibiting only the most purely personal expenses.
In 1989, Councilman Dryfoos used his campaign fund, which includes contributions from some of Manhattan's wealthiest developers and businessmen, to pay himself at least $13,716 in salary, and $2,100 for unspecified travel expenses. A spokesman for Mr. Dryfoos said the payments were to reimburse the Councilman for salaries he advanced to campaign staff.
 
5. Merging Interests
 Regulations also permit members to maintain outside businesses. Many of the dozen lawyers on the Council not only continue to practice, but do so out of the same premises as their Council district offices.
The convergence is perhaps best symbolized by a sign on Westchester Square, in the Bronx, advertising, "Office of Councilman Michael DeMarco, Esq."
Council members who are lawyers are prohibited from representing clients against the city. The city's Department of Investigations three years ago began examining accusations that Mr. DeMarco had pressured city agencies into taking actions that would benefit one of his clients in the waste-hauling business. Mr. DeMarco denies that the company was a client. The investigation has not reached a conclusion.
Mr. DeMarco said his joint office is a legacy of the days when Council members received small expense accounts and he could not afford to run separate offices.
For others, like Mr. DeMarco's Bronx neighbor, Mr. Crispino, the lines between legal work and Council work can become obscure, indeed. Mr. Crispino has served as lawyer for the family that owns the Naclerio Construction Company, whose principals have contributed thousands to his campaigns over 15 years. As a Council member, Mr. Crispino sponsored legislation renaming a street in the Bronx "Salvatore Naclerio Place," for the company's founder.
 
'Westchester Office'
 The Naclerio company was barred from doing new business with the city after it was caught submitting phony invoices. More recently, the company has been mired in controversy over the botched reconstruction of Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn.
Mr. Crispino said he stopped representing the Naclerio family three years ago. There is no evidence that Mr. Crispino represented the company on any of its city contracts.
Unlike Mr. DeMarco, Mr. Crispino does not practice law from his Council office, but from his home. He lives in a leafy neighborhood on the border between the Bronx and Westchester County, which has led opponents to assert that he barely lives in his district. Indeed, on his law firm letterhead, Mr. Crispino lists his home address as his "Westchester Office."

HEADLINE: Ethiopia's Dictator Flees; Officials Seeking U.S. Help

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia, May 21

 BODY:
Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, who ruled Ethiopia with an iron hand for 14 years, resigned today and fled the country. Officials of his Government then called on the United States to try to arrange a settlement with Ethiopian rebels who were reported advancing on the capital.
Shortly after Colonel Mengistu's departure at 9:30 A.M. on an Ethiopian Airlines plane bound for Zimbabwe, Prime Minister Tesfaye Dinka telephoned the charge d'affaires at the the United States Embassy here, Robert G. Houdek, to request that Washington relay a request to the guerrillas for an immediate cease-fire. Later in the day, airport officials in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, said Colonel Mengistu had arrived there. 
 American officials, who have played a growing role in seeking a negotiated solution to the civil war in recent months, agreed to pass on the message, but a representative of the rebels refused to call a halt to the offensive.
 
Control to Vice President
 Before he left, Colonel Mengistu, who held the title of President, handed control of the Addis Ababa Government to his Vice President, Lieut. Gen. Tesfaye Gebre-Kidan. But the departure of Colonel Mengistu appeared to herald the end of Africa's hardest-line Marxist government, one held responsible for the deaths of thousands of Ethiopians in political purges and for the forced relocation of hundreds of thousands of peasants to Government-founded cooperatives and state farms.
In the last year the Government moved to loosen restraints over the nation's politics and economy, but the animosity it had created among a diverse collection of rural ethnic groups was too much to overcome.
Like the hard-line Communist leaders of Eastern Europe, Colonel Mengistu was undermined by sharp reductions in Soviet military and economic aid in the last two years. A nearly complete cutoff of Soviet assistance since December eroded army morale, and one unit after another collapsed when confronted by a rebel offensive begun in February.
The rebels are reported to be within 50 miles of the capital and still advancing. The Second and Third Revolutionary Armies, Ethiopia's best, appear to have taken flight.
United States officials in recent weeks had quietly suggested that Colonel Mengistu resign to achieve peace. Last month, Colonel Mengistu told former Senator Rudy Boschwitz, a special envoy of President Bush, that he would leave his post if it was the only way to keep Ethiopia united.
Senior Government officials said the Ethiopian President and his closest advisers decided Monday night that he should resign after concluding that it was the only way to avert the disintegration of the country.
"Everything is coming to an end because we have reached a stage where our military can't do anything to stop the guerrillas," said a senior Government official, who spoke on condition that he remain anonymous. "This is not the beginning of the end. It is the end of the end."
The Mengistu Government faced two major rebel groups: the Eritrean People's Liberation Front and the Tigre People's Liberation Front.
 
Fighting for 31 Years
 For 31 years, the Eritrean group has been fighting for the independence of the northern province, which borders the Red Sea and includes the critical port of Massawa. Massawa has been in rebel hands for more than a year and rebel forces are besieging the province capital, Asmara. During the 1970's, the Eritrean group had a strongly Marxist ideology, but in recent years has softened its line.
The Tigre rebels, based in that province south of Eritrea, are fighting to overthrow the Mengistu Government. Active since the mid-1970's, it won military control of Tigre several years ago. The Tigre group has a harder Marxist line than the the Eritreans.
In the last several months, the two groups have formed the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front, but have kept their separate identities and long-term goals.
The Government announced Colonel Mengistu's departure in a brief radio broadcast at noon.
"In order to control the shedding of blood and return the nation to peace and progress, several individuals came to the understanding that the President should relinquish his power," it said. "Therefore, he has relinquished his power to Vice President Lieut. Gen. Tesfaye Gebre-Kidan and left the country."
 
Would Work in Transition
 The statement went on to suggest that the Government would "work for the formation of a transitional government."
Senior officials in the Government said General Tesfaye, who only took office as Vice President last month, would be little more than a figurehead. They said Prime Minister Tesfaye, who is no relation to the general, would effectively run the Government and attempt to negotiate a settlement with the guerrillas.
General Tesfaye was military administrator for Eritrea province until he was appointed Vice President. He was described by diplomats as a non-ideological officer with a decent record on human rights. He is reportedly popular with most groups in the army.
Prime Minister Tesfaye is an economist and former Foreign Minister who has developed a good relationship with officials in the Bush Administration and Western Europe.
The immediate popular reaction to Colonel Mengistu's departure appeared to be one more of surprise than relief. No demonstrations were reported in the capital or around the country, and the omnipresent signs and banners with Colonel Mengistu's picture were left untouched.
"Mengistu is gone and that is a relief for us," said Mugeta Tesfaye, a 39-year-old bank clerk, "but we will be lucky if we get a peaceful resolution."
"How could this be good?" asked Abeb Tesfaye, an accountant. "Just as we are threatened, he leaves us."
After Colonel Mengistu fled, rumors spread through the capital that the rebels were about to descend on the capital and kill everyone associated with the Government. Army troops patrolled the streets in open-bed trucks and jeeps with their assault rifles at the ready. During the day, citizens formed long lines at banks to withdraw their money and at local stores to hoard food. Schools and Government office buildings closed early, and the Government announced that the normal midnight-to-5 A.M. curfew would begin at 9 P.M.
Colonel Mengistu, whose age is placed between 46 and 53 in various references, was a member of a council of officers that overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie in a bloodless coup in 1974. He took sole control in 1977, when he personally killed several members of the junta at a meeting in the capital.
After making a tactical alliance with the Soviet Union and Cuba to repulse an attack by neighboring Somalia in the late 1970's, he formed a Marxist-Leninist ruling party and set out to create a Communist system.
 
No Respite for Government
 But separatist guerrillas in Eritrea bled his Government with their persistent attacks. Then war, failed economic policies and a devastating drought in the mid-1980's led to mass-scale hunger that left hundreds of thousands of people dead.
Critics charged that Colonel Mengistu worsened the famine by denying food to areas most opposed to his agrarian programs, which included fixed prices and forced crop and labor contributions by peasants.
His rule unraveled quickly since the guerrillas began coordinated attacks Thursday to the west, north and northeast of the capital. Today, Tigrean rebels accomplished their goal of cutting off the capital from Assab, the last port under Government control, by taking the northern highway town of Mille. As other Tigrean forces marched only 50 miles west of the capital, Eritrean rebels threatened to overwhelm Government troops in Asmara, the Eritrean capital.
Dawit Yohannes, a member of the rebels' supreme council, said in a telephone interview from Washington that he welcomed Colonel Mengistu's departure. But he added that the President's resignation did not go far enough because it did not signify an end to the Government.
He said the rebels were ready to discuss entering into a coalition government with officials in the present Government at peace talks sponsored by the United States and scheduled to be held in London next week. "We have no intention of attacking the capital," he added.
But Eritrean rebel leaders said they would only join a coalition government if a referendum is set for their province to decide on outright independence. The present Government has refused to consider any condition that would threaten the unity of Ethiopia.
 
'What Will Impress Them?'
 Kassa Kebede, foreign policy chief of the ruling Ethiopian Workers' Party, said he was disappointed by the guerrilla response. "If the stepping down of the President doesn't mean much to them, what will impress them?"
A Western diplomat predicted that the Government and guerrillas would attend the London talks, and that Addis Ababa "would have little left to bargain with."
Colonel Mengistu apparently made his final decision to depart after President Robert G. Mugabe of Zimbabwe sent an envoy here on Monday to repeat his invitation that the Ethiopian leader move to Zimbabwe, where his family had already gone.
Colonel Mengistu reportedly invited many of his longest supporters to his palace for a farewell party on Monday night. He left for the airport this morning, unceremoniously, in a caravan of four vans surrounded by motorcycles.

Chart: "Ethiopia: At a Glance"
 
Government
Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam had led a single-party Marxist-Leninist government based on the Soviet model since 1977.
 
Geography
Bordered by the Red Sea, Sudan, Kenya and Somalia, the country of 472,000 square mles is about the size of Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico combined. The terrain largely consists of high plateaus, mountains and dry lowland plains.
 
Economy
The country, one of the least developed nations in the world, has an economy based on agriculture. Two-thirds of the arable land is under cultivation and nearly 90 percent of the people depend on farming for subsistence. Coffee is the country's most important cash crop. But guerrilla insurgencies and famine caused by recurring drought have caused major disruptions in economic activity.
 
History
A nation of 48 million people, modern Ethiopia dates to 1896, when Emperor Menelik II repelled an Italian invasion from Eritrea and consolidated the country. His cousin, Ras Tafari Makonnen, became regent for his daughter at Menelik's death, and when the Empress died in 1930, proclaimed himself Emperor Haile Selassie. Mussolini's invaders forced him to flee the country in 1935, but he returned in 1941 after the Italians were defeated by British troops. The former Italian colony of Eritrea was merged with Ethiopia in 1952.
In 1974, the Emperor was deposed in a military coup by leftist officers. One of them, Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, consolidated control in 1977, killing remaining rivals for power. Authoritarian rule in the following decade -- along with the miseries of drought, famine and long-running guerrilla strife in Tigre and Eritrea -- left the country hobble. Until recently Colonel Mengistu had received billions of dollars in Soviet military and economic aid.
 
People
The dominant Ethiopian people are the Oromo, who make up 40 percent of the population. But there are 40 other ethnic groups in the country. The next largest are the Amhara (25 percent), the Tigre (12 percent) and the Sidama (9 percent). About 40 percent of the population is Muslim, about 40 percent is Ethiopian Orthodox Christian. (pg. A13)

HEADLINE: Weicker Says He'll Veto No-Income-Tax Plan

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 22

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said today that he would veto the no-income-tax budget plan unveiled by legislators on Tuesday. His announcement, one day before the Senate is expected to begin debate on the plan, raised the stakes further in the battle of wills between the administration and the General Assembly.
The budget plan was developed by leaders in both parties as a way to avoid the tax on wages that Mr. Weicker has argued is the only way for Connecticut to resolve its fiscal crisis. 
 Instead of an income tax, it would raise business taxes and apply the state's 8 percent sales tax to hundreds of millions of additional transactions. In the process, Mr. Weicker argues, it would also cripple the state's ability to pull itself out of recession.
Connecticut is one of only a handful of states that does not tax wages, although it does tax income from dividends, interest and capital gains.
 
A Much Smaller Margin
 "This is disastrous," he told reporters as he was entering the Capitol this morning. "If I didn't veto this, I should not be governor of the State of Connecticut."
Mr. Weicker had attacked the plan before as the particulars were still in negotiation, but had reserved a formal veto promise until all the details were in. Sponsors of the plan said today that since Mr. Weicker's views were well-known, he had added nothing new today, and they again expressed confidence that they had the votes to pass their plan in the Senate, as well as in the House, though there by a much smaller margin.
Other lawmakers said that Mr. Weicker, having now "guaranteed," as he put it, that the plan would not survive past his desk, had added another wrinkle in the complex political game that is going on as lawmakers look both to what their constituents want and do not want, and how the wrenching choices to be made this year may affect the legislative elections in 1992.
The thinking works like this: with a veto certain, lawmakers now know well in advance of their vote that a simple majority in both chambers for the no-income-tax budget will not be enough to insure passage; a two-thirds majority is needed to override a veto.
 
Even More Complicated
 Mr. Weicker's announcement sends a message to lawmakers who might agree that an income tax is needed, but who feel trapped by the public's apparent antipathy toward it.
Knowing where Mr. Weicker stands, they can safely vote for the legislative plan, knowing it will not become law, and then change their minds after his veto.
But some income-tax supporters say the equation is even more complicated. So many unpopular taxes had to be raised or added to make up for the lack of an income tax, they say, that the legislative package may no longer be a safe vote either. The plan would raise total taxes by $960 million, almost as much as Mr. Weicker's plan.

HEADLINE: On Philippine Treaty, Gap Is Said to Narrow

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
American and Philippine officials are expressing optimism that they can work out a new treaty permitting American forces to remain at two large military bases in the Philippines after the current lease expires in September.
Officials on both sides caution, however, that they are still without an agreement on the duration of the proposed treaty and the amount of compensation due to Manila. 
 The Philippines has offered to allow American forces to remain at Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay Naval Station and four smaller installations for up to seven years in exchange for $825 million a year in cash and other benefits.
The United States has demanded a treaty of at least 10 years and, according to Philippine negotiators, has offered an annual compensation package of about $400 million. American officials have refused to confirm the $400 million figure.
Clark and Subic are among the largest and oldest American military installations abroad, home to more than 10,000 American troops.
While the Defense Department no longer considers them vital to national security in light of a diminished Soviet threat in the Pacific, the Bush Administration hopes to hold on to the bases, arguing that it would be impossible to establish similar, mammoth military installations elsewhere in the region.
Newspapers in Manila reported this week that American and Philippine negotiators were hurrying to complete the agreement so that Vice President Dan Quayle could sign a treaty during his current trip to Asia.
American officials said today that a Quayle visit to Manila had been considered but was now unlikely. "We had hoped that the agreement might be ready this week," a State Department official said. "But it wasn't." President Corazon C. Aquino has intervened personally in the base negotiations in recent days, summoning the United States Ambassador, Nicholas Platt, to the presidential palace in Manila last Saturday for three hours of talks.
American negotiators said they were heartened by Mrs. Aquino's move. "Anytime the Ambassador gets the opportunity to visit with the president of the republic, I think it's pretty clear that she wants to bring the process to closure in a friendly way," a State Department official said. "I think it's fair to say she's anxious to get an agreement."
Mrs. Aquino is thought to be anxious to sign a new bases treaty if only to protect Philippine economic ties to the United States, the Philippines' largest trading partner.
 The Philippines is among the largest recipients of American foreign aid and enjoys a variety of trade concessions with the United States that, American officials have suggested, would be threatened if the base negotiations collapse.
Under Philippine law, a new treaty would have to be ratified by the nation's 23-member Senate, and American officials say Mrs. Aquino will have to lobby vigorously if the agreement is to win approval from Philippine lawmakers.
Although opinion pools show that the Philippine public wants to keep the bases, there has been strong opposition within the Senate. Many of the senators describe the American bases as a violation of national sovereignty and an ugly reminder of the Philippines' colonial past.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money Market Funds Post Mixed Yields for the Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed for the week that ended yesterday.
Analysts at IBC/Donoghue's say short-term interest rates are still coming down, but if economic indicators show that the recession is near its end, expect money market yields to settle near their present levels since the Federal Reserve may not lower interest rates further. 
 Walter S. Frank, Donoghue's chief economist, noted that today's durable-goods report for April could be critical. If the numbers are bad, an indication of weakness in the manufacturing sector, further interest-rate cuts could be in order, and that would push yields on Treasury bills and money market funds even lower.
Tax-exempt money fund yields declined for the week, with the average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios down a day, to 43. The assets of tax-exempt funds increased by $715 million, to a total of $88.9 billion.
For the seven-day period that ended yesterday, the average tax-exempt compounded yield fell by 8 basis points, or one-hundredth of a percentage point, to 4.15 percent, with the seven-day simple yield down by 7 basis points, to 4.07 percent. The 30-day compounded average yield fell by 2 basis points, to 4.29 percent, with the 30-day simple falling a similar amount, to 4.20 percent.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day compounded yield was 5.76 percent, while the equivalent in the 31 percent tax bracket was 6.01 percent.
Of the tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the Strong Municipal Money Market fund, distributed by Strong/Cornelison Capital Management Inc. in Milwaukee, had the best return for the second straight week, at an unchanged 5.19 percent.
 
Taxable Assets Up
 The assets of taxable funds increased by $3.4 billion for the week, to a total of $460.7 billion, with those of institutional funds up by $1 billion, to a total of $117.5 billion. But only $600 million of the gain represented sales, while the rest came from the addition of new funds. Consumer assets increased by $2.4 billion, to a total of $343.2 billion.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield was unchanged at 5.74 percent, while the 30-day compounded yield fell by 5 basis points, to 5.81 percent. The seven-day simple yield remained unchanged, at 5.58 percent, while the 30-day simple yield was down by 5 basis points, to 5.65 percent.
Including capital gains, the taxable fund with the best return was the Prudential Government Securities/ U.S. Treasuries, with a yield of 8.57 percent, but the more conventional return was by the American Performance Cash Management Fund, distributed by the Winsbury Company in Columbus, Ohio, with a yield of 6.82 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Makes Some Gains In Extremely Slow Session

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose on technical factors in extremely quiet trading yesterday.
Gold fell 90 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York to close at $356.30 an ounce. The Republic National Bank quoted a bid of $355.50, off $1. 
 Analysts said there was no news to sway the currency market. Ronald Holzer, chief foreign exchange dealer with Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, described the dollar's movements as a "technical retracement" after losses on Tuesday.
Traders were adjusting their positions ahead of today's scheduled release of data on April orders for durable goods and the weekly state unemployment claims. The markets were also beginning to wind down before the three-day Memorial Day holiday weekend.
The dollar gained against the Japanese yen in New York, trading on speculation that the Bank of Japan might lower its discount rate. A lowering of rates in a country generally tends to cause its currency to drop in value.
The dollar closed at 137.80 yen in New York, up from 137.30 late Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the United States currency fell 0.70 yen, to a closing 137.45 yen, but it was quoted higher in London at 138.00 yen.
The British pound slipped against the dollar. Sterling fell to $1.7280 in New York, from $1.7370 on Tuesday. In earlier London trading, the pound fell to $1.7270 from $1.7365.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.7227 German marks, up from 1.7128; 1.4602 Swiss francs, up from 1.4485; 5.8455 French francs, up from 5.8140; 1,279.00 Italian lire, up from 1,272.00, and 1.14975 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14895.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.7210 German marks, up from 1.7125; 1.4598 Swiss francs, up from 1.4480; 5.8425 French francs, up from 5.8100; 1.9390 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9290; 1,277.50 Italian lire, up from 1,271.25, and 1.1490 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1488.
Silver fell 0.3 cent on the Commodity Exchange, closing at $4.032 an ounce. In London, silver fell to a late bid of $4.03, from $4.05 late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Recovery Expected to Be Weak

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Ask a White House official, a member of Congress or a Federal Reserve policy maker what might happen when the recession ends, and they give this answer: Growth will be slow and sluggish. The bursts of activity that came immediately after other post-World War II recessions will not materialize this time.
That view showed up repeatedly in nearly a dozen recent interviews with Government officials. They accept the view of many economists that the American economy will probably expand by less than 3 percent in the first year of recovery, or roughly one-third the average growth rate after the eight previous postwar recessions. 
 The Government's reluctance to provide special stimulus has two aspects. One is a belief that the economy lacks the capacity to grow robustly without reigniting inflation. The other reflects a decision, shared by Democrats and Republicans, not to violate the October budget agreement, which chips away at the deficit over five years. The agreement rules out -- for the first time since World War II -- the combination of tax cuts and new spending that made the economy boom in the past.
"I am not attending meetings where we talk about how to get out of the recession and insure a strong recovery," said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana.
Did such meetings to discuss emergency spending programs like highway construction or job training take place in the 1981-82 recession? "Sure they did," Mr. Hamilton said. "We talked about many programs, but we have lost confidence in what Congress can do to pump up the economy in the short term."
Beyond politics, the various engines of growth -- exports, home construction, auto sales and household incomes -- are not likely to be strong enough to power a brisk recovery, economists say. What's more, Corporate America is no longer willing to engage in the rapid stockpiling of goods in anticipation of rising sales, a practice that inflated growth in the aftermath of past recessions.
"The real story of this recession, and probably the early recovery period, is that there is no area of strength, not in exports, or rising personal income or Government spending or manufacturing," said Henry J. Aaron, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution.
The recession is not over yet. The gross national product is still shrinking, which means that the quantity of goods and services produced in each quarter since last October has declined. The Administration says the decline will end by July, and that is also the consensus view of 50 private forecasters surveyed each month by Blue Chip Economic Indicators.
Assuming that a turning point is near, the Blue Chip consensus forecast in May predicted G.N.P. growth of 2.2 percent in the recovery's first year. After the eight other postwar ecessions, the average first-year growth rate was 6.5 percent.
"We could drift along for some months," said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office.
An anemic first-year recovery would make companies reluctant to rehire laid-off workers. Raises for those who do have jobs might be small and scarce, reflecting recent trends. And consumers will probably remain cautious shoppers until a stronger economy makes them feel more secure in their jobs.
 
What Fed Is Doing
 The Federal Reserve, which also has the power to step on the economic gas, favors a mild recovery. According to Fed policy makers, mild growth is all that the economy can achieve without increasing the inflation rate. Their concern is that the nation's businesses are not productive enough to supply all the needs of an economy growing at an annual rate of more than 2.5 percent to 3 percent. Beyond that level, people simply bid up the prices of a limited supply of goods and services and inflation rises. From 1983 through 1989, the G.N.P. grew at annual rates ranging from 2.5 percent (in 1989) to 6.8 percent (in 1984).
Such concerns about the nation's capacity for growth contributed to the Fed's decision to keep interest rates relatively high before the recession began last July. The decision played a key role in reducing the nation's economic growth to an annual rate of less than 2 percent, starting in the spring of 1989.
The Federal Reserve, which termed this approach a "soft landing," wants to maintain the policy after the recession ends, Fed officials suggest. The Fed would lower interest rates another notch (and thereby encourage the borrowing that stimulates economic activity) only if it saw clear evidence that the recession was continuing. That strategy was adopted at the Fed's policy making meetings on March 26 and again last Tuesday, according to the minutes of the March meeting and the reports of Government officials.
"I would say that in their heart of hearts, Fed policy makers want a very slow recovery that maintains the economy below its potential for growth," said Paul A. Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economic science, who believes the Fed has been too cautious.
The last recovery got help from the Federal Government. President Reagan provided a huge fiscal stimulus, the nation's last big one, when he pushed through his 1981 package of tax cuts and investment incentives in the early months of the recession. The robust recovery that began in November 1982 resulted in part from the big Reagan tax cut, many economists contend.
Today Administration officials and Republicans in Congress maintain that tax cuts and spending programs are no remedy because they would bear fruit too late. They say that steps to authorize public works projects and other job-creating programs would not produce jobs until next year, after a recovery was already under way.
 
Inflation in 70's Recalled
 They argue that similar legislation in the recessionary mid-1970's contributed to the high inflation rates late in the decade. These included a public works bill, a job-training program, Federal housing assistance, higher levels of Federal financing for state and local governments than exist today, and broader unemployment insurance coverage. "
"Fiscal stimulus has tended to add to inflationary pressures in the postwar period," said Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. "By and large, the spending came into effect only after recoveries had started, and long after anyone advocating the policy deemed it desirable."
Reflecting the White House view, Richard G. Darman, the budget director, said the current recession had been mild and was ending without special help from extra Government spending. Mr. Darman acknowledged that economic growth, in the first year of recovery, will probably be weaker than in the aftermath of past recessions. But the more important issue, he said, is achieving sustainable, noninflationary growth over a longer term.
Below-par economic growth is likely to endure well into the 1992 election campaign, but studies by political scientists show that voters will not necessarily be alienated, Mr. Darman said. "It is the direction, not the magnitude, that counts," he said.
The Democrats do not openly challenge the view that fiscal stimulus is not needed and in the past came too late. As Senator Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said, "The miraculous thing is that no one is pushing for job programs and other major spending."
Nevertheless, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, says public works projects now on hold at the state and municipal level -- for lack of financing -- could get under way immediately, if Congress provided the necessary funds. That would hasten a recovery, he said.
The fiscal stimulus proposed to date is small scale. Senator Sarbanes, Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Long Island, and a few others want to extend unemployment insurance payments to 52 weeks, as they were in the last recession. They currently are a maximum of 26 weeks in nearly every state, a result of rule changes in the 80's that tightened eligibility.
The spending increase to extend jobless pay -- nearly $5 billion a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office -- would require under the budget agreement an offsetting tax increase or an immediate reduction in some other spending program. That can happen only if Congress passes an emergency authorization to extend unemployment insurance, and President Bush gives his endorsement.
Democratic leaders in Congress say they would have sought the emergency authorization if the unemployment rate had risen in April beyond the March level of 6.8 percent. Instead, the rate fell to 6.6 percent for reasons that the Labor Department says might be reversed in May.

Georgia Pacific May Laugh Last

BYLINE: By Jonathan P. Hicks

 BODY:
THE Georgia Pacific Corporation may be poised for the last laugh at the naysayers who said a year ago that it was taking on far too great a burden in its $3.8 billion acquisition of the Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation, which made it the nation's largest forest-products concern.
Many analysts and industry executives said the acquisition would be particularly challenging amid predictions of an economic downturn and said its earnings would suffer profoundly. Indeed, last month the company reported a first-quarter loss of $7 million, its first quarterly loss since 1982. 
 One reason for the loss is the nation's recession. Lower industrial output has translated into fewer items being shipped in boxes, and sagging corporate profits and layoffs have meant less paperwork is being performed. But in addition to the negative economic forces affecting the entire paper industry, Georgia Pacific has been saddled with huge interest payments from the Great Northern acquisition.
Nevertheless, there are widespread forecasts of remarkably smoother sailing in the industry after the end of next year, and, analysts now say, Georgia Pacific's competitive position will be considerably stronger as a result of its acquisition.
"Over time, the acquisition of Great Northern will prove to be one of the smartest decisions made by any paper company," said Mark S. Rogers, an analyst with Prudential Securities. "Of course, right now we are seeing the negative side of the acquisition. The good news is that the cash flow of the company is strong, and the debt is working its way down. As we see general business conditions improve, the addition of Great Northern will prove to be valuable."
One reason for this optimistic outlook is that Georgia Pacific, like most other paper companies in the United States, is a relatively low-cost producer, compared with overseas competitors. Also, capacity in the United States is growing at much the same rate as growth in demand, Furthermore, as the nation recovers from recession, demand for paper products like business papers and shipping cartons will pick up, they reason.
Also, Georgia Pacific has worked feverishly to whittle down its debt. The company has undertaken an asset sale program, raising $1 billion from the sale of two linerboard mills, more than 30 box plants and timberlands in the Pacific Northwest. Also, an aggressive capital spending program is slowing down as more projects are completed.
"They are on their way to their target, which is to reduce their debt to the 40 percent to 45 percent range," said Michael L. Bowyer, a paper analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago. The company's debt-to-capital ratio soared from 47 percent at the end of 1989, to nearly 70 percent after the acquisition.
Moreover, the acquisition of Great Northern Nekoosa has bolstered the company's presence in the paper products sector of the business, reducing its exposure to the highly cyclical building products sector, which tends to be dependent on the housing industry. "They have a stronger product mix as a result of the acquisition," Mr. Bowyer said.
"When all is said and done, I guess one can say that Georgia Pacific plotted all the strategies very well," said Sherman Chao, a paper analyst with Salomon Brothers. "They have planned for and anticipated everything that has come about -- except for the wood-products business suffering from the credit crunch that has affected the housing sector. But, other than that, they have planned well."
Mr. Rogers expects the company will report a loss for this year, but he estimates that Georgia Pacific will earn $2.90 a share next year. That will be lower than the $3.99 a share earned last year and the $7.42 a share Georgia Pacific earned in 1989. Still, he predicts that the economy will be more robust and the company's debt will be down so dramatically that Georgia Pacific will earn about $12 a share within three to four years.
Mr. Chao also predicts a loss this year, but forecasts earnings of $2.50 a share for Georgia Pacific next year. He declines to estimate earnings beyond that. Mr. Bowyer of Duff & Phelps is more optimistic, forecasting earnings of $1.85 this year and $3.50 for 1992.
Investors also seem bullish. The company's stock, which traded at $44 at the time of the acquisition, closed up 12.5 cents yesterday at $47 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Demand for Notes Spurs Bond Selloff

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
An auction of $12.25 billion in new two-year Treasury notes went well yesterday, but after the results of the sale were announced, traders responded by selling longer-term notes and bonds.
The new notes were sold at an average yield of 6.81 percent, the lowest level in more than four years and well below the 7 percent average rate at the last two-year note sale on April 24. 
 Demand for the new securities was strong, but when the results of the auction were announced, bond prices fell. Traders said people were selling bonds to buy the shorter maturities, betting that the Federal Reserve Board might yet again move to lower short-term interest rates.
 
Volume Is Light
 Moreover, market participants said trading was so light that any selling of bonds had a disproportionately large effect on prices.
"It was a very unusual auction," said John P. Costas, a managing director at the First Boston Corporation.
"This issue is doing very well," he said. "There is an isolated source of demand for securities with maturities of two years or less. But the litmus test for the market will be the five-year auction on Thursday, not these two-year securities. And I think the market will need to see rates back up a bit in order to take on the five-year."
Demand for the new two-year notes remained strong after the auction, and by late yesterday the securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.78 percent.
Meanwhile, the five-year notes scheduled to be auctioned today were offered in when-issued trading late yesterday at a price to yield 7.69 percent, down from 7.70 percent late on Tuesday.
The sense that yields on the new five-year notes will have to move higher to attract demand is based on recent performance of such notes, the analysts said.
"Since the inauguration of the monthly five-year note auctions in January, much of the steepening in the yield curve has been between two-year notes and five-year notes," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a firm in Princeton, N.J., that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets. The differential between the yield on two-year notes and the 30-year bond is the greatest in five years, but two-thirds of that, Mr. McCarthy said, represents the difference between yields on the two-year notes and the five-year notes.
"But yields in the five-year sector are pretty good right now," Mr. McCarthy added. " There is not a lot of reward to extend out beyond five years. But there is a lot of reward to go out to five years."
 
30-Year Bonds at 8.27%
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 98 3/8 late yesterday, down by 9/32, to yield 8.27 percent, up from 8.24 percent late on Tuesday.
Among note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 19/ 32, down by an eighth of a point, to yield 8.06 percent.
But the prices of shorter-term notes firmed slightly.
In late trading, for example, the 7 percent three-year notes were offered at 99 25/32, up by 2/32, to yield 7.08 percent.
Treasury bill rates finished mixed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.44 percent late yesterday, down by 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late-offered rate of 5.62 percent.
In other developments, the heavy issuance of new tax-exempt municipal bond offerings continued.
 
Massachusetts Financing
 Foremost among issuers yesterday was the financially beleaguered Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which tapped the municipal bond market for the first time this year.
Investor demand for the new securities was so strong that the size of the negotiated sale was increased to $508.8 million, from the $475 million that was initially anticipated.
The issue consists of serial and term bonds with maturities to 2011.
The maximum yield on the securities offered was 7.83 percent on term bonds maturing in 2010.
Even with the increased size of the issue, market participants said the deal was oversubscribed.
"Reception of this transaction shows that investors have confidence in the plan of the Governor, the Treasurer and the legislative leadership" to balance the state's budget, said Eric Turner, the Massachusetts deputy treasurer for debt management.
Paul Williams, the manager of corporate planning and research at John Nuveen & Company, said, "There are some buyers who feel that perhaps Massachusetts's problems have ebbed."
 
Sound Yields Seen
 Another reason for the offering's success, Mr. Williams added, is that "there are not a lot of high-yield offerings out there." He went on, "And depending on an individual's tax bracket, the yield on these securities could translate into a taxable coupon of 10.5 percent to 11 percent."
The First Boston Corporation acted as the lead manager for the Massachusetts financing. The securities are rated Baa by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Activity in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds was very spotty, traders said. The prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged on the day.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds also reported that trading was very light, and that prices of most issues were unchanged.

HEADLINE: GORBACHEV PLEADS FOR $100 BILLION IN AID FROM WEST

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 22

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev pleaded today for $100 billion in economic aid from the democratic world, asserting that it would be well worth it to the West to bolster global security by priming a Soviet recovery.
The Soviet leader put his own print on what has been an unofficial and far from successful Kremlin lobbying campaign of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies for a voice at their summit gathering and for considerable cash aid for the staggering Soviet economy. 
 It was also the first time he had cited a specific figure. But it was unclear if the $100 billion was a well-thought-out request or was only suggestive. He did not say over how many years he envisaged such aid, but Soviet economists have been talking of $30 billion a year, much of it in outright grants, not loans. If it were loaned, $100 billion would instantly vault the Soviet Union into second place on the list of governments with the heaviest debt to foreign creditors.
 
Opposition From the White House
 "I have optimism on this issue," Mr. Gorbachev said at a news conference.
Mr. Gorbachev chose to move publicly with the ambitious economic initiative despite an oblique rebuff from White House officials, who said on Tuesday that his idea of formal inclusion at the seven-nation economic summit meeting in London in July is "a non-starter."
Announcing progress on a Soviet-American arms-control treaty today, President Bush held open the possibility of Mr. Gorbachev's attending the Group of Seven meeting, but did not endorse the idea. [Page A10.] But the idea of Mr. Gorbachev's coming to London was backed by Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti of Italy, who shared the platform with Mr. Gorbachev today.
Mr. Gorbachev argued that the fate of Soviet economic and political change was as important to the stability of the world outside as to the future of his troubled nation.
It deserved closer attention and support from the Group of Seven, he argued, because the Soviet Union has become "one of the solid, reliable pillars of today's world."
"If that pillar disappears," he continued, "we should consider all the possible consequences."
 
Summit Meeting's Prospects
 Mr. Gorbachev also confirmed that there would probably be no summit meeting here with Mr. Bush by the end of June, as originally planned, because preparatory details on disarmament issues remained unsettled.
"We cannot fix the exact date in advance," he said, but stressed that he and Mr. Bush continue to enjoy a good relationship and look forward to the meeting being held eventually.
Mr. Gorbachev, appearing jointly at the Foreign Ministry with Mr. Andreotti, seemed intent on declaring the extent of his hopes rather than in pondering the political risks of an initiative that thus far has received no encouragement from the White House.
"If I don't go, I'll still say what I want to say," he declared, smiling jauntily in discussing his need to be heard in some fashion at the economic summit meeting.
He demonstrated his point by even specifying the sort of economic aid he thinks it would be wise for the economic superpowers to extend to the Soviet Union as he and Soviet republic leaders attempt to fashion a workable plan for warding off economic collapse.
"If we are able to find $100 billion to resolve the crisis," he said, "the question of cooperation with the Soviet Union for the benefit of perestroika, for perestroika to go ahead and for the country, as a result of radical reforms, to turn to the individual and to open up to the world -- I think that is worth the candle."
He also spoke of the aid question as a "very important" one for an exchange of views with President Bush "if the summit takes place" in Moscow.
Until today, Mr. Gorbachev had remained one step removed from fully embracing the Kremlin initiative to seek a hearing and some aid at the annual economic gathering of the United States, Canada, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Japan.
 
Economic Strategist's Return
 The idea mainly was being pursued in his behalf by Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a free-market economic strategist with some credibility in the West. He had quietly rejoined the Kremlin planning team lately, after Mr. Gorbachev signalled his own retreat from attempting hard-line management of the crisis.
In making his case to be heard at the economic summit, Mr. Gorbachev said that it now was "quite natural" that international relations evolve further each year.
"Now there is really a necessity for the Soviet Union to have the possibility to express its views and considerations at the session of the seven," he said.
Mr. Andreotti reacted diplomatically to Mr. Gorbachev's statements, avoiding a direct endorsement of a Soviet presence at the London meeting while saying that "we postively evaluate" the idea of strengthening contacts with the Soviet Union.
 
'There Are Many Obstacles'
 Speaking of the United States, Mr. Gorbachev said that while relations had been getting stronger, "there are many obstacles in the way of economic cooperation."
"In my opinion not everything has been done to normalize relations," he said in referring to current disarmament differences.

HEADLINE: Memo Says Reagan Trade Policy on Iraq Helped Hussein

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
A State Department memorandum released today by a Congressman said that Reagan Administration policy in the late 1980's, while barring most arms exports to Iraq, allowed the export of military equipment intended to protect President Saddam Hussein.
A Government official confirmed today that there were shipments of equipment for the protection of Mr. Hussein but that they were probably limited to military radios for his bodyguards. Congressional officials, however, said some weapons might also have been involved. All the officials spoke on the condition that they not be named. 
 The unclassified memo, dated Dec. 6, 1988, said there was no reason to change the policy on the shipments of military equipment. "U.S. policy permits sale of Munitions, List articles to Iraq only when they are to be utilized for protection of the Head of State," it stated. "Congress's view toward Iraq has toughened as a result of Iraq's use of gas against the Kurds, and sanctions could be forthcoming."
The memo was released by Representative Mel Levine, Democrat of California, whose aides declined to indicate how he had obtained it. It provides another chapter in what is becoming a lengthy and increasingly partisan investigation by seven House and five Senate committees. The committees are examining the Administration's handling of relations with Iraq in the months preceding Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
 
Agreement, but No Action
 The memo was displayed by Mr. Levine at a hearing of the House Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade. The panel is looking into why the Administration did not limit exports to Iraq of civilian goods that could be used by the military after Iraqi forces gassed several thousand Kurds in 1988 or after Mr. Hussein threatened early last year to attack Israel.
A senior State Department official told the panel today that in April and May 1990, several months before the invasion, Administration officials agreed that controls on exports to Iraq should be tightened.
But the official, Robert M. Kimmitt, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, said he could not recall any specific action being taken as a result of what he described as a "general agreement" at two meetings of top deputies to the nation's most senior national security officials.
Mr. Kimmitt's account of the two meetings was less detailed and differed somewhat from Congressional testimony provided on April 8 by Dennis E. Kloske, who was then the Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration. After Mr. Kloske gave his testimony, he was reportedly urged by the Administration to accelerate his planned resignation, reports the Administration has denied. Mr. Kloske left on May 1.
Mr. Kimmitt told the panel today that the Administration had begun pursuing a policy of prodding foreign governments to tighten their controls on exports to Iraq in April last year. "I wanted to find a way to deal efficiently with Iraq and other countries of export concern," he said. The best way to do this, he added, was to encourage countries with more lax export controls than the United States to tighten them, rather than through further tightening of American controls.
Mr. Kloske told the same House panel that at the meetings he had advocated a ban on exports of some high-technology products to Iraq, but that the State Department had opposed that view, saying it could affect existing relations with Iraq.
Mr. Kimmitt, who represented the State Department at both meetings, testified that he had advocated tightening export controls against a number of countries, particularly Iraq.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Soviets Near Settling Arms Pact Dispute

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Minn., May 22

 BODY:
The United States and the Soviet Union today moved toward agreement on resolving differences over a treaty cutting non-nuclear armed forces in Europe.
The disagreements have prevented the pact from taking effect and have blocked the scheduling of the next superpower summit. 
 In St. Paul to promote his education program, President Bush expressed hope that the differences over the treaty could be ironed out this week. And in Washington, the chief of the Soviet general staff suggested that he had accepted a compromise plan offered by the United States.
 
'It Went Very Well'
 "We don't have all the results yet," said Mr. Bush, adding, "As far as I'm concerned, it went very well."
Mr. Bush spent 15 minutes at the White House on Tuesday with Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, the Soviet officer. General Moiseyev, who met with other senior American officials on Monday and Tuesday, had been seen by Washington as the leader of hard-line military officers who opposed the terms of the conventional arms treaty. But he indicated in a statement to reporters that the Soviet Union had agreed to abide by the overall limits set by the treaty, which was signed in Paris last year but not ratified.
American charges that the Soviet Union has reneged on some of its commitments under the treaty have stalled efforts to conclude another agreement, which would reduce long-range nuclear weapons. That in turn has prevented the final scheduling of a Soviet-American summit meeting that is supposed to be held in Moscow this year.
The Soviet Union had been insisting that its naval infantry units and coastal defense forces should not be counted toward the treaty's ceilings, while the United States had suggested that Moscow keep those units intact if it so desired but eliminate a corresponding number of other ground forces so that the overall ceiling set by the pact would not be violated.
 
Accord Possible This Week
 "The naval infantry armaments and the armaments of the coastal defense will be counted against those overall ceilings," General Moiseyev said in Washington.
He said it was "quite possible" that a final agreement on the treaty could be reached this week. "What is left is not of great importance," he said.
Although the general's comments were not definitive, David Shorr, associate director of the British American Security Council, a group that closely monitors conventional arms reduction, said: "Moiseyev seems to be ready to meet the concerns that the U.S. has been expressing. He seems ready to count everything we want counted under the limits."
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to St. Paul, Mr. Bush called "totally erroneous" a report in The New York Times and some other newspapers today that he opposed inviting President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to London in July for a meeting of the leaders of the seven most powerful industrial democracies.
Mr. Bush said, "No decisions have been taken on that," but he declined to say whether he indeed favored inviting Mr. Gorbachev to the meeting in London. "If his coming there could help with the reform, genuinely help reform, that would be a very, very important matter," he said.
Administration officials who had said on Tuesday that Mr. Bush did not want Mr. Gorbachev invited to London said today that while no formal answer had been sent to Mr. Gorbachev, the United States did not want to include him in the meeting this year because the extent and nature of economic assistance that Washington is ready to offer the Soviet Union remains unsettled.
They said Mr. Bush was irked that discussions about the meeting had appeared in news reports before a diplomatic accommodation had been reached and a final decision announced. The articles also came as General Moiseyev was in town for delicate discussions in which the Bush Administration has a large stake.
Moreover, in his dealings with Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Bush tries to strike a careful, diplomatic tone that does not embarrass the Soviet leader publicly. Administration officials said today that it was still possible that some face-saving convention might be found in place of Mr. Gorbachev attending the London conference, for instance having Moscow send a lower-level delegation to consult with officials of the countries meeting there.
Administration officials have been placing great importance on General Moiseyev's visit to the United States because he had been perceived in Washington as a leading figure among conservative military officers who thought the conventional arms treaty cut too deeply into Soviet military strength in Europe.
Mr. Bush's comments today seemed to be a signal that the Administraation has concluded that the military, or at least General Moiseyev, was no longer blocking final agreement.
"One thing I came away with is that they genuinely want to resolve both these matters," he said. "There was some question as to whether the Soviets wanted a deal, or whether we did. The answer is that we both do."
General Moiseyev said: "The ceiling for the Soviet Union which is envisaged by the treaty signed in Paris will remain the same for the Soviet Union. It will not be exceeded."
But Mr. Bush declined to provide any details of the discussions. "We're at the stage where we need confidential discussions going on," he said.

HEADLINE: Man Convicted in Rabbi's Death

BYLINE: By ARNOLD H. LUBASCH

 BODY:
A jury convicted an unemployed house painter yesterday in the killing last year of Rabbi Chaskel Werzberger, a leader of the Satmar Hasidic community in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.
The 37-year-old defendant, David Ranta of Brooklyn, could face 25 years to life in prison when he is sentenced on June 10 by Justice Francis X. Egitto, who conducted the trial in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.
 
Botched Robbery
 Rabbi Werzberger, 58, was a sexton, or chief assistant, to the grand rabbi at Congregation Yetev Lev D'Satmar. The rabbi, a native of Hungary and a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp, came to the United States after World War II. 
 He was shot about 5:45 A.M. on Feb. 8, 1990, in front of his apartment in Williamsburg. His assailant fired one shot through the passenger side of the car, opened the door, shoved the rabbi's body onto the street and then sped off in the rabbi's 1985 Oldsmobile Cutless.
The prosecutors, Barry Schreiber and Suzanne Mondo, charged that Mr. Ranta killed Rabbi Werzberger to steal his car while making a getaway after botching the robbery of a jewelry courier.
The defense lawyer, Michael Baum, contended that Mr. Ranta, who was arrested in August, was the wrong man and was charged with the crime to quiet the anger of the Hasidic community over the slaying of the rabbi.
A witnesses for the prosecution, Alan Bloom, testified that he and Mr. Ranta tried to rob Chaim Weinberger, a jewelry courier, who thwarted the robbery by speeding away in his car. He said Mr. Ranta shot the rabbi while making a getaway.
 
Appeal Is Planned
 On the second day of deliberations in the three-week trial, the jury convicted Mr. Ranta of attempted robbery, robbery and murder in the commission of a robbery, while acquitting him of an intentional murder charge.
"We think the verdict was just and we are satisfied that justice was done," Mr. Schreiber, said.
Mr. Baum called the verdict unjust and said he would appeal it.

HEADLINE: Credit-Card Rules Urged

 BODY:
Legislation to require that consumers be given at least 30 days to repay credit-card debts before the interest rate could be increased was proposed yesterday by Representative Charles Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat.
The proposal would protect consumers whose banks sell credit-card businesses to other banks, which then may raise the interest rate. In the past, banks were required to provide 15-days notice of a rate increase. 
 Increases in card rates have become more common in the last few years as the largest credit-card banks, whose standard rate is 19.8 percent, have bought the businesses of smaller banks with lower rates.
Mr. Schumer also proposed that on the front of any envelope with an application or solicitation for a credit-card account, banks be required to display information about the interest rate and other fees.
The same information would also be required in advertisements, including those on television or in print, under the Schumer proposal.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Japan Give Out Economic 'Report Cards'

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 22

 BODY:
Like two schoolteachers relishing the chance to grade one another, Japan and the United States concluded a novel round of trade talks here today with modest praise for the progress each had made in economic self-improvement over the last year but harsh criticism for continued shortcomings.
In an atmosphere that alternated between warmth and coolness, the United States found that Japan had taken steps to increase public investment, to make it easier to open large retail stores and to ease regulations on foreign investment in Japan, but had failed to establish new rules for effectively breaking up cartels and other anti-competitive groupings. 
 Japan, on the other hand, acknowledged that the United States had taken important steps to improve education and training, but took Washington to task for failing to tame the growing Federal budget deficit and for permitting companies to overpay their executives and focus on short-term profits, rather than long-term results.
 
Basic Viewpoints Unchanged
 After a year of this experimental approach to trade negotiations, it was evident that Japanese officials still regard the United States as profligate and unable to curb its excesses, and that the United States sees Japan as a closed society that excludes outsiders to benefit its own economy unfairly.
At a news conference today, a Japanese negotiator attacked an unidentified American auto company, which was taken to be the Chrysler Corporation, for paying what he said were exhorbitant sums to its top executives.
An American official was just as strong in assailing Japan's lack of antitrust prosecutions, saying that it was all but impossible for a person in Japan to file an antitrust suit and that the Government had not filed a criminal antitrust case in 17 years.
After three days of talks during a week of tough trade negotiations, Japan and the United States were assessing how well each had lived up to pledges made a year ago to remove barriers that were believed to be inhibiting open trade and investment.
The two had agreed to this novel method as an addition to the traditional method of negotiating product by product, market by market. In more traditional talks, negotiations are under way this week on opening Japan's market for semiconductors and construction projects.
The outline of what each side expected of the other was issued a year ago. This week's meeting constituted a report card.
 
Assigning Percentages
 A senior Japanese official had judged that Japan had lived up to 65 percent of its pledges in what is known as the Structural Impediments Initiative, while he graded the United States at 20 percent.
S. Linn Williams, the deputy United States trade representative, called this "a bum rap." He and John B. Taylor, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said that even though the Federal deficit had expanded, the budget process had been changed in a way that would begin to narrow the deficit.
Mr. Williams called the Japanese criticism "just an attempt by some to avoid focus" on the issue of monopolies in Japan.

HEADLINE: Sony Is Reportedly Near Deal To Lease A.T.&T. Skyscraper

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
In what is shaping up as one of the biggest real estate deals in New York City this year, A.T.& T. has tentatively agreed to lease its headquarters building, one of Manhattan's architectural highlights, to the Sony Corporation, real estate executives said yesterday.
A proposed 20-year lease with an option to buy the eight-year-old tower would consolidate Sony USA's corporate presence in New York. The 35-story building, sheathed in rosy granite, is sometimes called the Chippendale skyscraper for its pediment resembling the top of an 18th-century highboy, 
 Sony, the Japanese consumer electronics giant that has spent about $5 billion acquiring CBS Records and Columbia Pictures in the last four years, was searching for a corporate home in New York that would reflect its presence and prestige.
 
No Comment by Either Side
 Neither Sony nor the American Telephone and Telegraph Company would comment yesterday on whether they were negotiating a lease on the property on Madison Avenue between 55th and 56th Streets.
"We are not going to comment on discussions we've had or are having with prospective tenants," said Walter Murphy, the vice president for corporate communication at A.T.& T.
Robert Zito, a vice president of Sony USA, said, "We continue to look at options, and beyond that we have no comment."
But several real estate executives in New York said an agreement was all but complet, although they added that negotiations were continuing on some important points, like the terms of the purchase option and whether to name the skyscraper the Sony Building. The building's purchase price would be about $320 million, some executives said.
The leasing of the building, which has received about $39 million in property tax breaks from the city since 1978, is something of an epilogue to the dismemberment of the old Bell telephone network.
The tower, with its grand four-story lobby housing the company's longtime symbol, a 24-foot-high winged statue known as "Golden Boy," was completed just months before the telephone monopoly was broken up by the Federal courts and the seven regional telephone companies were spun off. It cost $200 million to build and is now too expensive for the much smaller A.T.& T. to maintain.
Few buildings have achieved the rapid fame for architectural distinction that was lavished on the building. The structure, built between 1978 and 1983, was designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee on a grand and opulent scale that was clearly intended to merge the pleasing aspects of classical architecture with modern office tower design.
If the proposed deal between Sony and A.T.& T. is finally sealed, A.T& T. would have to give back to the city about $13 million in tax breaks it received for putting up the building and keeping about 1,200 of its employees in New York. In addition, A.T.& T. would forgo another $3 million in tax abatements it could get between now and 1994 under a pact with the city signed in 1987.
 
Promises About Employees
Executives of A.T.& T. said yesterday that the company would scrupulously fulfill both "the letter and the spirit" of its agreement with the city, and that even if the building is leased none of the 1,200 employees would be moved out of the city.
"It's important to us that it be clearly understood that if we do arrange a lease, the A.T.& T. employees that are in that building will be moved to other locations in the city," Mr. Murphy said.
The agreement's tentative terms reportedly would allow Sony to begin moving into the building by January and there would be no rent charged for one year on most of the 670,000 square feet of office space. Sony would relocate about 2,500 employees from various operations now scattered around the city. Most of the employees, about 2,000, work for Sony Music Entertainment, the former CBS Records. The others work for Sony USA, its main corporate subsidiary in this country, and a few other divisions.
In looking for a building that would announce its presence in New York, Sony considered joining in the planned development of Columbus Circle with Mortimer Zuckerman and it considered renting or buying other existing buildings. But even with the high vacancy rate in Manhattan, few buildings could provide the more than 600,000 square feet of prime office space Sony wanted.
For its first five or so years in the A.T.&. T. building, Sony would pay about $20 a square foot a year in net rent, which takes landlord services and the break for the first year into account. That would rise to about $23 a square foot net rent for the next five years. Over the remaining 10 years the net rent would be increased periodically until it reached $30 to $35 a square foot.
The option to buy the building and the price are apparently still being negotiated. It remained unclear whether it would be an option that would expire if not exercised or whether Sony could renew it.
 
Concerns About Politics
 One real estate executive said a principal reason Sony could not make an outright purchase of the building now was that with the city in financial trouble, A.T.& T. is concerned about the political fallout from breaking the deal it signed with the city.
The deal with the city requires A.T.& T. to maintain the building as its headquarters site and keep its employees in the building, said Michael Schlein, chief of staff for Sally Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. But Mr. Schlein said A.T.& T. had repeatedly assured the city it would keep its employees here and would honor the agreement.
"A.T.& T. has been very responsible in the way they are handling this," Mr. Schlein said. "They think they can save some money with this, and our concern is about the jobs and keeping them in New York City."
Mr. Schlein said the city would work with A.T.& T. as long as the company remained committed to keeping the jobs in the city.
Anthony J. Mannarino, the executive vice president for the New York City Public Development Corporation, the city's agent for commercial and industrial development, said the city's main concern was that A.T.& T. adhere to the contract. He said the possibility of selling the building had been broached with the city.
"They have suggested that they might lease or sell a portion," Mr. Mannarino said yesterday.

HEADLINE: Democrats Block G.O.P. Attack on Campaign Bill

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Senate Democrats rejected a Republican effort today to remove the most important provisions of their campaign finance bill. But the action, in a replay of past clashes, may turn out to be little more than symbolic.
President Bush has threatened to veto the package, and a crucial vote showed that proponents of the measure do not have the strength to override. 
 Today's action allowed lawmakers in both parties to claim credit for trying to improve a system, even if the measure, the most significant change in campaign finance law since the Watergate era, is never enacted.
 
Democrats Refuse to Back Down
 Democrats refused to back off from a proposed system that involved voluntary spending limits in exchange for some taxpayer-financed incentives, and Republicans insisted that the remedy was not cutting spending but curbing the special interest political action committees that make contributions.
Although the Senate is expected to approve a campaign finance measure, a version has yet to be introduced in the House. Backers brushed aside the President's veto threat and insisted that in light of recent ethics scandals there was more momentum in both parties to do something about the campaign finance system.
The strongest challenge to the Democratic proposal came in an amendment by Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, that would have stripped the measure of its key provision: partial public fiancing for candidates who adhere to spending limits, It was rejected in a party-line vote of 56 to 42, after George J. Mitchell, the Senate Democratic leader, warned that the amendment "will kill campaign finance reform."
But after the vote, Mr. McConnell asserted that efforts to overhaul the finance system were as good as dead. He read aloud passages from a letter he received today from President Bush, who renewed his pledge "to veto any campaign finance 'reform' legislation which features spending limits or taxpayer financing of Congressional campaigns."
Although it rejected the McConnell proposal, the Senate was unwilling to go further than the leadership bill, rejecting an amendment by calling for the Government to subsidize nearly all of the general election costs for candidates who adhere to spending limits.
The amendment, sponsored by Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, was defeated in a vote of 58 to 39, with supporters picking up only one vote from last year, when an nearly identical proposal was offered.
As the Senate moved closer to a final vote on a Democratic-sponsored bill, lawmakers spent the day trading stories about how they struggled to raise money for their own campaigns and how the race for contributions should be halted.
 
Discounts on Television Time
 The Democratic bill would offer incentives, such as discounts on television time, for candidates who adhere to a spending ceiling on campaigns that would range from $950,000 to $5.5 million, depending on a state's voting age population. The bill would also prohibit political action committees from donating to Congressional campaigns. Under present law, there is no system of voluntary spending limits, and political action committees continue to increasingly donate to Congressional campaigns.
Republicans offered a barrage of amendments today that, while attacking the Democratic bill less directly, would still have made it too unpalatable to pass.
One amendment that drew extensive debate before it was rejected dealt with the sensitive issue of term limitations: Senators would be prohibited from serving more than two consecutive terms if they agreed to limit their spending and accept public funds.
Senator Hank Brown, a Colorado Republican who sponsored the amendment said, "It will create legislators who will be more likely to take firm stands on controversial issues and less likely to cater to special interests."
But Senator Dale Bumpers, an Arkansas Democrat, characterized the amendment as nothing less than an assault on the Democratic bill. Supporters of term limits, he declared, have "misdirected their venom, their hostility and their contempt" and instead ought to support changing the campaign finance system.
 
Notice on Campaign Ads
 Another Republican sponsored amendment that was defeated would have required a notice on campaign advertisements that they were "paid for with taxpayer funds."
In addition, the Senate rejected an amendment that would allow challengers to spend 50 percent more than incumbents on their campaigns.
The Senate did approve, by a voice vote, an amendment by Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat, that reduces to $25,000 from $250,000 the amount candidates are allowed to contribute personally or loan their own campaigns. On Tuesday, the Senate also passed an amendment that would prohibit members from supplementing their income with outside speaking fees.
In seeking to unhinge the Democratic bill, Mr. McConnell said his goal had been to insure that "we are not going to fleece the taxpayers to pay for our campaigns at a time when the budget deficit continues to grow, taxes continue to increase, the bill for Desert Storm must be paid and the recessionary economy is cutting into private paychecks."
 
Curbing the Cost of Campaigns
 But Senator David L. Boren, an Oklahoma Democrat and chief sponsor of the Democratic bill, said Mr. McConnell's proposal sought "to penalize people who accept spending limits." He said it was well worth the public expense to reduce the influence of special interests and curb the total cost of campaigns.
Mr. Boren said he was not discouraged by the President's veto threat, saying, "The President himself has also placed this matter on his personal agenda. He clearly understands that the status quo isn't working and something needs to be done."
