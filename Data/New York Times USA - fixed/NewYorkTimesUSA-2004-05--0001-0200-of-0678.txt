HEADLINE: Con Ed Applies for Rate Increases

 BODY:
Consolidated Edison asked the New York State Public Service Commission yesterday for permission to raise electrical rates by an average of about $5 per month for its commercial and residential customers. 
 An increase is needed, the utility said, to offset rising energy and equipment prices and to help pay for work on underground wiring, transformers and substations. 
The company is asking for an additional $550 million in revenues, which it said was necessary because of a 20 percent increase in electrical use in New York City and Westchester County over the last decade. 
 Joan S. Freilich, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Con Edison, said in a written statement that the increases would ''make possible the system upgrades necessary to provide the reliable and safe delivery of electricity.'' 
 Under the proposal, a typical residential customer paying $58.66 per month would see an increase of $5.40, or 9.2 percent. A typical small business paying $116.55 a month would see an increase of $5.04, or 4.3 percent. If granted, after a review process, new rates would take effect April 1, 2005. 
 Assemblyman Paul D. Tonko, chairman of the Assembly's Energy Committee, said the increase ''would be a disaster for the New York economy.''
 Mr. Tonko, a Democrat from Amsterdam, N.Y., said the utility has posted record profits in recent years and that New Yorkers were already paying the highest rates in the country.

HEADLINE: Midwest Industry Index Is Far Above Forecasts

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
An index of manufacturing in the Midwest rose much higher than expected in April, a report showed yesterday, pointing to improvement in industry ahead of a national report on Monday.
 A separate report showed that a measure of consumer confidence edged lower, and the government reported that consumer spending rose 0.4 percent in April, somewhat less than forecast, while personal income grew 0.4 percent.
 The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its gauge of regional business, watched by economists for clues about manufacturing, rose to 63.9 in April from 57.6 in March. Readings above 50 signal expansion. Economists had expected the Chicago index to rise to 61. 
 ''There are bigger gains ahead as payrolls pick up speed and hourly earnings begin to recover,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
 The Chicago index is close to the decade high of 65.9 reached in January. Indexes measuring production, new orders, backlogs, employment and supplier deliveries accelerated during the month. A gauge of inventories rose to the highest point in almost 10 years.
 Slow job creation and rising gasoline prices have restrained optimism, a survey from the University of Michigan indicated. The university's final index of consumer sentiment for the month fell to 94.2 from 95.8 in March. The preliminary reading two weeks ago had been 93.2.
 A 23 percent increase in the average cost of a gallon of gas so far this year has negated some benefits from increased tax refunds and increased consumer perception that some prices are rising amid low overall inflation, economists said.
 Nevertheless, consumers increased spending in March for a sixth consecutive month as their incomes rose, encouraging manufacturers to increase production and inventories.
 The 0.4 percent rise in personal spending in March matched February's gain, the Commerce Department said in a report. Incomes also rose 0.4 percent. 
 Incomes in the first quarter grew at a 5.6 percent annual rate, the fastest since the third quarter of 2000, the report indicated. With the contributions from tax refunds and refinancing likely to diminish in coming months, job creation will help add to income growth and bolster consumer spending, economists said.

HEADLINE: Another Leap by China, With Steel Leading Again

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 30 

 BODY:
When Mao Zedong ordered communities across China in the late 1950's to set up backyard kilns and rapidly increase steel production as part of his Great Leap Forward, the results were disastrous. The country turned out millions of tons of useless substandard steel, while millions of people starved as distracted farmers neglected their fields.
 Now, China is taking another great leap: a vast binge of industrial investment, especially in the last two years, with steel once again in the vanguard. China has doubled its steel output since 2000, emerging as the world's largest producer by a wide margin, and is on its way to nearly doubling it again in the next three years. The pace of spending on new steel mills tripled from 2002 to 2003.
 Concerns are growing from Beijing to Pittsburgh about this breathtaking ramp-up of Chinese steel making, but not because anyone thinks the 1950's disaster will be repeated. Instead, executives and industry analysts are worried that the world will be stuck with an enormous glut of steel that could wreck profits and touch off mass layoffs at steel mills around the world, including those in the United States. 
 Worries about steel have occupied the top leadership of China's government this week. On Tuesday, the State Council, China's cabinet, announced that investors in new steel mills would have to put up at least 40 percent of the cost themselves before taking out construction loans, nearly twice the previous minimum of 25 percent. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao held a cabinet meeting to hear criticism of a new $1.3 billion steel mill that is being built near Changzhou.
 Critics say the project was pushed through by local officials with disregard for land-use laws. The People's Daily and other state-controlled news media denounced the project on Thursday morning; the New China News Agency announced later in the day that eight officials in Changzhou had been disciplined and that work on the new mill was halted.
 Together with new lending restrictions, the suspension of the Changzhou mill project sent a shiver through commodity markets and Asian stock markets, because Chinese demand is increasingly important to economies around the region and commodities producers around the world.
 For the moment, domestic demand for steel in China is high, as economic growth roars ahead at 9 percent or more a year. China now consumes twice as much steel as the United States, though its economy is still only one-eighth the size. But more than half of that steel is used in construction, often in the kinds of speculative projects that Beijing has been trying to rein in.
 If China's growth slows -- something the Chinese central bank has been trying to make happen in response to rising inflation -- then much of that metal may flood out of the country in search of export markets. 
 ''My prediction is, frankly, we're going to be swimming in steel in the next year to 18 months,'' said Jack Perkowski, the chairman and chief executive of Asimco Technologies, a big Beijing-based auto parts company that buys a lot of steel.
 If demand in China fell back to where it was in 2000, enough surplus Chinese steel would be freed to meet nearly one-fifth of the rest of the world's demand; it would almost equal the total amount of steel now traded internationally.
 In recent months the Chinese government has been trying to discourage the start of work on any more steel mills, in part because there already are acute shortages of electricity and iron ore across much of the country. But it has been unable to dissuade provincial governments from proceeding with many projects already under way, nor from leaning on the local branches of national banks to lend money for them.
 ''Overheated investment in steel is no accident,'' The Economic Daily, an official publication, warned this month. ''It's just a prominent example of reckless investment and low-quality excess development in some industries and regions.''
 The history, the problems and the potential of China's steel industry can best be seen at one of the country's largest and most famous steel mills, the Nanjing No.1 Steel Works, and through the experiences of its general manager, Yang Si Ming. The mill faces electricity shortages and a likely domestic glut of steel in the coming years, and is already preparing to step up exports, first to Japan and South Korea and eventually to the United States.
 The 10,000-employee mill dates from 1958, the height of the Great Leap Forward. But it is no backyard kiln; indeed, it was built to be a showcase of communism.
 Situated on the outskirts of Nanjing, a former capital of China, the mill is a Dickensian place where green and orange flames leap as red-hot slabs of steel roll slowly along conveyor belts through a long, tall shed, where they are pounded into shape and sprayed with jets of water to smooth their finish.
 Though some of the buildings are nearly half a century old, the plant was and remains one of China's more sensibly planned steel mills, with its own small mine nearby for low-grade iron ore and its own dock on the Yangtze River for bringing in high-grade iron ore by barge and for shipping out finished steel.
 Frontage on the seacoast or a navigable river is crucial to controlling costs at a steel mill, yet relatively few mills in China are put in such locations. Many more, including those being expanded now, are deep in the interior of the country, partly to keep them safe in case of invasion. Iron ore for these mills must be delivered from distant mines by the country's overstretched rail system, which is prone to delays measured in weeks, or by truck, which is much more expensive.
 By contrast, the Nanjing mill has invested in new barges that can travel both in rivers and in the open sea, saving the time and expense of transferring cargoes of imported ore from Australia or Brazil from one type of vessel at an ocean port. 
 Nicholas Tolerico, the president of ThyssenKrupp Steel Services, the trading and distribution arm of the German steel giant, said that compared with moving iron ore by water, rail is twice as expensive, and trucks cost eight times as much. Over the last quarter-century, almost every American steel mill without access to a navigable waterway has closed, eliminating tens of thousands of jobs, because of shipping costs. 
 Inland mills in China are able to operate and even expand in part because of generous bank loans, but also because they are close to a booming market: local construction. Nanjing is enjoying a building boom, too: on a 40-minute drive from downtown to the airport on a recent Saturday afternoon, 282 tall cranes could be seen working on large structures, mostly apartment towers.
 As in other Chinese cities, feverish speculation has sent apartment prices in Nanjing skyrocketing. At $24,000 to $30,000, the price of a 540-square-foot downtown apartment is now roughly eight years' salary for a typical engineer in Nanjing, or 20 years' pay for a skilled factory worker, according to local residents.
 The boom has enriched Nanjing Steel, which now mostly makes the steel rods and mesh used to reinforce concrete. The company is in the process of doubling its output by diversifying into the big steel plates used to build ships and bridges; Mr. Yang said it expected to do so without adding workers. 
 As China has begun moving from central economic planning to capitalism, so has the mill. A group of private investors, whom Mr. Yang declined to identify, now owns most of the stock in the company, known formally as the Nanjing Iron and Steel Group Company Ltd. The city of Nanjing and the surrounding province of Jiangsu, which formerly owned the mill outright, now have a minority stake.
 Mr. Yang, a solid-set steel executive who has been at Nanjing Steel for 30 years, said in an interview at the mill that it was no longer in the business of providing the cradle-to-grave services to workers that used to characterize Chinese state-owned enterprise.
 ''We will not make our company be an entire society,'' he said. ''We will focus on iron and steel.'' 
 But like the rest of China's steel industry, Nanjing Steel faces difficulties. The most serious is an acute shortage of electricity, as power plant construction has failed to keep up with rapidly rising demand. Power rationing in the region cuts off the electricity supply to many factories for one to three days each week. Like many steel mills, Nanjing Steel is the biggest single user of electricity in the city. Close relations with the local utility have protected it from cutoffs so far; if the power did go off on short notice, molten steel in the mill would solidify. 
 But the mill now slows down its operations and does maintenance work during the hours when demand from the rest of the city peaks. 
 The company is also using more oxygen and less electricity in its furnace. But the extraction process used by its oxygen supplier requires a lot of power, so the net effect on electricity consumption is small, and using the extra oxygen raises the mill's costs. 
 While Nanjing Steel is in a better position than most mills, China will soon have more steel-making capacity than its power supplies and raw materials will allow to operate, according to Liu Jinghai, who was the director of the Chinese Metallurgical Research Institute before joining World Steel Dynamics, a consulting firm in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., last year.
 The trouble Beijing has faced in restraining investment in steel mills comes partly from the way political and economic power in China is decentralizing, said Li Cheng, a professor of government at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y. It is also a consequence of President Hu Jintao's policy of encouraging development inland while coastal provinces continue to grow on their own at a brisk pace, Professor Li added.
 Faced with the likelihood that the domestic market will be glutted at some point, Nanjing Steel is working to step up quality and productivity and getting ready to export more. The mill already ships steel for construction to Japan and South Korea. 
 China's voracious demand for raw materials has driven bulk shipping rates up tenfold in the last two years, so it is not economic now for Chinese mills to ship much steel to the United States. In any case, China still consumes more steel than it makes, and its imports have helped push global prices enough that the Bush administration lifted its steep protective tariffs on some steel products last December. 
 Andrew G. Sharkey, chief executive of the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade group in Washington, said that his members were unhappy with China's policy of pegging its currency to the dollar but had no current plans to file trade complaints over Chinese steel. 
 Mr. Yang said that he and others in the Chinese steel industry have hopes that the country's membership in the World Trade Organization, which it joined in November 2001, will protect them from trade disputes.
 ''A lot of people have already improved their knowledge of the antidumping regulations,'' Mr. Yang said. ''We will follow the rules, and we will notice if others follow the rules.''

HEADLINE: Nasdaq Index Posts Steepest Weekly Decline in 2 Years

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks sagged yesterday, pushing the Nasdaq composite index to its biggest weekly drop in two years, on worries that the Federal Reserve will move closer to raising interest rates at its meeting next week.
 Oil stocks helped limit the markets' declines after ChevronTexaco reported strong results. But Cisco Systems dragged down the Nasdaq, which fell for the fifth consecutive day and posted its biggest weekly drop since April 2002. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.70 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,225.57. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 6.59 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,107.30. The Nasdaq fell 38.63 points, or 2 percent, to 1,920.15.
 For the week, the Dow fell 2.3 percent, the S.&P. 500 was off 2.9 percent and the Nasdaq was down 6.3 percent. For April, the Dow fell 1.3 percent, the S.&P. 500 declined 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq was down 3.7 percent.
 Fears that the Fed will soon raise interest rates to curb inflation have weighed on Wall Street. Investors are uncertain when the central bank will begin raising rates amid improving economic indicators and signs of budding inflation.
 ''There's a strong sensitivity now to interest rate increases, and high-priced stocks such as tech stocks are generally more sensitive to that,'' said Ed Peters, chief investment officer at PanAgora Asset Management in Boston.
 The Fed is scheduled to meet on Tuesday to decide whether to raise rates. Though investors expect it will leave the benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks unchanged at 1 percent, analysts think the Fed will lay the groundwork in its policy statement for a rate increase that many expect will come in August.
 ''There's fear that when the Fed comes out with a statement next week, it's going to be a bit more hawkish than before, or at least less neutral, so people are turning to stocks that are less rate-sensitive,'' Mr. Peters said.
 Trading was heavy, with 1.7 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, above the 1.4 billion daily average for last year. About 2.17 billion shares were traded on the Nasdaq, above last year's 1.8 billion daily average.
 Cisco Systems, the world's largest maker of equipment that directs Internet traffic, topped the Nasdaq's most actively traded list. Its shares fell after a smaller rival, Foundry Networks, issued a disappointing financial forecast.
 Shares of Cisco fell 4.6 percent, or $1, to $20.91. Foundry tumbled $2.85, or 20.1 percent, to $11.30.
 ChevronTexaco shares jumped after it posted a 33 percent rise in quarterly profit, driven by strong gasoline and energy prices. Shares of ChevronTexaco rose $1.15, or 1.3 percent, to $91.50.
 Shares of Procter & Gamble fell, even after it reported its quarterly profit jumped 20 percent. The shares lost 22 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $105.75, giving up earlier gains.
 In the Treasury market, bond prices held on to modest gains yesterday, despite a strong reading on Midwest manufacturing activity as traders hunted for bargains after several weeks of heavy selling.
 The price of the 10-year note rose 8/32, to 96 1/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.51 percent from 4.54 percent on Thursday.
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 15/32, to 101 9/32; its yield fell to 5.29 percent from 5.32 percent.

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley Looks to Google for Signs of a New Boom

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL and CAROLYN MARSHALL

DATELINE: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., April 30 

 BODY:
The neighbors are turning into billionaires again.
 At least two of them this time. Young fellows, in their early 30's. Clean cut. With nice smiles, and apparent social consciences to boot.
 Larry Page and Sergey Brin were Stanford University graduate students in 1998 when they founded Google, the Internet search engine company that on Thursday disclosed its plans to go public. When it does so in the coming months, the friends turned founders will watch their net worths soar skyward and turn into celestial bodies. 
 Back down on Earth, the every-men and women of Silicon Valley on Friday expressed guarded joy that two more technology entrepreneurs have punched capitalism's lottery ticket. Little heard, but not altogether absent, were the acid reactions of four years ago from those left out of a dot-com boom that minted hundreds of millionaires in their midst.
 ''God love 'em,'' Bryn Taylor, 33, a carpenter, said of the Google executives and their soon-to-be found fortune. On the knuckles of Mr. Taylor's left hand is tattooed the word ''fate,'' but he suspected that his was not to become fabulously wealthy.
 ''If I could become a billionaire overnight, I'd do it in a heartbeat,'' Mr. Taylor said.
 So much hope has evaporated from Silicon Valley in the last few years. But the Google public offering appears to offer a symbolic gesture of revival. Some denizens seem not to be saying ''it could happen to me, too,'' but, rather, that the success of Google may suggest a more general economic recovery that would lift all dinghies.
 What tempers the enthusiasm is the undercurrent of fear that Silicon Valley could turn irrational again, and the corners would fill up with salesmen hawking hair tonic. The whispers are here, despite the fact there has been no real sense that Google is hollow or that its founders are charlatans hawking empty dot-com promises.
 Still, the attention to the public offering has reminded some here of the fact that they poured way too much personal money and hopes into failed companies during the late 1990's. 
 Alan Rogers, 45, an engineer with Analog Bits, a data communications company in Chicago with offices in Mountain View, said he was less than enthusiastic about Google or any other public offerings. ''Too many orphans and widows will invest in it,'' he mourned.
 Mr. Rogers added of the dot-com collapse: ''It didn't do anything to help business or real life. Now we're dealing locally with the slump because of the bubble.''
 The Silicon Valley economy has always been cyclical, marked by booms and busts of varying degrees. And there is no doubt the Google offering comes at a lull, with parking spots and restaurants empty, and highways where the traffic actually moves during rush hour.
 The economic lull was in evidence at the quiet Red Rock Coffee Company, an Internet cafe in Mountain View, where one of the handful of patrons, Ruth Robertson, 51, was doing research online.
 Ms. Robertson, a Palo Alto resident, was using Google, as she often does, and she said she believed the company's public offering will signal economic recovery.
 She, like many other people here, did not know the names of Mr. Brin and Mr. Page, but the larger issue was fresh on her mind. ''Who is Larry Page?'' she said, when asked in an interview what she thought of one of the two company's founders. Then it dawned on her. ''Oh, from Google.''
 Ms. Robertson had mixed feelings about the dot-com boom and bust -- the prism through which many people here seem to view the Google offering. On one hand, she said, her husband worked at a successful technology company, affording her the ability to stay at home and raise the couple's two children.
 On the other hand, she said, she saw in the late 1990's a great deal of excess, conspicuous and wasteful consumption. Along those lines, she said she does not resent the new billionaires or millionaires that a Google offering would create, especially if they use their financial powers for good. 
 ''I just hope they will pay taxes and be taxed appropriately and pay back to society,'' Ms. Robertson said. She added that she had heard the company was good to its employees, offering them free food and so forth.
 Tracey Grossbach said she would not mind of the some of the good fortune spilled outside of the company. The 36-year-old San Francisco resident said her husband worked at a technology company that they hoped would go public. 
 ''The chances are slim,'' she said, as she walked her 7-month-old daughter in a stroller down the street in San Francisco's Noe Valley neighborhood. But, she added hopefully, with Google going public, ''if things are on the rise'' maybe her husband's company could be acquired.
 The mention of the Google founders and their new wealth had Eric Truong, 33, feeling wistful. During the dot-com boom, he was a salesman at a Lexus dealership in South San Francisco, where the young and wealthy, and the older and wealthy, came to spend their stock option proceeds.
 ''One day, a secretary from a dot-com came in and paid $40,000 cash for a GS300,'' he said, his eyes shiny with memory. Now the sales manager at the same dealership, he is hoping not necessarily that a Google offering sends the company's enriched employees his way, but rather that it could mean the pendulum is swinging back.
 ''We need momentum,'' Mr. Truong said. 
 As to the 30-something founders and their personal turn in fortunes, Mr. Truong could only mumble under his breath, ''Big time. Big time. Big time.''

Trump Hotels Reports $49 Million Quarterly Loss
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, the centerpiece of Donald J. Trump's struggling casino empire, reported a quarterly loss of nearly $49 million, further undermining the company's tenuous financial position and complicating its ability to meet hefty debt payments due at the end of this month and in the fall.
 Trump Hotels has about $1.8 billion in debt that has drained the company of the cash it needs to maintain its properties and compete effectively in the Atlantic City gambling market. [Page C2.]

Airlines Turned Over Data on Fliers

HEADLINE: Between the Featherweights and the Sumos

BYLINE: By BOB KNOLL

 BODY:
''THE bigger, the better'' is the attitude of many truck-loving Americans. Certainly there are ranchers and construction workers who could not do their jobs without the load capacity, space and general ruggedness of a big pickup. 
 Far fewer people actually need such capabilities for their everyday chores or weekend projects. Rather, they like the image of saddling up one of the biggest horses on the highway. ''Wouldn't I look tough,'' you can practically hear them musing, ''riding high in that big Dodge Ram Hemi?'' 
 Just as trucks can be ridiculously large -- consider those heavy-duty monsters with dual rear wheels and four big doors -- they can also be too small. In the 1970's and 80's, several manufacturers grafted cargo beds onto economy cars like the Volkswagen Rabbit and Dodge Omni; others imported tiny trucks designed for foreign markets. None of those models are around anymore.
 The medium-size pickup would seem to be a sensible compromise. Yet these trucks are not highly popular; total sales in the segment last year were just 730,000 (less than the full-size Ford F-150 by itself).
 The national obsession with size is one reason, but another may be that, as a group, these trucks have had dated designs, mediocre performance and minimal marketing. All that is about to change.
 The first sign of new life in the midsize market comes from General Motors, which for 2004 is selling two new models, the Chevrolet Colorado (replacing the S-10) and GMC Canyon (instead of the Sonoma).
 Although introduced some 22 years ago, the old models were last redesigned for 1994; combined sales in 2003 were about 175,000. Since the Colorado and Canyon are the only truly new midsize trucks so far in 2004, they have the limelight to themselves until redesigned versions of the Dodge Dakota, Nissan Frontier and Toyota Tacoma arrive later this year. The segment's best seller, the Ford Ranger, will continue largely unchanged until the 2008 model year.
 Like most pickups, the Colorado and Canyon come in a dizzying variety of configurations. There are three cabs: regular, with two doors; extended, with rear-hinged, forward-opening rear doors on both sides and two small rear jump seats; and crew, with four conventional front-hinged doors and a full-width split rear seat.
 There are two wheelbases, 111.2 inches or 125.9, and two cargo box lengths, 61.1 inches (with the regular cab and crew cab) or 72.9 inches (extended cab only). 
 Payloads range from 990 pounds to 1,843 pounds. Trailer-towing capacity runs from 1,600 to 4,000 pounds depending on the model, engine and axle ratio.
 Most versions are available with either two-wheel- or four-wheel-drive systems, though the Sport with a regular cab is rear-drive only. The four-wheel system can be shifted on the fly with buttons on the instrument panel; unlike G.M.'s full-size trucks, there is no all-wheel-drive setting. An automatic-locking rear differential is available on all versions and is especially useful with two-wheel drive, helping to counter the inherently poor traction of this type of truck.
 Two engines are available in most models, a 2.8-liter in-line 4 cylinder (175 horsepower and 185 pounds-feet of torque) or a 3.5-liter in-line 5 (220 horsepower and 225 pounds-feet of torque). Both engines are variants of the 4.2-liter 6 found in midsize S.U.V.'s like the Chevy TrailBlazer. 
 Three suspensions are tailored to individual preferences. The standard Z85 suspension is available across the board. The off-road Z71 suspension raises the truck about two inches and is also available on all models -- this is a popular option in the South, where customers want the 4x4 look but don't really need the function. The ZQ8 sport suspension, available only with two-wheel drive, lowers the truck two inches for a sportier appearance and better handling.
 A five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission can be chosen. Four-wheel antilock brakes (discs in front, drums in the rear) are standard.
 Safety equipment includes dual-stage front air bags. Optional are curtain bags that drop over the windows in side impacts and also provide some rollover protection.
 I tested two well-equipped versions, both with the 5-cylinder engine. (The 4-cylinder started production later.) The Colorado that I drove was a Sport LS extended cab with two-wheel drive and manual transmission. It listed for $24,740. The Canyon test truck was a Z71 4WD SLE with automatic transmission and a $30,385 sticker. 
 Sales incentives cut prices by up to $2,500, but these change often and vary by model. 
 I am familiar with the old Chevy S-10 (I own a 1988 model), and I found the new trucks to be, naturally, much improved in ride, handling, smoothness and comfort. They rode with better control and less harshness than the Frontiers and Tacomas I've driven. 
 Steering response was quick and precise with good straight-line stability. The Sport model was especially fun to drive. At highway speeds, interior noise (mostly from wind) was quite loud in the extended-cab version and moderate in the crew cab. 
 Auto writers routinely criticize G.M. engines for their old designs, but there is no basis for that here. The technology of these in-line engines is thoroughly up to date. They are powerful at high engine speeds (noisy, too) and get decent mileage.
 They will not match the power of new versions of the Dakota, Frontier or Tacoma, with larger V-6's and V-8's, but they move these trucks along nicely. The in-line engines are also very smooth, especially at low engine speeds.
 For example, with the new manual transmission, I could drive in fifth gear as low as 800 r.p.m. without hesitation and could pull away smoothly. That gearbox shifts crisply, with fairly short throws.
 The four-speed automatic also shifted well; a part-throttle highway downshift is there when you need it. 
 Economy ratings are slightly better than those of competing trucks. I averaged slightly less than 20 m.p.g.; the 4-cylinder version should be about 1 m.p.g. better.
 Intelligent interior design has become much more important in any vehicle, including trucks. The Colorado and Canyon are finished with better materials than you will find in most lower-price trucks. 
 The window switches are of the child-safe design -- you pull the switch, not push it, to raise the window -- and the climate controls are logical. While the interiors are nicely finished, I noticed that the heaters in both trucks were slow to warm up. 
 Over all, the pickups are fresh in a field of old designs, and at present they offer more versatility than any rival save the Dakota.
 My personal choice is the Sport regular cab with the 5-cylinder and 5-speed manual. Not only was it the most fun, its low cargo bed was convenient to load and unload.
 For those who need four-wheel drive, the Z71 package offers that versatility without the ride and handling sacrifices of other midsize pickups. And for those who use a truck like a sedan, the four-door crew cab does well. Indeed, sales for that style have far exceeded G.M.'s expectations.

HEADLINE: America Has Second Thoughts About a United Europe

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE expansion of the European Union this weekend from 15 members to 25, marking the formal end of Europe's postwar division, presents America with a choice. Should it embrace this new union that stretches to the Russian border or try to foster Europe's many fissures in order to divide and rule? 
 For the moment, there is scant official comment, but perhaps Europe should not take this personally. The United States has shifted paradigms: Europe is old news. Still, the less-than-benign neglect surrounding the European Union's addition of 10 members, 8 of them once part of the Soviet bloc, reflects a moment of great difficulty. 
 ''The situation has never been so bad in 50 years,'' Gunter Burghardt, the union's ambassador in Washington, said in an interview. ''It is a fact of life that America is a hegemonic power, but the question is how that power is used. We need to know that America is open to a confident relationship, not just with certain member states but with the E.U. as such.''
 This assessment reflects the enduring wounds of the Iraq war and the feeling among many European officials that an American administration has determined that its interests may lie more in division within Europe than in unity, more in forging improvised coalitions of the willing than in honoring a partnership of the wedded.
 ''This is an administration that simply does not care about Europe,'' said Philip H. Gordon, an expert on European affairs at the Brookings Institution. ''I don't think they do anything solely to divide Europe, but if that's a consequence of an action, fine, because they don't want a counterweight to American power emerging.''
 In many respects, the new European Union is a potential major power. Its highly educated population of 455 million people is far larger than America's and it accounts for 28 percent of world trade.
 But it is also divided between formerly Communist states in Central Europe that are enthusiastic about Atlanticism, and other countries, led by France, where dislike of President Bush's America is intense. This is the basic ideological split that America could choose to quicken or quiet.
 America might, for example, try to use the sympathies of Poland, Slovakia or Hungary to undermine European unity and pursue its own goals, which may include the establishment of military bases in at least one of these countries, quiet attempts to assure that Europe's military identity remains muted or the obstruction of moves toward a more federal United States of Europe.
 But Iraq has been a sobering experience, and American officials seem, for now, to have dropped talk of ''old'' and ''new'' Europe in favor of a rediscovered pragmatism.
 ''Whatever the differences over the past year, we know that a Europe that is open, at peace, broadly united and reaching out toward Turkey is in the American interest,'' one State Department official said.
 The mention of Turkey is significant. Faced by the union's expansion, many Americans respond by asking why Turkey is not included. 
 The question, of course, reflects America's shift from a focus on uniting Europe to the overriding quest to change the Middle East. Admitting Turkey, a Muslim country, to a core institution of the West like the European Union would, in the American view, provide an important example of bridge building to the Islamic world. It is therefore vital, American officials argue, that the union decide at the end of this year to begin negotiations on membership.
 But the impatience over bringing Turkey into Europe also betrays enduring American misunderstanding over the nature of the European Union. The immense complexity and cost of offering membership to a country as big and poor as Turkey are not widely appreciated here.
 The extent of integration within the union, and the surrender of sovereignty involved, are blurry ideas in America, perhaps because the notion of such transnational merging is anathema to a country at or close to the apogee of its power. If America, Mexico and Canada were as integrated as Europe's states, it would be possible to have a Mexican in Ottawa setting United States interest rates. But that, of course, is unthinkable.
 This European indivisibility, despite all the continent's difficulties, makes it inevitable that new members like Poland will tend to seek shared European positions, whatever their strong American sympathies.
 At the same time, these institutional differences complicate trans-Atlantic understanding because a sovereign America run by an administration for which power is the coin of the realm faces European states that have put their faith in international institutions like the European Union or the United Nations or an international criminal court.
 But a lot is at stake in trying to overcome the current crisis of confidence. Between them, the European Union and the United States account for 40 percent of world trade. They are each other's largest trading partners. Business transactions between them run at close to $3 billion a day.
 This web of economic interests is so rich that it tends to compel a quest to resolve differences and harmonize regulations. The problem is that, in the strategic area, the common purpose that long drove America's broad support of European unity -- delivering stability to a continent with a debilitating penchant for war -- has been lost.
 It is not delight but some dismay that is accompanying the arrival of the Europe ''whole and free'' sought by the elder George Bush and reiterated as an objective by President Bush, who said in Warsaw in June 2001 that ''our goal is to erase the false lines that have divided Europe for too long.''
 Europe has worked hard on eliminating those divisions. But Mr. Burghardt believes recognition of this is scant in an America whose attention has moved elsewhere.''The E.U. delivered on Nov. 9, that is the fall of the Berlin Wall,'' he said. ''But we got hit by the geopolitical earthquake of Sept. 11.'' In other words, 9/11 trumped 11/9.
 In his Warsaw speech three months before Sept. 11, President Bush also said something else: ''When Europe and America are divided, history tends to tragedy.''

HEADLINE: Pay Taxes. Be Happy.

BYLINE: By Daniel Akst. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
A CENTURY ago, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. observed that taxes are what we pay for a civilized society. 
 The price has gone up quite a bit since then. Today, American civilization is underwritten by a tax system that annually reallocates something like a third of gross domestic product. The system is insanely complex, chronically unfair and disliked by most taxpayers. Thus, it may not be immediately obvious that what the American economy needs most right now is more taxes. Voters should demand them. Businesses should lobby for them. Kids should write to Santa, requesting them for Christmas. 
 Why should any taxpayer hope for higher taxes? The simple answer is that you're not just a taxpayer. You're also a wage earner, an investor, an entrepreneur, a parent, a retiree or some combination. And if Uncle Sam does not raise your taxes in the next few years, you could suffer from an economy plagued by rising interest rates, capital shortages that result from vast government borrowing and retarded productivity growth that will make all of us poorer. As Milton Friedman put it, ''Inflation is one form of taxation that can be imposed without legislation.'' 
 We'll need higher taxes no matter which party is in power, because government spending in the years ahead is certain to increase. Despite a Republican administration and a Republican-controlled Congress, spending is already up. Now add in the nation's enormous unfunded retirement liabilities, accompanied by unfavorable demographics: there will be far fewer workers per retiree in the future than there are now. Politically, those retirees will be a fearsome bunch, likely to demand and receive costly new benefits, like the recently enacted Medicare prescription drug plan. Because of medical advances, they will live longer than ever at greater expense.
 Then there is the Pentagon. President Bush's proposed spending of $420 billion for military purposes for fiscal 2005 heralds large increases for years to come. And, of course, persistent deficits and rising interest rates, both visible on the horizon, will mean more spending on debt service.
 So will taxes rise in the future? The good news -- and yes, this really is good news -- is that they almost certainly will. But the near-inevitability of higher taxes means it is wise to change how you handle your money today. Paradoxically, higher taxes have some of the same practical implications for investors as yawning deficits. Take long-term bonds. If taxes go up, bonds producing taxable income can be expected to suffer. But if taxes do not go up, interest rates will probably increase all the more, something that will still hurt those same long-term bonds. Assuming taxes do rise, municipal bonds on which the interest is tax-exempt may be the way out of this conundrum.
 Stock investors face their own travails. The corporate tax burden has declined sharply in recent years. According to the General Accounting Office, more than 60 percent of American corporations paid no federal tax for 1996 through 2000, when profits were growing. These figures will make corporations a fat target for revenue-hungry politicians, and one result will be lower corporate after-tax profits. This will be reflected in lower returns for investors, the folks who get taxed when corporations pay. If higher taxes keep interest rates down and stabilize the economy, stock investors should benefit.
 In the short run, the prospect of higher taxes may make you think twice about aggressively putting money into tax-deferred retirement accounts; funding them later, when taxes are higher, may be preferable as long as you are confident that your prudence and discipline will not result in paying even more taxes years from now, when America's retirement expenses become overwhelming. Meanwhile, with the federal tax rate on long-term capital gains at a maximum of 15 percent -- as low as it is likely to go in our lifetime -- this may be a good time to sell appreciated securities.
 When income taxes are rising, real estate can be attractive, offering continuing tax deductions and appreciation that is not taxed until the property is sold. Look for gains in states with a low cost of living, low state tax burdens and low levels of precipitation. (Americans prefer sunny climes.) Higher income taxes are never cause for glee. We would be better off with a hefty new levy on gasoline, which would offer many environmental, geopolitical and safety benefits. But don't bet on it. Expect instead more of the same complex hodgepodge of income, sales and property taxes, whatever gets the job done. And pay them with a smile. The alternative, after all, would be far worse.

HEADLINE: On the Waterfront, Wariness Over a Cruise-Ship Plan

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
When the Queen Mary 2 glided past Brooklyn the other day, residents of Red Hook scrambled up to on their rooftops to watch it pass.
 The neighborhood, like the rest of the city, was buzzing, but not just over the ship. Days before, the city's Economic Development Corporation had announced plans to create a cruise-ship berth in Brooklyn for similar vessels as early as the summer of 2005, with Red Hook's Pier12 emerging as a favorite possible location. But in a place where residents list unemployment among their main worries, there is concern over the impact that plan could have on one of the waterfront's largest tenants. 
 American Stevedoring, a shipping business that employs 600 people on Piers8 through 11, saw its lease with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey expire two days ago. Negotiations on a new lease continue, but Steven Coleman, a Port Authority spokesman, said a long-term commitment was unlikely as the authority studied other possible uses for the piers, including more cruise ships and retail use. Mr. Coleman said the authority favored a two-year lease for American Stevedoring, to keep its options open.
 ''Obviously, if we were to sign a long-term, multiyear lease,'' he said, ''that would preclude us from doing anything on those piers for a long period of time. Even if there are much better uses for those piers than a cargo-ship terminal.'' 
 Sal Catucci, American Stevedoring's chief executive, said he did not plan on going anywhere. ''The only way this place will ever, ever close is if I'm dead and they bury me here,'' he said. ''I'm 66 years old, and I expect to live another 25 years. So take it from there.''
 Mr. Catucci, who has operated on the piers since 1994, said he would not mind having cruise ships for a neighbor, but he contends that the city has too much to lose by letting his company go.
 ''They don't create that many jobs at all,'' he said. ''It's only 25 days a year that ships come in. They're not going to create the jobs that we're creating.''
 New York City's unemployment rate is around 8 percent, but activists say the number in Red Hook is higher, especially in the Red Hook Houses, a few blocks from Pier12. That is why Ray Hall, who runs a youth program called Red Hook Rise, supports American Stevedoring's presence on the piers. ''I see these youth, and I deal with them every day, and this is the most I've ever seen kids, and grown people, want to work,'' he said. ''People are dying for work, and there's just no jobs for them.''
 Mr. Coleman of the Port Authority emphasized that everyone had the area's best interests in mind. ''Our primary objective,'' he said, ''is to find the best uses for that site that are going to provide the best jobs and economic activity for the Brooklyn area.''
 In the meantime, American Stevedoring will continue to operate on the piers, though without a lease. Mr. Catucci is confident that things will work out. ''Everybody always says I see the glass not half-full,'' he said, ''but full.'' JAKE MOONEY

THE president of a new minor league hockey franchise in Danbury, A.J. Galante, was speaking to a reporter on his cellphone last month when he had to cut the conversation short. Was a player's agent on the other line? Did Mr. Galante have to speak to the coach? 
 Nope.
 A teacher was walking down the hallway of Mr. Galante's high school, where cellphones are forbidden. 
 ''Uh-oh,'' he said. ''I've got to go.'' 
 A.J., a 17-year-old senior at New Fairfield High School, has been appointed president and managing partner of the Danbury Trashers, a professional hockey team bought by his father, James, who said he would hand over ownership when his son turns 18 in August.
 ''I'm the only president of a sports franchise who has to hide from teachers to do an interview,'' A.J. said later.
 Indeed, the announcement last month that Danbury is getting a team in the United Hockey League has generated a buzz in the city and, to a lesser degree, in hockey circles. Not all of it has been positive; some people, A.J. acknowledged, are skeptical of a 17-year-old who thinks he can run a hockey team. But he was confident he can prove them wrong.
 ''I'm not a spoiled kid who is just getting this title for the fun of it,'' he said. ''I'm definitely putting a lot of hard work into it.''
 He won't be on his own. The team has already hired J. Todd Stirling, the son of Steve Stirling, coach of the New York Islanders in the National Hockey League. 
 For Danbury, the hockey team is much more than an experiment for a young entrepreneur. If the team is a success, said Mayor Mark Boughton, it could fill a void in Danbury.
 ''I think that first of all Danbury is known as a hat city,'' he said, referring to the city's reputation for manufacturing hats. ''But we've really moved into a different era. Minor league teams could really help build our new identity.''
 The city has also been trying to lure a minor league baseball team.
 Tickets to minor league hockey games cost about $10, making the games good family outings, said Richard Brosal, the president and chief executive of the United Hockey League. Mr. Brosal estimated that the team will bring $250,000 into the local economy during the hockey season, which begins in October. The hockey team can also be used as a marketing tool, he said, because once fans from other cities come to Danbury to see the games, they may want to come back.
 ''It's a great springboard for redevelopment of any city,'' he said.
 The league has two six-team divisions, stretching from Virginia to Michigan. 
 James E. Hare, a City Council member and former mayor of Elmira, N.Y., said a minor league hockey team can invigorate a city's nightlife. The Elmira Jackals are also in the league.
 Mr. Hare, a season-ticket holder, said the atmosphere in downtown Elmira has changed since the Jackals began to play there four years ago. While the team may not have drawn new businesses, it has helped the businesses that are already there, he said. On game nights, restaurants are busy and hotels fill up with fans from other cities.
 ''Have we had a store zip into downtown because an arena is there? No,'' he said. ''But we have a lot more activity downtown on hockey nights.''
 The team has helped introduce visitors to Elmira, he added.
 ''One of the benefits is you have people becoming familiar with your community,'' he said. In some ways, hockey has become an integral part of Elmira's community, Mr. Hare said. The players host clinics and do charity work. Some have married locals and become celebrities in town -- one was announced as ''the next mayor of Elmira'' before a recent game. ''There are a lot of spin-offs,'' he said. ''People tend to focus on the economics, but the identity thing is good, too.''
 But other cities haven't taken as well to minor league hockey. New Haven had a U.H.L. team, but the team folded after two seasons.
 Hartford and Bridgeport also have minor league hockey teams, though those teams are in the American Hockey League, a higher league than the U.H.L.
 James Galante, who owns trash hauling companies in Danbury and Putnam County, N.Y., first tried to get into the hockey business in New Haven, but he eventually realized the city's team couldn't be saved. When Danbury opened its ice arena in 2001, Mr. Galante saw another opportunity. He had watched his son play hockey in high school and noticed that young people from the area were signing up for junior and pee wee leagues. A hockey team, he realized, could take root here.
 ''Being at the rink and seeing the amount of kids who come in there, I just really believe there's a need for this,'' he said. ''It will keep them out of the malls. It gives them something to do.''
 It certainly gives his son something to do. His schedule leaves little time for the mall.
 ''It's basically school, school and hockey right now for me,'' A.J. Galante said.
 Hockey has been a big part of his life for at least a decade. He played on the New Fairfield High School varsity squad for four years, though he was sidelined earlier this year after a knee injury that has required multiple operations. While he was playing, A.J. said he collected the most penalty minutes in his league and earned the team's award for toughness his junior and senior years. He has been trying to line up an N.H.L. affiliation for the team, which is roughly equivalent to a Class AA minor league baseball team. He's also looking for corporate sponsors to advertise around the inside of rink. 
 The team will hold open tryouts and will also pick players from other teams through an expansion draft this summer. As soon as the season is over (it is the middle of the playoffs now), A.J. will be talking to agents and players to prepare for the draft.
 The team will also be paying for major renovations to the ice arena, expanding the capacity from 750 seats to as many as 2,500. The renovation still needs the city's approval, said Kevin McCormack, regional manager for New Jersey-based Floyd Hall Enterprises, which owns the arena. The arena had also not signed a final contract with the team, Mr. McCormack said.
 The arena, which holds two rinks, already logs 400,000 to 500,000 total visits a year for youth leagues, adult leagues and recreational skating, among other events, Mr. McCormack said. None of those activities will be curtailed by the hockey team, he said. He expected the team to boost interest in the arena, rather than drive it away. Danbury residents are already coming to the ice arena asking where they can buy season tickets, Mr. McCormack said.
 Increasing the seating was a prerequisite for admission into the league, Mr. Brosal, the U.H.L. president, said. He also said he was not concerned that James Galante had served a federal sentence in connection with filing false corporate tax returns.
 ''We have zero issue with it,'' Mr. Brosal said. 
 In September, A.J. plans to attend Manhattanville College in Westchester County to study business. The school is a 40-minute drive from Danbury and A.J. said he wanted to go to all of the home games. Opening night at the ice arena is scheduled for Oct. 15.
 James Galante said his son's experience will certainly augment his education.
 ''This is the best of both worlds,'' he said. ''College and a little O.J.T. -- On the Job Training.''

HEADLINE: An All-American Town, A Sky-High Divorce Rate

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

DATELINE: ROANOKE, Va. 

 BODY:
Marriage might be in the spotlight as the American ideal for many people these days. But the inescapable image for Roanoke, the all-American hub of southwestern Virginia with Norfolk Southern railroad tracks slicing through the pretty brick facades of the restored downtown, is Splitsville East.
 About one in 10 American adults are divorced or separated. In Roanoke, a city of 94,000 that has taken a disproportionate share of the cultural and economic blows that shatter marriages, the rate is closer to one in five. The national rate of divorce and separation grew 10 percent in the 1990's, according to the 2000 census. It grew about 30 percent in Roanoke.
 Divorce so occupies this city that the big First Baptist Church downtown is organizing ''pre-engagement'' classes for dating teenagers. Under a new Virginia law, courts deny divorce decrees until parents take four hours of classes to learn to help their children deal with divorce. Divorcing parents can also enroll children ages 8 to 12 in the Family Service of Roanoke's eight-week course for coping with a split-up family. And domestic relations lawyers and mediation services have bloomed along Campbell Avenue, downtown Roanoke's busiest street. 
 The decline in marriage mirrors the jolts that Roanoke's economy has suffered over the last decade. ''Things have dramatically changed'' since the North American Free Trade Agreement was implemented 10 years ago, said David Beidler, a lawyer at the Legal Aid Society of Roanoke Valley. 
 From 1993 to 2001, about 25 percent of the area's jobs in metalworking, furniture and textile plants, which paid $600 to $800 a week, folded or went abroad. The city has low unemployment, but jobs in stores and services that pay $200 to $500 a week have left some two-worker families making less than what a single worker had once earned.
 One result is a median family income of $37,826, far below Virginia's median of $54,169. That has left 22 percent of families with children, many of them two-worker families, in poverty -- twice the state's rate.
 Far-removed events have also worked to rip apart ordinary lives. At the Rescue Mission homeless shelter here, war is an issue. 
 ''I'd say 25 to 40 percent of the men in the shelter are veterans,'' said the shelter's director, Joy Sylvester-Johnson. ''Many were married and aren't married now. We've had Desert Storm people and families of people in Iraq. Not everybody comes back O.K.''
 A divorce is harder to get in Virginia than in many other states. But in some ways, Roanoke seems more exposed than most cities to the influences that lead to marital tensions, like poverty and lost jobs and shifting cultural views that make marriage optional.
 Clifford R. Weckstein, a Circuit Court judge here, says he is seeing less and less commitment among couples. ''We are tending toward majority nonmarried cohabitating couples for the first time in history,'' he said. ''My perception, both from uncontested divorces and contested divorces, is that we are at an all-time high in people not willing to devote the effort to work together to get through difficult times.''
 Nationwide, 11.9 percent of Americans 15 and older told the 2000 census that they were divorced or separated. In Roanoke, the rate was 17.8 percent. For counties and a few cities like Roanoke that are organized like counties, the census ranked Roanoke first in divorce and separation among those of more than 75,000 people, with no more than 3 percent in prisons or other institutions.
 Ranked another way, among cities of comparable size, only Reno, the Las Vegas suburb Paradise and Flint, Mich., ravaged by the loss of well-paid jobs in automobile plants, have higher rates. Two other cities match Roanoke: Gary, Ind., sunk by the disappearance of steel mills, and Miami Beach.
 The national divorce rate has shown some signs of ebbing since the 1990's, but the marriage rate is ebbing more, leaving fewer marriages to end in divorce and raising the numbers of unwed parents who are breaking up. 
 And there is little evidence to suggest that the trend toward marrying later in life will lead to fewer divorces. Surveys of the National Center for State Courts in Williamsburg, Va., for 1996 through 2001 show divorce filings slipping just 1 percent, but also find a 46 percent surge in child custody cases.
 Divorce filings in Circuit Court in Roanoke show that lawyers filed 539 divorce complaints last year. Over a four-week stretch this winter, 39 people, mostly women, completed filings. They included one couple who separated after two weeks of marriage and another after seven months, but on average the separations began in marriage's year of the itch, the seventh.
 Adultery, still grounds for divorce in Virginia, was cited in just 3 of the 39 cases, but lawyers say it is a factor in far more broken marriages than that. ''I'm not a Bible thumper,'' said David Weaver, a divorce lawyer who caters to affluent clients. ''But if it weren't for sex, I wouldn't be in business.'' Clients, he said, ''come here and say they 'want space.' Well, they want space for a reason.''
 Connie Owens's marriage toppled when her husband, a truck driver, kept leaving and then coming back. He finally left her, she said, with their trailer, her job in a factory making boxes and their 14-year-old son. ''I didn't have the heart to tell him he didn't have his daddy to walk into the yard anymore,'' said Ms. Owens, 51. ''But he begged me. He wanted to go to his dad in Florida, so I let him. I cried until I could get down there.''
 Ms. Owens settled nearby in a one-bedroom trailer and found a job. ''I lived there five years,'' she said. ''He lived with his dad.''
 Ellen Brown, a divorced 52-year-old mother of three and the director of a program to help homeless and divorcing families at Total Action Against Poverty, a nonprofit community service agency, said, ''The culture sets couples up to fail.''
 ''There's so much societal pressure, media pressure for people to have this, have that, look this way, have a partner, have a family that looks like this,'' Ms. Brown said. ''All that contributes to the dissolution of relationships and marriage.''
 For most women, divorce still spells a shrunken standard of living. Courts order little if any alimony for working women these days. Women earn 70 to 80 percent as much as men in similar jobs and receive lower Social Security and pension benefits.
 But women's economic gains in recent years also seem to have affected divorce rates. While men have been losing industrial jobs, women have surged into professional and management careers that provide the wherewithal to support a family or flee a soured marriage.
 ''Women who have already been working for pay and get divorced,'' said Toni Calasanti, a sociologist at Virginia Tech here, ''they're not necessarily going to be thrown into 'My gosh, what am I going to do now?' ''
 Theresa Scott, 49, the mother of two grown daughters, said she and her husband were executives, each earning $45,000 a year, when they broke up 11 years ago.
 ''My divorce was friendly,'' Ms. Scott said. ''We planned it like our wedding. We wrote our separation agreement over pizza. He signed the house over to me. He got a condo. He got a credit card. I got a credit card.''
 Still, she said, ''I felt stifled, resentful and angry.'' 
 ''I thought life had something greater for us,'' Ms. Scott said. ''I believe the Lord said, 'Your priority is your kids.' We don't share the joy of our kids as a couple. The hardest thing in divorce is losing control of when you see your kids.''
 Laurie Gearheart, 41, first married at 22 and had the first of her two children at 24. ''I got a college degree,'' she said. ''I'm a C.P.A. He had not gone to college. He did odd jobs.''
 ''He was raised in a home where his mother cooked and cleaned,'' she said. '' 'Where's my dinner?' he'd say. As soon as I would walk in the door from work, he would go, 'Here,' '' thrusting the baby at her.
 She divorced him and met another man, who like her was an accountant. ''He was cute and charming,'' Ms. Gearheart said. They were married. But that marriage, too, ended in divorce, three years ago. 
 For marriage to work, some divorced people here say, it needs a second act. Lloyd Merchant, 40, a state probation and parole officer, was 21 the first time he married, as was his wife. After 13 years and a son, she filed for divorce.
 ''I wish I had waited until I was in my 30's,'' he said. ''I would have decided who I am, what I want to be.''
 Five years ago, he married again. ''It's great,'' he said. ''This lady, we talk about everything. We have a friendship, too. We do things together. There's no 'woman' chore, no 'man' chore. We've got a lot of stuff in common.''

HEADLINE: Drought Settles In, Lake Shrinks and West's Worries Grow

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON and DEAN E. MURPHY; Kirk Johnson reported from Page, Ariz., for this article and Dean E. Murphy from Grand Canyon National Park.

DATELINE: PAGE, Ariz. 

 BODY:
At five years and counting, the drought that has parched much of the West is getting much harder to shrug off as a blip.
 Those who worry most about the future of the West -- politicians, scientists, business leaders, city planners and environmentalists -- are increasingly realizing that a world of eternally blue skies and meager mountain snowpacks may not be a passing phenomenon but rather the return of a harsh climatic norm.
 Continuing research into drought cycles over the last 800 years bears this out, strongly suggesting that the relatively wet weather across much of the West during the 20th century was a fluke. In other words, scientists who study tree rings and ocean temperatures say, the development of the modern urbanized West -- one of the biggest growth spurts in the nation's history -- may have been based on a colossal miscalculation. 
 That shift is shaking many assumptions about how the West is run. Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, the states that depend on the Colorado River, are preparing for the possibility of water shortages for the first time since the Hoover Dam was built in the 1930's to control the river's flow. The top water official of the Bush administration, Bennett W. Raley, said recently that the federal government might step in if the states could not decide among themselves how to cope with dwindling supplies, a threat that riled local officials but underscored the growing urgency.
 ''Before this drought, we had 20 years of a wet cycle and 20 years of the most growth ever,'' said John R. D'Antonio, the New Mexico State engineer, who is scrambling to find new water supplies for the suburbs of Albuquerque that did not exist a generation ago.
 The latest blow was paltry snowfall during March in the Rocky Mountains, pushing down runoff projections for the Colorado River this year to 55 percent of average. Snowmelt is the lifeblood of the river, which provides municipal water from Denver to Los Angeles and irrigates millions of acres of farmland. The period since 1999 is now officially the driest in the 98 years of recorded history of the Colorado River, according to the United States Geological Survey.
 ''March was a huge wake-up call as to the need to move at an accelerated pace,'' said Mr. Raley, assistant secretary of the interior for water and science.

Losing Water at Lake Powell
 Some of the biggest water worries are focused here on Lake Powell, the vast blue diamond of deep water that government engineers created in one of the driest and most remote areas of the country beginning in the 1950's. From its inception, Lake Powell, the nation's second-largest artificial lake, after Lake Mead in Nevada, was a powerful symbol across the West. Some saw it as a statement of human will and know-how, others of arrogance.
 Powell, part of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, has lost nearly 60 percent of its water and is now about the size it was during the Watergate hearings in 1973, when it was still filling up. White cliffs 10 stories high, bleached by salts from the lake and stranded above the water, line its side canyons. Elsewhere, retreating waters have exposed mountains of sediment.
 The tourist economy here in Page has been battered. The National Park Service, which operates the recreation area, has spent millions of dollars in recent years just to lay concrete for boat-launch ramps that must be extended every year, a process that one marina operator here called ''chasing water.''
 Daniel C. McCool, a professor of political science at the University of Utah and director of the American West Center, says Powell is the barometer of the drought because what has happened here is as much about politics, economics and the interlocking system of rules and rights called the law of the river as it is about meteorology.
 Part of the lake's problem, for example, dates to a miscalculation in 1922, when hydrologists overestimated the average flow of the Colorado River and locked the number into a multistate agreement called the Colorado River Compact. The compact, along with a subsequent treaty with Mexico, requires Lake Powell to release 8.23 million acre-feet of water each year below the river's dam, Glen Canyon, no matter how much comes in. 
 Because the river's real average flow was less than the 1922 compact envisioned, Powell very often released more than half of the water the Colorado River delivered. But it did not really matter because the upper basin states were not using their share. Now, communities from Denver to Salt Lake City and Indian tribes with old water rights in their portfolios are stepping forward to stake their claims. Lake Powell, which has been called the aquatic piggy bank of the upper West, is overdrawn.
 If water levels continue to fall, Powell will be unable to generate electricity as early as 2007 or sooner, some hydrologists say. And it would be reduced more or less to the old riverbed channel of the Colorado River not long after that. Even now, the lake's managers say, it would take a decade of historically normal rainfall to refill it.
 ''If we're only in the middle of this drought, then Lake Powell might be very close to some very dramatic problems,'' said Dr. John C. Dohrenwend, a retired geologist for the Geological Survey who lives near the lake.
 Insufficient water for the Glen Canyon Dam turbines would be only the beginning. At that point, much of the lake bottom would be exposed, creating a vast environment for noxious weeds like tamarisk and thistle. The next step in the spiral would come at what is called ''dead pool,'' where decades' worth of agricultural chemicals at the lake bottom would begin mixing more actively with the reactivated river. The question then, environmentalists say, is what would happen to the Grand Canyon, just south of the dam.

An Issue That May Go to Congress
 ''Americans won't stand for the Grand Canyon being endangered,'' said John Weisheit, the conservation director for Living Rivers, an environmental group in Moab, Utah, that advocates removing the dam at Glen Canyon and allowing the river to return to its natural course. ''In another year, they're going to be talking more seriously about Powell in Congress.''
 But the fact is, no one knows: the weather could change tomorrow. Many past Western droughts have ended suddenly, with a bang of precipitation. But some dry spells persisted for generations. From about 900 to 1300, scientists say, periodic drought in the West was the norm. Only a few times during that period, according to tree-growth measurements, was precipitation anywhere near the relatively high levels of the 20th century.
 ''What is unusual is not the drought periods, but the above-average wet periods,'' said Dr. Robert Webb, a hydrologist with the Geological Survey who specializes in the Colorado River.
 The uncertainty has local, state and federal officials along the 1,450-mile river scurrying to secure water allotments while also preparing for the worst.
 Already in Las Vegas, the regional water agency is removing the equivalent of a football field of grass every day from front lawns, playgrounds and golf courses to save on outdoor watering. Farther downriver, Arizona officials are pumping billions of gallons of water into aquifers to save for an even less rainy day.
 Electricity has become a concern. The Western Area Power Administration, the federal agency that distributes power from hydroelectric projects in the Rocky Mountain West, plans to reduce by about 25 percent the amount of electricity it can promise in future years.

Conserving on a Large Scale
 In Los Angeles, a representative from the West's largest urban water agency, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, is among a group of Western water officials dusting off plans to help limit evaporation from reservoirs, which could save billions of gallons. One idea is to pour a nontoxic substance over the reservoirs to form a water-trapping barrier. 
 The group, which has been holding meetings, is even looking at far-off solutions like raising the height of Hoover Dam so that more water could be collected and saved during wet times.
 ''We understand we have a problem and we are working on it,'' said the Los Angeles representative, Dennis Underwood, a former head of the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which oversees dams and reservoirs in the West.
 There are also worries downstream from Powell at Lake Mead, which serves Nevada, Arizona and California. It could drop low enough as early as next year to force officials to declare a drought emergency. That would hurt the booming southern Nevada economy through significantly higher water rates and outright bans on things like new swimming pools, said Patricia Mulroy, general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority.
 Mr. Raley of the Interior Department said he wanted the states to consider a water bank, in which unused water could be leased or sold across state lines. Some previous efforts to create banks, with federal oversight, have been contentious because they were seen by smaller states as a means to funnel more of the river to water-guzzling California.
 But the notion of cutting private water deals on the Colorado is gaining broader acceptance, in large part because of the drought. The most celebrated example was a deal last year to sell irrigation water in the Imperial Valley of Southern California to the urban water district in San Diego.
 Some advocates for agriculture fear that water-to-the-highest-bidder could ravage ranches and farms if owners were induced to sell their irrigation rights. But private-market supporters say the truth, like it or not, is that farmers own most of the West's water, and ultimately there will be fewer of them.
 There is some concern that if the Colorado River goes into crisis, the ensuing tangle of litigation over water rights, endangered species and border disputes could undo the system of Western water law that has evolved over the last 100 years.
 Some say that would be a good thing.
 ''The law of the river is hopelessly, irretrievably obsolete, designed on a hydrological fallacy, around an agrarian West that no longer exists,'' Professor McCool at the University of Utah said. ''After six years of drought, somebody will have to say the emperor has no clothes.''
 Water officials in Arizona and Nevada say they would also like to rethink the law of the river to put their states on a more equal footing in sharing the Colorado River. But Mr. Raley said such talk invites disaster and chaos, especially during a drought.
 ''This isn't the time to plunge into chaos,'' he said.
 Other people who live here on the fringe of Lake Powell say that the West's great reservoirs have, in their very decline, proved their value in stretching out limited water resources and underlined the difference between past civilizations here that anthropologists say were wiped out or displaced by drought.
 ''Those people back then had nothing to catch and save their water -- now we do,'' said Ronald W. Thompson, district manager of the Washington County Water Conservancy District in southwestern Utah.
 ''I'm a believer that history repeats itself -- long-term drought could return,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''But I suspect our civilization can weather this.''

Dry Spell
 Articles in this series will examine the effects of prolonged drought on states in the Colorado River basin.

 BODY:
Allison Price Fine, a daughter of Gail Fine and Dr. Douglas Fine of Santa Fe, N.M., was married last evening to Jeffrey James Kingsley, a son of Jane and James Kingsley of Madison, Conn.

HEADLINE: The German Question

BYLINE: By Richard Bernstein. 
Richard Bernstein is chief of the Berlin bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
It's not often that world leaders are bluntly contradicted in public by other world leaders, but that is what happened at the Bayerischer Hof, Munich's grand 19th-century hotel, where a bit over a year ago, in what came to be an almost epochal event in Germany, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, had a sort of clash of civilizations over the war in Iraq. The setting was the 2003 Munich Conference on Security Policy, an annual event attended by a who's who of European and American diplomacy, business and politics. At the time, Rumsfeld was at the height of his European unpopularity, thanks to his statements likening Germany to Libya and Cuba in their nonsupport of what was then the imminent Iraq war and his declaration that ''Old Europe'' was irrelevant. As Rumsfeld spoke, demonstrators led by Munich's mayor gathered on the snowy streets of the city. 
 Munich, of course, is a historically and metaphorically freighted place, the city where Neville Chamberlain made his notorious gesture of appeasement to Hitler, and that was Rumsfeld's theme as he made the case for the war. To fail to overthrow the regime of Saddam Hussein, he argued, would be to fail to learn the lesson of Munich. Rumsfeld then sat in the front row of the audience, his face set in an almost theatrical glower, as Fischer took the podium to argue the contrary point of view. An intensely intellectual man who happens to be both a former street-fighting left-wing radical and Germany's most popular politician, Fischer argued what had by then become the standard Old European point of view: that starting a war against Iraq before the peaceful alternatives had been exhausted was both unnecessary and rank with possibilities for unintended consequences.
 In midspeech, Fischer broke into extemporaneous English. ''Excuse me,'' he said, while Rumsfeld sat and glared, ''but I'm not convinced.'' The phrase, reproduced in English in the headlines of many German newspapers the next morning, quickly acquired an almost Delphic significance in Germany, as a declaration of independence from the United States, the end point of a half-century of nearly automatic compliance with the American wish. Effusions of joy greeted the comment all over anti-George Bush and anti-Rumsfeld Germany. 
 But by the time of the next Munich security conference, in February, the atmosphere was much changed. There were no mass demonstrations outside the hall and no abrupt confrontations within. Of course, there were reminders of the disagreements of the past -- ''We were not, and are still not, convinced of the validity of the reasons for war,'' Fischer said. Yet he avoided repeating the old arguments. He has said frequently that the debate over Iraq was always a matter of tactics, not goals, and that even though the United States went ahead with a war that Germany opposed, it is now in the German interest for the Americans to succeed. It is certainly not in Germany's interest for its major ally, the United States, to become bogged down in a quagmire. Fischer used his Munich appearance to put forward a strategic vision that is actually very close to the American one. We face a common threat, Fischer said, and he attached a clear name to it: ''destructive jihadist terrorism with its totalitarian ideology.'' Facing that threat, Fischer declared, it is imperative that ''the coalition's efforts must be successful; the forces of violence and terror in Iraq must not win the upper hand.''
 Fischer's Munich 2004 speech was clearly an attempt to realign Germany with the United States after the worst period in their relations since the end of World War II, a few months during which President Bush didn't talk to Chancellor Gerhard Schroder. A few weeks after this year's Munich conference, in fact, Schroder went to Washington and, in a public display of camaraderie with President Bush, seemed to put the freeze of 2003 into the past. The chancellor proposed a sort of Marshall Plan for the Muslim world, a multifaceted effort -- that was first outlined by Fischer in Munich -- to address the poverty and desperation that are, in the German view, at the heart of the problem. But Fischer understands, and has said, that winning the war on terrorism will require something more than a program for what he calls the modernization of the Islamic world. ''You fight terrorism with police, with armies, with intelligence, but also with transformation and by addressing the root causes,'' he has said. His belief, and Germany's belief, is that the old trans-Atlantic alliance is indispensable, probably for both sides, certainly for Germany. 
 So the question is, Is everything back to normal between the United States and Germany? Given Germany's centrality to the Western alliance's entire network of agreements and institutions, it is an important question at any time, but it seems especially important in the wake of the devastating terror attacks in Madrid on March 11. Germany is the geographical, economic and strategic heart of Europe, and it will be even more so as the European Union, newly enlarged from 15 to 25 members, strives to forge common positions in foreign affairs and defense. For 40 years, what was then West Germany was, outside of England, America's closest European ally, our chief cold-war partner, the country that owed its flourishing and vigorous democracy to what might perhaps be the most benign and successful postwar occupation in history. Germany is the country that has always prevented France from transforming the European Union into an instrument of French policy, which was, and still seems to be, to create a counterweight to the American superpower. Germany has always been, so to speak, the counterweight to the counterweight, the rudder that has kept the alliance on course. 
 It is this background that makes the question of German-American relations so important once again as the West confronts Islamic terrorism. The people on both sides of the Atlantic now understand that they are vulnerable to what Fischer has aptly called a transmogrified sort of totalitarianism, which strikes in a new, terrifyingly random and unpredictable way. 
 So, yes, normal relations between Germany and the United States have been restored, but with some new uncertainties and questions. There is no important disagreement between the United States and Germany, or the rest of Europe, over the existence and nature of the terrorist threat. But the freeze of 2003 resulted from some deep disagreements over the tactics to adopt against the threat, and these disagreements are rooted not just in different conceptions of the role of force but also in the widespread conviction that Europe and the United States belong to two very different universes of culture and values. European governments, in the wake of the Madrid bombings, have mostly reaffirmed their solidarity in the antiterror fight. Even the newly elected Spanish prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, pledged his support, despite his plans to withdraw his country's military contingent from Iraq. But as Zapatero's victory itself suggests, some Europeans seem to believe that the more they distance themselves from American policies, the safer they will be. In this context, the German-American relationship will determine much about the endurance and effectiveness of the trans-Atlantic alliance that won the cold war, kept the peace, spread democracy throughout Europe and is now being called on to protect the West and the penumbra of states dependent on it from the new menace of terrorism.
 there was a telling moment at Munich 2004 that indicates some of the ways in which German-American ties are still weaker than they were before the divisions over the war in Iraq. It came when William Cohen, former secretary of defense, did a bit of politely phrased public grilling of Fischer. If Germany agrees that it is essential to win the peace in Iraq, and if winning the peace is so essential to the security of Europe and America, Cohen asked, why would Germany rule out sending troops to Iraq to help the coalition in its struggle? Germany, as Cohen surely knew, has stated clearly that it will not send a single soldier to Iraq. With troops already stationed in places like Bosnia and Kosovo, in addition to Afghanistan (where more than 2,000 German soldiers serve in the NATO-commanded international force), German officials persuasively make the point that their contribution to European peacekeeping and the war on terrorism is being made elsewhere. Germany has agreed to run a training program for Iraqi police officers (though not in Iraq itself), and figures like Fischer have certainly made clear that they want the United States to prevail in making Iraq a self-sustaining democracy. 
 To the critics of the Schroder government, however, Germany's vigorous campaign in the United Nations and NATO against the war in Iraq was behavior unbefitting an ally. There has of course been opposition, even very passionate opposition, to the United States in the not-too-distant German past. Just look at the protests during the Vietnam War, when the posters showed the letters USA written so that the S looked like a swastika, or the mass marches against the installation of Pershing II medium-range nuclear missiles on German soil in the early 80's. What was different in the Iraq debate was that opposition to a policy that the United States deemed critical to its national interest was headquartered in the German government itself, in the office of the chancellor. (By contrast, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who as a Social Democrat was himself on the left, supported the installation of the missiles in the 80's.)
 Schroder not only spoke out strongly against the war but also was the first major European leader to do so, inveighing against it at a time when President Jacques Chirac of France seemed uncertain what to do. Then he went further than Chirac ever did, saying that Germany would oppose a war even if the United Nations sanctioned military action. It was Schroder, not Chirac or President Vladimir Putin of Russia, who crystallized what came to be called the Moscow-Berlin-Paris antiwar axis, and it was this tripartite opposition that made Security Council approval of the American plan well-nigh impossible. Worst of all, perhaps, Schroder did this not by leading German public opinion but by following it at a time when anti-American sentiment had reached a postwar peak. As Michael Mertes, a former foreign-policy adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, put it in an article in the journal Internationale Politik, ''If anti-Americanism pays domestically, how reliable is Germany as an ally when the moment of truth finally comes?''
 It is one of the paradoxes of the Iraq debate that despite Germany's more categorical opposition to war, Americans were, and still are, far angrier at France. One explanation for this is that as the debate heated up in the early months of 2003, Germany happily allowed France -- mostly in the person of its flamboyant foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin -- to lead the coalition of the unwilling. When de Villepin was applauded after a rousing antiwar speech in the Security Council, Fischer knew immediately that it was going to be very expensive applause -- expensive in American annoyance. Fischer has told German journalists that in his own speeches he tried to remain academic, precise, a little bit boring. He acted that way mainly because he had no interest in allowing the war in Iraq to spoil the bilateral relationship but also because of the ineradicable German instinct, since World War II, to play a subdued role on the world stage, not to be like France. The German interest since the end of the war has been to allay fears that someday it will allow history to repeat itself, to create a Fourth Reich, to use its power to dominate Europe. It wants, as conspicuously as possible, to be nonnationalistic, nonmilitaristic, anchored in Europe and in the NATO alliance.
 This does not mean that Germany and its foreign policy have been static since 1945. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 fundamentally altered the strategic equation that had governed both German-American relations and Germany's own single-issue foreign policy for more than 40 years. Almost overnight, Germany was under no military threat. After the fall of the wall, said Karsten Voigt, the German foreign ministry's coordinator for German-American cooperation, ''Germany became less dependent on the United States, but we became less relevant to the United States at the same time.'' In fact, the disappearance of the cold-war threat and German reunification have brought changes, most notably a slow but steady German progress toward being what the Germans often call a normal country, a country like others, even though the Germans seem to understand that the mere fact that they aspire to be normal means that in at least some ways they still can't be. The Germans move slowly and hesitantly toward accepting that their country has interests and responsibilities like other countries even as they worry that their past disentitles them to have these things.
 The liberation of Germany from its American dependency also brought it into confrontation with an unknown. ''Before, it was automatic that we would be part of the game,'' Voigt said, meaning the cold-war game. ''Now, we have to decide if and where we want to be relevant. It's a psychological shift. We need to change the mentality of the German people, not just the mind-set of a few leaders.''
Among the main things that had to change was the almost theological pacifism of the German public, that recoil from the horrors that the Germans once inflicted on the Jews, on their European neighbors and on themselves. ''We have an excellent democracy, but there are terrible things in our past,'' Fischer once said to me, and that sentence is indeed German history in a nutshell, the bad followed by a real attempt to come to grips with what went wrong and to not repeat it. But at the same time, once democracy was firmly established, and once the Western alliance needed a German military contribution, the pacifism that was once a reassurance became a kind of failing. ''Germany's pacifism was a relic of a moral superiority for Germany, another kind of arrogance,'' said Heinrich August Winkler, one of Germany's most prominent historians. ''It was the inverse of the former German arrogance, vastly better, but an arrogance nonetheless.'' By all accounts it has been Fischer, the foreign minister, who is chiefly responsible for ridding Germany of this postwar legacy.
 Fischer's biography is one of those things that everybody in Germany knows, a sort of metaphor for Germany itself and its transformation. He is a member of the generation born just after World War II, which demanded an accounting of Germany's wartime crimes and forced the previously taboo subject of the Holocaust into the open. As a teenager, unable to tolerate the conformity demanded in the schools, he dropped out, became a political radical and then, in the early 80's, a member of the nascent Green Party, the peace and environmentalist group whose members wore jeans, listened to Dylan and, in some cases, breast-fed their babies during meetings. In other words, Fischer belonged to a movement that failed in its stated objective, notably to bring about a revolution, but nonetheless fractured Germany's formerly stiff, heel-clicking authoritarianism and led to its replacement with a more open, more democratic and, above all, more self-critical society. When Fischer became environment and energy minister of the state of Hesse in 1985, he famously wore sneakers to his inauguration, and the shoes, emblems of Germany's cultural transformation, are now on permanent exhibit in the historical museum in Bonn. ''The whole leftist movement was a failure,'' said Otto Schily, Germany's interior minister, who was once a lawyer for members of the terrorist Red Army Faction. ''But the result -- the transformation of the German collective consciousness -- was a success.''
 Fischer never seemed primarily interested in Green issues, most notably the environment, though certainly the Greens were the only party unorthodox enough to allow a high-school dropout like him to rise to power. His interest was in foreign policy, the Middle East, in German relations inside Europe and, of course, in doing well enough in elections to become part of the national government. He and the Greens did so in 1998, coming to power as the minor partner in coalition with Schroder's Social Democrats -- what's known locally as the Red-Green Coalition.
 Once Fischer was in power, his former radicalism continued to fade, and he became a liberal interventionist, in favor of the use of force when all other options have been exhausted. Specific events pushed him along, especially the Serbian massacre of some 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in the supposed United Nations safe area of Srebrenica in 1995 and later the Serbian threat of ethnic cleansing against Albanian Kosovars in 1998. Both incidents left a deep mark on Fischer, who led the Greens, kicking, screaming and protesting, away from pacifism to an acceptance of the use of military force outside Germany's borders. When German pilots took part in the 1995 NATO bombardment of Serbian positions in Bosnia, it was the first time German forces had been used in a combat situation outside Germany since World War II.
 Essentially, Fischer brought the left into line with a foreign policy favoring a stronger and more active German role in the trans-Atlantic alliance, and in so doing, he helped enable two German chancellors, Kohl from the right, Schroder from the left, to engage German troops abroad without instigating mass demonstrations and mass resistance at home. 
 sept. 11, 2001, moved Germany even further in the direction of greater engagement in the world and solidarity with the United States. Most important, Germany dispatched troops all the way to Afghanistan. Defense Minister Peter Struck offered a succinct definition of Germany's new strategic position. ''Our security must also be defended on the Hindukush,'' he said in December 2002, referring to the Afghan mountain range. ''We must face up to threats where they arise,'' he said more recently. 
 Struck would have committed political suicide if he'd said that a few years before, Voigt said. ''We are now defining our security way outside our boundaries, and I think the German people will have to accept it,'' he continued. ''It's no longer a debate about morality, which it used to be previously. It's now a debate about interests.''
 These days, Germans do indeed debate their interests, especially when those interests involve the United States. After Sept. 11, for example, Schroder criticized the foreign policy of the preceding government of the conservative chancellor Helmut Kohl for undertaking only ''secondary assistance measures.'' Schroder said he would have Germany behave like ''a great power.'' But then came August 2002, when Schroder himself, campaigning hard for re-election as chancellor, announced his fundamentalist anti-Iraq-war position, and soon thereafter, Schroder, Chirac and Putin created their own alliance, whose main purpose, it was feared in Washington, would be to confront any unilateral exercise of American power. 
 ''Both sides became very ideological, articulating positions rather than searching for the truth,'' said Gary Smith, the director of the American Academy in Berlin, of the fierce disagreement over Iraq. ''And both sides indoctrinated themselves; they imbibed what they said at the time, and it's naive to think that suddenly either side is going to go back to the way they saw things before.''
 Indeed, it is not difficult to find reasons that Germany and the United States may slowly drift apart, at least enough to end up on opposite sides of more than just the Iraq-war question. Already the Germans share the wider European sense of a growing cultural gap with the United States, seen in disagreements over such matters as the death penalty, the Kyoto Protocol on global warming and the International Criminal Court. On all three, Europeans and Americans have opposing positions. There is also what has become the four-year-old stagnation of the German economy. The specter of 10 percent unemployment and the prospect of a shrunken Social Security system will probably dampen the German enthusiasm for more foreign engagements or new troop deployments. ''It all comes together, and it gives you the feeling that there's less common ground than there used to be,'' said Wolfgang Biermann, a Social Democratic Party senior foreign-policy adviser. ''The feeling in Germany is that the Americans end up doing what they want with only their national interest counting, while the Germans don't feel that only their national interest counts.''
 Finally, Germany has new distractions and new priorities, most important the effort to build an integrated Europe. It is a project that doesn't necessarily mean a drifting away from the Atlantic alliance, but many people suspect that the future will be determined by a contest between the German trans-Atlanticists, who see the American relationship as fundamental, and the Europeanists, who see the future with the European Union.
 ''I'd say that, essentially, the non-Atlanticists have won,'' said Jeffrey Gedmin, director of the Aspen Institute Berlin. ''The deans of the Social Democratic Party are not anti-American, but none of them are full-blooded, heart-and-soul Atlanticists. They're at least as interested in the E.U. as they are in an alliance with the United States.'' More generally, Gedmin said, ''German foreign policy in the next 10 years will look more French. The Germans will still be allies. They'll still be members of the alliance. But Germany will be far from the old, loyal, helpful junior partner it was under Kohl.'' 
 Many Germans, including Fischer himself and his counterparts in the conservative opposition, repudiate the notion that foreign policy either can or should drift into a sort of Gaullism by default. ''This is a complete misunderstanding,'' he told me. ''Germany is completely different,'' he said, meaning different from France, and the difference lies, as so much does in Germany, in the burden of the past. ''We have the responsibility of having fought for hegemony in the first half of the 20th century. We destroyed ourselves during the Nazi dictatorship. We are responsible for the Shoah. Our country was divided. And postwar Europe was not only built against the Soviet Union but also against the German threat. So, yes, we'd be more Gaullist if we hadn't had the Nazi period and the Second World War. Of course, why not? Because then we would have had a different history. But given our real history, we don't only look to the trans-Atlantic relationship because it's in our interest but also because it is in our institutions; it is part of our way of life.''
 There are large areas of strategic consensus -- rebuilding Afghanistan, bringing Turkey into the E.U., in part to prevent it from drifting toward Islamic fundamentalism, keeping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. More important is the widespread assumption in Germany, despite the jaundiced view millions of Germans still take of the Bush administration, that the United States must remain Germany's most important ally. If, as many expect, the conservative parties come into power in the next national elections in 2006, Germany would probably be more trans-Atlanticist than before. ''If you try to unite Europe against the United States, you will fail,'' said Wolfgang Schauble, vice chairman of the Christian Democratic Union, Germany's largest conservative party. ''Most people in Germany understand that the better way for Germany is to cooperate very closely with the United States. Without a strong partnership, it would be much more difficult and much more insecure for us.''
 Perhaps the key concept for the future is very simple: a less compliant, more European-oriented Germany is the almost inevitable price that the United States will pay for one of history's greatest foreign-policy triumphs, the forging of a peaceful, democratic, united Germany. For the first time in modern history, Germany is surrounded by friendly countries; it has no territorial claims or imperial ambitions. It is, in short, a happy story, with the consequence that Germany will go its own way, even when that displeases the United States. Egon Bahr, a Social Democratic Party foreign-policy analyst who was a chief adviser to Chancellor Willy Brandt, said, ''Now the Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore, so logically Europe can only get its emancipation vis-a-vis the United States.''
 Otto Schily put it this way: ''Leaving aside the question of who was right on Iraq -- there were arguments on both sides -- the fact that we didn't simply follow the American position was a very big difference for German policy. We have a mature relationship now, and sometimes a relationship between a father and a son becomes a friendship.'' And, it might be added, sometimes it becomes a rivalry, and sometimes a little of both.

HEADLINE: Driving in Kenya Can Be Hazardous to Your Health

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, April 26 

 BODY:
Why did the chicken cross the road in Kenya? Who knows? But they do so with monotonous regularity, with a squawk, a thud and a flurry of feathers on the windshield, contributing to the country's reputation as one of the most dangerous places to drive in the world.
 Chickens are by no means the most dangerous obstruction found on Kenyan roadways. There are also, to name but a few, donkeys, pushcarts, rickety bicycles loaded to the hilt and barefoot children in full sprint. Put all that together with speeding motor vehicles and the result is a terrifying obstacle course for the uninitiated. 
 In Kenya, fast-moving tractor-trailers surge straight at oncoming cars, forcing them to the shoulder. Minibuses dart back and forth in traffic, with the limbs of passengers jutting out of open windows and doors. Bicyclists cling to any back bumper they can grab for a free ride.
 Not surprisingly, the chaos regularly ends badly. Kenya estimates that it loses about 2,600 people a year to road accidents, a rate of just over 55 deaths per 10,000 motor vehicles, which is alarmingly high for a country with a population of 32 million. By comparison, the United States has a rate of just over 2 deaths per 10,000 motor vehicles. The thousands of Kenyans who are maimed on the roads fill hospital beds that are needed for other patients, officials say, and sap some $76 million from the country's struggling economy.
 Increasingly, however, Kenyans have begun calling for an end to the carnage. Traffic safety is becoming the fad, with public education campaigns urging speeders to let up on the gas and with lawmakers trying to impose a few restrictions.
 Talking on cellphones while driving is now banned in Kenya, although that did not stop one hurried caller from swerving around a pedestrian at full speed the other day.
 Of all the voices urging drivers to slow down, none is more persuasive than that of Mary Mwangangi, the traffic commandant of Kenya's Police Department and one of the most vocal advocates for road safety.
 ''I want to see road safety taken as seriously as AIDS,'' Mrs. Mwangangi said. ''It kills just like AIDS and malaria and tuberculosis. We ought to be talking about road safety just as much and teaching children about it. We ought to be fighting it just like those diseases.''
 Road safety is more than a professional issue for Mrs. Mwangangi. She denounces unsafe roads from a wheelchair. A traffic accident put her there.
 ''I used to talk about road safety but I didn't feel it,'' she said. ''Now my body aches. When you're involved in one, it changes everything. Since my accident, road safety has become the most important issue to me.''
 It was a head-on collision in March 2003 between Mrs. Mwangangi's police vehicle and a speeding truck that opened her eyes. She usually wears a seat belt, she said, a habit she picked up while working for six years at the Kenyan Embassy in Washington. But she did not have it on at the time of impact. Mrs. Mwangangi hit the dashboard hard.
 She broke both legs and both arms in the crash. She now attends regular physical therapy sessions and is slowly healing. She dreams that she will walk again. As for driving, she is not certain she wants to get back behind the wheel.
 ''If I drive again, I'm going to be a very frightened driver,'' she said. ''Even now, when I'm in the car, I keep telling my husband, 'Watch that vehicle! Watch that one!' I have a phobia now.''
 But she also has a passion. She spoke at a recent rally in Uhuru Park here, using her personal story to urge others to slow down and buckle up. ''I would probably have suffered less severe injuries if only I had my seat belt on,'' she said at the event, sponsored by the World Health Organization.
 Although she is still on disability leave, Mrs. Mwangangi said in a recent interview that her mind remained hard at work. She wants money for more radar detectors and Breathalyzers, which are in short supply. She wants Kenyans to understand the meaning of jaywalking. She wants road safety to become as much a part of the educational curriculum as AIDS prevention.
 The task that she and others have taken on is monumental.
 Across Africa, babies still crawl on dashboards and bus drivers accelerate on turns. The roads are still a hodgepodge of divots, holes, ridges and bumps. And those are the portions that are paved with asphalt.
 Kenya's government has begun an overhaul of the road network, about half of which it estimates is in need of urgent attention. Corrupt contractors wasted huge sums in the past. What looked like shiny new roads that would last for decades were really mirages. Potholes appeared at the first rains. Trucks sank into the substandard asphalt. 
 Light-fingered Kenyans have exacerbated the problem by stealing road signs. Wooden ones are used as firewood, metal ones are twisted into grills. ''We need to teach people that stealing the signs is a serious offense,'' Mrs. Mwangangi said.
 The babies on the dashboards and the toddlers with their heads out the windows -- that is what riles Dr. Sidney Nesbitt, a pediatrician who is one of the founders of an organization called Child Road Safety Kenya.
 He has had to convince some colleagues that road safety is as pressing a health concern as diarrhea, malaria and malnutrition. All he had to do was look at some of the emergency cases that come to his office to know he was on the right track.
 ''We've had one child thrown through the windshield,'' he said. ''We had another who fell out the door and the father just drove over him.'' 
 The government of President Mwai Kibaki, who himself was severely injured in a traffic accident during his 2002 campaign, has begun taming the biggest threat to Kenya's roads. John Michuki, the transportation minister, issued a decree requiring the commuter minibuses that operate here -- usually with reckless abandon -- to install seatbelts as well as devices that limit their speed to about 50 miles per hour. 
 ''We're moving in the right direction,'' said Naftali Obiri, 58, a retired bureaucrat who endorses the crackdown on the commuter vans. ''You used to see passengers hanging out the door. Not anymore.''
 He was speaking from Kenyatta National Hospital, where he was nursing wounds that he suffered in a traffic accident.

HEADLINE: The Problem Is, Oil and Water Do Mix

BYLINE: By TOM CLAVIN

 BODY:
THE Town of East Hampton is poised to become the first municipality in New York State to forbid the underground installation of fuel storage tanks for home heating systems. Supporters of the proposal hope the restriction proposed in East Hampton can be implemented elsewhere on Long Island, where an estimated 70,000 such tanks are buried, each one of them a potential threat to the Island's drinking water.
 Legislation now before the Town Board would ban the installation of underground tanks in all future residential construction. In addition, the town would give a homeowner $500 toward the cost of closing up or removing an underground tank. It would be required in new construction that fuel tanks be placed above ground or in basements without floor drains, but unless supporters can persuade the Suffolk County Legislature to amend its law, replacements for underground tanks could still be placed underground.
 A town study estimated that there are 5,000 underground residential fuel tanks in East Hampton, with capacities ranging from 275 to 1,000 gallons. The town estimates that 15 percent to 25 percent of those tanks are leaking oil or will begin to leak in the near future because of cracks in the tanks themselves or problems with the connecting pipes, contaminating soil and eventually threatening the underground aquifers that supply all of Long Island's drinking water. 
 ''The primary concern is the groundwater and drinking water,'' said the town supervisor, William McGintee. ''But another concern is our harbors and other waterways. There are many examples of contaminants getting into the ground that travel and eventually end up in the waterways. We're looking at protecting all our waters.''
 Larry Penny, head of the town's Natural Resources Department, said leaking home heating oil could reach the drinking water supply. Monitoring wells sampling upper levels of groundwater, above the shallow aquifer from which East Hampton residents draw their water, have detected methyl tertiary-butyl ether or MTBE, a gasoline additive that was banned in the state this year after two decades of use. As Mr. Penny explained it, many of the trucks that carry home heating oil are also used to transport gasoline and thus trace amounts of MTBE can be found in the oil. Because the additive is thinner than the No. 2 heating oil, when it is spilled or leaks it leaches through the ground more easily and quickly, sinking down toward the aquifer. Home heating oil is following behind, he said. ''Even if we removed all the leaking fuel tanks next week, we still have a lot of material seeping through,'' Mr. Penny said. ''We'll be dealing with the consequences for years to come, so the sooner the better implementing the legislation.''
 In response to the town study, Robert DeLuca, president of the environmentalist Group for the South Fork in Bridgehampton, created the East Hampton Safe Tanks Program, which developed a list of recommendations that became the basis of the new legislation.
 ''Even if only 15 percent of East Hampton's buried residential fuel tanks are leaking or at immediate risk of failure, there could easily be thousands of gallons of fuel already seeping into the town's vital reserves of drinking water or headed for its precious bays and harbors,'' Mr. DeLuca said. ''And even if none of the town's buried tanks were leaking, the potential environmental consequences posed by unregulated storage of an estimated 1.5 million to 2 million gallons of home heating oil held in thousands of aging tanks throughout the town is a looming environmental and economic threat to the town.''
 East Hampton is far from being the only municipality threatened by leaking underground tanks of home heating oil. ''It's a huge problem for all of Long Island,'' said Adrienne Esposito, executive director of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment in Farmingdale. ''Both counties tackled it to the extent of regulating commercial underground tanks, such as at gas stations, but residential tanks haven't been addressed.''
 The Long Island regional office of the State Department of Environmental Conservation receives reports of more than 2,500 fuel spills a year, and two-thirds of them involve residences. In most cases, the tanks that are leaking were installed during the building boom period on Long Island in the 1950's and 60's. A D.E.C. brochure warns that many of the tanks were not designed for underground use and could fail prematurely. 
 Detecting a leak at an early stage is critical to curbing contamination damage. But Otto Reneberg, director of the office of pollution control of the Suffolk County Health Department, said that a slow but steady leak from an underground tank can go undetected for years, with no apparent smell, soil discoloration or damage to plants growing above the tank. By the time a leak is discovered, he said, there may already have been significant contamination, possibly even of water wells serving the homeowner or the surrounding neighborhood.
 ''Even public water, it's got to come from somewhere,'' Mr. Reneberg said. ''On Long Island, it's drawn from the ground. Some people might say, 'I don't have to worry about this, I'm on public water now,' but even the public water has to originate someplace, and that's in our underground aquifer.''
 East Hampton has fewer underground fuel tanks than most other towns on Long Island, but Mr. McGintee said it is leading the effort to restrict the tanks because the town ''has always been a leader in protecting the environment.''
 ''There had been discussions about underground tanks for years,'' Mr. McGintee said. ''It was an idea whose time had come, in fact long overdue, and I felt and the rest of the Town Board felt, 'let's get on the cutting edge again of environmental legislation.' We want to be a model for other municipalities.''
 The Oil Heat Institute, a fuel oil suppliers' association headquartered in Hauppauge, worked with the town on developing the legislation. 
 ''We want to make it as easy and inexpensive as possible for homeowners to do the right thing for themselves and do the right thing for the environment and remove their tanks,'' said Kevin Rooney, the chief executive of the association, most of whose members also service oil heating systems, including installation or replacement of fuel tanks. ''There is no negative impact on the oil industry. Our job is to fill a tank wherever it is. But for environmental reasons, we prefer the tank be above ground.''
 Tanks for basement use are limited to 330-gallon capacity and are small enough to fit down most basement stairways. From an aesthetic perspective, that's the better move, said Maxine Liao, a Sag Harbor architect who has designed homes in East Hampton. Outdoor installations could spoil the view.
 ''If you put the tank outside, you can make it less obvious by placing it in a small shed, like a pool heater, or obscuring it with bushes,'' Ms. Liao said. ''It's not an issue that should cause a homeowner any concern.''
 Though homeowners elsewhere on Long Island won't have access to the $500 East Hampton incentive, Mr. Rooney said it can still make financial sense to remove an underground fuel tank. Mr. Rooney said the cost of removing an underground tank and putting in a new one above ground or in the basement can vary depending on the size of the tank, its location and its condition, but he said $2,500 was a reasonable estimate.
 It isn't even necessary to remove an underground storage tank. Shutting it down can reduce the cost. After some excavation, a tank can be emptied, filled with sand, slurry or an inert foam, disconnected and then left in place. 
 Compare that to the D.E.C.'s estimate of a $20,000 average cost for cleanup of a heating oil leak. Typically, when a leak is reported, the D.E.C. is brought in to oversee the remediation work. The bills for this work are passed on to the homeowner. Some home insurance policies contain a ''pollution exclusion'' clause that denies coverage of underground fuel leaks, and other companies won't write insurance policies at all for properties with underground tanks. 
 ''We started hearing five years ago that insurance companies weren't comfortable with underground fuel storage tanks,'' said Ted Borsack of the Strong Insurance Agency in East Hampton. ''Now, with the companies we represent, not one will write a new policy that covers an underground storage tank.''
 There are companies, Mr. Borsack said, that will offer insurance coverage, but there are stipulations, such as the underground tank must be less than 20 years old. The consumer usually pays more for such coverage.
 ''An underground tank is a case of out of sight, out of mind,'' Mr. DeLuca said. ''You'll fix the crack in the driveway because it's unsightly and you don't want to get sued if someone trips over it. You'll remove dead trees on your property before they fall down. But many times people don't think of their underground fuel tank until too late and it could cost you 10 times more to clean up the damage.''
 Of course, a tank that is above ground can spring a leak, too. But, said Mr. Reneberg, ''Above ground or in the basement, you can smell it and maybe see a leak. Your senses don't work underground.''
 If the legislation is enacted by East Hampton, Mr. DeLuca would like to take it on the road, working westward and introducing it to town and county governments. Mr. Rooney said the Oil Heat Institute is ready to help.
 ''East Hampton is a leader in the state if not in the nation in this regard,'' he said. ''We think that this program can become a model for every other municipality on Long Island and in the state. This is landmark legislation.''
 A public hearing on the legislation is scheduled for Thursday at 10:30 at East Hampton Town Hall.

HEADLINE: Job Forecasts: Data, Luck And a Pinch of Prophesy

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
COMBINE jobless claims, help-wanted ads and a dash of job availability in a bowl. Stir. Season with aged data. Blend in the current outlook for the economy. Bake. 
 What comes out are the Wall Street forecasts for the report on new payroll jobs created in the previous month. 
 The result is more art than science, and often quite wrong. For March this recipe produced a forecast of 120,000 new jobs. The figure actually reported was 308,000. ''The Street is not very good at forecasting these numbers,'' said James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at J.P. Morgan. David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International, said, ''It is largely a judgment after filtering every shard of data I can find on the jobs front.'' 
 But forecasting is a business, so predictions are made, and they determine how the actual number is received and how the stock and bond markets react. 
 The April jobs report, due Friday, is being awaited with all the trepidation due the arrival of the most important monthly economic statistic: a swing of 100,000 either way would alter market expectations of when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.
 The median forecast of the 63 gathered by Bloomberg News is 168,000, with a high of 250,000. J.P. Morgan's forecast is 250,000. Mr. Resler is at 190,000. 

NO DATA, NO NEWS -- The Federal Open Market Committee is not expected to produce news, in part because Federal Reserve policy makers will not have the April jobs data when they meet on Tuesday.
 The Fed's benchmark interest rate should stay at 1 percent. Analysts do expect a revision in the language on inflation in the F.O.M.C. statement that will be issued at 2:15 p.m. This would not be a surprise because Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said two weeks ago that deflation was no longer a threat.
 It would be news, however, if policy makers tampered with the interest-rate pledge made in the statement after the March meeting. It said policy makers ''can be patient'' in raising rates.
 Among other data due this week are the Institute for Supply Management's indexes for the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy.

BULKED-UP BONDS -- On the municipal bond market's Muscle Beach, California's general obligation bonds are puny, with the worst credit rating among the 50 states. So Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the onetime bodybuilder, has swept these weaklings aside.
 When the state goes to the public this week to raise $7.9 billion to balance the state's budget, California will be selling enhanced-performance bonds. And they are appealing enough that some money managers are taking a second look.
 ''I like this deal better than I like the state,'' said George Strickland of Thornburg Investment Management, who has shunned California's flabby general obligation bonds for two years.
 These bonds look better because of the injection of a quarter-cent of state sales tax. The bond referendum passed earlier this year dedicated that much to paying off the bonds' principal and interest. 
 The $7.9 billion sale, along with an additional $4.4 billion block to be sold between the end of May and mid-June, are needed to cover the state's $8.6 billion budget deficit and to avoid what the governor called ''Armageddon cuts'' in state services.

HEADLINE: A Sour Note

BYLINE: By JEREMY PEARCE

 BODY:
FOR the last week, barely a sound has been coming from the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra.
 Although bristling with 30 antique string instruments -- including rare Italian violins by Stradivarius, Guarneri del Gesu and other master makers -- the orchestra's administrators were sending a muted message about their recent multimillion-dollar purchase from Herbert R. Axelrod, who has been indicted on federal charges of tax evasion and fled to Havana.
 Lawrence J. Tamburri, the former executive director and a past trustee of the orchestra -- who was the principle broker of the deal -- declined to comment on the controversy. Dr. Victor Parsonnet, chairman of the orchestra's board, had this to say, ''We had appraisers of our own that said one way or another that we were getting good value.''
 Retreat may be an understandable response, given the status of Mr. Axelrod, the orchestra's benefactor and a storyteller of bravura scale, who is himself now an international fugitive from justice. Mr. Axelrod, a millionaire publisher of pet books and violin collector, sold his instruments to the orchestra for $18 million last year. The deal was consummated only after a fitful courtship in which the entrepreneur boasted that rival European symphonies were waiting in the wings to as much as $50 million. 
 More than a week ago, when federal authorities indicted him on charges of tax evasion, the 76-year-old Mr. Axelrod fled from his multimillion-dollar home in Deal, on the Jersey Shore, to the mobile refuge of a yacht moored at the Marina Hemingway in Havana, where he said he planned to spend his newfound retirement deep-sea fishing and composing fresh tunes rather than face the possibility of five years in prison and fines of $250,000.
 ''It is difficult to represent someone in absentia,'' conceded Michael B. Himmel, a lawyer from Woodbridge who is defending Mr. Axelrod in the tax case. Mr. Himmel added that he had not heard from the pet publisher since April 21, when a federal judge in Trenton issued a warrant for his client's arrest.
 But the grander question of the moment was to measure what, if any, aftershock from Mr. Axelrod's public implosion would reach the striving New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. Just last year, the orchestra began a five-year fund-raising campaign with the intention of attracting $51.2 million for its endowments as well as to pay off the $18 million borrowed to acquire the Axelrod collection.
 In recent years, the shaky economy has proved especially difficult for the arts, and the symphony accrued a budget deficit of $2 million during the last fiscal year. A spokesman for the orchestra credited the arrival of the new instruments and the appointment of a renowned conductor, Neeme Jarvi, with a boon of $11 million in donations in the past year.
 Still, things are not so simple. Since Mr. Axelrod's disappearance, symphony officials have rushed forward to declare the authenticity of the instruments. Yet they have been willing to say little more, leaving open-ended whether the institution's reputation will suffer embarrassment or something worse by association with their fugitive donor.
 In the wider world of the arts, news of the symphony's situation brought mixed reactions, shaded perhaps by the performers' traditional conviction that publicity of any stripe results in larger audiences.
 Lawrence Goldman, president and chief executive of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which is home to the symphony, said: ''I think this is actually going to help future fund-raising. Acquiring these instruments was a long-range decision.''
 Preferring to look toward the horizon, Mr. Goldman added: ''When all the dust clears, this is all about 30 golden-age instruments. Ten years from now, 50 years from now, that's all anybody is going to care about.''
 But Ann Marie Miller, executive director of Artpride New Jersey, a Bordentown advocacy group that lobbies for arts financing, sounded more circumspect, even as she said the symphony was not likely to suffer harm in the longer term.
 ''If anything, this sends a signal to the arts community at large to be careful,'' said Ms. Miller, who has worked as a fund-raiser for the McCarter Theater in Princeton. ''It is a forewarning and a caution to the rest of the nonprofit world. All donations carry some level of risk, and everyone in our world is accountable, even the trustees, who are accountable to the greater audience.''
 Dr. Parsonnet has previously hinted that the actual value of the collection might lie closer to $25 million, or about half of what Mr. Axelrod claimed the instruments were worth. For now, the orchestra has insured the instruments for $48.9 million, which is what Mr. Axelrod had them insured for with Lloyd's of London.
 ''My sense is that a price of $50 million is way out of bounds,'' said Claire Givens, a violin dealer in Minneapolis who was attending an instrument auction in New York last week. ''Otherwise, the seller wouldn't have settled for $18 million.''
 Yet one trustee did step forward to deny that any collusion took place that would have heightened the collection's value for Mr. Axelrod's tax benefit. Scott A. Kobler, a Newark lawyer and trustee who helped represent the symphony during the sale, cited the institution's ''scrutiny and due diligence.''
 ''We were completely and categorically not in complicity with Dr. Axelrod,'' said Mr. Kobler, a former chairman of the New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority. ''We never agreed with Dr. Axelrod about his valuation of the instruments, but he did provide an appraisal of an internationally recognized person.''
 As he explained, ''the symphony has no knowledge if Dr. Axelrod ever took a tax deduction for those instruments. In fact, we never gave him a receipt.''
 One symphony official who declined to be identified said the collection had been examined by three experts in the course of negotiations, but that an actual appraisal had not been conducted. The official added that Mr. Axelrod's past appraisals were reviewed, although not accepted as accurate. Still, it was decided that the costs of commissioning a fresh appraisal -- a percentage of the valuation of all the instruments -- would been prohibitive. In a characteristic flight of fancy, Mr. Axelrod himself suggested that the collection could soar in value to $100 million over the next decade.
 But in the end, the orchestra will be paying somewhat less than the decided price. It borrowed $9 million from Commerce Bank, another $5 million from the Prudential Foundation and the remaining $4 million from Mr. Axelrod, who, before fleeing, forgave $1 million and assigned $3 million in notes to several nonprofit groups, in effect making a donation as he departed the country. That left the final price at $17 million.
 Gabriella Morris, president of the Prudential Foundation and a symphony trustee, said that she had seen the instruments' valuations and was fully satisfied with the deal.
 ''There was no complicity here,'' she said, echoing Mr. Kobler's phrase.
 She paused before continuing: ''As far as we're concerned, we don't really care what they're worth, above the $18 million. Our process was a credible one, and the values were supported. Appraisal by media is not credible.''
 Not accountable at the moment is Mr. Axelrod, who holds a doctoral degree in education from New York University and prefers the honorific doctor. In his 50-year ascent in the publishing world, Mr. Axelrod, a native of Bayonne, crested the wave of post-war American pet mania, writing such guides as ''Dr. Axelrod's Atlas of Freshwater and Aquarium Fishes'' and creating T.F.H. Publications, which stands for ''tropical fish hobbyist.'' His carefully tended biography details him as an inventor, explorer, scientist, musician, environmentalist, bon vivant and a once-favored companion of such notables as Emperor Hirohito and Winston Churchill.
 But the facts were often at variance with Mr. Axelrod's claims, according to an article in The Sunday Star-Ledger last week. Although he earned his doctorate in education from N.Y.U., he regularly told people that he had earned a Ph.D. in medicine. Moreover, charges of plagiarism have followed some of his books, and through the years Mr. Axelrod has been accused of unscrupulous business practices. The latest charges, detailed in the federal indictment, include accusations that he employed a Swiss bank account to hide hundreds of thousands of dollars in income.
 Though he accumulated his share of detractors, Mr. Axelrod also won over many, using part of his wealth for philanthropic purposes. For instance, he donated a collection of fish fossils to the University of Guelph, in Canada, although a former university official now says that he exaggerated their value of $24 million.
 In 1997, he donated a quartet of string instruments -- two violins, a cello and a viola, all made by the great Stradivarius -- to the Smithsonian. At the time, the quartet was valued at about $50 million, a figure that has not been questioned. In New Jersey, he has also given to hospitals and community centers as well as the orchestra.
 It was the Axelrod collection of instruments that has been credited with helping lure Mr. Jarvi, the Estonian musician who was previously maestro at the Detroit Symphony, to Newark. Mr. Jarvi announced his appointment as music director designate in October, and cited his excitement at the prospect of deploying New Jersey's new array of instruments.
 Jill Woodward, a spokeswoman for the Detroit Symphony, said it was rare for any American orchestra to own a quartet of string instruments, much less 30 period instruments that include 24 violins, 4 cellos and 2 violas made by some of Italy's pre-eminent makers of the 17th and 18th centuries. It is estimated that fewer than 7,000 Italian instruments of such pedigree exist in the world.
 ''It would be unusual to ever see New Jersey's situation again,'' Ms. Woodward said. ''The donor would have to be Bill Gates.''
 Time and court proceedings should tell if Mr. Axelrod's legacy is ultimately remembered as the Axelrod collection. Some of the instruments are scheduled to be played today, in Plainsboro as part of a children's concert called ''Carnival of the Animals,'' composed by Saint-Saens. Still, it is almost certain that the family name will continue to pop up in headlines and at other venues.
 In Ocean Township, at the Ruth Hyman Jewish Community Center, builders are nearing completion of a 600-seat concert hall. Jess Levy, executive director of the center, said that Mr. Axelrod and his wife, Evelyn Miller Axelrod, had both given ''generously'' toward the construction, although he declined to say how much. The whereabouts of Mrs. Axelrod are unknown, according to lawyers.
 ''I will say,'' Mr. Levy said, ''that the concert hall will bear their name.''

HEADLINE: Even the Dollar's Rise Can't Keep Foreign Stocks Down

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
THE dollar was supposed to have fallen flat on its face by now. It hasn't. In fact, confounding most currency experts, the dollar has rallied. But most investors would probably fare a lot better this year by betting on foreign stocks than on the faltering American stock market. 
 In most instances, foreign stocks have outpaced domestic ones enough to compensate for the dollar's rally. And many analysts expect the dollar to stumble later this year, again making it a plus for Americans investing abroad. 
 Morgan Stanley Capital International's All Country Sectors stock index is up 1.5 percent in dollars this year through Thursday, excluding the United States. In local currencies, the index gained 4.8 percent. Although the climb of the dollar against most currencies sliced that gain by more than half, the foreign performance easily beat the 0.1 percent dip in MSCI's index of American stocks.
 The dollar didn't outpace foreign currencies across the board. In some emerging markets, it fell, giving Americans a little extra octane in the value of their stock investments there. 
 In South Korea, for example, the dollar has dropped 1.7 percent against the won, converting a 9.8 percent gain in the Korean market into a 11.7 percent increase in dollar terms.
 Over all, emerging markets rose 2 percent in local currency and slipped only to a 1.6 percent increase in dollar terms.
 But Americans investing in countries using the euro were punished by the dollar. Markets in these countries gained 3.3 percent in euros; that translated into a loss of 2.2 percent in dollars, through Thursday. 
 All prognostications about the dollar should be taken with a dose of skepticism, because some studies have found that such predictions are not much more accurate than flipping a coin. Certainly, forecasts that the dollar would fall as much as 11 percent against the euro this year and 5 percent against the Japanese yen have been well off the mark. For the year to date, the dollar is up 5.3 percent against the euro and 2.2 percent against the yen. Still, it is likely that the dollar will resume its decline before the end of the year, according to many foreign-exchange analysts.
 One reason is that the United States' huge current-account deficit, which measures the country's balance of trade in goods and services with the rest of the world, should limit dollar gains and eventually drag the currency down. And history shows that while the dollar has rallied on expectations of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, it has fallen in the months after the rate increases actually began.
 ''I don't think it will last,'' Rebecca Patterson, global currency strategist at J.P. Morgan, said of the dollar's rally. She added that Fed rate increases, which could come as early as June, would be a damper on the stock market, curbing the flow of investments from abroad that have supported the dollar.
 Underlying the strength of foreign stock markets is a rally in smaller-company stocks, which have done well in the United States but even better abroad.
 The Standard & Poor's/Citigroup Extended Market Index of smaller-company stocks in Europe and the Pacific is up 10.3 percent in local currencies and 6.8 percent in dollar terms through Thursday, compared with a 1.6 percent rise in the smaller-company index for the United States. The S.&P. index for Europe and the Pacific for larger-company stocks is up only 5.2 percent in local currencies and 1.9 percent in dollar terms. 
 Matthew Dobbs, the portfolio manager of the Vanguard International Explorer fund, which had a 2004 return of 7.8 percent through Thursday, said that the valuation advantage of smaller-company stocks compared with larger companies was disappearing. But he argued that there was still plenty of room for good stock selection from countries like Ireland, Greece and Finland, especially given the lack of deep research on many smaller companies.
 Mr. Dobbs says he suspects that the dollar rally this year will last longer than other rebounds during the currency's steep slide over the last 28 months. 
 ''I think we are less inclined to see this rally of the dollar as one that will collapse,'' he said. 
 Although Mr. Dobbs's fund can hedge against a rise in the dollar to protect returns, he said, ''We don't tend to hedge unless we have a very strong view on the dollar and we don't have that now.''
 So if the dollar begins to slip again, it will make investors who stood by their foreign portfolios look even smarter.

HEADLINE: Tenants and Building Security

 BODY:

Q. Some landlords are beginning to tell current tenants that they must submit to invasive security requirements to get a key card to enter their own buildings. Fliers posted all around my building are intimidating residents into supplying copies of their driver's license, electric bill and phone bill, having their photo taken and filling out a questionnaire. No current tenants in my building ever consented to such practices as part of their lease agreements. What information can the landlord require from someone who is already a tenant? . . . Seth Kaplan, Brooklyn.

A. ''I cannot find any specific law or case law governing this circumstance,'' said Luise Barrack, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.
 But, Ms. Barrack said, in the aftermath of 9/11, many building owners have added tougher security measures. 
 ''Although tenants and their guests may not welcome these measures, they have been accepted as a necessary evil along with other intrusions into people's personal space and privacy,'' Ms. Barrack said. ''Therefore, I do not believe that it is inappropriate for a landlord to request information of their tenants to increase security in a particular building.'' 
 She pointed out, however, that since the rights and obligations of rent-stabilized tenants are set forth in the tenant's lease, an argument could be made that such tenants do not have to provide any documentation beyond what was required at the inception of the tenancy or by the lease. 
 Moreover, she said, if the landlord's requests appear to be intended only to harass the tenant or are unduly burdensome, a tenant might be able to make a case that the requests are unreasonable. For example, she said, while requiring a tenant to provide a photo identification might be reasonable, requiring production of a telephone bill might not.
 In any event, Ms. Barrack said, any dispute that arose out of a tenant's refusal to provide documentation requested by a landlord would ultimately have to be resolved by either the courts or the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the state agency that administers the rent laws.

The Sale Price Of a Co-op

Q. Last week, you advised how to find the recent sale price of a house. How can one determine the sale price of a co-op in New York City? . . . John Lynch, Manhattan.

A. The sale of a co-op apartment involves the transfer of shares in the co-op organization rather than the transfer of real property, and the transfer of those shares is a private matter between the parties and the co-op organization, said Stanley R. Simon, a Manhattan co-op lawyer.
 ''As a result, there is no public document filed or recorded memorializing the transfer,'' Mr. Simon said. 
 (With transfers of real property, the deed is filed in the public record and the amount of tax indicated on the deed can be used to calculate the amount of the sale. The tax in New York State is $2 per $500 of consideration paid. So if the tax was $2,000, the sale price was $500,000.) 
 Mr. Simon said that when shares to a co-op are sold or transferred, transfer tax forms must be filed with New York State. For New York City co-ops, a New York City transfer tax form must also be filed.
 ''And while the taxes paid with these forms are based on the sales price,'' he said, ''the transfer tax forms themselves are not part of the public record, and not available for public scrutiny.''

HEADLINE: Calculating The Politics Of Catastrophe

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT is the nightmarish, unpredictable event that both the Bush and Kerry campaigns obsess about in private, yet rarely discuss in public. How would another terror attack before the presidential election, even one that proves a pale shadow of Sept. 11, affect the way voters view the president or his challenger?
 It is an unanswerable question, of course, which naturally makes it ripe for endless Washington dinner-party talk. It is probably too speculative for serious polling. Yet that does not mean the planning has not started. Mr. Bush has begun to talk about the possibility in public, perhaps to brace the country for the worst, perhaps to begin the political inoculation if domestic defenses fail. 
 Asked at a newspaper editors' convention here 10 days ago about surveys showing that two-thirds of Americans believe terror will strike the United States in the near future, he said: ''Well, I can understand why they think they're going to get hit again. They saw what happened in Madrid.'' And on Thursday, emerging from his interview with the 9/11 commission, he was asked whether he could now assure Americans that no Al Qaeda members were plotting in the United States. 
 ''No, I can't say that,'' he responded tersely. His national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, talks of ''chatter'' about a strike against America, perhaps around the political conventions this summer, that terrorists hope would influence the election. 
 This public discussion about a possible terror strike, large or small, has become far more than just another yellow alert for the nation to be on its toes at shopping malls, airports and train stations. It has quietly become part of the election-year landscape, put alongside strategists' calculations about how the unemployment rate, or the Dow, or Iraq might affect a close election. 
 It has also led to a kind of macabre game theory, in which security experts and political operatives -- two classes of people who typically do not interact much in Washington -- are calculating what the political fallout of an attack might be. The answers depend on what kind of attack, and when it happens. But if thinking about the less-than-unthinkable was an undercurrent before the Madrid bombings, it has become a subject of intense strategizing ever since. 
 ''The message the terrorists learned in Madrid is that attacks can change elections and change policy,'' a senior administration official said, talking about the new Spanish government's decision to pull its troops out of Iraq -- exactly the goal some believe the train bombers had in mind. ''It's a very dangerous precedent to have out there.''
 Americans have rarely, if ever, seen a political dynamic quite like this one. Pearl Harbor spread fear around the country -- with patrols along the West Coast looking for Japanese invaders -- but by the time the 1944 election came along, the enemy was on the run in the Pacific. The cold war took on its own grim political calculus, down to Lyndon Johnson's girl-with-a-daisy ad in his campaign against Barry Goldwater. But cold war political chess included an enemy that could be targeted for nuclear retaliation, the missing factor in the age of terror. That is why Mr. Bush has made pre-emption -- taking the war to the enemy before he can strike -- not only a cornerstone of national security policy, but of his re-election campaign.
 Now the possibility of an election-year strike has become part of the political anthropology of Washington. Perhaps that is the inevitable result in a city where disaster planning is a growth industry, and where the newest bureaucratic behemoth is the Department of Homeland Security, with its war room command center tucked into a quiet residential neighborhood in northwest Washington, away from the presumed blast zone of the White House and the Mall.
 There is no sign out front, and minivans with children speed past the gate on their way to the baseball field nearby. But almost everyone who travels in the political and security worlds here knows where it is, as surely as they know that if motorcades full of officials head for the department's command post, the effect on the election is anyone's guess.
 Mr. Bush's political aides -- speaking only on background, because no one dissects terror on the record -- argue that the crazier the world gets, the more it plays to the theme of the campaign: Now more than ever, the country needs a president who has proved to be strong on terror. A worsening scene in Iraq, they believe, plays into the same instinct. Perhaps that is pre-disaster spin, but many Democrats say privately that they agree with that theory.
 So far, the signs are contradictory. Mr. Bush's approval rating seemed to improve a bit even as casualties in Iraq worsened in April. But then a New York Times/CBS News poll, released last week, suggested that Mr. Bush was finally paying a price among voters who wonder if he has a workable Iraq strategy. They gave him higher marks on fighting terror. But a strike at home could change the numbers instantly. 
 ''People now realize there might be an Al Qaeda election-year strategy,'' said Richard Norton Smith, a historian who has studied how war affected the re-elections of Lincoln in 1864 and Roosevelt in 1944. ''Even terrorists take into account the calendar.'' 
 So the timing of any future attack is now the subject of hallway conversations in the Pentagon and the West Wing and at diplomatic dinner parties, where current and former officials mingle. A highly unscientific survey of those conversations revealed a few common strands of logic among Bush and Kerry advisers. Few doubt that an attack would bring the country together behind the president, just as it did after 9/11.
 But the effect may be a lot shorter-lived this time, many speculate, because the shock value would be gone, and because this time American defenses are supposed to be up. So within a month or so, the thinking goes, horror could give way to analysis about whether the billions spent on security were well spent -- and if Mr. Bush focused on the right threats. It was one thing not to understand the pre-9/11 warnings. It would be another to misunderstand them now.
 Unpreventable attacks, the theory goes, could have limited political effect. Suicide bombings in a mall or on a train, Madrid style, could fall in this category. But a more spectacular attack that voters viewed as exploiting a vulnerability that Washington said it was fixing -- say, an explosive device aboard a freighter headed into San Francisco Bay, or a dirty bomb that evades nuclear detectors in New York or Washington -- could prompt immediate calls for investigations about whether the administration did too little too late as it focused on Iraq. 
 ONE reason the administration is so obsessed with security for the conventions is that those gatherings attract large concentrations of the American elite in two major cities. But they also may be sufficiently far ahead of the election to allow time for the predictable finger-pointing. Terrorists, some believe, might try to undertake an attack that could be credibly portrayed as a result of the Iraq war, rather than as a 9/11 replay. That could make it Exhibit A in the anti-Bush argument that Iraq has made us more vulnerable.
 But at least one senior adviser to Mr. Kerry fears the reverse: that Al Qaeda wants Mr. Bush re-elected because he is ''the best poster they have for further recruitment.''
 In the end, the impact of terrorism is impossible to know. Mr. Kerry's aides may be mindful of the lesson learned by another senator from Massachusetts, in his bruising first months as president.
 John F. Kennedy despaired after the Bay of Pigs fiasco, convinced that the failed mission to oust Fidel Castro made him look weak against a Communist threat right off America's shores. Then his poll numbers soared.
 ''It's just like Ike,'' he exclaimed, says an account in Richard Reeves's book, ''President Kennedy: Profile of Power.'' ''The worse you do, the better they like you.''

HEADLINE: Googling Google

 BODY:
It wasn't a mistake. That newspaper you received Friday reporting that two young Stanford graduates have decided to become instant billionaires by taking their Internet company public was not some reprint from the late 90's.
 It sure read like one, though, including the pledge by Google's founders -- Sergey Brin and Larry Page -- that their one-of-a-kind company with the ''Don't Be Evil'' motto will remain committed to making the world a better place. Such idealistic talk out of Silicon Valley, so seemingly empowering back in 1999, seems embarrassingly naive now that the party's ended, at least for the rest of us. 
 Google has created the most popular Internet search engine, one so dominant that a verb made from its name has become a part of the lexicon. Thanks mainly to its advertising revenue, the privately held company is quite profitable -- in stark contrast to many of the ill-fated dot-coms that rushed to go public during the bubble. 
 Many of those companies did so to raise operating capital, but not Google. It has plenty of money in the bank. Indeed, judging by its Securities and Exchange Commission filing announcing the intention to go public, Google is not relishing the transition to a publicly traded company, which will force it to disclose far more financial and operational detail. 
 The sole reason for this initial public offering is to let employees and investors cash in -- one of the venture capital firms that backed the company early on will see its $13 million investment turn to billions. It's hard to begrudge Google insiders their rewards for building an admired Internet blue chip comparable to Amazon or eBay, but investors should not be carried away by their nostalgia for the halcyon bubble days. Nor should they pay too much attention to all the hype about Google's auction-like I.P.O., which will make it easier for investors to ''get in'' as if it were a sure thing.
 Google will have a frothy market capitalization, perhaps in excess of $25 billion, once it goes public. It could still continue to grow and thrive from there, and a speculative bet to that effect might pay off handsomely. But it might not. The Google story, of a powerful Web gatekeeper whose business model is predicated on its ability to sift others' content for you, is a reminder of how a slim technological advantage can reap enormous dividends in the new economy. But slim technological leads can be lost -- just look at Netscape's current market share -- with devastating results. And plenty of other online behemoths, from Yahoo to Microsoft, will be challenging Google's dominant search engine.
 It will be interesting in a few years to google Google to see how the story will have unfolded.

HEADLINE: Waterfront Project Hinges on Asphalt Plant

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN 

 BODY:
WHEN developers working to rehabilitate an old industrial section of this village acquired a neighboring waterfront parcel occupied by an asphalt plant, it was considered a major coup. Ultimately the project will give the village new offices, a new public works garage and a new recreational center, making a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to remake a large swath of Hudson River waterfront near the border with Sleepy Hollow, as well as significant parts of the village.
 ''We were able to acquire the entire property, which we never expected,'' said Joseph Cotter, president of Ferry Landings, a development project by National Resources of Greenwich, Conn. 
 But the developer's attempts to relocate the county asphalt plant to a site about 400 feet from where it sits is quickly becoming a problem for the project, which calls for 88 town houses, a new village hall, the new public works garage, a recreation complex including an aquatic center as well about 150,000 square feet of office and retail space. 
 At a meeting Tuesday night, Tarrytown residents lined up to question the planning board's handling of the asphalt plant move, while complaining about an overall lack of information regarding the project and calling for further study. 
 ''What was discussed tonight sounds like a possible improvement, but I'd like to make that judgment when I see the final design,'' said Cherie A. Gaines, a Tarrytown resident who also expressed concerns about the density of the project.
 The Tarrytown development is one of several in various stages of planning along the Hudson River waterfront from Yonkers to Peekskill. For much of the last century, a great deal of waterfront land was used for industry, and the municipalities that are now able to plan developments there have encountered various challenges like density and size, environmental concerns, aesthetics, green space and access to the river. 
 The Tarrytown meeting came just days after neighboring Sleepy Hollow filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court in White Plains seeking to overturn Tarrytown's decision to forgo a full-scale review of the move under the State Environmental Quality Review Act and challenging zoning changes and site plan approvals related to the Ferry Landings project.
 ''The village is not necessarily opposed substantively to what the Village of Tarrytown is doing,'' said Joel H. Sachs, a lawyer with Keene & Beane who is representing Sleepy Hollow. ''But their concerns are that there are procedures under state law that require that all the environmental and land use impact of development proposals be given a hard look under the environmental review law SEQRA.'' 
 That law, the State Environmental Quality Review Act, requires state or municipal agencies weighing projects to consider the environmental impacts against social and economic factors. If a project is deemed to have no significant impact, the agency can make a ruling called a ''negative declaration'' and forgo producing a full environmental impact statement.
 Mr. Sachs said Tarrytown has been going about the process using what he calls the ''salami approach,'' slicing off bits of the projects and granting approvals without an overall environmental assessment of the project.
 Tarrytown officials responded that a draft environmental impact statement for the Ferry Landing project is in the works, but that a full environmental review on moving the asphalt company was not necessary because the plant already exists, and because village officials had determined that no negative impact would be created by moving it. 
 ''The people contesting us are treating this as if it is a new plant,'' said Dr. Stanley L. Friedlander, chairman of the planning board. ''The asphalt plant exists, the environment it produces exists, and the question is, does moving it 400 feet have a negative impact.''
 Mr. Friedlander said that upgrades related to the move will make the plant more environmentally friendly. He also noted that officials are pressing to move the project ahead quickly because federal officials have found the current village hall unsuitable for use, so there is pressure to get the new village hall under construction.
 ''It's second best but we really think it's an improvement to the existing conditions,'' Mr. Cotter said at the meeting. In an ideal world, he said, the asphalt plant would find a home outside the new development. At this point, such a move does not seem likely because the plant has a 99-year lease to operate and has said it would remain in the current area.
 But residents said they feared the village has not done its homework and has failed to look at issues like the impact on neighborhoods that will be closer to the plant, owned by Peckham Industries, after the move and the possibility that it might increase production once it had been upgraded.
 Ray Touey lives on Storm Avenue, which will be even closer to the plant after the move. He spoke up Tuesday night, saying he had been watching the meeting on television and became so concerned he got in his car and drove to the meeting to address the planning board.
 Mr. Touey told the board that he was concerned that emissions from the plant could adversely affect his 10-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn, who has asthma. He said that from what he had heard there was no adequate evidence to assure him that would not be the case.
 ''All I keep hearing is 'I think, I think,''' he said.
 Ultimately, the planning commission postponed voting on whether to approve the asphalt plant relocation for a month to give Mr. Touey and other residents an opportunity to review the environmental information compiled on the plant. Mr. Friedlander encouraged residents who had health and safety concerns to present them to the appropriate agencies.
 As the audience continued to press the board about details of the project, Mr. Friedlander suggested that they might be better served if they were to begin attending Sleepy Hollow meetings regarding development on the old site of the General Motors plant where more than 1,500 units of housing are being proposed.
 ''If all of us are so concerned about Tarrytown we should all be at the Sleepy Hollow meetings,'' he said.
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Cotter suggested that Sleepy Hollow was using the lawsuit to try to delay the Tarrytown project to give its own a leg up. He called the suit disingenuous, saying Sleepy Hollow had agreed not to file a suit immediately, after Tarrytown agreed that the window for filing an action could be extended.
 ''It's gravely disappointing and we think very much in bad faith,'' Mr. Cotter said.
 Mayor Philip Zegarelli of Sleepy Hollow noted that the negative declaration made by Tarrytown could be challenged only for 30 days. Despite the offer of an extension, he said, there were concerns that the agreement did not provide adequate protections for the village, which has a new development -- Ichabod's Landing -- near where the plant would be moved. He also expressed concerns that Tarrytown, in moving so quickly with approvals, was trying to get ahead of Sleepy Hollow.
 Beyond that, however, he said that the revitalization along the Hudson, an opportunity that comes along only about once every 100 years, warrants extreme caution and care.
 ''We're at a crossroads now and in looking at the asphalt plant every effort should be made to see about eliminating it,'' he said.
 For groups like Scenic Hudson, which is working with communities in an attempt to create well-thought out developments, the escalating ill will between the communities is cause for concern.
 ''I think both Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to shape a highly visible and crucial portion of Westchester County on the waterfront,'' said Ned Sullivan, the executive director of Scenic Hudson.
 Between the two communities he said there are roughly 130 acres including a 1.8-mile stretch of waterfront. But in an area already choked with traffic, the challenge is to use the land wisely and with full understanding of the future impact.
 ''If the two mayors could be working collaboratively and trying to address these proactively,'' Mr. Sullivan said, ''we would end up with two or three waterfront projects that work well together, that minimally impact traffic and insure public access along the water.''

HEADLINE: Agency Plans to Reap Wind Power Off Jones Beach

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Imagine a modern windmill, sleek and metallic.
 Make it giant-sized -- specifically 425 feet tall, equal to a 40-story building and taller than the Statue of Liberty.
 Now picture 35 to 40 such windmills, all standing in the Atlantic Ocean, clustered near Jones Beach.
 The Long Island Power Authority says it will soon start turning that imaginary scene into reality, to harvest electricity from the steady sea breezes that have drawn people, from the ancient Indians to modern suburbanites, to the shoreline.
 The authority says that in the coming weeks it will announce its choice of the company to build and operate the windmills. Officials will not identify the bidders, but industry sources say the two leading contenders are Arcadia Windpower Ltd., based in Manhattan, and FPL Energy, based in Florida. The project could produce the first offshore windmills outside of Europe, wind power experts say. While land-based windmills are increasingly common around the world, offshore sites are relatively new. 
 A larger proposal for 130 offshore windmills is pending on Cape Cod, but residents have mounted a $1 million campaign to block it, citing economic, environmental and scenic concerns. Some Long Islanders have raised similar objections, but so far there is little organized opposition.
 The Long Island project would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take up to four years, authority officials say. The exact price and other details will be announced later. ''At a time when oil prices are going through the roof, this makes imminent sense,'' said the agency's chairman, Richard M. Kessel.
 Those rising prices forced the authority to impose fuel surcharges on electricity customers. Growing demand for power is also forcing the purchase of new generators and supply cables, so the authority is facing greater expense and more disputes over sites. And Gov. George E. Pataki is requiring the use of more clean energy, though it costs more than power from fossil fuels in the current market.
 The windmills would represent only about 2 percent of the authority's total power use, and so would have a minimal impact on electricity bills. 
 Many environmentalists, including some who criticize the authority on other issues, have long advocated windmills. ''Windmills are a necessity, not only for Long Island, but for the state and nation,'' said Adrienne Esposito, executive director of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, one of several groups endorsing the project.
 Windmills use a limitless resource without harming the environment, supporters say. Wind energy also reduces dependence on Middle East oil with its gyrating prices and volatile politics. ''The fuel is free from Mother Nature, and the cost is predictable,'' said Gordian Raacke, executive director of two energy groups, the Citizens Advisory Panel and Renewable Energy Long Island. 
 Still, the plan poses a host of concerns. Skeptics cite noise and vibration, dangers to migrating birds, disruption of prime squid fishing, and intrusive underwater cables and power connections on land.
 Most of all, critics have focused on the permanent alteration of the ocean view from the South Shore.
 But authority officials said the impact would be minimal on birds, fish and even the view. Because the windmills would be 2.5 to 6 miles from shore, they would appear small on the horizon, proponents contend.
 While the precise location has not been decided, the windmills would be somewhere off the coast of Jones Beach and possibly Long Beach or the western end of Fire Island.
 Jones Beach is jammed on hot summer weekends. Long Beach and neighboring communities are the most densely populated stretches of oceanfront in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. Fire Island has a major park and summer resort.
 ''Why Jones Beach rather than anywhere else on the South Shore?'' said Joseph M. Kralovich, president of the Old Lindenmere Civic Association in Merrick. ''It's a sore subject, but the answer is obvious. It's to avoid people with expensive waterfront homes. Nobody lives there.'' He opposes the windmill plan. ''I moved here from the city because of Jones Beach, to get closer.''
 Another critic, Cathy McGrory Powell of Wantagh, said: ''Jones Beach is a big tourist center. It's going to be horrible. Why, instead, isn't every government building using solar energy and every official driving a more fuel-efficient car?''
 The power authority says it chose the site because the water is shallow, the winds average about 19 miles an hour, and an existing substation in nearby Massapequa would connect to the windmills, serving densely developed Nassau and western Suffolk.
 Windmill defenders call the view a minor issue. ''We have to make a choice: whether we want to look at smokestacks or windmills,'' said Mr. Raacke, of Renewable Energy Long Island. ''It's worth paying that small price.'' He said he had found no opposition to offshore windmills in Europe, adding, ''People are quite proud of them, actually.''
 Ms. Esposito, of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, said windmills would become a tourist attraction, as they have elsewhere. ''If acid rain and smog keep up, we're not going to have a view, anyway.''
 Last month, Hofstra University, whose campus displays a miniature windmill in tribute to Nassau County's Dutch heritage, held a conference titled ''From Blackouts to Windmills.'' Richard V. Guardino Jr., dean of suburban studies and a resident of Point Lookout, near Jones Beach, said, ''Personally, I like the way windmills look, and I think they would add something.''
 As a sun worshiper, the authority's chairman, Mr. Kessel, said: ''No one loves Jones Beach or goes there more often than I do. A passing tanker ship is going to be a lot more visible than these windmills that you can barely see. It'll be a comforting sight, dedicated to a cleaner environment for Long Island.''
 Some fishing companies, though, are opposed. ''Some of our largest catches are right there in the area they're talking about,'' said Sima Freierman, general manager of Montauk Inlet Seafood, which unloads, packs and transports fish. ''There's enough places on land where they can do this.''
 Ms. Freierman said more than two million pounds of squid were netted by trawlers from New York in the planned windmill site each summer, as well as catches by boats from other states. The site also yields millions of pounds of bluefish, butterfish, flounder, fluke, monk and whiting. For boats, ''putting windmills there is like putting concrete poles in the middle of the Long Island Expressway,'' she said.
 But proponents of windmills say they will use only about five square miles, a small part of the fishing grounds. Windmills could act as an artificial reef and a preserve that would help replenish fish stocks, said Prof. Malcolm J. Bowman of the marine science center at Stony Brook University. Many recreational fishers are keen on the windmills, which they say will attract fish. 
 Before the windmills are built, more public hearings will be held, and 18 official approvals are required from various state and federal agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, which will require blinking warning lights.
 Each steel tower will rise 425 feet from the ocean surface to the top of the arc swept by the three rotating resin blades. Depending on the location, 40 to 70 feet of the tower will be underwater. The base will go an additional 60 to 80 feet underground into the seabed. The towers will be 15 to 30 feet thick at water level and placed a third of a mile to half a mile apart, according to the authority's project manager, Daniel Zaweski. The blades will rotate 8 to 20 times a minute, swiveling and tilting to catch the wind, and generate 3.6 megawatts of power. The entire group will generate 100 to 140 megawatts, enough for 30,000 homes. 
 The critics' biggest fear seems to be that if the windmills succeed, more will go up. ''If this works, they're talking about stringing this along the entire South Shore, putting us out of business,'' Ms. Freierman said.
 Mr. Kralovich expressed a similar fear: ''Once they put this in, wind farms are going to go in, up and down the East Coast. In 30 years, it's going to look like the Jersey Turnpike.''
 But Mr. Kessel is taking a shorter view. ''We want to take this one step at a time,'' he said. ''It's a project that's never been done before in North America, and we want the public to see it and give acceptance, which I think they will, before we even look at expansion.''

HEADLINE: Unstained Masses

BYLINE: By Rob Walker

 BODY:
Jonathan Levine calls himself ''an aesthetic dentist.'' He has been in the business for 22 years, specializing in prosthodontics, which is the restoration and replacement of teeth. Over time, working in New York City, he gradually built up a list of famous clients; he is, in fact, what could be called ''a celebrity dentist,'' the kind who is quoted about Sarah Jessica Parker's teeth in USA Today. It was for such people, who basically look good for a living, that he began noodling around a few years ago with a method for portable tooth-whitening. 
 It did not, at first, occur to him that there would be any demand for his invention -- an ampule that lets you smear a hydrogen-peroxide-based whitening mixture onto your teeth -- among those who do not have to worry about how they look on Entertainment Tonight. But whether it's true that no one ever went broke by underestimating the taste of the American public (as H.L. Mencken rather tastelessly contended), it's lately seeming much harder to go broke by overestimating the vanity of the American public. Levine's invention has evolved into a product called GoSmile, which is described as offering ''prestige smilecare.'' GoSmile is now sold in fancy department stores like Henri Bendel, Fred Segal, Saks and the Sephora beauty chain. Last year it had sales of around $2 million, and it's on track to hit $8 million this year. 
 It was Levine's wife, Stacey, who had run a luxury corporate-gift business, who thought GoSmile had commercial potential, at least at the high end. ''It looked like a real lifestyle opportunity,'' she says. Then two things happened that brightened 
 GoSmile's potential. Word spread from some of Levine's clients to makeup artists, who passed the word to their clients. And Crest and Colgate rolled out enormous marketing campaigns for similar products aimed at what Mencken might have called the Great Unwhitened. This created a mainstream, $330 million category and established something for GoSmile to be more exclusive than. Deborah Walters, a Saks senior vice president, says she had seen doctor-developed skin-care brands become hits and ''immediately'' saw the potential for 
 GoSmile as the driver of a new high-end beauty category. A package of 56 Crest Whitestrips sells for about $30; 30 GoSmile ampules retail for around $75 (plus you'll want the stylish travel compact, which comes with seven ampules and costs $45).
 Of course, GoSmile is easier than strips to use in ''maintenance'' situations, like just after a debauched teeth-staining episode. It might be better in the long run just to knock off the red wine and cigarettes at lunch, but why worry about the long run when you can just obliterate the evidence (or at least feel as if you have) before your afternoon staff meeting? Collier Strong, a Los Angeles makeup artist who gives GoSmile to various famous clients and says he uses the stuff twice a day himself, argues that everyone's standards are changing. ''Now public awareness has risen to the point where if you don't have nice teeth, people look at you and ask themselves, at least, why not? There's so many products, it's so easy to have a beautiful smile now. It's like somebody who doesn't have call waiting,'' he says, with a jovial laugh. ''How primitive! Come on, do you have electricity?'' This shift has shown up lately in a culturewide makeover mania, with reality shows like ''The Swan'' peddling the dream of radical conversion from averageness to irresistibility as quickly as possible. 
 Actually, this urge may not be, like so much consumer behavior, totally irrational. Research dating back to the 1960's has shown the economic advantage of good looks. For example, better-looking people tend to earn more money than their plainer co-workers. One study examined attempts to use beauty products to ''ameliorate deficiencies in pulchritude,'' and found at least some payoff. And whatever the motive, there is another upside to dental vanity. When he started out, Levine says, ''people came to the dentist for health reasons. They were in pain. In the last five or six years, people come to the dentist, really, to enhance their smile. It's the No. 1 reason people go to the dentist.'' The result, he says, is that people probably take better care of their teeth now -- just as people who go to the gym in a quest for ripped abs can come out with healthier bodies. So even if mass vanity seems like a dark cloud, maybe it's one with a gleaming white lining.

HEADLINE: How to End Grade Inflation

BYLINE: By Michael Berube. 
Michael Berube is the Paterno Family professor of literature at Pennsylvania State University.

 BODY:
Last month, Princeton University announced it would combat grade inflation by proposing that A-minuses, A's and A-pluses be awarded to no more than the top 35 percent of students in any course. For those of us in higher education, the news has come as a shock, almost as if Princeton had declared that spring in central New Jersey would begin promptly on March 21, with pleasant temperatures in the 60's and 70's through the end of the semester. For until now, grade inflation was like the weather: it got worse every year, or at least everyone said so, and yet hardly anybody did anything about it.
 There is nothing inherently wrong with grade inflation. Imagine a system of scoring on a scale from 1 to 6 in which everyone gets a 5 and above, or a scale of 1 to 10 in which the lowest posted score is around 8.5. Such are the worlds of figure skating and gymnastics. If colleges employed similar scoring systems, the class valedictorian would come in with a 4.0, followed closely by hundreds of students above 3.95, trailed by the class clown at 3.4. 
 Critics would argue that we must be perilously close to such a system right now. Several years ago, Harvard awarded ''honors'' to 90 percent of its graduates. For its part, Princeton has disclosed that A's have been given 47 percent of the time in recent years, up from 31 percent in the mid-1970's. Perhaps grade inflation is most severe at the most elite colleges, where everyone is so far above average that the rules of the Caucus Race in ''Alice in Wonderland'' apply: everybody has won, and all must have prizes. At the school where I teach, Penn State, grade inflation over the same period has not been nearly so drastic. In the spring semester of 1975, the average G.P.A. was 2.86; in 2001 it had risen to only 3.02. 
 Still, we don't grade all that toughly. English departments have basically worked on the A/B binary system for some time: A's and A-minuses for the best students, B's for everyone else and C's, D's and F's for students who miss half the classes or threaten their teachers with bodily harm. At Penn State, A's accounted for 47 percent of the grades in English in 2002. The numbers are similar for sociology, comparative literature and psychology -- and indeed for the College of Liberal Arts as a whole. The sciences and engineering, notoriously, are stingier. 
 What to do? If we so desired, we could recalibrate grades at Penn State, at Princeton or at any college in the country. The principle is simple enough, and it's crucial to every diving competition: we would merely need to account for each course's degree of difficulty.
 Every professor, and every department, produces an average grade -- an average for the professor over her career and an average for the discipline over the decades. And if colleges really wanted to clamp down on grade inflation, they could whisk it away statistically, simply by factoring those averages into each student's G.P.A. Imagine that G.P.A.'s were calculated on a scale of 10 with the average grade, be it a B-minus or an A-minus, counted as a 5. The B-plus in chemical engineering, where the average grade is, say, C-plus, would be rewarded accordingly and assigned a value of 8; the B-plus in psychology, where the average grade might be just over B-plus, would be graded like an easy dive, adequately executed, and given a 4.7.
 After all, colleges keep all the necessary statistics -- by year, by course and by department. We know perfectly well which courses require a forward somersault with two and a half twists from the pike position for an A, and which courses will give B's for cannonballs. We could even encourage professors and entire departments to increase their prestige by lowering their average grade and thereby increasing their ''degree of difficulty.'' Students who earn A's in difficult courses would benefit -- as would students who earn B's.
 Incorporating ''degree of difficulty'' into students' G.P.A.'s would turn campuses upside down; it would eliminate faculty capriciousness precisely by factoring it in; and it would involve nothing more than using the numbers we already have at our disposal. It would be confusing as hell. But it would yield a world in which the average grade was never anything more or less than the middle of the scale.

HEADLINE: Exit Date

BYLINE: By Douglas McGray. 
Douglas McGray is a writer living in Washington.

 BODY:
On a snowy January evening, in the kitchen of a powder blue colonial at the end of a still, winding block in the suburbs of Washington, Titia and her husband, Kaprr, two immigrants from Sierra Leone, enjoyed a rare family evening together. Their youngest children, a giddy pair of elementary-schoolers, rushed in and out of the room. Their teenage daughter chattered about her ''cheerleading skills.'' Even the 17-year-old Deen made an appearance, slouching up from the basement to pick at leftovers from dinner. It seemed a storybook image of the American immigrant dream.
 But across the room, in low voices so the kids couldn't hear, Kaprr spoke about the circumstances threatening to break up his family. Kaprr and Titia have been living in the United States for 13 years. By the time they moved into this house five years ago, they had legal status, steady jobs, a growing family, night-school degrees well under way and a mortgage. Despite appearances, though, Kaprr and Titia are not Americans, or even on a certain path to citizenship. Rather, they are among at least 2,700 Sierra Leoneans living and working legally across the United States who face deportation unless they leave the country by May 3. 
 Kaprr and Titia settled in America as illegal immigrants after they overstayed their tourist visas, and Titia then tried and failed to win asylum. But they lucked into legal status in 1997, when the United States granted all Sierra Leoneans living within its borders something called temporary protected status, or T.P.S. On the books since the first Bush administration, T.P.S. was designed by Congress to shelter those who cannot benefit from refugee and asylum laws: foreign visitors staying in the United States on short-term visas or working illegally when their homeland suffers a humanitarian crisis. Recently, a vigorous lobby has urged the extension of temporary relief to Haitians, Colombians and Zimbabweans. 
 T.P.S. grants the right to work and live here legally, but provides no other perks of citizenship. At the end of a year, if a crisis persists, the government can offer another year of legal status; and at the end of that year, another, and so on. Of course, many crises, civil wars in particular, have a way of dragging on. Of the nine immigrant communities under T.P.S. protection, seven have been living year to year since 1997 or earlier; most of the 10,000 Liberians and 360 Somalis with temporary protected status have been legal residents since 1991, although the Liberians are most likely next up for deportation, and someday, the Somalis will have to follow.
 Kaprr first heard the rumors late last summer. Everyone in the Sierra Leonean community was talking about it: this would be the year T.P.S. ends, they said. Kaprr grew sick with worry. ''I couldn't think about anything else,'' he said. Under different circumstances, Kaprr and Titia might not mind this temporary life coming to a stop. Both of them miss Sierra Leone, even though the house they left was destroyed in the fighting, and their families were devastated -- Kaprr's parents and sister were killed, as was Titia's sister, and many others. Both of them want to return, eventually. But Titia's mother, who lives with the family, had a liver transplant last fall at Georgetown University Hospital; Kaprr and Titia pay for her health insurance. ''She's taking all these medications that we cannot afford if we go back,'' Titia said -- if the drugs are even available there. 
 And then there are the four thoroughly American kids. When, cautiously, Kaprr and Titia broached the topic of a possible move back to Sierra Leone, they were anxious and full of questions. ''They wanted to know about the electricity,'' Kaprr said, ''if there are going to be any medical facilities.'' Titia laughed. ''They wanted to know about the Cartoon Network. And do people have shoes? They asked: 'Do you sleep in trees?' '' When Titia and Kaprr brought home a series of documentaries about the war, their teenage daughter fled the room, terrified. The 8-, 11-, and 13-year-olds are all born American citizens; the 17-year-old is here on T.P.S. and eligible for deportation. ''If they have to go home. . . . '' Kaprr said, then paused. ''For them, it's not home.''
 The alternative, it seemed, was to stay illegally, until the kids finished school. But after so many years of legitimate American life, Kaprr did not want to live in hiding. ''We are law-abiding citizens,'' he said. Besides, the risk of sudden deportation seemed too great. All they would have to do is slip up at work, or run afoul of the law, and they could end up in detention. Their kids had never known such a fearful life and he didn't want to subject them to it now. (The family members have been identified in this article by their middle names.) 
 Like most Sierra Leoneans facing the likely end of their time in America, they could do little. They hoped the rumors were wrong and that T.P.S. would continue. They hoped they might qualify for a green card or that they would be recognized as good Americans and allowed to stay. They hoped for impossible things and tried not to think about those things too hard, so they could still take comfort in them. 
 One of Kaprr's night jobs had petitioned the Department of Labor to give him a permanent work visa, and his family a shot at permanent citizenship. But almost two years had passed since then, with no word. After hearing the rumors this summer, he feared he was running out of time.
One night late last summer, Titia came home from work with an idea, one they had never talked about before. She mentioned a woman from work, a nurse. She is a Sierra Leonean, Titia said. And an American citizen. And single. ''She is willing to marry you,'' Titia said. Just like that. Though Kaprr was shocked, he saw that the idea made a lot of sense. His marriage to Titia was not officially recorded in the United States. Marrying another woman seemed like their only option. Because Titia had applied for asylum, and failed, she was scheduled for deportation as soon as T.P.S. ended. If she defied the deportation order, it was highly unlikely she would ever be able to return to the United States. But Kaprr's case was different, less urgent. Since he never applied for asylum, he had been merely an undocumented alien before T.P.S. took effect. Once T.P.S. ended, he would be undocumented again. If the kids were going to stay in Virginia with at least one of their parents, Kaprr would have to find a way to stay in Virginia, too. 
 After two weeks of deliberation, they agreed to go ahead. Titia arranged for Kaprr to meet his future wife after work, and came along, as matchmaker. It was brief and businesslike. When I asked him about it, Kaprr simply shrugged at the memory. 
 Kaprr and the American married shortly after, on paper at least. But just a few weeks later, Kaprr received an unexpected round of good news: his petition for a permanent work visa had been approved. After 13 years in the United States, he was finally on a path to citizenship -- and entangled now in a bureaucratic soap opera. He could not petition for Titia to stay with him in America, as his wife, because technically, he was married to someone else. As he explained the cruelty of the situation, he shook his head and forced a wry, stoic smile, even as his eyes began to redden. 
 The rumors about T.P.S. turned out to be true. The very week Kaprr got his work authorization, the Department of Homeland Security gave Sierra Leoneans eight months to sell their belongings, book flights home and leave the country for good. When T.P.S. ends, most of the Sierra Leoneans will most likely try to stay on illegally, rather than return to one of the poorest countries in the world. Alimamy Sesay, a Sierra Leonean community organizer and caseworker outside Washington, guesses that ''probably 90 percent'' will ignore the deportation order. This winter, I spoke with at least two dozen Sierra Leoneans who were here under T.P.S., and not one of them was planning to leave in May. Many hoped to win some kind of last-minute reprieve. Failing that, they will stay on anyway, because they have built lives here and raised families here, or because the money they earn supports a family back in Sierra Leone.
 Once all of Kaprr's paperwork goes through (including, now, a pending divorce), and he scrapes together a few thousand dollars in fees, he and his kids will remain in their powder blue colonial at the end of the block. In a couple of years, Kaprr's lawyer tells him, he will probably be able to bring Titia back from Sierra Leone, though he figures with the Department of Homeland Security's backlog of immigration cases, and his own fragile citizenship status, it could be longer. That makes them among the lucky ones. It just doesn't feel like it.
It was raining that day back in 1991 when Kaprr placed one small suitcase in the trunk of an uncle's car and crossed the river to the Freetown airport. His young wife, Titia, was already in America. This was Feb. 28, Kaprr said, the last day he spent in his country -- and just before the rebel leader Foday Sankoh crossed the border from Liberia at the head of a brutal militia.
 Kaprr figured he and Titia would be back soon, maybe after a few years. He had a decent job in Freetown, but he longed to open his own accounting firm. The Sierra Leoneans who visited from America seemed so rich, he said, with their new clothes and their wallets filled with dollars. In the U.S.A., he thought, he could make some money in a hurry, get an accounting degree, then return home.
 He found a job as a nursing assistant, just as Titia had done, and enrolled in a vocational tech program. He figured he would soon be able to get a good enough job to start saving some money and taking accounting classes at night. Instead, he and Titia had to make a choice between paying his tuition and their mounting bills. He dropped out of the tech training, so he would have more hours to work. It was so frustrating, he said. He felt as if he was already giving up on his American dream.
 Soon enough, though, the young couple had greater worries. Machete-wielding rebels battled Sierra Leonean forces as the conflict back home worsened. The army, meanwhile, staged a coup, tossing Sierra Leone's elected president out of office and installing a military regime. Deportation was always a risk, but now, Kaprr and Titia worried, what would they return to? They decided it might be a good idea to wait the insurgency out. 
 Neither of them could make a particularly strong case for asylum, since asylum seekers have to prove they have fled targeted political or religious persecution, and civil war -- ''generalized violence,'' the law sometimes calls it -- tends not to discriminate in its victims. But Titia's family, at least, was politically active in the past. So she applied, and gained tentative legal status during the two years of immigration court proceedings and three years of appeals that followed. Kaprr kept working, quietly, as a nurse's assistant, hoping he could hitch his fate to hers.
 When Kaprr and Titia became legal immigrants under T.P.S., life got better, or at least more secure. The couple no longer lived in constant fear that immigration authorities would expel them to a country ravaged by war. But neither of them was able to use newly achieved legal status to establish a stable career -- a common difficulty with temporary protection.
 Until his recent layoff, Kaprr had a contract gig as a network engineer with a well-known technology company. At night, he takes accounting classes at a local university, balances books for a few small businesses and prepares tax returns. And from Friday night through Sunday he lives and works at a group home for mentally disabled adults. When Titia and I visited the home, a half-dozen of Kaprr's charges sat apart from each other in secondhand couches and chairs, some of them reading, others just staring. A loud symphony played from a radio in the dimly lighted living room. Only an orange and white cat moved, curling and uncurling its tail as it stepped from one lap to the next. 
 ''One job is not enough to support a family in this country,'' Kaprr said. Titia nodded in agreement. She starts her first shift as a nursing assistant at 11 at night, she said, and works until 7 in the morning. She has an hour off to drive to her next nursing assistant job, where she works from 8 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon. By the time she goes shopping and makes dinner for the kids, she has time for only a couple hours of sleep. ''You work all night, you drive around all day,'' she said. ''Sometimes I'll just sit there, like a zombie. But you can't; you have to think about the things that need to be done.'' 
 Even working papers constitute a hardship for legal immigrants. The year-to-year paperwork Kaprr and Titia bring to prospective employers shows an expiration date usually just a few months away. That keeps them in the same low-wage jobs they had when they first came to the country. Titia did put herself through nursing school by cutting back her hours a few months at a time and moving her shifts around. Once she passes a state exam, she'll qualify to be a nurse, which will allow her to make more money and cut back to 40-hour weeks. Still, she said, ''even if I got my license, I would probably stay working as a nurse's assistant.'' Temporary citizenship means temporary work.
 ''T.P.S. is the bare minimum,'' explained Bill Frelick of Amnesty International. ''It is intended to segregate you legally and socially and economically so you don't immigrate, so you're more likely to go home when the designation has expired.'' 
'I understand the difficulty involved when people put down roots,'' a staff member of the Department of Homeland Security told me. ''That's one of the consequences of T.P.S., one of the things that just happens. But this program's just not designed for that.''
 On this point, critics agree. They think T.P.S. is a valuable fix for temporary crises, but unreasonable when it goes on too long. For the last seven years, Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, has tried in vain to legislate a reprieve for the most drastically affected, Liberian immigrants, many of whom settled in Rhode Island and have lived year to year since 1991. To Reed's mind, the Liberians in his state became permanent a long time ago, regardless of their official status. ''They've established a place in the community,'' Reed says. ''They have children who've been born here. With each passing day, the case gets stronger.''
 The problem isn't unique to Liberians, Reed explains, or to Sierra Leoneans. It is intrinsic to temporary protected status. ''It works pretty well, if there's a brief interlude of instability,'' he says. ''We should be thinking about a system that recognizes when it's no longer temporary. Ten years is not temporary. We can develop a system where at least there's a presumption that after so many years, you can become a citizen. And we can do that on a general basis, not a country-by-country basis. There are ways to do it.'' In fact, there was talk at the White House toward the end of the Clinton administration about creating a path from temporary protection to permanent-resident status, one State Department official reports. ''Then the administration changed, and we were back to square one,'' he says. 
 Thousands here on T.P.S. hold out hope that Congress might include them in an amnesty program for undocumented immigrants. President Bush has urged immigration reform. A series of bills working through Congress could grant legal residency and a chance at citizenship to longtime illegal residents; these bills may benefit longtime legal residents as well. No immigration reform bill is likely to pass before next year, though, which means Sierra Leoneans with T.P.S., and possibly Liberians as well, would not be spared deportation. Advocates like Sesay have lobbied the White House to grant Sierra Leoneans a onetime extension of a year or two, called deferred enforced departure. That would give Congress the option to include them in any immigration reform law that passes next year; at the very least, Sesay argues, it would give families time to save money and plan for the move home, or finish professional degrees. But Sesay reports little headway.
 As thousands of Sierra Leoneans across the country consider their futures, uncomplicated circumstances seem to be the exception. One man I met at a local community meeting, a soft-spoken engineer with two master's degrees and his own home in suburban Maryland, told me he would probably stay, taking an illegal job and dodging immigration authorities, so his 8-year-old American-born son, who has severe cerebral palsy, can continue with his special-education classes. Back in Sierra Leone, he said, the schools would have no use for his son; simply getting around in a motorized wheelchair would be nearly impossible. Another man told me he may stay illegally to support his elderly mother, who recently won asylum from the grim refugee camps in Guinea, where many Sierra Leoneans fled. She arrived in the United States, alone, less than a month before T.P.S. was due to expire.
 When I talked with Kaprr and Titia's teenage daughter, I asked her if she'd ever thought about living in Africa. ''There are snakes,'' she said, screwing up her nose. ''I don't like snakes.'' She has no idea that she narrowly avoided leaving the United States -- nor did she realize the choices her parents had already made to keep her here. She sensed something was up, though. She knew her parents were worried. ''If they're just by themselves, I go up and eavesdrop,'' she said. ''They really want to go back. Just not right now.''

HEADLINE: Lost, and Found, in Riga

BYLINE: By KATHERINE ZOEPF. 
KATHERINE ZOEPF is a graduate student at the London School of Economics.

 BODY:
FOR the past several months, the tabloid press in London, where I live, has been making wild predictions about the hordes of hopeful migrants who can be expected to descend on Britain now that the European Union is expanding. 
 Among the new entrants is Latvia, so when I began planning a trip there in mid-April and visited the Air Baltic Web site (www.airbaltic.com), I was amused to be greeted by a large picture of a buxom Slavic blonde in a Union Jack bikini. The photograph was advertising ultralow, one-way-only fares to London from the Baltic states.
 But if citizens of the Baltic countries are eager to get better acquainted with Western Europe, Latvia seems just as eager to greet visitors from abroad. The nation's flag was first raised at NATO headquarters in Brussels on April 2, followed by formal accession to the European Union this month. During three days in Latvia's capital, Riga, I found the feeling of change and excitement palpable. There was little of the characteristic Latvian reticence. Instead, I was eagerly asked what had brought me to Latvia, what Americans thought about the country, and even what I had thought of last year's Eurovision Song Contest, held in Riga, which remains the high water mark for the city's nascent tourism industry. Prices in Riga, too, seem to be rapidly approaching Western European standards. 
 A modest, clean hotel in or near the old city costs about $100 for a double room. Riga has an exciting, and very international, restaurant scene (everything from Georgian to Ukrainian to Uzbek cuisine), and visitors so inclined can plow their way through mounds of Baltic caviar in elegant surroundings. But a budget traveler could eat heartily for around $5 a day, simply by sticking to the many cafeteria-style establishments. In short, Western-style comforts are readily available, but the real reason to go to Riga now is to watch a beautiful old city energetically reinventing itself.
 I arrived at Riga's sparkling, small hassle-free airport late on a Friday evening, too tired to contemplate much exploring that night. The taxi trip into the city center took less than 15 minutes, whisking down a short strip of highway and across one of the Daugava River bridges, from which I could see the floodlit face of Riga Castle. Soon, I was settling into my airy room at the Elizabetesnams, a snug hotel in Riga's Jugendstil, or Art Nouveau, neighborhood. The next morning, after plates of dried-apple salad, an omelet, dense brown bread and Latvian cheeses in the hotel's sunny breakfast room, I set out to see the city, now a metropolis of over 750,000. The streets were filled with the kind of cold, harsh Nordic sunlight that can give you a headache if you're not used to it. At first, the stark patches of light and shadow made the city feel otherworldly, a bit like a film set.
 At the Russian Orthodox Cathedral, two old women with thick shawls knotted under their chins were selling bunches of snowdrops. In a square just off Kalku Iela, one of the main streets running through Riga's Old City, a small skating rink had been set up, and children skated to a tinny rendition of ''Material Girl.''
 Riga is said to have one of the finest collections of Art Nouveau buildings anywhere and, turning onto Alberta Iela, that afternoon, I could easily believe it. An architecture buff could happily spend a couple of hours here, just working her way around the block. Riga was spared the bombings that destroyed so many of Germany's Art Nouveau buildings. Whole neighborhoods look much as they must have looked before 1914, when Riga was a prosperous seafaring city with a large shipyards and a thriving merchant class. Many of the elaborate, fanciful structures were designed by Mikhail Eisenstein, whose son Sergei became one of Russia's best-known film directors.
 It was impossible not to smile at, say, the grumpy-looking stone dragons flanking the doorway at 8 Antonijas Iela, or the sphinxes at 2A Alberta Iela. At 33 Elizabetes Iela, stone men with bare torsos and furrowed brows strain with every fiber to lift the columns that hold up the third and fourth floors, while the nymphs on the third floor support their balconies with careless ease.
 After a stop at a local sweet shop, Staburadze, for lingonberries preserved in powdered sugar, I headed down to the river again. From the spire of St. Peter's, a 13th-century church that was subjected to a slightly clumsy renovation under the Soviets, I could see all the way down the Daugava (in early April, still studded with a few chunks of floating ice) to the Gulf of Riga. Looking down at the sea of red-tiled and green tin roofs surrounding the church, I could see how the city had grown up, with the very oldest buildings clustered by the river, ringed by graceful Art Nouveau houses, and finally grim Soviet-era suburbs beyond.
 It seemed time for a more thorough Latvian history lesson, at the Occupation Museum, which is near the river in a huge rectangular bunker of a building. The story told on its walls is unabashedly nationalistic, beginning with Latvia's little window of independence between the two world wars, cut tragically short by successive annexation and conquest by the Soviet Union, the Nazis, and the Soviets again. A large map near the entrance shows the network of Soviet prison camps where Latvian patriots were often sent: many of the camp sites are above the Arctic Circle, and an information card notes laconically that prisoners were permitted to stop working outdoors when temperatures dropped lower than 42 degrees below zero. 
 One particularly moving exhibit displays everyday items from the camps -- felt boots, homemade scissors, bits of blanket -- accompanied by texts written by former Latvian political prisoners. Typical was this passage by Martins Bisters, a survivor who described an empty oil barrel that had served the inmates as a latrine: ''We stank from unbelievable filthiness, which was worse than anything else done to us. And still we Latvians retained our humanity in order to survive all humiliation and proudly return home to Latvia.'' 
 By the time I left the Occupation Museum, Nostalija, billed as a ''retro Soviet restaurant,'' which had caught my eye earlier in the day, no longer seemed appealing.
 Instead, I decided to try Dzirnavas, part of the Lido chain of ''traditional'' Latvian restaurants. For more than a decade, the Lido group has been wooing Latvian urbanites with a pleasantly romanticized version of the country's rural past. At Dzirnavas, waitresses wore puff-sleeved traditional dresses, families sat at rough-hewn trestle tables, and the whole place pulsed with rollicking Latvian folk music.
 The food -- bacon-and-tomato-scented solanka soup, pancakes stuffed with a salty cheese and dill mixture -- was delicious, but I was more intrigued by a pamphlet on my table, telling the Dzirnavas story. ''Have you ever been in a tavern of a good old Latvian miller?'' it began. ''Lido Dzirnavas -- revived good old days in the heart of modern Riga.''
 Surely no one in the restaurant had ever even met a ''good old Latvian miller.'' But after 50 years of enforced Sovietization, perhaps this sort of cheerful reinvention of Latvian heritage was a healthy sign.
 The next morning, I decided to visit the Ethnographic Open-Air Museum, a collection of 18th- and 19th-century buildings near Lake Jugla, about 40 minutes by car from central Riga. It is situated on about 250 acres of pine forest, through which visitors could roam freely.
 When I asked Ernests, the Elizabetesnams' friendly manager, about the museum, he assured me that it was a must-see, the perfect place to learn about ''the real Latvian life.'' He printed a bus map and schedule for me from his computer and pointed out the stop -- across the street from the Russian Orthodox Cathedral -- where I should wait.
 I found the bus stop soon enough, but the vehicle rumbling towards me, clearly marked No. 1, was a trolley instead of a bus. Ernests' English was fairly fluent, but I wondered if he could possibly have gotten the word wrong. Or perhaps Riga's trolleys and buses were all part of the same system? Ernests had said that there was a full half-hour between buses, so I didn't like to risk missing one. I decided to hop on. After all, if it turned out to be the wrong vehicle, I could simply hop off again and only be out about 35 cents for my mistake. 
 When the conductor came by my seat to take my fare, I showed her my map, and gingerly tested out the Latvian phrase that Ernests had taught me: ''I'd like to go to this museum, please.'' 
 The conductor seemed puzzled and then, as she read my map, concerned. A torrent of Latvian issued forth. I had clearly made a mistake. I got up and, smiling sheepishly and excusing myself in crude Russian, tried to make my way to the door of the trolley. No problem, thank you, I tried to convey, but I would simply get off at the next stop. 
 The conductor, an older woman in a blue smock, wouldn't hear of it. She gripped my arm and motioned me back into my seat. To my deepening embarrassment, she began making her way around the trolley, asking the other passengers if they spoke any English.
 We seemed to be heading east, outside the zone my map covered. At the next stop, the conductor, the driver, and several passengers got off, pulling me with them, and huddled on the sidewalk to peer at my map.
 Finally, one of the other passengers seemed to nominate herself as my guardian. She introduced herself as Anna, and beckoned me into her nearby apartment building. Anna's neighbor, Vesma, had studied some English, and seemed strangely delighted to have her Sunday dinner preparations interrupted by a mortified, lost American.
 ANNA and Vesma's building was a dingy Soviet-era apartment house. But inside it was very cozy, the stairwells choked with bicycles and smelling strongly of roasted meat, and the neighbors dropping in on each other with easy friendliness. Vesma's apartment consisted of a single, small room and adjoining kitchen nook. Everything was exquisitely neat; the family's beds converted by day into sofas and chairs. The floor was covered with worn, overlapping Oriental rugs, and intricately painted Easter eggs hung from pussy willows in vases.
 Soon Vesma, Anna and I were sitting in her tiny kitchen, drinking coffee and munching rosewater-flavored Lithuanian chocolates. Thanks to Vesma's skill as an interpreter, the three-way conversation gradually became less awkward. We talked about Anna and Vesma's children, about the ways Riga is changing, about the Victorian children's books that Vesma likes to read to practice her English.
 I did eventually make it to the Ethnographic Open-Air Museum, where I spent two hours examining old-fashioned churches and fishermen's cottages, and watching crafts demonstrations. As lovely and original as it all was, I can't agree with Ernests that it was the best way to learn about ''the real Latvian life.'' My happily misbegotten bus ride accomplished that. 

The bottom line
 I spent 47.77 lat (about $90) a day on transportation, food, lodging and activities during three days and nights in Riga. Though Latvia is entering the European Union, it is not expected to adopt the euro for another couple of years. Prices are calculated at 0.556 lat to the dollar. The official language is Latvian, though Russian and, to a lesser extent, English are widely understood. 

Lodging
 At the Elizabetesnams Hotel, 27 Elizabetes Iela, (371) 7509292, fax(371) 7509291, on the Internet at www.elizabetesnams.lv, a large single room cost about $85 a night, with an elaborate hot breakfast. 
 The Hotel Valdemars, 23 Kr. Valdemara Iela, (371) 7334462 or (371) 7332132, fax (371) 7333001, on the Web at www.valdemars.lv, is in an Art Nouveau building; its interior is more modest. A smallish single room with bath cost $47, with breakfast. 

Food
 Dzirnavas, at 74-76 Dzirnavu Iela, (371) 728-6204), serves a smorgasbord of Latvian specialties. A hearty dinner of solanka soup, pork meatballs, creamed vegetables, savory pancakes and mineral water came to $6.
 Pelmeni XL, at 7 Kalku Iela, specializes in chewy steamed dumplings with a variety of fillings and toppings, all sold by weight. Apple tea and a large bowl of cabbage dumplings with grated cheese were $1.15.
 Sievasmates Piradzini (Mother-in-Law's Pirogi) at 10 Kalku Iela is a bustling little place, where customers pluck pirogi buns -- filled with anything from poppy seeds to bacon to dried apricots -- from an array of steaming trays, cafeteria-style. A cup of tea and sweet pirogi stuffed with cheese and jam was $1.70.

Things to Do
 The Occupation Museum, 1 Strelnieku Laukums, (371) 7212715, www.occupationmuseum.lv, is free, though donations are encouraged.
 A ticket to a Saturday afternoon concert at the Riga Dome Cathedral, 1 Doma Laukums, (371) 7213498, cost $9.40.
 Admission to the Ethnographic Open-Air Museum, 440 Brivibas Gatve, (371) 7994515 costs $1.85. KATHERINE ZOEPF

HEADLINE: PRINCETON LIMITS A'S

BYLINE: By Robert Strauss

 BODY:
The Princeton University faculty has overwhelmingly approved a new grading system intended to stem grade inflation. The proposal by the undergraduate dean, Nancy Malkiel, limits the number of A's, including A-pluses and A-minuses, given in any undergraduate department to 35 percent of students for all courses and 55 percent for those taking upper-level independent work. 
It takes effect next fall. A study of the Princeton class of 2002 showed that 65 percent of students graduated with an average of B-plus or higher and that a student with a B average would rank 923 out of a class of 1,079. Students had voiced concerns during debate over the proposal that limiting A's would unfairly jeopardize them in job and graduate-school applications, since it would lower their grade-point averages relative to other colleges that did not limit A's. Dr. Malkiel stressed that the new guidelines were ''expectations,'' not strict limits, and that specific cases will be viewed on their merits. Robert Strauss

HEADLINE: New Orleans

BYLINE: By Frederick Turner. 
Frederick Turner's new book,''In the Land of Temple Caves'' (Counterpoint), is a meditation on art and the human spirit.

 BODY:

New Orleans is a town of nicknames: the City of Sin, the City That Care Forgot, the Big Easy. Waiting for a bus on Basin Street, I asked a woman if New Orleans's good-time reputation was deserved. ''If you got five people waitin' in line,'' she smiled, ''you likely to have a party.''

The Mood
 At 8:30 on a Saturday morning I was awakened in my hotel room by the long, one-note wail of a boat horn. Normally, I can't sleep so late, but this was New Orleans, and I'd been out well past midnight listening to music. Pulling back the curtains, I looked out on the great river and a 200-foot-long barge sliding past Algiers Point, the water rough and taupe-hued under a gray winter sky.
 For many years I'd been coming down here, drawn by the music and the food -- both very rich. But in this morning moment it was suddenly borne in upon me that neither of these civic treasures sets the tone of this town the way the powerful presence of the river does. The Mississippi made New Orleans a tourist destination as far back as the early 19th century, and then it made it into the nation's busiest port. A huge dam above Baton Rouge now chains the river to its current channel so that it won't seek a shortcut to the Gulf of Mexico and leave the city a sea of mud and desolation. Chatting with a cabby about the river, I asked him what New Orleans would be like without it. Daniel Thompson had spent 40 years on the Mississippi. Now he watched for a break in traffic, then eased through it. ''Wouldn't,'' was all he answered.
 Until the 1984 World's Fair the New Orleans waterfront was about as inviting as that of Bayonne, N.J. But a sizable stretch of it was razed and renovated for that forgettable event so that now from the French Market on Decatur to the Crescent City Connection Bridge across to Algiers, it's possible for visitors to get a sense of how the river continues to shape what the city is. Here, set down beside a flow so mighty you don't really see it, are extravagant attractions chorusing their debt to the Mississippi: Margaritaville, the Jackson Brewery mall, the Moonwalk promenade, Woldenberg Riverfront Park, the aquarium, the convention center, the casino, cruise ships, riverboats.
 And if you were to pass beyond all this to where a grittier kind of commerce commences, you would find vestiges of a riverfront town substantially unchanged in a century and a half: long, warping warehouses where the corrugated tin peels away from the structures' sides; splintered docks on battered pilings; railroad sidings with trains of boxcars many blocks long; abandoned factories with immense chimneys. Even these chimneys add to the overwhelming impression of the river's shaping omnipotence, simply because in their immensity they are fully in keeping with the scale of everything else down here -- the bridge, the barges, the cruise ships: it's all immense, as it must be to match the Mississippi.
 But until summoned by that boat horn I had never understood much of this. Instead, I had long believed that traditional jazz was the tone-setter for the city. Now I think that jazz isn't the emotional equal of the river; I don't think it's the equal either of another tradition long preceding it: necromancy. New Orleans has a historic love affair with death. Of no other American city can this be said. There is a whiff of the grave hanging over the place, something musty, decayed. Many have felt this, but it forcefully came to me on my recent visit when I was walking St. Peter Street from Basin into what local people call the Quarter. I passed a tall, spare house whose door, close-set columns and pediment struck me as the entrance to a crypt, not a home: sooty, settling, scrunched like the age-blackened face of the mummy I'd just seen at an exhibit on Egyptian funeral customs at the New Orleans Museum of Art.
 Here is a city whose older cemeteries remain prime tourist attractions even though they are now very dangerous places to enter. You can get a vampire tour of New Orleans, buy goofer dust (dirt dug from a grave) at many a tourist shop, visit a voodoo museum. Yes, all these are transparently touristy. But all of them reach roots into authentic cultural soil, and as New Orleans itself is raised a precarious few inches above the river's wet suck, so the city's hectic gaiety seems raised above the reaching arms of death. What other place makes a brassy party out of a funeral?

The Food
 New Orleans, it is frequently observed, is a gumbo of a town, a useful shorthand reference to its mix of French, Spanish, African and Caribbean influences as well as to its single most characteristic dish. A bowl of gumbo, with its okra and oysters, its shrimp and sassafras, its spicy, peppery finish, has defined what made New Orleans cuisine unique as far back as memory takes us. But even in this city that clings to tradition, cultural evolution is at work. Gumbo may still define the cuisine, but the grand old restaurants that proudly served it and have so long stood for New Orleans cooking seemed, with one exception, very weary to me when I ate at some of them last spring.
 So when I came back this winter I made it a point to investigate restaurants that had grown up and flourished since I first came down here believing that eating in New Orleans meant dinner at Antoine's. What I discovered dining at Bayona, Stella!, Restaurant August, Peristyle and the Bistro at the Maison de Ville will surprise no one who has been keeping up with the local restaurant scene: this remains a fabulous eating town, right up there with New York and San Francisco and maybe superior to either because of the distinctive nature of the indigenous cuisine.
 The one exception to my disappointment with the old-timers was Commander's Palace, still run by the Brennan family according to their exacting standards. I planned on having their famous pompano, but the chef, Tory McPhail, said they'd had it on the menu the night before and recommended the speckled trout. When I tasted it (beautifully balanced between flaky and moist) I was glad the pompano hadn't been available. I had the gumbo du jour as well, and every mouthful reminded me of why I have so long loved New Orleans cooking.
 The Brennans, of course, have been around a long time. The current star on the scene is the chef-owner Susan Spicer, who founded Bayona in 1990 and most recently co-founded Cobalt in 2001. When I dined at Bayona I understood what all the fuss is about. This is a softly stunning spot of salmon-colored walls, mirrors and big bouquets. Spicer described herself to me as a Navy brat whose father had retired here. ''Luckily enough for me,'' she smiled, ''he picked a great food town.'' I told her I was leaning toward the buttermilk-fried rabbit in a Creole mustard sauce. She approved of that inclination, adding that she'd been buying rabbit from the same man for several years because his product was so consistently excellent. That kind of reliance on local producers and attention to detail was evident in everything I tasted at Bayona down through dessert. Rabbit-in-mustard is one of my favorite dishes but a good deal more tricky to prepare well than it would appear. Spicer's version was tender enough to cut easily with a fork and compared favorably with any I recall from my favorite Parisian bistros.
 I had a good dinner at Stella!, and ate even better at Restaurant August and Peristyle. I also found room for three splendid lunches at the Bistro at the Maison de Ville, where Patrick Van Hoorebeek, the city's master of culinary ceremonies, presides as maitre d'hotel. When I came in out of a rainy Monday there were only three tables occupied. At one were the owners of the long-famed Galatoire's; at another were the owners of Alex Patout's Louisiana Kitchen. And as if that hadn't been enough to tell me all I needed to know about the Bistro's food and service, Patrick gave me a lagniappe of an anecdote as I staggered out after consuming a marvelous cassoulet. ''When Albert Finney was here years ago filming 'Miller's Crossing' he took to coming in here regularly,'' Patrick said. '' 'Patrick,' he said to me one night, 'this restaurant is an island of sanity in a sea of madness.' '' We are, you see, but one building removed from Bourbon Street!'' (America's answer to 18th-century London's Gin Lane).

The Style
 If the river and the underworld of necromancy establish the mood of this town, then jazz, broadly construed, defines its style: swaggering, swinging, sexy. It is the single most important item in the city's promotional kit. Jazz images hit you the moment you exit from your plane, and its sounds may be heard in the Quarter from midmorning on, when enterprising trumpeters and tenormen set up on street corners. But traditional jazz is fading away in the city of its birth, outmuscled by urban blues, R & B, funk and rock -- none of which, of course, could exist without jazz.
 When I first visited here in 1961, Preservation Hall on St. Peter was newly established, a place where long-neglected black musicians could find work playing the old way. The clubs around the corner on Bourbon played breakneck Dixieland, and in the Quarter there were two or three blues spots. Preservation Hall still marches on before packed houses, and there is plenty of electric blues to be heard. But jazz of any sort has pretty much left Bourbon.
 The singer and banjo player Banu Gibson has played with traditional groups here since 1981, and when I asked her whether that style was dying out she said: ''Well, there's just so much other stuff out there now. We've lost most of our traditional jazz clubs. Partly, that's just the evolution of taste, but part of it is economics. If a club owner can get four electric players with speakers and so on, why would he want to pay for seven acoustical ones? And, really, you can't get that full, traditional sound with anything less than a sextet.'' Gibson now finds herself in greater demand in places like St. Louis. ''But don't get me wrong,'' she hastened to add, ''this town is still deep in great jazz players. Go by the Spotted Cat while you're here and catch the Jazz Vipers. They do great versions of 30's numbers.''
 Gibson was right to send me to the Spotted Cat in the currently happening Faubourg Marigny. The New Orleans Jazz Vipers were a well-rehearsed sextet featuring violin and the rarely heard bass sax. But, after all, the evening had a certain staidness to it, both in the charts the band played and in the demeanor of the all-white, determinedly middle-aged audience.
 The real action was elsewhere, and it wasn't jazz. It was rock with the local legends, the Radiators, at Tipitina's in the gritty warehouse and wharf district; blues with Yvonne Williams and the Juke Joint Players at the Lounge Lizards on Decatur; funk with Funk'n Horns at Donna's Bar and Grill on North Rampart across from Louis Armstrong Park.
 Particularly the action was with the Radiators, playing before a packed house and with an additional line of petitioners waiting outside in a pelting rain. When the band struck up about 10:30, the instant voltage in the room was astonishing. I found myself next to a comely youngish woman down from Baton Rouge. ''There was no question where I would be tonight!'' she shouted. ''I left the baby with Mama -- and here I am!''
 At Donna's I found Funk'n Horns to be a hard-hitting unit that just blew hell out of every 20-minute number they played. The drummer was white, but the rest of the players were lean, young black men. To a listener with a historical cast of mind there was something deeply moving in the fact that their jazz-inflected playing was happening on the very ground of the vanished Storyville district where so many of the early jazz greats got their start. Here, I felt, was authentic continuity in a city that prizes it.
 The happiest face in the room belonged to Donna's husband, Charlie, who was working behind the bar and was clearly proud of the young men up on the stage. ''All these boys,'' he said, nodding in their direction, ''I been knowin' them since they was 15, 16 years old. 
 And now look at them go!''

HEADLINE: Berkshire Hathaway Millionaires Gather

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

DATELINE: OMAHA, May 1 

 BODY:
In 1978, Bill Scargle bought his first stock in Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate built by Warren E. Buffett, at $175 a share. Today, the stock is trading at an astounding $93,390.
 Mr. Scargle, a career clerk in the brokerage business from Orinda, Calif., sold about $1 million of the stock to secure his retirement 15 years ago when it was trading at $7,000 a share. But he still has several million dollars' worth, he says, and he savors his good fortune daily. The first thing he sees when he turns on his computer is the stock price.
 ''Berkshire has been the biggest single influence on my life, by far,'' Mr. Scargle, 65 and retired, said as he was preparing to attend the company's 39th annual meeting here in the Qwest Center auditorium. 
 The Berkshire meeting, the biggest annual shareholders meeting in the country, and surely one of the most festive, is filled this year as most with early investors like Mr. Scargle. They are rich or richer because of their Berkshire investments, and they focus their gratitude on the founder, chairman and main engine of the company, Mr. Buffett, a lifelong Nebraskan who has cultivated a folksy, down-home style while making a personal fortune in the tens of billions.
 To longtime investors, Mr. Buffett is the Dalai Lama, the pope, Will Rogers and Midas rolled into one.
 ''He has completely transformed my financial life,'' said Gifford Combs, a money manager from Los Angeles who bought his first Berkshire shares in 1980 at $340. ''It's as if my life went from black and white to color. And he has done this for hundreds and hundreds of people.''
 On Friday, Mr. Buffett, 73, ambled through a thicket of blue blazers and silk dresses at a reception at Borsheim's Jewelry, chatting and posing for snapshots with investors. He opened the meeting on Saturday with an hourlong film of quips and sight gags, and shots of him strumming a ukulele and lollygagging with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Donald Trump, Bill Gates and Jimmy Buffett made cameo appearances.
 ''I'm a very happy guy,'' sang Mr. Buffett, the entertainer, who invested in Berkshire 20 years ago and, those close to the family say, may be a very distant cousin to the Berkshire boss. ''I bought Berkshire way back when it was cheap.''
 Mr. Buffett, the billionaire investor, quickly dispensed with the formalities of the typical annual meeting and, sitting at a folding table at one end of the auditorium, launched into a daylong seminar on his school of investing: search out bargain stocks and companies and hold them forever. At his side, as usual, was his friend and fellow strategist, Charles T. Munger, 80, the vice chairman of the board and as laconic as Mr. Buffett is loquacious.
 Suggesting a new approach for corporate America on accounting in the formal part of the meeting, Mr. Buffett said Berkshire's audit committee had acted to increase its independence from management. Instead of awaiting the rare question from outside auditors, he said, Berkshire's audit panel this year raised its own questions. ''The trick,'' he said, ''is to have the auditors worry more about the audit committee than about management.''
 In response to a question, Mr. Buffett said he expected to see inflation ''start to heat up.'' 
 Mr. Combs, 45, has been taking notes at the Berkshire meetings for nearly 15 years and studying them when he gets home. Friends sometimes wonder what more he could possibly learn after all those years of listening to Mr. Buffett.
 ''My retort is that if Tiger Woods is willing to spend six hours talking to you about your swing and you don't learn anything, well, it wouldn't be Tiger's fault,'' Mr. Combs said. ''I almost always come away with something new, and I'm almost always surprised at what it might be.'' 
 Mr. Buffett has made a fortune for himself and his shareholders by investing heavily in a few stocks like Coca-Cola and Gillette, and, when he has not been able to find appealing stocks, buying entire companies. Berkshire owns more than 60 companies, including big insurance concerns and a cowboy boot manufacturer. And in the last four decades, Mr. Buffett has racked up an average annual growth for Berkshire of 22 percent, more than double the performance of the stock market as a whole.
 Even so, he is not without detractors. In April, a big pension fund in California took Mr. Buffett to task for being a director of Coca-Cola and engaging in significant business dealings with Coke through various Berkshire units. And in March, Thomas M. Kostigen, a columnist for CBS MarketWatch, declared that Mr. Buffett ''may be the most overrated money manager in history.''
 The first assumption of Buffett loyalists is that critics are on the wrong track. ''I wonder how many billions these guys have made in the stock market?'' Mr. Scargle asked.
 The questioners Saturday were mainly deferential toward Mr. Buffett. But the first asked about the purported conflict for him as a director of Coke and a proposal that he leave its board. ''I think it's absolutely silly,'' Mr. Buffett said, adding that Coke and Berkshire's business dealings were slight and that Berkshire's ownership of 8.2 percent of Coke's stock gave him an incentive to act in Coke's best interest.
 During the technology boom, Mr. Buffett stayed on the sidelines, saying he did not understand the racy stocks. Pegging him as a typewriter guy in a computer age, many investors jumped ship. But as Berkshire's share price drooped into the low $40,000 range, loyalists like Steve Wallman, 51, a money manager from Madison, Wis., doubled their bets. ''I backed up the truck and loaded up on Berkshire at that price,'' said Mr. Wallman, who bought his first shares at $1,500 each in 1985.
 Following his own buy-and-hold strategy to perfection, Mr. Buffett now owns 36.6 percent of Berkshire stock and with a fortune estimated at more than $45 billion has become the second-richest person in the world, after Bill Gates of Microsoft.
 ''Everybody thinks the big trick in investing is to find the right stock,'' Mr. Wallman said. ''But in many respects the trick is to hold onto it. You find yourself getting richer and richer and you say, 'What if this ends?' and you begin to diversify. And that's where people make their mistake. They tend to diversify away from their winners.''
 Mr. Scargle, whose wife, Jane, died four years ago and who has no children, now flies to places like Hong Kong and Paris and plays golf twice a week, largely because of his Berkshire investment. As a clerk with a modest salary, he started by buying 10 shares at $175. But he gradually increased his holding to more than 200 shares, many of which came to him when Berkshire bought Blue Chip Stamps for stock, and Mr. Scargle converted his Blue Chip holdings into Berkshire shares.
 Other companies have sometimes outperformed Berkshire and made investors wealthy. But no other stock carries such a high price tag. That is because Mr. Buffett has never split Berkshire's stock. ''He doesn't want a huge number of shares out there in the hands of people looking for short-term gains,'' said Andrew Kilpatrick, the author of the book, ''Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett.''
 ''It makes it harder to manage for the long-term,'' Mr. Kilpatrick said.
 In 1996, Mr. Buffett issued shares valued at 1/30th of an original Berkshire share. Those Berkshire B shares, which Mr. Scargle also owns, closed Friday at $3,119. 
 The Berkshire meeting, the main event of a weekend of cocktail parties, barbecues and bargain shopping at the company's big jewelry and furniture stores in Omaha, is also, for many, an annual reunion.
 In 1991, Mr. Combs organized a dinner for a group of Berkshire investors at an elegant horse farm on the edge of Omaha and each year since the friends have reconvened. They call themselves the Omaha Lounge Suit Society. They wear the regimental tie of a disbanded British colonial unit in India, and open the evening with bagpipes and Champagne.
 Mr. Buffett said 19,500 people attended the annual meeting, up from 12,000 last year.
 Even with tickets provided free to shareholders, admission had been so sought after that bootleggers began selling tickets on eBay at $9.99 each, only to be countered by Mr. Buffett who tried to ruin the outside sales by offering tickets at $2.50 each.
 A group of 31 Australians chartered a plane to fly to the meeting, contributing to a surge in attendance from overseas that prompted Mr. Buffett to schedule a special reception for the long-distance travelers late Saturday afternoon.
 This year, as in the past, several business school professors brought their entire classes to the meeting. The scene was strikingly different when Mr. Scargle attended his first meeting in 1979, held in the cafeteria of National Indemnity, Berkshire's first insurance company. About 25 people attended, Mr. Scargle said, most of them employees and relatives of Mr. Buffett. 
 ''The meeting went: bam, bam, bam,'' Mr. Scargle recalled. ''It was over in 15 or 20 minutes. Afterwards, I went up and introduced myself. He said, 'I've got about an hour, anybody who wants to stick around and talk about investing, I'll be glad to do so.' ''
 By then the crowd had dwindled to Mr. Scargle and three other shareholders. ''The four of us sat down at a folding table with Warren Buffett,'' Mr. Scargle said. ''As he talked, I was convinced this guy was the smartest guy I'd ever heard speak.''

HEADLINE: Corzine Earning Political Stripes as the Money Man

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1 

 BODY:
Having spent $62 million of his own money to win elective office, Senator Jon Corzine is not exactly in the habit of asking for political donations. Yet there he was during ''call time'' at the Senate Democratic headquarters the other day, looking ever so slightly uncomfortable as he tried to persuade a wealthy New Yorker to part with $25,000.
 ''I don't know how to say this, since you're in the car,'' Mr. Corzine said, apparently fearing the woman on the phone would crash upon hearing his pitch. ''I hate to be pushy.'' 
 It is, however, Mr. Corzine's job to be pushy. After just four years in politics, the New Jersey Democrat and former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs has a new chairman's title, at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. As its chief recruiter and money man, he has been hopscotching around the country, trading on his considerable Wall Street connections as he dials for dollars and headlines fund-raisers, something he never did for himself.
 He got the job for a simple reason, said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader: nobody else asked for it.
 That was in December 2002 when, Mr. Daschle said, ''the prospects for success looked less than encouraging.'' But the party has gotten some lucky breaks. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Republican of Colorado, unexpectedly decided to retire. Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, faces a tough primary challenge. And the Democrats have recruited strong candidates in unlikely states, like South Carolina.
 Some independent experts now say the idea of a Democratic Senate, while still a long shot, is no longer so far-fetched.
 ''I would say right now Republican chances of holding onto the Senate have dropped from 80 to 90 percent to, say, 60 percent,'' said Charlie Cook, publisher of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. ''Five or six months ago, you might have said, 'Corzine, he's working hard, but he got dealt a bad hand of cards.' But he's got to have a real spring in his step today.''
 Mr. Corzine, 57, does not have a spring in his step; he has been hobbling around on crutches, plagued by what his doctors say is an old football injury or gout. But he has been relentlessly cheery about Democratic prospects, telling contributors that if the election were today, the Senate would be 52-to-48 Democratic. Republicans call it fuzzy math, especially in light of Senator Arlen Specter's victory in Pennsylvania's Republican primary this week.
 ''How does he get to that?'' asked Ed Gillespie, the Republican National Committee chairman, adding, ''It doesn't seem to me to be a realistic assessment.''
 Realistic or not, Mr. Corzine's reputation is riding on it as he tries to shed the baggage of political neophyte. He volunteered, he says, for two reasons. First, he has learned Washington's most important lesson: ''If I really want to get stuff done, I need to be in the majority.'' And while Mr. Corzine is a respected Democratic voice on the economy, he wanted ''credibility with my peers'' in another arena: politics.
 ''I'm earning my stripes,'' he said.
 Soft-spoken and awkward on the stump, Mr. Corzine says the only thing more humbling than running for office is ''being No. 99 on the food chain in the United States Senate.''
 He does not wear his wealth on his sleeve; Inez Tenenbaum, the Democratic Senate candidate in South Carolina, recalls a meeting with Mr. Corzine in which his cellphone kept dropping to the floor. ''You'll have to excuse me,'' she recalls him saying. ''I have a hole in my pocket.''
 He did not slide naturally into the job. At first, aides say, they had to press him to make fund-raising calls. Sometimes, the senator would hold ''prospecting dinners,'' said Tom Shea, his chief of staff, in which he failed to ask for money, insisting he could build relationships first and seal deals later. Inside the committee, Mr. Corzine replaced the executive director and finance director.
 The churning was apparent; at the end of 2003, Senate Democrats were in the worst financial shape of any major party committee. 
 ''I was very concerned about it,'' said Mr. Daschle, who attributed the poor showing to a heavy focus on recruiting and confusion over the new campaign finance law. But one Democratic strategist said the problem was Mr. Corzine, who ''had never made a fund-raising call.''
 Yet in March, the committee raised $7.1 million, nearly $2 million more than its Republican counterpart. Steve De Micco, who ran Mr. Corzine's 2000 campaign, says Mr. Daschle made ''an inspired choice, because Jon is somebody who has the potential to bring money into the party from entirely new sources.''
 Mr. Corzine's Wall Street contacts do seem to come in handy. Last month, he was at a cocktail party in Buckhead, Atlanta's ritziest neighborhood, with an unlikely group of Democratic contributors: a Republican real estate developer and his business associates.
 The setting, a large home on 7.5 acres, with waterfalls and immaculate gardens, was straight out of Southern Living magazine. The host, who has known Mr. Corzine since the senator's Goldman Sachs days, would not be identified, for fear of alienating Georgia's Republican governor. The guests -- with the notable exception of Roy Barnes, a former governor whom Mr. Corzine unsuccessfully tried to recruit to run for the Senate -- came not so much to meet the senator from New Jersey, but to cement their own business relationships with the host.
 Mr. Corzine began his remarks by glancing about at the opulent surrounding. ''Democrats,'' he said wryly, ''could get used to this.'' After a low-key speech in which he reminded his audience that ''business and Democrats don't need to be enemies,'' he went on to lead what amounted to an economics salon, fielding questions on subjects like interest rates -- ''I think we're on the precipice of an explosion of intermediate and short-term rates'' -- and President Bush's tax cuts -- ''I'd love to have tax cuts; I think it would be great for me. But I don't think it works for the nation.''
 The guests gave him favorable reviews. ''I'd much rather see that man running than John Kerry,'' one said, referring to the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Mr. Corzine, his task accomplished, limped out the door, with Senate Democrats $40,000 richer for his evening's work.

HEADLINE: Even as Earnings Rise, Benchmarks Slip

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
Corporate profits, paced by big companies like I.B.M., Merrill Lynch and ChevronTexaco, are up smartly -- the 411 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index that had reported by Friday posted an unexpectedly high 27 percent gain in the first quarter. 
 Economic statistics paint a picture of a solid recovery. 
The Commerce Department reported last week that both consumer spending and Americans' incomes were up 0.4 percent in March and that the economy had expanded at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter.
 So investors might be forgiven for asking what it takes to buoy stock prices, which fell last week.
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 2.4 percent in the week, closing at 10,225.57, while the S.&P. 500 fell 2.9 percent to 1,107.30, and the Nasdaq composite plunged 6.3 percent to 1,920.15. One reason, Wall Street analysts said, is that the strong earnings and economic figures might soon lead the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates, now at their lowest point since 1958.
 Another is worry that the Chinese economy may be ready to cool down. That fear also depressed Asian markets. South Korean stocks, led by Samsung Electronics tumbled, sending the Kospi index down 7.8 percent, its biggest weekly drop in a year. JAN M. ROSEN

HEADLINE: Celebrations of a New, Expanded Europe Are Clouded by Old Fears of Immigration

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER; Brian Lavery contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DUBLIN, May 1 

 BODY:
A celebration of fireworks, light shows, church bells and dancing rolled across Europe on Friday night toward a culminating ceremony on Saturday in the Irish capital, where the 15 nations of the European Union welcomed the largest expansion of its borders ever by taking in eight former Communist states of Eastern Europe and two Mediterranean countries. 
 A night of music under searchlight-laced skies gave way to pomp and festivity here, where Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland, who holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union, was the host of a flag-raising ceremony set to the strains of Beethoven's ''Ode to Joy,'' the European anthem. He also held a banquet on Saturday night for the 24 other leaders, who flew in under heavy security.
 Mr. Ahern, speaking at a news conference, called this May Day a ''day of hope and opportunity'' that finally closed one chapter of modern Europe's history of cold-war division and opened a new chapter made possible by ''the triumph of your determination and perseverance.'' 
 Though this enlargement does not add as many people or as much raw economic power as the one in 1973 that brought Britain, Denmark and Ireland into the union, it nonetheless pushed Europe across a critically important psychological barrier, completing a unification process that began after the collapse of the Soviet bloc more than a decade ago. 
 The expansion creates an even larger European economic entity, at 450 million people more populous by half again than the United States and marginally stronger in economic output. But the enlarged Europe still suffers from a lack of political cohesion or diplomatic heft against the dominance of the United States in world affairs and global security. 
 Moreover, there was a detectable sour note hanging over the celebrations, many officials said, engendered by fears that economic migrants would flood west from the new member states to compete for jobs and welfare benefits. 
 Thus the expansion, so long anticipated as the fulfillment of dreams for half a continent oppressed during the Soviet era, had an ill-mannered side to it. Western nations have slapped restrictions on migration and used transitional powers to deny social benefits to Central European workers who already have become the waiters, carpenters and the nannies of the wealthier West.
 In their news conference on Saturday, Mr. Ahern, along with Romano Prodi, who heads the cabinetlike European Commission, and Pat Cox, president of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, called for swift action to complete a European constitution for approval at a meeting of leaders in June. The constitution would for the first time provide a formula for streamlined decision-making through majority voting. 
 Up to now, decisions required unanimity. With 25 members, though, European leaders fear paralysis in Brussels and have been debating a new voting formula in a struggle similar to that engaged in by the American founders in Philadelphia. Many also want a stronger presidency, as well as a more active and clearly defined foreign policy and independent military capability. Others still fear giving up too much sovereignty to 35,000 bureaucrats headquartered in Brussels who preside over 100,000 pages of laws and regulations that will now be translated into 20 languages.
 ''There are enormous difficulties if we try to continue on the way we are going,'' Mr. Ahern said. ''I really do believe that the changes are essential.''
 The debate over the constitution's formula that would give France and Germany more voting strength in recognition of their large populations deadlocked last December, with Spain and Poland opposing the formula because it weakened their relative weight. But leadership changes in Spain and Poland have put a compromise within reach.
 On Saturday, Mr. Ahern said he would begin talks on the compromise over the weekend with Spain's new prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. ''It is an opportunity to outline to him what we are trying to achieve,'' Mr. Ahern said.
 Mr. Ahern and his colleagues skirted the challenge issued Thursday by the French president, Jacques Chirac, who suggested that any member of the union that did not ratify the new constitution would have to quit or be pushed to the margins. His remarks were aimed at Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who has been forced by domestic political opposition to say that he will submit any European constitution this year to a referendum vote.
 The celebrations started early Friday night, leading up to the moment of accession, midnight, for the 10 states. There were buoyant and emotional scenes in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, where old border crossings came down, eliminating the divides that symbolized the last remnants of the cold war. Down the boulevards and across the squares where people power overcame the tyrannies of the Soviet era, Eastern Europeans extolled their new sense of arrival. 
 Hungary's prime minister, Peter Medgyessy, told a jubilant crowd of more than 100,000 in central Budapest that although the country had long considered itself at the gates of Europe, ''The significant difference is that now we are inside the gates.'' 
 The European Union flag, a circle of stars on a blue field, was hoisted in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Malta and on the Greek half of a divided Cyprus. 
 President Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland told celebrants in central Warsaw, ''Today our dream is becoming reality. Poland is returning to its European family.''
 A sign of the times was provided by a young woman in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, who draped herself with the European flag while reveling with her friends. ''I don't remember what the Soviet Union was like,'' Jurate Rudyte, 17, told a reporter for The Associated Press, ''but I really enjoy the European Union that Lithuania is joining.''
 One of the architects of European unification, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, was one of many dignitaries who gathered to walk across the bridge over the Neisse River where Germany meets Poland and the Czech Republic. Addressing a crowd on the river bank at Zittau, an emotional Mr. Kohl told the crowd, ''The message is there will never again be war in Europe.''
 In a nationally televised speech, the current chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, confronted domestic concerns about low-paid Polish workers taking German jobs by contending that the overall expansion in trade will create jobs and ''will make us not poorer, but richer.'' 
 Despite the doubts and grumpiness across the region, Mr. Chirac exhorted his countrymen not to fear necessary reforms. 
 ''Other great entities in the world are moving ahead faster than we are,'' he said. ''Unemployment in Europe remains high, the population is aging, our social systems are adapting with difficulty, our economies are facing heightened competition. And in the face of these challenges, it is imperative that Europe assert itself.''

 BODY:
Here's what I learned in Tokyo: If you're the leader of Japan, America, Australia, Taiwan, Malaysia, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines or the European Union and you're not going to bed each night saying the following prayer for China, then you're not paying attention:
 ''Dear Heavenly Father, please keep the leader of China, President Hu Jintao, healthy and on an even keel. Please see to it that he moves steadily and carefully toward restructuring the Chinese banking system and ridding it of its huge overhang of bad loans and corruption, before there is a real meltdown that would be felt around the world. Give him the wisdom to cool the overheated Chinese economy without creating a recession that would prompt China to stop importing like crazy and start just exporting like crazy. And Father, forgive us for all the bad words we used in recent years to describe China's leaders -- terms like 'Butchers of Beijing.' We did not mean it. We meant to say 'Bankers of Beijing,' because their economy is now fueling growth all over Asia, bolstering Japan and sucking up imports from everywhere. May China's leaders live to 120, and may they enjoy 9 percent G.D.P. growth every year of their lives. Thank you, Father. Amen.'' 
 The most striking thing about being in Asia today is hearing how much more important China's growth engine has become for companies all across the region -- and well beyond it. When Chinese authorities told banks last week to cut back their wild lending, commodity prices and stock markets tumbled all over the world. News that China is having regular blackouts because it can't buy enough crude oil is helping push up gasoline prices the world over.
 While three years ago the Bush team came to office growling about no longer coddling China -- the way those ''wimpy'' Clintonites did -- that talk has disappeared from the Bush vocabulary. It's not just business as usual now. It's business only.
 To some degree the world is getting hooked on China -- its cheap labor, its voracious appetite for commodities and capital (over $50 billion in foreign direct investment last year) and its emerging middle class. The more hooked we become, the less the world can tolerate any sort of prolonged instability there. If the China bubble bursts, it will be the mother of all burst bubbles. Which is why we need to pray that China's leaders will have the skill to cool things down, just enough but not too much, without some wheels falling off.
 ''A lot of the world's stability or instability is resting on the leadership in Beijing -- there is no question about that,'' argues Richard Koo, chief economist for Nomura Research Institute. But, he insists, ''Chinese leaders understand what world they are living in. They have a general equilibrium view of the world -- that what they do affects us all and then comes back to affect them.''
 That seems true. But one of the ways that China has grown so rapidly in the last decade has been by decentralizing authority to regions and letting governors or mayors attract whatever investment they can. It is not clear anymore how much the center can slow things down.
 And considering the huge amounts of foreign investment that have flowed into China in such a short time, ''it's very hard to think that they could have invested that much money efficiently,'' remarked Robert Feldman, managing director in Tokyo for Morgan Stanley. ''So the senior leadership is scared, because if they have a hard landing from bad loans you have a regime problem. [But] when they tried to slow the economy, they got real push back from the regions, who said, 'You in Beijing have all that infrastructure. Why shouldn't we have a new bridge or road?' ''
 Given how opaque China's decision-making is, it's hard to predict how Chinese leaders will balance their obligation to behave in a way that promotes global equilibrium with their need to create millions of jobs each year in order to stay in power.
 One can only say three things: 1. They've done a pretty good job so far. 2. The job gets harder every day. 3. No one will be immune to the fallout. The relationship of the world to China right now reminds me of that old banker's rule: If a client owes you $1,000, that's his problem. If a client owes you $1 million, that's your problem. China's stability is our problem.
 Heavenly Father . . .

HEADLINE: A Team Makes a City A High-Rent District

BYLINE: By Daniel Gross. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com

 BODY:
IN March, amid great fanfare, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki helped unveil plans for a $1.4 billion, 75,000-seat stadium for the New York Jets on the West Side of Manhattan. In a public-private partnership, an $800 million investment from the Jets owner, Woody Johnson, would be added to $600 million from the city and state. The proposal would both create a stadium that the Jets could call their own and anchor a larger development project.
 In recent years, politicians and team owners have argued that using public funds to attract and retain professional sports franchises helps create jobs, draws tourists and revitalizes desolate zones shunned by private investors. But these claims have not stood up to economic scrutiny. ''The overwhelming conclusion of studies that have tried to estimate the economic impact of a football or baseball stadium is that there isn't any,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College. 
 Still, the continuing investment in sports stadiums -- last summer, the Philadelphia Eagles began playing in the new Lincoln Financial Field -- intrigued Edward Coulson, a professor of economics at Pennsylvania State University. ''I had seen all these studies, and I couldn't figure out why politicians kept saying we should spend all this money,'' he said. If people -- even mayors and governors -- are economically rational creatures, why would they sanction inefficient expenditures of public funds? 
 Professor Coulson and Gerald A. Carlino, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, reasoned that football teams contribute to the quality of life in cities, much as museums and parks do. (Last year, the contributions of the 4-12 New York Giants were minimal.) And economists have long known that residents pay for such amenities indirectly through higher rents. 
 In a forthcoming paper in the Journal of Urban Economics, Professor Coulson and Mr. Carlino try to figure out how much extra people pay for the privilege of living in cities with a National Football League franchise. To do so, they charted rents for apartments in 53 cities between 1993 and 1999, and used regression analysis to isolate the effects of an N.F.L. franchise. Their conclusion: All things being equal, apartment rents in the central-city areas of N.F.L. towns were 8 percent higher. On average, each resident of an N.F.L. city in 1999 paid $184 a year, about 50 cents a day, for the privilege of living near a group of extremely large, muscular men who, on several Sundays each fall, hurtle into one another. The average value to a city's property owners of these higher rents: about $139 million a year. 
 Mr. Carlino and Professor Coulson found that in some instances, the presence (or absence) of an N.F.L. team helped explain substantial trends in rents. In 1994, the Houston Oilers moved to Tennessee and morphed into the Titans. But Dallas retained its iconic Cowboys. By 1999, rents in Dallas had risen about 37 percent while rents in Houston had grown more slowly, about 22 percent.
 Higher rents mean higher home values, which lead to greater property tax receipts. Mr. Carlino and Professor Coulson found that property tax revenues were about $50 million a year higher, on average, in N.F.L. cities in 1999 because of the teams' presence. That's pretty good, considering that the average annual subsidy provided by a city -- stadium maintenance, police and fire services, and tax breaks -- to professional sports teams was about $27 million in 1999. In 22 of the 25 N.F.L. cities on which they had data, Mr. Carlino and Professor Coulson found the potential increase in property tax revenue exceeded the subsidies.
 ''STADIUMS do seem to be a good deal for most cities,'' said Mr. Carlino. A bonus: citizens reap the benefit of higher property tax revenues and home values even if they never set foot inside a stadium or shell out $6 for a hot dog.
 So does it make sense for a city perennially short on cash to help build an expensive stadium? ''I'd rather not have this be part of a brief for a team owner,'' said Professor Coulson. Remember, it's the presence of the team in a metropolitan area that creates the effect, not a new stadium. The investment would be a sound one only if the Jets were to follow the example of the city's other lovable losing franchise, the Brooklyn Dodgers, and plot a move to Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: Now Can We Talk About Health Care?

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton (April 18) is exactly right to insist that the American health care system must place the needs of the individual -- not the needs of the provider, payer or others -- at the very center of its concerns. Moreover, I could not agree more that a great place to start is by adopting a personal health record for every American that is owned and controlled by the individual. As we have seen in other parts of the economy, when individual Americans are empowered with good information and freedom to choose, they drive an astonishing level of innovation, technological and otherwise, that delivers increasingly better results at an increasingly lower cost. We should not be surprised, then, that we are starting to see this same pattern occur in health care. New information-age health improvements are allowing individuals to be better informed about their own health and how to be informed consumers of health services, and are thereby saving lives and saving money. We need to accelerate these trends so that all Americans can benefit from improved health and lower costs.

HEADLINE: Ads Citing War Mix With Reports From the Front Lines

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: COCOA BEACH, Fla., April 29 

 BODY:
It is the earliest, most expensive political advertising war in presidential campaign history, totaling at least $90 million so far, most of it from President Bush.
 But this is also the first campaign in wartime in more than 30 years. In the 18 battleground states where the advertising is focused, including Florida, the blitz is not just striking for its intensity, but also for the way that it is playing off televised reports from the front lines in Iraq.
 As they do in most places, images from the war zone dominate television news programs in this town near Patrick Air Force Base. Those graphic sights are often accompanied by reports about the local men and women who are doing the fighting, and the parents worrying about them here at home. 
 So spots from Senator John Kerry and President Bush, appearing most intensely in newscasts, are playing like running commentaries over who is better qualified to preside over the action unfolding between the commercials.
 It is a significant break from recent campaigns, in which political commercials broadcast on local programs seemed awkward and out of context.
 ''Usually, you have this really feel-good story about someone rescuing a cat, and then you'll get this really nasty, negative ad,'' Kenneth M. Goldstein, an associate professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, said. ''It's very rarely that you get the paid media from both sides and the free media all engaged in the same topic.''
 The spots may be optimally situated by the blunt standards of Madison Avenue, which puts a premium on placing commercials in programs where they will have the most emotional effects. But political scientists and strategists said both campaigns, already sparring daily over national security, risked criticism for politicizing the conflict in commercials, which lack the same nuances as interviews or even stump speeches.
 ''It is fraught with danger if you are viewed as being exploitative,'' said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist who is producing advertisements for the Media Fund, a group that is running spots against the president. 
 Then again, Mr. Axelrod said, events necessitate it. 
 ''It's sometimes not risky to address the thing that's paramount on people's minds,'' he said.
 Not since 1972 has a presidential campaign unfolded amid continuing combat. Then, commercials for President Richard M. Nixon and Senator George McGovern vied over who could most efficiently end the unpopular conflict and bring the troops home.
 This time, with both candidates agreeing that pulling out is not an option, the spots vie over who is better equipped to support the troops and solve the crisis -- with messages that are often powerfully reinforced by reports from the front lines.
 The Channel 2 News at 11 here, for instance, reported recently about a decision by a marine from Orlando, Sgt. Kenneth Conde Jr., to stay in Iraq after taking a bullet in the shoulder. Interviewed for the report, his mother, Theresa Conde, said she had asked him, ''Are you crazy?''
 An advertisement for Mr. Bush that followed shortly afterward implied that Ms. Conde would have even more to worry about if Mr. Kerry were president. It showed troops marching through the desert as an announcer intoned: ''As our troops defend America in the war on terror, they must have what it takes to win. Yet John Kerry has repeatedly opposed weapons vital to winning the war on terror.''
 Adding a local economic element, the announcer added that Mr. Kerry had opposed Apache helicopters, C-130 Hercules transport planes and F-16 fighter jets, ''components of which are all built here in Florida.'' 
 As the announcer speaks, the hardware disappears, piece by piece, leaving a lone soldier staring forlornly into the camera as the announcer ends: ''John Kerry's record on national security? Troubling.''
 Although Mr. Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, had opposed continued production of those weapons systems, he had also voted for them or others like them on other occasions, a point that goes unmade in the advertising battle.
 That spot from Mr. Bush ran on the Channel 9 news on Wednesday afternoon after a report about Rita Smith, the worried mother of an Army soldier whose tour in Iraq was extended because of the continued fighting.
 ''When Rita watches the news,'' the correspondent, Berndt Petersen, reported, ''you can see the worry.''
 Toward the end of that broadcast, a spot from Mr. Kerry was shown that was in large part devised to deflect charges from Mr. Bush that he is not committed to the troops and national security. While listing what would be his top priorities as president, Mr. Kerry speaks directly into the camera and says, ''First, we will keep this country safe and secure.''
 ''My priorities are jobs and health care,'' he adds. ''My commitment is to defend this country.''
 In two days of intensive viewing here, Mr. Kerry's spots often played such a defensive role, coming after spots from Mr. Bush had raised questions about his ability to be a wartime leader.
 That is not to say Mr. Kerry's spots never worked on offense. Late on Wednesday, ''Nightline'' on ABC offered a long, blunt report about fighting in Falluja, juxtaposing images of allied soldiers and rebel fighters firing their weapons with that of Mr. Bush telling reporters, ''Most of Falluja is returning to normal.''
 Toward the end of the broadcast, a commercial for Mr. Kerry had him again looking directly into the camera, this time saying, ''Let me tell you exactly what I would do to change the situation in Iraq.'' After promising to ''reach out to the international community in sharing the burden, the risk,'' he reminds viewers, ''The American taxpayer is paying now almost $200 billion and who knows how many more billions, and we're paying the highest price in the loss of lives of our young soldiers, almost alone.''
 Darrell M. West, a professor of political science at Brown University, said the challenge for the candidates in running these spots was that they simply did not know how the advertising would come off in the news environment.
 ''How voters are going to see the ad is going to depend on whether the war is good or bad that day,'' Professor West said. 
 He and other experts noted that the campaigns did not have much choice when both sides agreed that the election would be decided on national security and the war as much as by economic factors.
 ''What Bush is trying to do in every way is to say, 'You should be afraid of change right now,' '' said Donny Deutsch, head of the Deutsch Inc. advertising agency in New York who was a consultant for Bill Clinton in 1992. ''And the game for Kerry is, 'As scary as change is, it's even scarier to stay the course.' And there's the game.''

VOWS OF SILENCE
The Abuse of Power in the Papacy
of John Paul II.

A Calling in Crisis.

 ROMAN Catholics have come to no consensus on whom to blame for the sexual-molestation scandals that have rocked their church since 2002. The liberals among them fault a haughty hierarchy that resisted the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, setting itself against human sexual reality as lived by the laity -- starting with Pope Paul VI's 1968 letter against birth control. Conservatives think Vatican II prompted leaders to wink at sexual permissiveness -- starting (again) with birth control, passing through the establishment of a gay subculture in seminaries and winding up at the priests' Caligulan excesses. 
 In their expose ''Vows of Silence,'' Jason Berry and Gerald Renner see some merit in both accounts. Berry is the author of ''Lead Us Not Into Temptation'' (1992), one of the first books to address the church's pedophilia problem; Renner was for decades the religion writer for The Hartford Courant. Like the conservatives, the authors see a ''dimension of gay culture'' in the scandals. Hiding priests' homosexuality, their reporting shows, fostered secrecy and occasionally blackmail. But like the liberals, they think this clerical secrecy has deep roots in church history. Left alone, Vatican II might have done away with endemic mistrust of the laity and unrealistic sexual expectations, particularly on birth control and priestly celibacy. In leading a ''backlash'' against Vatican II, Pope John Paul II has put clerical privilege ahead of the well-being of his flock. 
 Berry and Renner's account is organized around two biographies that have nothing to do with each other. The hero is the Dominican canon lawyer Thomas Doyle, a Reagan-voting, Latin Mass-loving protege of Cardinal John Cody, the former archbishop of Chicago. When priestly abuse cases started crossing his desk at the Vatican Embassy in the mid-80's, Doyle was appalled by his colleagues' indifference. His warning that this was ''the most serious problem that we in the church have faced in centuries'' cost him his job. So he became an Air Force chaplain, worked with awareness groups like SNAP (Survivors' Network of Those Abused by Priests) and helped lawyers prepare cases against the church. The authors view him as ''a prophet'' trapped among lesser minds and ''a Catholic embodiment of the rebel, an ethos expressed by Albert Camus.''
 The villain is Marcial Maciel Degollado, the 84-year-old Mexican founder of a conservative priestly order, the Legionaries of Christ, who is alive and in good standing with the church. The pope has praised the Legion for its record in forming priests and evangelizing Latin America. To the authors, Maciel is secretive, fascistic and a Demerol addict, one who puts on ''a heroic, saintly mask to cover his worldly genius at pulling money from the rich while hiding sex with boys in the closet of church secrets.'' Since the late 60's, nine former Legionaries from Mexico and Spain have accused Maciel of abusing them as seminarians and young priests in the 40's and 50's. He allegedly had some massage his penis to relieve abdominal ''pains,'' told others he needed a semen sample and convinced still others that he had a papal dispensation for sex. 
 The Vatican investigated Maciel and suspended him from Legion duties for two years (presumably for the above-mentioned matters; the report is secret). Maciel returned to his position four days after the death of Pius XII in 1958, during the interregnum between popes. In 1998, the ex-Legionaries filed a canon-law suit against Maciel before the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (C.D.F.), arguing that, by offering them absolution after sex, he had violated the sacrament of confession. The case went nowhere, and the men never penetrated the secrecy of the C.D.F. Nor do the authors, although their sources say that the C.D.F.'s hard-line prefect, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, while seeming to believe the charges, found them too ''delicate'' to address. As a ''what did he know and when did he know it?'' book, this one does not land much of a blow against the pope. 
 ''Vows of Silence'' also meanders through the entire grotesque of the Catholic pedophilia scandal: abuse of runaways by the Rev. Bruce Ritter at Covenant House in New York, the acquisition of teenage catamites by the military chaplain Robert Peebles of Dallas, sexual blackmail by the accused serial molester Robert Trupia of Arizona (protected when he threatened to reveal he'd had sex with his bishop), sodomy rings run by the Irish Christian Brothers in Newfoundland and Australia, abuse in monasteries by Cardinal Hans Groer of Vienna. These thumbnails hint at the scale of the crisis, but they have little direct connection to either Doyle's drama or Maciel's. 
 ''Vows of Silence,'' however, has some great strengths. The stories of those Doyle has helped and Maciel has harmed illuminate why priestly abuse took so long to expose. Victims blame themselves. One of the seminarians who allegedly masturbated Maciel says, ''I believed my problem was nothing compared to his.'' Barbara Blaine, the founder of SNAP, thought after her own molestation, ''I had caused a good holy priest to sin!'' And victims are broken in ways that diminish their credibility. One Chicago mother pleaded with her archdiocese to remove the Rev. Robert Mayer, a serial pedophile who had taught hard-core sex techniques to his students and had made advances on her son. The church brushed her off. After the institution to which she had entrusted her salvation failed to support her son against his assailant, her marriage crumbled. She wound up pleading her son's case as a divorced Catholic -- i.e., a ''bad'' Catholic. Similarly, by the time the nine Legionaries came to testify against Maciel, only one was still in the priesthood. The church knew exactly whom it was dealing with. Its response, according to Doyle, was to ''send some imperious cleric out there to show them how bad they should feel about dragging the church's name through the mud.'' It countersued its accusers for defamation. James Serritella, lawyer for the Chicago archdiocese, told one gathering of priests, ''When one of these situations develops, those people are the enemy, and I'm on your side!''
 The last half-century has witnessed the largest exodus from the priesthood since the Reformation. The median age of American priests is 60. But for Andrew M. Greeley, a priest who is also a novelist and sociologist, the priesthood's biggest problem is its own culture. If Berry and Renner think the conservative explanation (it's the gays) and the liberal one (it's the celibacy) are both partly right, Greeley thinks they are both largely wrong. In ''Priests,'' he uses survey data to claim that most priests are not only content with the celibate life but also better adjusted than laymen. A sixth of priests leave the priesthood over the celibacy requirement. Another sixth are homosexually inclined, and most of those are celibate. Greeley is reluctant to speculate why the generation of priests born between 1937 and 1957 should diverge so widely -- on survey indexes ranging from homosexuality to job satisfaction -- from those born before and after. He does note, uneasily, that priests under 35 are ''more like the priests over 75 than like priests in the middle years of life.'' 
 For Berry and Renner, the church must embrace the Vatican II idea of the laity as a ''People of God.'' It ''desperately needs a separation of powers'' to better serve the ''majority of laypeople espousing the Vatican II ideals of religious liberty.'' Greeley -- who tells us that two-thirds of the laity support married priests, women priests and popular election of bishops -- would like the church to set up a ''Priest Corps,'' so young men with a vocation could try the profession on for five or ten years. 
 But it is hard to see how democratic reforms can arrest the crisis in Western Catholicism. For what can ''religious liberty'' mean in the context of a doctrine? In free societies, dissent gets expressed through ''exit'' rather than ''voice,'' to use the economist Albert O. Hirschman's terms. The less doctrinaire a parishioner, the more likely he is to find his preferred spiritual product elsewhere. So the democratic world may offer the church a hard choice -- between growing more reactionary or dying. Perhaps the church's real arrogance was to assume at the time of Vatican II that it had the standing to open a dialogue with modernity. The church could never command that non-Catholics listen to it; all it could do was expose its faithful to the siren song of democracy, capitalism and sex.

HEADLINE: Transforming City's Housing: Act 2

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
TWENTY-TWO years after New York City launched a federally financed $50 million plan to create 25,000 units of affordable housing, the program is winding down, successful beyond the imagination of even many of those involved. The stock of 10,000 buildings that formed the backbone of the plan -- buildings seized by the city for tax delinquency -- has been reduced to fewer than 800, and well over 200,000 housing units have been created or restored.
 Now the city and the affordable housing community must struggle with the question of what's next. It is a problem at the core of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's $3 billion New Housing Marketplace program to build or preserve 65,000 more homes and apartments over the next five years.
 ''There's no single answer, no silver bullet,'' said Shaun Donovan, the city's new commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development. ''It's not just the dollars and the units, which are critically important. It's also about setting a framework for where the new pipeline for development is coming from.'' 
 The proposals and plans -- some are already works in progress -- include extensive rezoning of manufacturing and waterfront property for residential use, remediation of brownfield sites and building on vacant land that is either on city housing projects or adjacent to them. Other notions call for a shift from the construction of two- and three-family homes (a standard model for affordable housing) to higher-density co-ops or condominiums; teaching developers used to rehabilitating buildings how to perform ground-up construction; and retooling financing instruments to cover the cost of acquiring property, now that foreclosed properties are so scarce.
 Already, Mr. Donovan said, ''Just the rezonings currently on the boards will create room for thousands of new units.''
 The assumption that city initiatives can lead to the creation of large numbers of desirable homes for working-class people dates back, at least, to Jan. 14, 1982, when President Ronald Reagan, Mayor Edward I. Koch and 100 top business leaders, recruited by David Rockefeller, gathered at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to announce the start of the New York City Housing Partnership. Over time, the partnership would be seen as a keystone in the creation of a structure by which major lenders, government subsidies, the expertise of local housing advocates and, increasingly, community-based developers would be harnessed to build homes for lower-income New Yorkers. 
 In the last 15 years alone, 212,000 new or rehabilitated homeownership and rental units -- in broad swaths of full blocks and in-fill scatterings of two or three here, four to eight there -- have infused new life and commerce into still-struggling communities.

Extensive Privatization
Areas Restored Via Foreclosures
 The sites that have been rehabilitated were seized through a legal procedure known as ''in rem foreclosure,'' and in the shorthand of the housing industry they are widely called in rem properties. (''In rem'' is Latin for legal action taken ''against the thing.'') Since 1986, the city's inventory of in rem buildings has dropped by 92 percent and in rem units by 96 percent.
 The transfer of those properties to for-profit and nonprofit developers, Commissioner Donovan said, ''is quite simply the largest privatization of housing anywhere in the country.''
 And in a welcome offshoot of the process, a cadre of small community-based builders has seized the opportunity to reseed their old neighborhoods.
 Ten years ago, Desmond Emanuel, president of Landmark Projects Inc., was a subcontractor doing the hammer-and-nail work assigned by established developers. ''Then we got introduced to the partnership,'' he said. ''They were interested in small contractors redeveloping communities they either lived in or were familiar with.''
 Mr. Emanuel grew up in a railroad flat with three brothers and seven sisters on Kelly Street in the Morrisania section of the Bronx. ''I played stickball on the block,'' he said.
 One of his first projects through the partnership was the development of 50 two-family homes around the corner from Kelly Street. ''That was 1996,'' Mr. Emanuel said, ''and at the time they sold for $147,000. Now they go for $300,000, minimum.'' Since then, his company has built 650 homes, mostly in the Bronx and Upper Manhattan.
 The Housing Partnership is certainly not the only, and not even the first, of what are sometimes referred to as intermediaries -- organizations bringing together public agencies and private lenders, developers and contractors. But its basic financial model of transferring title of city-held properties to local developers and organizations has become standard in the affordable housing sector.
 ''The city provides land that's been taken in rem and turns it over to the Housing Partnership for a minimum price,'' said Kathryn Wylde, a former president of the partnership -- sometimes for as little as $1.
 A developer designated by the partnership and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development then designs the site and secures a construction loan. The negligible cost of the land and public subsidies cover the difference between construction costs and the home's market price.
 ''Typically, the gap between what the market would bear and the house price was 20 percent,'' said Ms. Wylde, who is now president of the Housing Partnership's parent organization, the New York City Partnership, a leading business and civic group. ''So if you built a home for $100,000, the most you could sell it for would be $80,000. And the public subsidy would make up the difference in the cost to the builder.''
 ''In most of the neighborhoods where we built,'' she added, ''this was the first private financing for residential construction in 50 years. It had all been public construction.'' 
 Over the years, that basic formula would transform dozens of neighborhoods. ''It worked as well on Staten Island's north shore as it did in the South Bronx or central Brooklyn,'' Ms. Wylde said. ''It received tremendous support from the City Council, the Legislature, governors and mayors.''
 Denise Scott, director of one of the original intermediary organizations, the Local Initiative Support Group, or LISC, is similarly impressed. ''Koch created this affordable housing program, and it's actually continued with every mayor since,'' Ms. Scott said. ''I don't think there's any other city that has invested as much in housing development as New York. And it's a credit to the city, phenomenal, in fact, that this kind of commitment has spanned many mayors, Democrat or Republican.''
 The New York office of LISC, an organization serving 35 cities nationwide, opened in 1979. And through its portfolio of 50 community development corporations, most not-for-profit, it has worked with the housing preservation department to rehabilitate 20,000 units in apartment buildings in central Brooklyn, the South Bronx and Harlem. At the same time, it has helped create about 1 million square feet of commercial and retail space in those communities.

Doing 'Great Things'
Sick Blocks, Made Better
 When Deborah Wright wants to remind herself of what is possible, she goes to 140th Street between Adam Clayton Powell and Frederick Douglass Boulevards in Harlem.
 ''It was dubbed the sickest block in the city,'' said Ms. Wright, who served as housing commissioner from 1994 to 1996 and is now president of the Carver Federal Savings Bank. ''There was a two-page article in The Daily News and that was the headline, with a graphic showing the indices of distress: building code violations, sick children -- it may have been TB -- the percentage of people unemployed, drug incidents.''
 Back then the city owned all but three buildings on the block. ''Most of the tenants weren't paying rent,'' Ms. Wright said, ''and, in my view, appropriately so because our service was so poor. Many buildings didn't have front doors, certainly no operating intercoms; trash bags all around. It was the poster child for what was wrong with our policy of holding onto these buildings.''
 Eventually, through the Housing Partnership, the city handed over all its buildings to a combination of local private property managers and a nonprofit group, the Harlem Churches for Community Improvement. These days, the complete internal renovations of the fully occupied buildings, their stylish facades and canopies, their delicate detail work and the landscaped garden that once had been a garbage-strewn lot, offer a joyful contrast to the past.
 ''We brought together the city's most prominent banks and small local entrepreneurs, business people who were not typically on a first-name basis with major lenders,'' Ms. Wright said. ''You get local actors in the same room with major private resources and government as a third partner, and great things happen.''
 Now, with the city's in rem stock largely dissipated, but its affordable development structure firmly in place, housing officials and advocates are examining a panoply of possibilities to continue their work.
 Rafael Cestero, director of the New York office of the Enterprise Foundation, another leading intermediary, sees the need for a finely tuned piecemeal approach. ''The tricky part of what's next is that the problem isn't so visible,'' Mr. Cestero said. ''It's putting even more of an onus on us to hit all the nooks and crannies where poorly run property still exists.''
 The Enterprise Foundation, which opened its New York office in 1987, was the creation of the late James Rouse, a Baltimore developer of planned communities who, in his later years, turned toward producing homes for poor people. Enterprise has created 15,000 units in New York City.
 ''A major challenge,'' Mr. Cestero said, ''is to purchase poorly run properties so they can be refinanced and rehabilitated as affordable projects. The idea is to work with financial institutions to develop early intervention strategies for acquiring properties facing foreclosure.''
 ''If you get in early and work with the banks, you can save the cost and pain of foreclosure to the bank and, frankly, to the landlord,'' Mr. Cestero said. ''You either work with the existing landlord who really wants to do a good job or with the bank to negotiate the purchase of the property prior to foreclosure.''
 ''There are literally thousands of units like that around New York,'' he said.

Larger Scale Actions
Using Rezonings And Other Means
 Commissioner Donovan is thinking on a larger scale. Under the mayor's housing plan, he said: ''We have already, in partnership with City Planning, begun the most aggressive rezoning the city has ever seen.'' The process, so far, calls for a combination of upzonings -- which increase density -- and use changes for abandoned manufacturing sites in East Harlem, Park Slope, Morrisania and parts of Staten Island. 
 ''We believe that just the rezonings recently completed or under way make room for between 30,000 and 50,000 new housing units,'' Mr. Donovan said. ''And we will be looking at many more in coming years.'' Some sites, he said, will require varying degrees of environmental remediation.
 At the same time, the commissioner continued, ''We have already worked with the New York City Housing Authority to start revitalizing a number of their properties.''
 It is a notion that boggles the mind of Ms. Wright, the former housing commissioner. It speaks of ''the remarkable success that the city, the private sector and the community groups had in revitalizing what were considered tough neighborhoods,'' she said.
 ''One constant in those neighborhoods is public housing,'' Ms. Wright said. ''Thirty years ago, no one believed you could sell a brownstone for $1 million literally a block from public housing. Today, a $1 million brownstone in Harlem is unremarkable.''
 ''Thirty years ago, nobody would have believed that land adjacent to Housing Authority property would be attractive for homeownership,'' she added. ''The time is right to blow away that myth.''
 It could be co-ops or condominiums for lower-income people on those kinds of sites, said Naomi Bayer. Ms. Bayer is both director of the New York office of Fannie Mae, the mortgage-purchasing corporation, and chairwoman of the Housing Partnership.
 ''I think we're transitioning from the traditional two- and three-family homes that have been the model for the partnership over the past two decades into multifamily homeownership options like condominiums and cooperatives,'' Ms. Bayer said.
 Two- and three-family homes have been the bellwether of the affordable housing movement because they allow the home buyer to use the rental income from the other units to help pay the mortgage. ''Condos and co-ops provide the opportunity for more units on a single site,'' Ms. Bayer said. ''Each buyer would benefit. So if it's a 200-unit property, there's 200 new homeowners on that site. And there would be a similar subsidy model to what has been used on the two- and three-unit properties.''
 Whatever the complex formula, no one expects it to fully solve the city's chronic housing squeeze. From 1990 to 2002, according to City Planning Department statistics, the number of newly built units increased by 123,200. Over the same period, however, census data indicates, the city added more than 154,000 households.
 At the same time, according to the 2002 New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, 22.7 percent of all renters, or 460,000 households, pay more than half their income in rent, and 14.3 percent of all homeowners, or 143,000 households, pay more than 60 percent of their income for housing.
 It took a lot for Carmen Liburd, 46, to afford her dream.
 Ms. Liburd, a single mother of two daughters, worked day and night -- as a teacher's aide and caring for children with cerebral palsy -- scraping together the $20,000 down payment on a two-family partnership-built home on South Road in Jamaica, Queens. ''It ended up being my birthday present,'' she said. ''We closed two days before my birthday.'' That was in 1998.
 While renting in the area, Ms. Liburd said, ''I saw the houses building up.''
 ''So,'' she said, ''I did the Joshua walk, like in the Bible when he walked around the walls of Jericho. I put down some footsteps. That's how I claimed that one day I would own one of these properties.''
 Ms. Liburd is from the tiny Caribbean island of Nevis where ''people usually don't pay rent,'' she said. ''They stay home with their family and save up to buy, even if it's just a two-room house. That was the mentality, save to get your own.''

HEADLINE: How Much House Does $1 Million Buy?

BYLINE: By CARIN RUBENSTEIN

 BODY:
TEN years ago, $1 million bought you a lot of house,'' Robert Paladino, 53, said. ''One million dollars used to be a lot of money, but now it's not.''
 Mr. Paladino and his wife, Louann, bought a house in Harrison recently that was half the size of their old one. The new home has five bedrooms, but it sits on just one-third of an acre; they paid $1.1 million for it. 
 Like the Paladinos, a growing number of Westchester home buyers are entering the million-dollar home market, whether they like it or not. 
 The soaring house prices in Westchester, of course, are the cause. In the early 1990's, only about 5 percent of homes in Westchester sold for $1 million or more, according to P. Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. But during the first quarter of 2004, 15.9 percent of the 1,063 single-family homes sold in Westchester went for at least $1 million.
 ''There will be more and more $1 million properties as market inflation continues,'' Mr. Mercurio said, adding that Westchester housing prices ''are far above both the region and the nation.''
 In fact, the National Association of Realtors in Washington, which charts housing sales nationwide, does not track homes that sell for more than $1 million, since ''it's fewer than 1 percent of transactions,'' said a spokesman, Walter Molony.
 But in a few metropolitan areas, including New York, million-dollar homes are becoming commonplace. 
 In Cambridge, Mass., for example, nearly 12 percent of single-family homes were valued at more than $1 million, as were 7 percent of those in San Francisco, according to data drawn from the 2000 census by Zhu Xiao Di, a research analyst at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. Although he did not examine Westchester figures, Mr. Di said that he is not surprised by the large number of million-dollar homes here. 
 In places where housing demand exceeds supply, and there is little open land to build more, ''one million dollars does not purchase a huge mansion, just a standard thing,'' he said. Mr. Di's study focused on owner-occupied single-family homes and thus excluded New York City's co-ops and condos. 
 The proportion of million-dollar homes, though, varies widely across municipalities in Westchester, as well as across the New York region as a whole.
 In Bronxville, for instance, 76 percent of the single-family homes sold so far this year (a figure that includes houses and town houses but not co-ops and condos) have been for more than $1 million, according to Carolyn Martin, a broker at Bronxville-Ley Real Estate. In Rye City, 38 percent of the homes sold in 2004 went for more than $1 million, according to George M. Stone, a co-owner of Julia B. Fee Real Estate in Rye. 
 In Greenwich, Conn., 64 percent of homes sold this year were million-plus sales, said John Cooke, the manager of Merritt Associates, a Greenwich-based realty company. In Nassau County, just 6 percent of home sales this year included those selling for more than $1 million, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island.
 The disparity stems in part from the fact that housing prices have always varied widely from community to community, and what matters most is, of course, location. Also, in places like Bronxville, there are only about 1,000 homes, and very few of them are small, said Ms. Martin, who seems to know the history and provenance of nearly every dwelling in the mile-square village. Home buyers who end up paying $1 million or more for a one-, two-, or three-family house are subject to a New York State ''mansion tax,'' a 1 percent levy on the total price, which is added to the standard real estate transfer tax of $4 per $1,000. (The transfer tax a buyer would pay on a $1 million home, for example, would total $14,000; the tax on a $990,000 home, however, would be $3,960.) 
 The tax was instituted in 1989 by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, according to Tom Bergin, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance in Albany.
 The first year the tax was collected, in fiscal year 1990-1991, 559 homes paid New York State a total of $10.4 million in mansion tax, Mr. Bergin said. By fiscal year 2002-2003, that number had multiplied 10-fold, to 5,125 homebuyers paying a total of $99.3 million, he said. 
 Since the tax is not collected on condominium or cooperative apartments in New York City, Westchester County home buyers contribute a sizable chunk of the mansion tax revenue, about $20.9 million last year, he said.
 New York State's mansion tax is the only one of its kind in the nation, according to Charles M. Staro, the chief executive of the New York State Association of Realtors, which has lobbied, unsuccessfully, for its removal. 
 ''It adds to the total taxing picture of New York, which is the highest taxing state in the nation,'' he said.
 Patty Neuwirth, the owner of Hudson Homes in Tarrytown who has sold real estate along the Hudson for nearly 25 years, said: ''The term 'mansion' needs a new definition. To me, a mansion has lots of bedrooms and lots of land, but now a house that could tip $1 million is what I bought as a starter home, just a lovely house on a street.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 2 about the inflated residential real estate market misstated the scope of New York State's ''mansion tax,'' which is 1 percent on the total price of homes costing $1 million or more. Condominium and cooperative apartments are indeed subject to it.

THE ANATOMY
OF FASCISM
By Robert O. Paxton.
321 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $26.
 Fascism, to hear President Bush tell it, has been revived by Islamic militants. ''The terrorists are the heirs to fascism,'' he has said. ''They have the same will to power, the same disdain for the individual, the same mad global ambitions. And they will be dealt with in just the same way. Like all fascists, the terrorists cannot be appeased: they must be defeated.'' 
 In this statement, Bush laid out his checklist for what constitutes fascism. Such checklists are required because fascism -- unlike Communism, socialism, capitalism or conservatism -- is a smear word more often used to brand one's foes than it is a descriptor used to shed light on them. Robert O. Paxton, a professor emeritus at Columbia University and the author of several books, including ''Vichy France,'' is not the first scholar to wade into a definitional and historical quagmire in order to answer the question, What is fascism? Indeed, his book ''The Anatomy of Fascism'' -- which doubles as a history and a sustained argument -- is not the most original study of the subject. But it is so fair, so thorough and, in the end, so convincing that it may well become the most authoritative.
 Why should readers care about fascism? Paxton offers one answer at the outset. ''Fascism was the major political innovation of the 20th century, and the source of much of its pain.'' But in exploring how such uncouth nobodies as Hitler and Mussolini introduced what the Italian philosopher and historian Benedetto Croce described as an ''onagrocracy'' -- or ''government by braying asses'' -- he also hopes to enable us to recognize ''what the 21st century must avoid.''
 ''The Anatomy of Fascism'' is the work of a distinguished scholar who has sifted through the primary sources, the tomes and the trends in an effort to synthesize and even settle prior debates. His main emphasis is on Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany, but in order to demonstrate why certain fascist movements were able to seize power while most remained marginal, he contrasts these ''successes'' with fascist sputterings in Britain, France, Hungary, Portugal, Spain and elsewhere.
 Paxton proceeds chronologically, tracing how fascist movements are born, take root, assume power, govern and self-destruct. At every stage he explores the interaction among the leader, the state, the party and civil society, examining the symbiosis between socioeconomic conditions and the political agents who seized upon and shaped them.
 World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 contributed mightily to the advent of fascism. The war generated acute economic malaise, national humiliation and legions of restive veterans and unemployed youths who could be harnessed politically. The Bolshevik Revolution, but one symptom of the frustration with the old order, made conservative elites in Italy and Germany so fearful of Communism that anything -- even fascism -- came to seem preferable to a Marxist overthrow. 
 Still, Paxton retains an important capacity for incredulity. How on earth was it that Benito Mussolini, who won a mere 4,796 votes out of 315,165 in the 1919 election, could find himself appointed prime minister in 1922? The answer, Paxton makes clear, was not Mussolini's policy platform. ''They ask us what is our program,'' Mussolini said. ''Our program is simple. We want to govern Italy.'' Rather, it was the societal ills, the conservatives' fear of a Communist revolution, the paralysis of Italy's liberal constitutional order and the violence inflicted by fascist militia -- violence that made the state eager to co-opt the violent themselves.
 How could Hitler, whose Nazi Party placed ninth in 1928 (with only 2.8 percent of the popular vote), soar to first in 1932 (with 37.2 percent)? In Germany, storm troopers intimidated enemies, Hitler himself delivered mesmerizing harangues and the Nazi Party became a catchall movement that appealed to those Germans from all classes who were disillusioned with the bankrupt mainstream parties. 
 But none of this was enough to bring about fascist rule. One of Paxton's main contributions is to focus less on the ''Duce myth'' and the ''Fuhrer myth'' and more on the indispensable ''conservative complicities'' behind the fascist takeovers. Paxton debunks the consoling fiction that Mussolini and Hitler seized power. Rather, conservative elites desperate to subdue leftist populist movements ''normalized'' the fascists by inviting them to share power. It was the mob that flocked to fascism, but the elites who elevated it. ''At each fork in the road, they choose the antisocialist solution,'' Paxton writes. King Victor Emmanuel III responded to Mussolini's ''gigantic bluff,'' the Black Shirt march on Rome, not by imposing martial law but by offering him the prime ministership. And in 1933 it was the ambitious German Catholic aristocrat Franz Von Papen, believing he would be the one who gained power, who arranged the deal that gave Hitler the chancellorship.
 Fascists never assumed power in countries where governing structures functioned ''tolerably well,'' where conservatives retained confidence or where local fascists remained ''pure'' by avoiding political compromise or elections. ''It was not enough to don a colored shirt, march about and beat up some local minority to conjure up the success of a Hitler or a Mussolini,'' Paxton writes. ''It took a comparable crisis, a comparable opening of political space, comparable skill at alliance building and comparable cooperation from existing elites.'' 
 Fascist movements and regimes are different from military dictatorships and authoritarian regimes. They seek not to exclude, but rather to enlist, the masses. They often collapse the distinction between the public and private sphere (eliminating the latter). In the words of Robert Ley, the head of the Nazi Labor Office, the only private individual who existed in Nazi Germany was someone asleep. And, crucially, their durability depends on their ability to remain in constant motion. It was this need to keep citizens intoxicated by fascism's dynamism that made Mussolini and Hitler see war as both desirable and necessary. ''War is to men,'' Mussolini insisted, ''as maternity is to women.''
 Paxton leaves his readers with a working definition of fascism: 
 ''A form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.''
 Fine-tuning definitions, however, is less important for the future than identifying and neutralizing fascist threats. This recognition will come, Paxton believes, ''not by checking the color of shirts'' but ''by understanding how past fascisms worked.'' We should ''not look for exact replicas, in which fascist veterans dust off their swastikas,'' he writes; nor should we look for hate crimes and extreme nationalist propaganda. Rather, we should address the conditions and the enablers -- political deadlocks in times of crises, and conservatives who want tougher allies and elicit support through nationalist and racist demagogy.
 For every official American attempt to link Islamic terrorism to fascism, there is an anti-Bush protest that applies the fascist label to Washington's nationalist rhetoric, assault on civil liberties and warmaking. Paxton's study has made it no less likely that the label will be appropriated. But the lasting contribution of this splendid book is to remind us that fascism, if it returns, will do so not simply because of a rousing leader, but because of his timid accomplices.

To the Editor:
 Frank Rich is absolutely correct that the cultural component in the growing disenchantment with the Iraqi war is nearly as important as the political one [''As the War Turns: A New Soap Opera,'' April 25). In a media-drenched world where news tickers are as ubiquitous as stock tickers, where a faked kidnapping in Wisconsin can unleash squadrons of helicopter news-ships (instead of gun-ships) in search of an evildoer, and where the celebrity-reality complex contributes a huge percentage to our gross domestic product, is it any wonder that attention spans are getting shorter?
 The number of Americans who think the situation in Iraq is going well, which Mr. Rich reports as having gone from 85 percent to 35 percent in about a year, may or may not be related to the sudden increase in American casualties. Perhaps it merely reflects an inverse relationship with the ratings of ''The Apprentice.'' How ironic that policies and programs which are geared for 15-second media sound bites and photo ops tend to bore the public when they actually last longer than their designated time frames, unlike reality shows that are packaged with finite schedules and perfectly scripted endings.

HEADLINE: Investment Engines in Search of Their Next Moves

BYLINE: By LAURA RICH

 BODY:
As far as John Doerr is concerned, the Internet frenzy of the late 1990's was not a bubble. No, to Mr. Doerr, a prominent venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, it was the ''Great American Boom.'' 
 ''It was a good thing,'' he said in an interview last month. ''It made the American economy bigger. It raised incomes for everybody. It made us more of a leader in the world in all respects.''
 Four years after the stock market plunged under the weight of lifeless dot-com stocks and other technology losers, Mr. Doerr is as upbeat about the potential of Internet start-ups as ever -- and now his faith will be rewarded with billions from Google, the Web search company, when it goes public. 
 In 1999, Mr. Doerr, on behalf of his firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, invested $12.5 million for a stake in Google that will probably be worth at least $3 billion -- perhaps more -- after Google sells stock to public investors this year. That is a gain of 240 times the original investment in five years and provides plenty of spare profit to offset the losses from other bets investors made in the same round of venture capital fund-raising. 
 ''John Doerr throws big darts at distant targets,'' said Jerry Kaplan, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur whose start-ups in the early 1990's, Go Corporation and Onsale.com, were flops backed by Kleiner through Mr. Doerr. ''Most miss, but when they hit, it's spectacular.''
 For Mr. Doerr, Google's spectacular success is fresh vindication of his ability to pick big winners. Since the dot.com bust, critics have questioned Mr. Doerr's boosterism of the Internet, which he famously called ''underhyped'' in the 1990's boom. 
 More recently, he raised eyebrows with his wildly optimistic predictions about the potential value of Segway, the maker of ''human transporters,'' which has yet to find more than a niche market for its gyroscope-guided scooters.
 Such disappointments certainly have not changed his views. 
 ''I think we still underappreciate the long-term potential'' of the Internet, he said matter-of-factly over bottled water at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington, where he was lobbying members of Congress to abandon initiatives he contends would hurt technology start-ups. 
 Mr. Doerr remains a huge presence in Silicon Valley despite his Internet losses. Entrepreneurs will always dream about becoming the next Amazon, the next Netscape, the next Compaq, the next Sun -- all of which received early backing from Kleiner. The firm, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., anchors the West Coast venture capital industry.
 Kleiner's flops are overshadowed by its financial successes. Mr. Doerr made an $8 million investment in Amazon for the firm that turned into $60 million when the company went public in 1997. His $5 million investment in Netscape Communications reaped $400 million for Kleiner. 
 Entrepreneurs who have received money from Kleiner said that Mr. Doerr's name lent a level of seriousness to their companies, and his connections and strategic vision improved their prospects. But they also note that the other, not-so-high-profile, partners of the firm are just as important. 
 ''John Doerr is well-known for his rigor on key results and defined objectives,'' said Bill Campbell, chairman of Intuit, which Kleiner first backed in 1990 with $5 million. ''But it really is partnership-oriented and different partners have different insights.'' 
 Mr. Doerr is adamant that what counts is the combined expertise of the 17 partners, not his status as a celebrity venture capitalist. 
 ''I'm part of a firm with lots of prominent partners,'' he said, adding that focusing on him would be misleading. ''One of the things that happened in the boom,'' he said, ''was too much attention was paid to venture capital and not enough to the entrepreneurs and innovators and scientists. And that is rightly where the action is.''
 In the last three years, Kleiner has added six partners, including Raymond J. Lane, the former president of the Oracle Corporation; Juliet Flint from Ramsey Beirne Associates, an executive search firm; and John Denniston, a former managing director at Salomon Smith Barney. 
 While Google is Kleiner's most visible investment now, the firm's $400 million KPCB XI fund will focus on six areas of investment. ''What we do at Kleiner Perkins,'' Mr. Doerr said, ''is we look for a fundamental and important technology breakthrough that will address a large, unserved market need.''
 In earlier funds, Kleiner has placed stakes in companies that make software and services for hand-held devices like PalmOne, the maker of Treo, and consumer-based enterprises like Blue Nile, an online diamond retailer, which may go public this year. 
 It also has invested $12 million in Linuxcare, a company that provides support to enterprises using Linux, the operating system that is distributed free.
 ''That's a freight train I wouldn't want to get in front of,'' said Mr. Doerr, explaining the importance to having a stake in a Linux-based venture. ''Probably get run over.''
 Another area of investment is next-generation semiconductor chips and technology. Alternative energy ventures are also of interest. ''The biggest trend on the earth is urbanization,'' Mr. Doerr said. ''We need clean water, clean distributed power and clean transportation.'' Kleiner has investments in this area but declined to name them. 
 Health care companies remain a priority. Mr. Doerr says that he is ''very excited about the Internet,'' and added that ''there's a revolution going on in health care.'' Kleiner has made several health investments, including information tech companies like Healtheon and ventures like Genomic Health, which Kleiner backed with $14 million in 2001.
 ''We're in early in all of those categories,'' said Brook Byers, the Kleiner partner who oversees many of the firm's health care investments. ''We're the geeks in the suits.''
 Entrepreneurs have been eager to win the backing of Kleiner and Mr. Doerr because of his connections and ability to turn their ideas into solid businesses. Of course, Kleiner has financed its share of duds. 
 Mr. Doerr's less successful picks include a $13.8 million stake made in 1998 in Homestore.com, an online real estate company. Several executives of Homestore have pleaded guilty to securities fraud in connection with the company's accounting practices. Homestore's shares rose as high as $138 in January 2000, fell below $1 in January 2003 and are now trading around $5. 
 Drugstore.com was another Kleiner investment that did not fare well. Kleiner invested $3.9 million in that company in 1999 as part of the KPCB IX fund. After a $90 million initial public offering in July 1999, the company's share's fell, hitting about $1 a share in March 2001. It now trades around $5 a share.
 Other prominent duds include a $2 million investment in Kibu, a teen-oriented content site that folded in 2000 and a $2.8 million investment in BroadBand Office, a real estate investment trust that bundled telecommunications services, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001 after two years in business.
 Indeed, KPCB IX, the fund that backed Kibu and Drugstore.com, has trailed far behind previous funds like KPCB VIII, begun in 1996, which had an internal rate of return of 286.6 percent, according to the University of California, which invests in these two funds. As of March 2003, KPCB IX, begun in 1999, had an internal rate of return of negative 23 percent. Kleiner's venture partner in Google, Sequoia Capital, meanwhile, has had an internal rate of return of negative 6.1 percent on the Sequoia IX fund, the university said.
 ''They all failed for different reasons,'' said Mr. Doerr of the companies that faltered. ''Most ventures fail, though I wouldn't say most Kleiner ventures fail.''
 Kleiner is taking a wager on ''social networking'' Internet sites. In February, Kleiner led a $3.7 million round in Visible Path, a company that offers a social-networking application for businesses, intended to capture the relationships between employees and a company's client base. And last July, Mr. Doerr led Kleiner's $5 million stake in Friendster.com. Other venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital and Mayfield are also investing in social networking companies. 
 Friendster offers personalized Web pages to members, who can link their pages to those of other members. The service is free. Mr. Doerr said the value of the company is in its customer base.
 ''All you have to do is look at the usage for a service like Friendster that connects people to people, and at the growth in the usage, and you know this is something that really matters, that people are going to use,'' he said. But critics say that social networking may never pan out as a viable business, and Mr. Doerr did not elaborate on how the company intends to make money. 
 But then, few thought stand-alone search engines could make money back in 1999 when Kleiner first invested in Google.
 ''It is the only company that prospered through the bust,'' said John Battelle, a Silicon Valley consultant who is writing a book on Internet search. Around the time the Walt Disney Company was completing its acquisition of Infoseek, it acquired a minority stake in a deal valued at $420 million in a bid to create a comprehensive Web portal. The project was abandoned in 2001.
 ''Kleiner has strong visionary folks,'' said Kim Smith, an entrepreneur whose firm, NewSchools Venture Fund, invests in education-related ventures and has received financial backing from Mr. Doerr and Mr. Byers.
 Other venture capitalists are less effusive about Google's prospects.
 ''Google is the current state of the art, but it could be replaced,'' said Timothy C. Draper, a partner at the Silicon Valley venture firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. ''I've got a new search in my office that will take on Google.''
 Mr. Doerr might not disagree. ''We still underappreciate the long-term potential of this amazing and ever-improving two-way form of communication that may be evolutionary in its impact on business, but is likely to be revolutionary in its impact on society, governments, policies, political campaigns,'' he said. ''We'll see. It's still early. I mean, it hasn't been all that long since you could point and click.''

HEADLINE: Online competitors are crowding the flower vendors for a piece of the Mother's Day market.

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
LOOKING for a Mother's Day gift? Log on to ... just about anywhere. The online pharmacist Drugstore.com has a Mother's Day gift shop. EBay is offering suggestions. Even the Web site of Orvis, a company known mostly for fly-fishing supplies, is featuring a Mother's Day section in its holiday gift guide.
 Over the last year, online merchants have begun competing more aggressively for gift shoppers, making major battlegrounds of second-tier gift-giving occasions like Valentine's Day, Mother's Day and Father's Day. 
 Web sites that had carved niches in the gift-giving category, like 1-800-Flowers.com, RedEnvelope.com and others have been forced to redouble their efforts to attract shoppers.
 ''Retailers understand now how lucrative the online gift-giving business is,'' said Carrie Johnson, an analyst for Forrester Research. ''They've all jumped on the bandwagon with e-mails, promotions, services like gift wrapping. It's clouding the message of the traditional gift-giving companies.''
 Luring gift shoppers at this time of the year is particularly important, Ms. Johnson said, because a retailer who handles the sale well may not only secure a repeat customer, but could turn the gift recipient into a customer, as well. 
 Conversely, if the gift arrives late or in substandard condition, retailers run the risk of ruining their chances of future business with two customers. 
 ''It's a rough market, for sure,'' Ms. Johnson said, ''but everybody wants in.''
 The threat is especially strong for floral sites like 1-800-Flowers.com; Provide Commerce, which operates Proflowers.com; and others, Ms. Johnson said, because they rely so heavily on Mother's Day for revenues. 
 ''We still own the same-day gift business,'' said Chris McCann, vice president for marketing at 1-800-Flowers.com. But the new competition has forced the company to refine its offerings.
 ''It's nuts. Who'd think of going to Drugstore.com to buy a gift for your mother? But they get some of their customers to do it,'' Mr. McCann said. ''Now that everyone has access to U.P.S. or FedEx, everybody's in the gifting business. Used to be, if you needed a gift on short notice, flowers were your only choice.''
 1-800-Flowers has had to focus more carefully on merchandise that differentiates the company from other gift sellers. To that end, the business has relied on a rather unusual approach. Since late 2002, 1-800-Flowers has conducted occasional surveys of 100,000 customers to help develop new products. Based on one survey, for instance, the company determined that it could sell floral gifts appropriate for summer parties. 
 1-800-Flowers.com subsequently designed what is known inside the company as the ''happy hour collection,'' including floral designs meant to look like oversized margaritas or martinis. 
 But in the first round of testing, the very customers who suggested the products refused to buy -- until the company reduced the arrangements to the size of actual martinis and amended its Web site description.
 To help further distance itself from the gift-giving competition, 1-800-Flowers is delving into territory last occupied by the defunct Kozmo.com, which hand-delivered items like ice cream and videos to customers who ordered online.
 Mr. McCann said his company was starting to stock its floral shop affiliates with goods like Godiva chocolates and other items, so when shoppers wake up Sunday morning to realize they've forgotten Mother's Day, the 1-800-Flowers.com site can arrange same-day delivery of gift packages, not just flowers. 
 The service will be available ''in many locations Sunday morning,'' Mr. McCann said. ''It's a matter of supply and demand, so we can't say how many.''
 No other retailers can do that, Mr. McCann said. ''Wal-Mart, Drugstore.com, Amazon, nobody. It's a great competitive advantage for us.''
 As more sites vie for gift shoppers, it's a given that marketing costs will rise for holidays outside of the Christmas season. But executives have run into an even more vexing problem: a dearth of advertising space on the most popular portal sites. 
 ''We notice that it's harder to get space now,'' said Allison May, chief executive of RedEnvelope.com. You have to get in there and duke it out a bit during the major events, no question.''
 Ms. May said that because the site had longstanding relationships with sites like Yahoo and MSN, it could more easily secure prime ad inventory during peak periods.
 So-called ''search advertising,'' where sites bid for the right to have their ads appear next to search results, also becomes considerably more expensive as holidays approach, Ms. May said. ''You'll spend pennies for certain search words, and for a specific event it might cost $2,'' she said.
 Or $2.26, to be exact. That's what it was costing FTD.com to hold the No.1 spot yesterday when someone typed ''Mother's Day Gifts'' into Yahoo's search box. RedEnvelope was holding the No.12 spot for $1.87, which it pays each time someone clicks on its link. (The ranking can change almost hourly.)
 RedEnvelope says it will refine its marketing in the coming months, to avoid getting lost in the swelling sea of competitors. 
 ''I don't think we've necessarily been doing a good job of articulating our message,'' Ms. May said. ''So the focus will be on differentiating ourselves as a gift authority.''
 Ms. May said the site would stress its selection-- 700 to 850 items, 70 percent of them exclusive to the site. ''We don't necessarily sell functional products,'' she said. ''We provide meaningful tokens for someone to be able to say 'I love you' to a person. That's why you give a gift.''
 As sellers of functional items increasingly dabble in Mother's Day gifts, though, they, too, are getting better at merchandising and marketing.
 Last year, Orvis.com introduced a Mother's Day gift guide that proved so successful it has returned this year in an expanded form.
 Rather than stocking the Mother's Day shop with fake bugs and fish hook sharpeners, the gift guide features items like watches, jackets and hats -- items Orvis has increasingly carried in recent years as it expands beyond its piscatorial roots. 
 According to John Rogers, Orvis's director of e-commerce, last year's gift guide included more ''snug-fitting clothes'' but the customers using the guide -- sons, presumably -- were either too smart or too timid to venture a guess as to their mom's size.
 Mr. Rogers said the Mother's Day promotion was a way to take some of the gift business that otherwise we might not have gotten. 
 ''People aren't coming to us right now for Mother's Day. They're coming mostly to buy for themselves,'' he said.
 ''But with this, we can catch someone who says 'That's right. I do need to shop for mom. Why not do it here?'''

HEADLINE: Rises in Fares and Costs Give Cabbies Mixed Feelings

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
The stickers on the car doors are new. The meters are recalibrated. The army of taxi drivers is eager, and wary.
 Starting today, a taxi ride in New York City costs more for the first time in eight years, as a fare increase of more than 25 percent took effect at 12:01 a.m. 
 The base fare for a ride in one of New York's 12,000 yellow cabs is now $2.50, up from $2, and the rate for every one-fifth of a mile rose to 40 cents from 30. Riders will also have to pay a new $1 dollar surcharge from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays, a fee intended to draw out more cabs during rush hour.
 For riders, an average cab ride of 2.6 miles now costs $8.30 -- $1.70 more than it used to. But the effects of the fare increase on the city's mostly immigrant taxi drivers are much muddier.
 Bruce Schaller, a taxi consultant who has analyzed past rate increases, said drivers stand to make 30 percent more. But in interviews, more than a dozen drivers said they feared they would take a hit. As they waited at clogged Midtown taxi stands and cruised for fares in Chelsea yesterday, drivers said they worried the increase would prompt lease fees to climb and ridership to drop, and would mean a sharp decrease in tips.
 ''It's not going to the drivers,'' said Babi Omer, who said that he has driven a leased cab for five years. Mr. Omer said the company he leases a cab from was raising its weekly fees by $200. ''It's going to the fleet, to the sharks,'' he said.
 When the Taxi and Limousine Commission approved the fare increase on March 30, it also increased by 8 percent the maximum a cab-leasing company can charge drivers. That increase, which varies according to the type of lease and among different companies, also took effect at 12:01 a.m. today. Driver after driver complained that weekly leases were going up $70 to $200, an increase they predicted would eat up the additional money they make from the higher fares.
 But Mr. Schaller, who was once the policy director for the Taxi and Limousine Commission, said nearly all taxi companies lease cars for less than the legal cap, which is rising to $666 from $617 per week on a single-shift medallion cab.
 ''The drivers are going to earn more money, no question about it,'' said the taxi commission chairman, Matthew W. Daus. ''For the first time, they're going to be able to earn a livable wage.''
 But there will be costs, Mr. Schaller said. He said ridership was likely to drop by a ''pretty typical'' 8 percent after the fare increase, and then gradually recover over time as taxi rates decrease relative to inflation.
 The president of the state Federation of Taxi Drivers, Fernando Mateo, said the fare increase was overdue, but worried about the largesse of New Yorkers. At a news conference yesterday outside the Port Authority Bus Terminal, he implored riders not to stop tipping drivers. 
 ''Do not penalize the drivers,'' he said. ''Be fair to your drivers. They need the tip.''
 Nazneen Rahman, who is studying medical technology in college and pores over cardiology textbooks between fares, said she expected that the increase in her lease would outweigh her profits from the fare increase.
 ''It's a mess,'' she said, as she sat parked yesterday afternoon on Avenue of the Americas near 16th Street. ''We are not happy at all.''
 Faizul Bivash, who has driven a taxi for two and a half years, pulled up to the bus terminal to pick up a fare. As he rolled through the taxi line he said some riders had told him that they planned to take the subway instead of paying the higher rates.
 On a good day, Mr. Bivash said, he can take home $120. Though he fears a bigger piece of that could go to the leasing companies or subway turnstiles, he said he had no choice but to wait and see.
 ''I don't have another job,'' he said. ''I have to keep driving.''

HEADLINE: In Tax Pitch, a Bid for Political Survival

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 30 

 BODY:
In his brief career in the private sector, James E. McGreevey was a lobbyist, working for Merck & Company, the pharmaceutical superpower, and its corporate goals.
 Now Mr. McGreevey is undertaking the biggest lobbying job of his career as governor, working for his new tax proposals and his own political survival. 
 He began on Thursday, delivering the proposals for property tax relief to a special session of the New Jersey Legislature. That evening he took the proposals to a building trades union hall in Perth Amboy. He resumed at 9 a.m. Friday, pitching his plan to hundreds of mayors in the basement of the Trenton War Memorial. 
 The governor's immediate fix -- raising income taxes for 28,500 wealthy households to finance bigger property tax rebates for two million households with incomes below $200,000 -- might not be so hard to sell. And his choice of a vehicle for long-term change -- a state constitutional convention to redraw the property tax system -- is a popular idea, according to polls.
 But even more than his legislative plan, the governor is selling himself, a battered incumbent looking at 18 months before the next election and approval ratings below 40 percent. He is having to explain his own conversion to two causes that he had dismissed repeatedly from the time he took office: the so-called millionaire's tax and the constitutional convention. ''This is it; this is make-or-break for him,'' said David Rebovich, the director of the Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University. Like many in Trenton, Mr. Rebovich said the governor's long-awaited response to New Jersey's galloping property taxes was his most important initiative yet. 
 ''The problem is not with the proposal, it's with the salesperson,'' Mr. Rebovich said. The question, he said, ''is whether or not the governor can convince folks that this did follow from careful analysis and wasn't pure political calculation.''
 Bret D. Schundler, the Republican who lost to Mr. McGreevey in 2001 and plans to run again next year, said: ''I think he said: 'I have to do something to make people vote for me again. Maybe I just use cold, hard cash to buy votes. Let me take from some people and give to other people.''' 
 Mr. McGreevey is now saying the words ''millionaire's tax'' -- although it applies to all income over $500,000 -- with some relish. He says his change of mind came about in response to President Bush's federal tax cuts, which he says saved $19,000 for each New Jersey household earning $500,000, and $40,000 for those with incomes of $1 million. 
 In addition, the governor said in an interview on Friday, ''economic growth in New Jersey is now relatively solid and stable, so such a marginal increase would not have a deleterious impact.''
 As for the constitutional convention, Mr. McGreevey said, ''I was a late convert to the idea.'' 
 He made property taxes a principal theme in both his 1997 and 2001 campaigns, but in his first two years in office, the governor offered no proposals beyond scoldings to municipal officials about their spending habits. In those two years, property taxes rose 13 percent. And in his struggles to balance the state budget, he cut rebates to homeowners.
 To draw attention to his new plan, Mr. McGreevey, not known for schmoozing with legislators, is instead bringing his famously inexhaustible campaign style to the task. On Friday, he went from the mayors to a ribbon-cutting ceremony at a veterans home and spent the afternoon on three interviews for weekend television programs and a live radio program. His schedule included five speeches from Friday to Monday, and on Tuesday, at a household in Paramus, he will kick off a series of living-room meetings with voters.
 Mr. McGreevey sidesteps questions about how he will lobby fellow Democrats. They control both the Senate, by a 22-to-18 margin, and the General Assembly, 47 to 33. But the Senate president, Richard J. Codey, opposes a convention. At least one Democratic senator promises to vote against a tax increase, joining a Republican caucus almost certain to be lined up against the governor. 
 Since his speech on Thursday, Mr. McGreevey has been commended by many Democrats -- for signing on to their ideas. And worse, they speak privately about replacing Mr. McGreevey as the 2005 nominee, a prospect even more ominous if his property tax plan is less than a triumph.
 When asked about possible problems in the Legislature, Mr. McGreevey, characteristically on message, said: ''Ultimately these ideas will prevail. Legislators will understand the idea to provide immediate relief and also understand that a constitutional convention is perhaps the best mechanism for structural reform.'' 
 If the legislators do approve Mr. McGreevey's tax proposal, 800,000 households will receive bigger checks from the state rebate program for the elderly and disabled in July, and 1.3 million checks for other homeowners earning less than $200,000 will go out in the fall. 
 Even if the Legislature passes Mr. McGreevey's tax plan, Mr. Rebovich of the Rider Institute said, ''it's not clear he'll get the bounce he needs.''
 ''Swing voters will say, 'Thanks, but I really want to wait for the other shoe to drop.'''

HEADLINE: Turnaround In Advertising Doesn't Extend To Magazines

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
Now that an economic -- and advertising -- recovery is under way, David Carey, the publisher of the New Yorker, is eating very well, but for the wrong reasons.
 ''Often, I have two breakfasts, a lunch, and a dinner, sometimes even two dinners,'' said Mr. Carey, who, like a lot of publishers, is rushing to wine and dine enough advertisers to end 2004 even with last year. Staggering breakfast times and double dipping on dinner with marketers and ad agency officials has not been good for Mr. Carey's waistline, but he has managed to produce enough ad pages to match the comparative good old days of 1999.
 But even the Magazine Publishers' Diet has not kept the industry healthy. For the last nine months, the number of advertising pages in consumer magazines has declined, bucking broader trends and spreading frustration across the industry. 
 ''If the economic recovery has been jobless, then the advertising rebound has been pageless,'' said Jack Kliger, president and chief executive of Hachette Filipacchi Media, the owner of Elle, Car and Driver, Premiere and other consumer magazines. 
 Although overall advertising spending rose 6.1 percent last year, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, and is projected to rise 7.8 percent this year, magazine publishers are stuck to the bottom, watching as a rising tide lifts other boats. Cable television and Internet advertising each grew more than 15 percent last year. Revenue figures reported to the Publishers Information Bureau, which are more wishful thinking than reality, were said to have gone up 6.3 percent last year. But the bureau's more accurate advertising page figures show that after losing about 21 percent of its ad pages in 2001 and 2002, the magazine industry was flat in ad pages last year compared with 2002. And in the first quarter this year, ad pages have declined 2.3 percent. 
 ''I think we would all agree that we had anticipated a more robust advertising business in calendar '04 than we have experienced to date,'' said Stephen M. Lacy, president of Meredith Corporation's publishing group, which publishes women's magazines like Better Homes and Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal. ''There has been a tentative view of the economy among advertisers and a hesitancy to commit.'' 
 Several reasons underlie the lack of a recovery. Magazines historically lag behind a turnaround because the purchase of a magazine advertisement -- usually made months before publication -- cannot deliver an immediate jolt to sales. Increasingly, advertisers are looking for just that, and are delaying purchases of media until the last minute, further complicating the picture. And the publishing industry's primary appeal -- the ability to deliver specific groups of consumers with well-defined interests -- has suffered significant encroachment from the cable industry as it has developed magazinelike channels for every interest. The Web is beginning to deliver similar audiences and interactivity.
 It is not as if the magazine business is in danger of tipping over. At several companies, like Meredith, and many magazines, like Real Simple and Vanity Fair, the recession is a distant memory.
 But broad categories of magazines, particularly business magazines like Fortune and Forbes, that soared from all the technology and financial services advertising during the boom are still limping. And some magazines, including Glamour and Marie Claire, that depend on beauty and fashion ads are also struggling.
 The magazine industry has responded with some old tricks, like slashing prices or offering complete marketing programs, with events and contests, in addition to ad pages. Some new, contentious strategies, such as breaching the wall between editorial and advertising by trading editorial coverage for advertising dollars, are much discussed and never acknowledged.
 ''The line between editorial and advertising is becoming more and more blurred,'' said Eric Blankfein, director of media planning for Horizon Media, an advertising agency whose clients include the A&E Network and Earthlink. ''Publishers realize that brands need to be integrated into their products, which used to always be black and white. From my perspective, they have been way behind the times.'' 
 In a recent article in Advertising Age, a trade magazine, an executive from Sears pointed to product placement the company had received on television and suggested that products should become ''part of the story line'' in magazines.
 If advertising pages are tough to come by, making sure consumers see them carries its own challenge. 
 ''The government, through regulation, is cutting off our access to customers,'' Charles H. Townsend, chief executive of Conde Nast Publications. ''They are limiting e-mails to consumers, sweepstakes are more or less gone, and now we have do-not-call lists. It is almost as if they are trying to regulate us out of business.''
 Some wounds are self-inflected. At the end of last year, the much-publicized court case between Rosie O'Donnell and Gruner & Jahr USA Publishing featured testimony in open session that suggested that circulation figures had been manipulated. Daniel B. Brewster Jr., then chief executive of the company and the leader of the Magazine Publishers of America, the industry association, said at the time that Gruner & Jahr was engaging in practices that were common in the industry.
 ''This is an industry where the leader of the association stood up and said, 'Yes, I cheat, and others do as well,''' said Kent Brownridge, general manager of Wenner Media. ''In any other industry, he would have been found groaning and bleeding at the bottom of 70-foot cliff.'' Careful advertisers are scrutinizing magazine circulation more than ever.
 Even setting aside credibility questions about how many readers magazines actually deliver, many people in the advertising business think that the collective pitch of magazines is tired.
 ''We are getting a fair amount of bland presentations,'' said Steve Greenberger, director of print media at Zenith Media. ''Many publishers are just throwing their sales people at media buyers in the hope that something will stick, as opposed to coming up with marketing programs that really work. The industry seems beleaguered right now.''
 But sometimes coming up with pitches replete with bells and whistles comes to naught.
 ''We sold a program called 'Fresh Faces,''' said Bruce Hallett, who recently resigned as president of Sports Illustrated to write a novel. ''It was essentially a model search for the swimsuit issue next year that included bringing advertisers to those sites. Jeff Price, our executive director of marketing, went to California five times and eventually sold it to Mazda. And then it went to Japan and got killed in a budget cut. It was a great program, very time-consuming to produce, with an enormous amount of creative effort, and we came up with a handful of sand.''
 Because many companies that buy advertising are just beginning to recover, most are interested in a quick hit that will have an immediate impact on sales in this quarter, not the kind of image-building at which magazines have historically excelled.
 ''When clients look at their dollars, they want instant returns, and that doesn't bode well for monthly, or even weekly, magazines,'' said Donny Deutsch, chief executive officer of Deutsch Inc., an advertising agency whose clients include Revlon, Snapple and Mitsubishi. 
 Media companies continue to generate ever more special-interest channels for topics like cooking and fishing, creating the kind of editorial contexts that advertisers crave and that have historically been the province of magazines.
 ''The Internet on the one hand and cable television on the other, in a lot of ways, are the ultimate in targeted magazines, except they move, they have sound, and they don't have closing dates,'' said Charlie Rutman, president of Carat USA Magazines. ''Magazines have not gone backwards, but they have stayed in the same position and other mediums are attacking them in very dynamic ways.'' 
 While overall advertising spending grew last year, some big marketers reduced the share they devoted to magazines. At Procter & Gamble, for example, magazines' share of ad spending fell to 31.4 percent last year from 34.7 percent in 2002, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR. At the same time, Procter & Gamble increased the share devoted to cable television to 27.8 percent from 26.9 percent, and raised the proportion that local and regional newspapers received to 2.5 percent from 1.4 percent. 
 ''I love magazines and think they continue to have an intimacy with the consumer that can be very powerful,'' Mr. Rutman said. ''But you can tell times are tough. Again and again, we will have magazine sales people who tell us that they just can't do business as a certain price, and we say 'Fine, we'll go with another magazine.' And two days later they will be back saying that maybe they can work with us after all.''
 Despite all the dismaying reports, magazine publishers remain an optimistic breed. 
 ''I don't think the sky is falling, but there are just a few more clouds than we would like to see,'' said Mr. Carey of The New Yorker. ''One rough period does not necessarily make a trend.''

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:

THE NARROWS
A Novel
By Michael Connelly
404 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $25.95.
 ''The Narrows,'' Michael Connelly's best crime novel since ''City of Bones,'' unfolds within his increasingly seductive world. Based in Los Angeles, it is an expanding realm of fictitious and real characters, of new narrative developments and ghostly echoes of earlier stories. Its central concerns remain the stuff of detective stories. But more and more, this place has come to resemble Mr. Connelly's version of Middle Earth.
 To be sure there are plenty of mystery writers who devise recurring characters and let their paths cross. But Mr. Connelly's central figures are becoming more mythic than most, not only for their single-minded decency but also for the stubborn resilience they display. Even when the author waxes a shade purple about the nature of evil, his vision remains rivetingly spare.
 The battle under way in Mr. Connelly's books is best illustrated here by a girl named Maddie Bosch in a drawing of her father, Harry. It's a picture of Harry battling a demon. ''In the picture,'' he notices, ''my daughter had put a smile on my face.''
 It is well known to Mr. Connelly's increasingly devoted following that Harry is actually named Hieronymus Bosch, after the painter. ''Some say he was crazy,'' Harry explains. ''Some say he accurately foretold the future.'' 
 Harry certainly has a prophetic side, to the extent that he can predict how reluctant certain supercriminals are to go away. In ''The Narrows'' he is once again on the trail of a villainous ex-F.B.I. agent who supposedly died several books ago. Hah.
 This serial killer's nickname is the Poet, and he is one of several established Connelly characters to reappear now. Another is Terry McCaleb, a vital presence in ''The Narrows,'' even though he happens to be dead. As Harry explains, McCaleb became something of a celebrity after Clint Eastwood played him in the film version of ''Blood Work.'' Harry didn't see this movie, but he and some of the Connelly creations who were ill treated by its screenplay do some grousing here. It is also mentioned, in strangely credible fashion, that the real Mr. Eastwood showed up at the fictitious character's funeral.
 ''The Narrows'' reels in Harry with a request from McCaleb's widow that Harry investigate her husband's death. When last seen Harry was terminally disillusioned with police work and ready to give it up. But it's fair to assume that none of Mr. Connelly's devotees took that prospect seriously. So Harry starts off unemployed, a free agent who winds up in the midst of an F.B.I. murder investigation. In a diabolical twist, the Poet has engineered a way to commit federal crimes, the better to torment his former colleagues.
 That's all this book needs to get started. The rest follows from this basic setup, and from the author's self-evident heart and soul. Mr. Connelly has planted Harry in Las Vegas this time, not only because that's where Maddie and her mother live but also because of the contrast with Los Angeles, which suddenly looks positively cheery to Harry compared with Nevada. 
 ''I thought about all the people who had moved here on the family ticket,'' he thinks, looking at a billboard featuring naked showgirls, ''only to have that ticket punched with this and ten thousand billboards just like it after they got here.''
 Without jeopardizing his broodiness or noir storytelling cachet, Mr. Connelly manages to endorse not only family values but also bibliophily. Books are mentioned collegially here. (There are passing references to the author's fellow mystery writers Ian Rankin, George Pelecanos and Dean Koontz.) And a bookstore figures significantly in the well-constructed mystery plot. ''Harry, when's the last time you read a book?'' the proprietor asks him. 
 The Poet's case has supposedly spawned several nonfiction volumes; and then of course there is his nickname. During this story's wild denouement, the Poet torments one victim by reading ''The Raven.''
 ''The Narrows'' takes its name from a dangerous part of the Los Angeles River and prompts the requisite metaphorical warnings. (''Stay out of the narrows.'') Like ''City of Bones,'' it's a title with more quiet eloquence than may first be apparent. That's the way Mr. Connelly works: in a style so simple, blunt and knowing that its impact is almost subconscious. But sleepless readers of ''The Narrows'' will know why Harry Bosch is said to have ''seen-it-all-twice eyes.''
 ''The Narrows'' imports the tough, likable F.B.I. agent Rachel Walling from an earlier novel. And it gives Harry a better, more matter-of-fact rapport with her than he generally has with women. ''The Narrows'' isn't brusque or lacking in emotion, but it's a book that has a lot more to do than trump up an ancillary romantic subplot. Only as the story picks up steam in its final sections does Mr. Connelly show any awkwardness in juxtaposing Harry's first-person narration with Rachel's third-person point of view.
 Although ''The Narrows'' is linked by long tentacles to this author's other novels, it works perfectly well on its own. Mr. Connelly is good at succinctly explaining what has happened earlier, and he fills in all the blanks. But ''The Narrows'' is so enveloping that it may send readers back to the early lives of these characters. Harry hasn't read any crime stories lately, but Mr. Connelly's admirers may wind up reading a lot of them.

HEADLINE: Son of Late Dictator Is Elected The Next President of Panama

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: PANAMA, May 2 

 BODY:
More than 14 years after the end of authoritarian rule, voters here elected the son of a former military dictator on Sunday as Panama's next president.
 Martin Torrijos, 40, is the heir of a political party that was built by military strongmen, including his father, Gen. Omar Torrijos, a populist dictator who ruled the country from 1968 to until his death in 1981; and Manuel Antonio Noriega, whose violent government was overthrown by American troops at the end of 1989. 
 Mr. Torrijos, who was educated in the United States, campaigned skillfully as both a reverent son, and the leader of a new generation of Panamanian politicians. In urban ghettos and among rural peasants, he embraced the memories of his father as a champion of the poor and the visionary who negotiated the treaty by which the United States gave this country control of the Panama Canal.
 Mr. Torrijos, who will replace President Mireya Moscoso, vowed to keep up the fight against the corruption and unequal distribution of wealth that has plagued Panama through most of its 100-year history. At the same time, however, he distanced himself from his party's past misdeeds, vowing to uphold democracy, protect human rights and defend freedom of expression.
 ''I hope that people vote thinking of the future, about their families and the needs of the country,'' Mr. Torrijos said after visiting his father's crypt, and then casting his ballot on Sunday morning.
 Mr. Torrijos's closest rival in the balloting, former President Guillermo Endara, conceded defeat late Sunday night. With some 40 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Torrijos held about 47 percent of the balloting, with Mr. Endara holding about 30 percent. 
 These were the first political contests since the United States handed over control of the Panama Canal and withdrew 10,000 troops. The elections were energized by a wave of young voters -- an estimated 15 percent of the 1.9 million people registered -- casting the first ballots of their lives.
 Among them were Erica and Yasunari MacFarlane, who have college degrees in tourism and hotel administration. But they are among the estimated 14 percent of Panamanians who are unemployed.
 They said they had supported Mr. Torrijos because he was a young candidate with fresh ideas for bringing more visitors to Panama and creating new jobs. Luis Arias, 52, also supported Mr. Torrijos.
 ''Dictatorships are a thing of the past, and democracy has been synonymous with corruption,'' he said. ''I voted for a man who cares about the needs of the people. I do not care about his father.''
 Others, like the political analyst Miguel Antonio Bernal, lamented that the campaigns had produced no real debate about the issues that divide this society into a small class of haves and masses of have-nots. Mr. Bernal said he had held his nose and cast his ballot for Mr. Endara, whom he considered the least offensive of the presidential candidates.
 Hector Endara, a director at the church-based organization Caritas who is not related to the candidate, cast a blank ballot.
 ''I think it is the most concrete way to show that no single candidate represents the interests of the people,'' he said. ''We should not expect anything to change.''

HEADLINE: Poland's Prime Minister Is Replaced

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WARSAW, May 2 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Leszek Miller of Poland, whose government was paralyzed because of corruption scandals and his lack of personal popularity, resigned Sunday. He was replaced by Marek Belka, 51, the country's former finance minister. 
 Mr. Belka promised to push ahead with tough reforms and keep supporting the United States in Iraq.
 ''We begin our mission at a special time,'' he said, referring to Pland's joining the European Union on Saturday. ''It's a turning point in Polish history.''
 Mr. Belka, was sworn in by President Aleksander Kwasniewski at the presidential palace, although he still needs parliamentary approval.
 Addressing one of Mr. Miller's major problems, Mr. Belka said job creation ''will be the first and main task of our government,'' and that the country's 20 percent unemployment rate was ''the source of all evil.''
 Favored by the business community for his fiscal austerity, Mr. Belka also promised that Poland would put its new subsidies -- as much as $3.7 billion to help it modernize -- to good use.
 Mr. Belka, who recently completed a term as director for economic policy for the American-led provisional authority in Baghdad, has said he will continue Mr. Miller's support of the American mission in Iraq, where Poland has 2,400 soldiers and leads the multinational force.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Losing Its Dominance In the Sciences

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
The United States has started to lose its worldwide dominance in critical areas of science and innovation, according to federal and private experts who point to strong evidence like prizes awarded to Americans and the number of papers in major professional journals.
 Foreign advances in basic science now often rival or even exceed America's, apparently with little public awareness of the trend or its implications for jobs, industry, national security or the vigor of the nation's intellectual and cultural life.
 ''The rest of the world is catching up,'' said John E. Jankowski, a senior analyst at the National Science Foundation, the federal agency that tracks science trends. ''Science excellence is no longer the domain of just the U.S.''
 Even analysts worried by the trend concede that an expansion of the world's brain trust, with new approaches, could invigorate the fight against disease, develop new sources of energy and wrestle with knotty environmental problems. But profits from the breakthroughs are likely to stay overseas, and this country will face competition for things like hiring scientific talent and getting space to showcase its work in top journals. 
 One area of international competition involves patents. Americans still win large numbers of them, but the percentage is falling as foreigners, especially Asians, have become more active and in some fields have seized the innovation lead. The United States' share of its own industrial patents has fallen steadily over the decades and now stands at 52 percent. 
 A more concrete decline can be seen in published research. Physical Review, a series of top physics journals, recently tracked a reversal in which American papers, in two decades, fell from the most to a minority. Last year the total was just 29 percent, down from 61 percent in 1983.
 China, said Martin Blume, the journals' editor, has surged ahead by submitting more than 1,000 papers a year. ''Other scientific publishers are seeing the same kind of thing,'' he added.
 Another downturn centers on the Nobel Prizes, an icon of scientific excellence. Traditionally, the United States, powered by heavy federal investments in basic research, the kind that pursues fundamental questions of nature, dominated the awards.
 But the American share, after peaking from the 1960's through the 1990's, has fallen in the 2000's to about half, 51 percent. The rest went to Britain, Japan, Russia, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and New Zealand.
 ''We are in a new world, and it's increasingly going to be dominated by countries other than the United States,'' Denis Simon, dean of management and technology at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, recently said at a scientific meeting in Washington.
 Europe and Asia are ascendant, analysts say, even if their achievements go unnoticed in the United States. In March, for example, European scientists announced that one of their planetary probes had detected methane in the atmosphere of Mars -- a possible sign that alien microbes live beneath the planet's surface. The finding made headlines from Paris to Melbourne. But most Americans, bombarded with images from America's own rovers successfully exploring the red planet, missed the foreign news.
 More aggressively, Europe is seeking to dominate particle physics by building the world's most powerful atom smasher, set for its debut in 2007. Its circular tunnel is 17 miles around.
 Science analysts say Asia's push for excellence promises to be even more challenging.
 ''It's unbelievable,'' Diana Hicks, chairwoman of the school of public policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said of Asia's growth in science and technical innovation. ''It's amazing to see these output numbers of papers and patents going up so fast.''
 Analysts say comparative American declines are an inevitable result of rising standards of living around the globe.
 ''It's all in the ebb and flow of globalization,'' said Jack Fritz, a senior officer at the National Academy of Engineering, an advisory body to the federal government. He called the declines ''the next big thing we will have to adjust to.''
 The rapidly changing American status has not gone unnoticed by politicians, with Democrats on the attack and the White House on the defensive.
 ''We stand at a pivotal moment,'' Tom Daschle, the Senate Democratic leader, recently said at a policy forum in Washington at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the nation's top general science group. ''For all our past successes, there are disturbing signs that America's dominant position in the scientific world is being shaken.''
 Mr. Daschle accused the Bush administration of weakening the nation's science base by failing to provide enough money for cutting-edge research.
 The president's science adviser, John H. Marburger III, who attended the forum, strongly denied that charge, saying in an interview that overall research budgets during the Bush administration have soared to record highs and that the science establishment is strong.
 ''The sky is not falling on science,'' Dr. Marburger said. ''Maybe there are some clouds -- no, things that need attention.'' Any problems, he added, are within the power of the United States to deal with in a way that maintains the vitality of the research enterprise.
 Analysts say Mr. Daschle and Dr. Marburger can both supply data that supports their positions.
 A major question, they add, is whether big spending automatically translates into big rewards, as it did in the past. During the cold war, the government pumped more than $1 trillion into research, with a wealth of benefits including lasers, longer life expectancies, men on the Moon and the prestige of many Nobel Prizes.
 Today, federal research budgets are still at record highs; this year more than $126 billion has been allocated to research. Moreover, American industry makes extensive use of federal research in producing its innovations and adds its own vast sums of money, the combination dwarfing that of any other nation or bloc.
 But the edifice is less formidable than it seems, in part because of the nation's costly and unique military role. This year, financing for military research hit $66 billion, higher in fixed dollars than in the cold war and far higher than in any other country.
 For all the spending, the United States began to experience a number of scientific declines in the 1990's, boom years for the nation's overall economy.
 For instance, scientific papers by Americans peaked in 1992 and then fell roughly 10 percent, the National Science Foundation reports. Why? Many analysts point to rising foreign competition, as does the European Commission, which also monitors global science trends. In a study last year, the commission said Europe surpassed the United States in the mid-1990's as the world's largest producer of scientific literature.
 Dr. Hicks of Georgia Tech said that American scientists, when top journals reject their papers, usually have no idea that rising foreign competition may be to blame.
 On another front, the numbers of new doctorates in the sciences peaked in 1998 and then fell 5 percent the next year, a loss of more than 1,300 new scientists, according to the foundation.
 A minor exodus also hit one of the hidden strengths of American science: vast ranks of bright foreigners. In a significant shift of demographics, they began to leave in what experts call a reverse brain drain. After peaking in the mid-1990's, the number of doctoral students from China, India and Taiwan with plans to stay in the United States began to fall by the hundreds, according to the foundation.
 These declines are important, analysts say, because new scientific knowledge is an engine of the American economy and technical innovation, its influence evident in everything from potent drugs to fast computer chips. 
 Patents are a main way that companies and inventors reap commercial rewards from their ideas and stay competitive in the marketplace while improving the lives of millions.
 Foreigners outside the United States are playing an increasingly important role in these expressions of industrial creativity. In a recent study, CHI Research, a consulting firm in Haddon Heights, N.J., found that researchers in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea now account for more than a quarter of all United States industrial patents awarded each year, generating revenue for their own countries and limiting it in the United States.
 Moreover, their growth rates are rapid. Between 1980 and 2003, South Korea went from 0 to 2 percent of the total, Taiwan from 0 to 3 percent and Japan from 12 to 21 percent.
 ''It's not just lots of patents,'' Francis Narin, CHI's president, said of the Asian rise. ''It's lots of good patents that have a high impact,'' as measured by how often subsequent patents cite them.
 Recently, Dr. Narin added, both Taiwan and Singapore surged ahead of the United States in the overall number of citations. Singapore's patents include ones in chemicals, semiconductors, electronics and industrial tools.
 China represents the next wave, experts agree, its scientific rise still too fresh to show up in most statistics but already apparent. Dr. Simon of Rensselaer said that about 400 foreign companies had recently set up research centers in China, with General Electric, for instance, doing important work there on medical scanners, which means fewer skilled jobs in America.
 Ross Armbrecht, president of the Industrial Research Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington that represents large American companies, said businesses were going to China not just because of low costs but to take advantage of China's growing scientific excellence.
 ''It's frightening,'' Dr. Armbrecht said. ''But you've got to go where the horses are.'' An eventual danger, he added, is the slow loss of intellectual property as local professionals start their own businesses with what they have learned from American companies.
 For the United States, future trends look challenging, many analysts say.
 In a report last month, the American Association for the Advancement of Science said the Bush administration, to live up to its pledge to halve the nation's budget deficit in the next five years, would cut research financing at 21 of 24 federal agencies -- all those that do or finance science except those involved in space and national and domestic security.
 More troubling to some experts is the likelihood of an accelerating loss of quality scientists. Applications from foreign graduate students to research universities are down by a quarter, experts say, partly because of the federal government's tightening of visas after the 2001 terrorist attacks.
 Shirley Ann Jackson, president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, told the recent forum audience that the drop in foreign students, the apparently declining interest of young Americans in science careers and the aging of the technical work force were, taken together, a perilous combination of developments.
 ''Who,'' she asked, ''will do the science of this millennium?''
 Several private groups, including the Council on Competitiveness, an organization in Washington that seeks policies to promote industrial vigor, have begun to agitate for wide debate and action.
 ''Many other countries have realized that science and technology are key to economic growth and prosperity,'' said Jennifer Bond, the council's vice president for international affairs. ''They're catching up to us,'' she said, warning Americans not to ''rest on our laurels.''

HEADLINE: A Conductor Weakens, but What of the Music?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
The conductor James Levine, who has been in charge of musical matters at the Metropolitan Opera since 1976, has countless admirers, and they have long been concerned about his health. Taking curtain calls after Met performances these days, he looks portly, red-faced, unsteady on his feet and exhausted, though alarmists must ask themselves how they would look after conducting something like Wagner's ''Gotterdammerung,'' a six-hour endurance test.
 But the level of concern is sure to rise now that orchestra members, who revere Mr. Levine, 60, as a total musician, have begun, however regretfully, to voice their concerns about his diminished agility and lapses in concentration.
 The topic is indeed the ''elephant in the room'' that no one has wanted to talk about, to quote one player's anonymous comments to my colleague Robin Pogrebin in an article published Saturday in The New York Times. In that article, Mr. Levine for the first time discussed the problems he has been grappling with, especially the tremor in his left arm and leg and the medication he takes to control it, and responded to the concerns of some of his musicians. 
 But before Met fans or administrators panic, some perspective is called for. Although conducting requires mental and physical stamina, the job is hardly limited to those who fit the standard image of the kinetic and charismatic wizard of the podium, like the young Finnish firebrand Esa-Pekka Salonen of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Some of the greatest conducting of the last 100 years was done by aging and physically enfeebled maestros who still inspired orchestras through their insights and uncanny abilities to convey intention with economical hand gestures, facial expressions and sheer presence.
 Otto Klemperer, a colossal figure, did some of his most important work during the 1960's, having survived more than 20 years of poor health that started with surgery for a brain tumor in 1939. 
 The eminent Fritz Reiner, famous for conducting with his eyes, as the critics used to say, employed such a minimal roster of hand cues that from the audience's perspective it often seemed he was not conducting at all. Yet there would be the Chicago Symphony Orchestra playing with the blazing energy and utter precision that Reiner elicited until his death at 74 in 1963.
 Conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra at Carnegie Hall this January, Wolfgang Sawallisch, an octogenarian suffering from health problems and fatigue, sat on a tall conductor's chair for a performance of Bruckner's daunting 80-minute Symphony No. 5. Yet the playing was so luminous and inexorable it seemed that Mr. Sawallisch was not just performing but channeling Bruckner.
 Many people who attended a memorial concert at Carnegie Hall for Robert J. Harth on April 15 were dismayed to see a nearly immobile Mr. Levine slumped in a chair as he conducted some Met orchestra musicians in a performance of the slow movement from Bach's Concerto for Two Violins and Orchestra. But as performed on that occasion with just a small roster of players, the Bach was essentially a chamber work for which the players did not really need a conductor. 
 Mr. Levine just kept an eye on things. To beat time at these excellent musicians might have seemed insulting, and his presence can be seen as mostly a gesture of respect to Mr. Harth, the artistic and executive director of Carnegie Hall.
 Still, for New Yorkers these days, watching Mr. Levine at work provides quite a contrast to Lorin Maazel at the New York Philharmonic, who, 14 years older at 74, conducts with as much physical animation, tireless energy and masterly technique as ever.
 If the only problem with Mr. Levine's diminished physical agility is his need to sit when he conducts and rely on economical hand cues, this hardly matters. But if his attention is slipping or if he is losing focus as long performances wear on, that's different. Some musicians report that his energy level goes up and down. And when it's down, they say, he slumps in his chair and is hard to see or follow.
 But the musical results are what count, and the level of Mr. Levine's work remains highly impressive. How can that be in light of the complaints from some of the musicians? Though the orchestra players are the only experts on what it's like to work with Mr. Levine, they are not necessarily the best judges of their own playing.
 From my days as a pianist who performed lots of chamber music, I know, as do all musicians, that you can't be sure of how a performance is coming across. Sometimes, when everything seems to be going splendidly -- few mistakes, no tension -- the music making may actually be a little placid. And sometimes, though the work at hand was rehearsed thoroughly, the performance feels precarious, even on the verge of splitting apart. Yet to the audience the playing may have an edge-of-the-seat intensity.
 I was especially struck by the comments of one Met orchestra player about the performances of Schoenberg's gnarly, complex and visionary opera ''Moses und Aron'' in December. 
 ''He just wasn't there,'' the musician was quoted as saying of Mr. Levine. ''The notes are going by, and we're looking up and thinking, 'He's just trying to keep it steady.' ''
 What can I tell you? I found the performance I heard exhilarating. No one expects to hear this dense and complex 12-tone score executed with Mozartean clarity. 
 The music heaves and surges, and if a sense of struggle comes through in the playing, in a way it's appropriate to the music.
 The majority of the players in the orchestra have been working with Mr. Levine for many years, and by now they have an almost symbiotic relationship. Over the years he has taken the orchestra to glorious highs. The Met musicians are so enormously accomplished and experienced they may not realize how involving and impressive they are even when feeling uncomfortably on their own.
 Mr. Levine's lithe and vibrant performance of ''Don Giovanni'' when the Met's new production was introduced in March, and his undulant and playful account of Rossini's ''Italiana in Algeri'' in February, were highlights of recent months at the Met. Since the mid-1980's his tempos in Wagner's ''Ring'' operas have become noticeably, some would say provocatively, slower. 
 With his recent performances, though, he seemed to be trying for greater fleetness and a more rhapsodic approach to these formidable scores, without altering his basic conception. It's certainly true that this time around the playing of the orchestra was more prone to mishaps and less incisive than in the past. 
 Still, Mr. Levine is offering Met audiences a radiant and important interpretation of this incomparable work. Audiences have been responding with ardent ovations, especially, it has seemed to me, for Mr. Levine.
 For someone with health concerns Mr. Levine continues to maintain a worrisomely punishing schedule. While in the midst of conducting three full cycles of Wagner's ''Ring,'' he is rehearsing the orchestra in two demanding concert programs that will be performed later this month at Carnegie Hall. And starting in the fall he takes on the directorship of the Boston Symphony. You cannot blame Boston-area music lovers who are counting on Mr. Levine to energize the orchestra for being concerned.
 Even a conductor in top-notch health would have trouble keeping to such a schedule. Mr. Levine is going to have to asses honesty what he realistically can continue to handle. It's significant that he will not conduct during the opening three weeks of concerts for his first season as the music director of the Boston Symphony because he was long ago committed to the Met. The reductions he will have to make in his schedule, it seems to me, must come from his dates at the Met. He cannot take on an orchestra as historic and important as Boston's without fully committing himself.
 Still, I'd rather hear James Levine working at 80 percent or 90 percent of his capacity than most of today's conductors working at full tilt.

HEADLINE: UBS Violated Fed Contract

 BODY:
UBS, Europe's largest bank by assets violated an agreement with the Federal Reserve over the distribution of dollars, a UBS spokesman, Christoph Meier, said on Sunday, according to Bloomberg News.
 The Federal Reserve ended its contract with UBS for the distribution of dollars after discovering that currency had been transferred to countries that are under a United States trade embargo, according to Peter Bakstansky, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 Mr. Bakstansky said that the Federal Reserve was working with the Swiss banking authorities and was expected to take some action against UBS in the near future. 
 The Swiss bank has taken disciplinary measures by firing several employees involved in sending the bills to embargoed countries. The countries include developing nations like Middle Eastern states, but do not include Iraq, Mr. Meier told Bloomberg News.

HEADLINE: Hoping to Attract Callers to the Internet

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON And MATT RICHTEL; Matt Richtel reported for this article from San Francisco.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, May 2 

 BODY:
Some of America's biggest telecommunications companies are meeting here this week to discuss how best to provide phone services to consumers. It will not be telephone companies talking, though, but cable providers.
 The effort by the cable companies to make deeper inroads into telephone services by using Internet technology will be the No.1 topic at the industry's annual trade show here that continues through Wednesday. There will be much backslapping given the success cable providers have had rolling out high-speed Internet, and they will be eager to show how their new Internet-based phone services that use those broadband connections will be just as triumphant. 
 But selling high-speed connections and phone services are two different things, and cable companies are certain to face an uphill climb beating the telephone industry in this latest contest. Many consumers still see high-speed Internet connections as a largely generic service, which they can buy from many different vendors.
 But choosing a phone service is a more emotional decision. Telephone companies have well-established brands and have been reliable providers of voice calls for decades. Cable companies are still viewed, not as phone providers, but in terms of the television programming they offer.
 Moreover, phone calling over the Internet is relatively new, and providers of all types are still working out the technological flaws as well as customer and billing services. Those gaps in service may alienate customers, analysts said, if cable companies introduce Internet calling too quickly.
 ''Depending on the cable provider, the quality of the telephony is all over the map and bad news travels by word of mouth faster than good news,'' Lisa Pierce, vice president at Forrester Research, said. But that risk has not stopped the cable companies from introducing Internet phone services. With all the promotion surrounding the technology and its potential to lower phone bills substantially, the cable providers do not want to be beaten by AT&T, Qwest and other telephone companies that have started Internet calling options and start-ups like Vonage, which entered the nascent market two years ago. 
 Cable companies are also eager to recoup some of the roughly $75 billion they spent in the last few years to upgrade their networks so they could offer Internet calling and other digital services.
 Though the cable network has been in place for a while, selling Internet calling broadly became more possible when the telephone switches needed to best deploy the technology became commercially available. In December, Time Warner Cable, the nation's second-largest cable company after Comcast, announced plans to make Internet phone service available by the end of this year in all 31 markets it serves. 
 Cablevision Systems also announced an ambitious program, and signed up 29,000 customers in the last two months of 2003. The company said it was increasing subscriptions by 2,500 a week.
 Cox Communications began its first Internet phone service in Roanoke, Va., last year and it expects to introduce the service in other small and midsize markets in the coming months. (Cox will, however, continue to offer phone service through an older circuit-switched technology in larger markets where denser concentrations of customers make using that technology more feasible. )
 Cox added 78,959 customers to its phone services in the first quarter of this year, 37 percent more than in the period a year ago, with most new customers receiving circuit-switched calls. In any event, Cox, the industry leader, has one million phone customers, a small number compared with the big local phone companies.
 ''A lot of customers don't know cable companies offer telephony,'' said David Pugliese, the vice president for product marketing and management at Cox Communications.
 Still, cable industry executives say the real growth will start in 2005, when Internet phone services are available in more markets. Encouragingly, too, they say, customers who order telephone service with their cable and Internet connections are 50 percent less likely to switch providers.
 ''We get more from a telephony halo effect,'' Mr. Pugliese said, referring to the high retention rate of cable consumers who choose cable telephone service.
 Cox and other cable companies are also eager to promote their reliability. Unlike other Internet phone service providers that use the public Internet to transmit calls over phone networks, cable companies use their own cable lines. This allows them to offer better quality control of calls traveling on their networks.
 ''We can prioritize the voice bits so they are not interfered with, so you get excellent quality,'' said Tom Rutledge, the chief operating officer at Cablevision Systems.
 Cable companies also note that they offer consumers convenient installation through regular cable company workers. And like the telephone companies, they charge flat fees for unlimited local and long-distance calls connected via the Internet, along with added features like caller ID.
 Still, offering innovative technology is no guarantee that customers will cut their ties to their traditional telephone companies, analysts say. To get customers to switch, the cable industry will have to spend a lot of money marketing Internet telephony even as they are introducing other services like video on demand and digital video recorders.
 ''If you're a cable operator, there are five or six things happening,'' said Adi Kishore, a cable industry analyst at the Yankee Group. ''With a lot of things going on, it's a matter of where you want to focus.''

PERSON: Dr. Arthur J. Naparstek

HEADLINE: A.J. Naparstek, 65, Public Housing Expert

BYLINE: By LILY KOPPEL

 BODY:
Dr. Arthur J. Naparstek, an expert on urban redevelopment whose ideas for rebuilding Cleveland's impoverished neighborhoods became the model for a federal program, died April 24 at University Hospitals of Cleveland. He was 65. 
 The cause was complications from lung cancer, said his son Aaron.
 Dr. Naparstek was a professor of social work and a former dean of the Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. 
 Dr. Naparstek's work helped redefine the function of public housing through community building. In the early 1990's, Dr. Naparstek, appointed director of the Cleveland Foundation Commission on Poverty, edited and directed the drafting of the commission's report, ''The Cleveland Community-Building Initiative: The Report and Recommendations of the Cleveland Foundation Commission on Poverty.'' The study became the foundation for the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development's Urban Revitalization Demonstration Act of 1993, known as HOPE IV. 
 ''He was not just dealing with the bricks and mortar, but with the whole aspect of community,'' said Sunia Zaterman, the executive director of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities. 
 The multibillion-dollar HUD program brought local community leaders and tenants to the table by giving them a role in creating the revitalization plans for their dilapidated housing projects and more control over operations.
 ''By building community, we are talking about people forming relationships,'' Dr. Naparstek said in a radio interview in 2000 on the National Public Radio show ''Public Interest with Kojo Nnamdi.'' ''People are poor because they lack relationships with people who have access to resources and power.''
 The initiative takes into consideration the social and physical aspects of the environment. Critics of the program have said its emphasis on the demolition of housing resulted in the displacement of residents. 
 In the late 1960's, Dr. Naparstek was assistant to Richard G. Hatcher, then the mayor of Gary, Ind. President Jimmy Carter appointed Dr. Naparstek to the National Commission on Neighborhoods and the President's Commission on Mental Health's Task Panel on Community Support Systems. In 1994, President Bill Clinton appointed him to the Corporation for National Service. He was a co-author of four books and published many articles about the importance of community building and mental health in public policy. 
 In 1995, Dr. Naparstek was appointed to the Urban Institute in Washington as a senior associate directing the Institute's HOPE IV initiative.
 As co-chairman of the Jewish Community Federation of Cleveland's Partnership 2000 program, Dr. Naparstek applied his community-based model in Beit Sh'an, a city in northern Israel. In 1999, the mayor of the town and the Palestinian governor of Jenin met in Dr. Naparstek's home in Cleveland Heights to discuss the plan. 
 Dr. Naparstek, the son of Polish immigrants, was born in New York City and grew up in the Bronx and in Mount Vernon. In the 1940's, he was in a gang called the Ravens and learned how the neighborhood governed itself. ''The neighborhood had a thousand eyes,'' he said in the radio interview in 2000. A below-average student in high school, he defied expectations by attending college on a football scholarship to Illinois Wesleyan University. He went on to receive a master's degree from the Florence Heller School of Advanced Studies in Social Welfare Management at Brandeis University.
 In addition to his son Aaron, of Brooklyn, survivors include his wife of 38 years, Belleruth Naparstek of Cleveland Heights; a second son, Abram, of Pittsburgh; and a daughter, Keila, of St. Louis.


CORRECTION-DATE: May 4, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An obituary yesterday about Arthur J. Naparstek, a public housing expert whose work became the model for a federal Department of Housing and Urban Development program, misstated the program name. It is HOPE VI, not IV. The obituary also misidentified the degree he received from Brandeis University. It was his doctorate; his master's in social work was from New York University.

HEADLINE: With Longer Sentences, Cost of Fighting Crime Is Higher

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

 BODY:
The cost of fighting crime in the United States, for police, prisons and courts, rose to a record $167 billion in 2001, the latest year for which figures are available, according to a study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
 That is $20 billion more than was spent on the criminal justice system in 1999, the last time the Justice Department calculated the cost. It is also an increase of about 350 percent over 1982, when the total cost was $36 billion, the report said. Adjusted for inflation, the increase was about 150 percent. 
 The report, which was released yesterday, comes at a time when states are facing record budget deficits and both Republican and Democratic state legislators are beginning to take soaring prison costs seriously. In the last year, more than half the states took legislative steps to modify tough sentencing laws they passed in the 1990's, like scrapping mandatory minimum terms or requiring treatment instead of prison for first-time drug offenders, said Dan Wilhelm, director of the state sentencing and corrections program at the Vera Institute of Justice in New York.
 ''It is now becoming a bipartisan recognition of the magnitude of the challenge, given the incredibly punitive and expensive punishment system that has accumulated over the past 20 years,'' Mr. Wilhelm said. 
 The report highlights the crux of the problem.
 The number of arrests rose only to 13.7 million in 2001 from 12 million in 1982, and the number of court cases grew only to 92.8 million in 2001 from 86 million in 1984, the report found.
 But the number of state and federal prison inmates jumped to 1.3 million in 2001, up from only 488,000 in 1985. At the same time, the number of inmates in local and county jails tripled, to 631,000, the report said.
 The disproportionate growth in inmates over the past two decades reflects a decision by the public and politicians to become more punitive, sentencing more offenders to incarceration and for longer terms, said Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University. 
 ''As a society, we became much more punitive and passed all kinds of laws like mandatory minimums, three strikes and you're out and sending juveniles into adult prisons,'' Professor Blumstein said.
 ''All this action occurred in the 1980's and 1990's when state budgets were growing and there was little concern for expenditures,'' he said. ''But now states are faced with huge deficits and they are looking to prisons as a prime candidate to save money.''
 Spending on jails and prisons rose to $57 billion in 2001, from $9.6 billion in 1982, according to the report.
 Spending on police protection and the courts also grew, though more slowly, with money for the police reaching $72 billion in 2001 and spending on the courts reaching $38 billion, the report said. Court spending includes the costs of judges, prosecutors, clerks and public defenders.
 In total, the criminal justice system accounted for 7 percent of all state and local government spending in 2001, roughly equal to the amount spent on health and hospitals, the report found. The criminal justice system employed 2.3 million people in 2001, 747,000 of them as jail or prison guards.
 Michael Jacobson, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, said the report was ''another indicator, especially on the corrections side, that unless we do something more significant to change our punishment policies, these numbers are going to continue to be out of control.''
 Professor Jacobson is a former corrections and probation commissioner and deputy budget director for New York City. He is a specialist on the cost of corrections.
 Many of the changes state legislators have made in the past two years to try to cut prison costs have been ''minor reformist efforts, just nibbling around the edges,'' Professor Jacobson said.
 Even if a state adds no new prisoners, the costs will still go up, because of contracts already in place for expenses like guards' salaries and medical care for inmates.
 ''There is a historical window here, where given the lower crime rate in recent years and the desire of a large number of legislators to cut prison costs, to take a new look at how we use mass incarceration,'' Professor Jacobson said.
 One big savings could come from a revised parole policy, he said, returning fewer parolees to prison for minor infractions like being late for an appointment with a parole officer or failing a drug test. This would be particularly helpful in California, the state with the largest number of inmates and where almost two-thirds are in prison for parole violations.

HEADLINE: For New York, Economic News Is Good at Last

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
By any number of measures, from Broadway ticket sales to new hiring at banks, economists say that New York's economy is rebounding. And while they hesitate to call it a boom, they do predict more prosperous times for at least the next year.
 The new economic vitality is showing up in all kinds of ways: rising profits on Wall Street, higher than expected bridge and tunnel toll receipts, busier restaurants, even a run on high-end shampoo. 
 So if Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was a little late last week when he pronounced New York's nearly three-year-old recession officially dead or at least on the wane, he ran into little disagreement. 
 ''The city economy is truly springing into spring,'' said Marc Goloven, senior regional economist for J.P. Morgan Chase and the author of a monthly newsletter on the city economy.
 Since last fall most economists have been predicting the end of the city's recession, but in a number of reports issued in the past weeks, they have seen their forecasts borne out. While some experts see the recovery as fragile -- job creation over all has been anemic, and unemployment remains much higher than in the rest of the country -- most say they expect it to continue for the near future.
 ''Once it's started, it's like the Queen Mary,'' said Rae D. Rosen, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. ''It tends to keep going for a couple years.''
 Like an ocean liner trying to reverse course, the city economy has waited a long time for this turnaround. Although the nation's recession ended, by most estimates, in late 2001, the city's dragged on for another two years, largely because of the lingering fallout of the 9/11 attacks, said John Tepper Marlin, chief economist for the New York City comptroller's office. He and other experts said they believe New York's recession finally expired in the last quarter of 2003. 
 Wall Street, which drives the city's economy to a large degree, has led the way to recovery, with profits rebounding last year to $16.8 billion, the highest total since 2000, when profits hit $21 billion. Banks are also planning to hire hundreds of workers this year, job recruiters say. 
 That is important, Ms. Rosen said, because workers in finance spend heavily, so that for every job created on Wall Street, two are created elsewhere.
 As in every New York recovery, though, the big question is whether that new money is coursing into the cash registers and wallets of other New Yorkers. And the answer is a qualified yes. A variety of other measures are showing gains, though not all of them are strong, and the overall city economy has not returned to the robust levels of 2000. 
 The city's economy grew 2.9 percent in the last quarter of 2003, its highest growth rate since the second quarter of 2000, according to the city comptroller. 
 Tourists from elsewhere in the United States are flocking back -- an estimated 36.5 million leisure travelers last year, edging past the record 36.4 million in 1999. But the number of tourists from other countries has declined in the past few years to 4.8 million last year from 6.8 million in 2000. The increase in travel is filling hotels. Occupancy rates rose to 76 percent last year from 73 percent in 2001, with preliminary figures for March showing the rate as high as 85 percent. 
 Gross ticket sales on Broadway climbed to $721 million in 2002-03 from $666 million in 2000-01.
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority reports that toll revenue in 2003 was $1 billion, about $5.2 million more than expected. By contrast, 2002 revenue was $933 million, about $500,000 less than expected.
 The recovery's ripple effect has even reached into stores like Ricky's, a chain that sells wigs, makeup, exotic shampoos and costumes. Although bad weather in January and February has dampened sales somewhat this year, they increased last year by 5 percent, with clear signs that people are in the mood for pampering.
 ''We are seeing the beauty-supply end doing well,'' said Todd Kenig, who owns the chain with his brother, Ricky. ''Shampoos, bath products -- we sell high-end shampoo, higher-end hair care. They are doing great for us.''
 Restaurants, too, have seen business pick up, particularly in the past several months. Chuck Hunt, executive vice president of the New York State Restaurant Association, said a variety of restaurateurs have reported better business, though tavern owners still complain that the city's antismoking law has hurt them.
 ''I think we are headed toward regaining pre-9/11 numbers,'' said Randy Garutti, general manager of Union Square Cafe, who estimates his business is up about 10 percent this year. 
 Recruiters for banking firms said business has rebounded considerably after a three-year drought. ''There is definitely a surge,'' said Helene Crocitto, executive vice president at Filcro Financial Staffing, a Manhattan recruiting firm. ''A lot of companies that consolidated in the past now have a better handle and are now starting to hire again.''
 Many jobs, she said, are at the executive level, '' a key sign that things are turning around.''
 Economists, however, are closely watching for signs of broader improvement in the job market. The city's unemployment rate, which tends to lag behind other indicators, fell to 7.9 percent in March, from 8 percent in February. The national rate was 5.7 percent.
 Joblessness was highest in the Bronx, with a 10.5 percent unemployment rate, and lowest in Queens, with a 6.9 percent rate.
 Adolfo Carrion Jr., the Bronx borough president, said the borough, the city's poorest, has traditionally lagged behind the rest of the city in employment, but predicted that a number of economic development projects, including the renovation of the Bronx Terminal Market, would improve the outlook there.
 The city gained 700 private-sector jobs in March, bringing the total to 2,988,600, seasonally adjusted, according to the city comptroller's office analysis of federal labor statistics. That net job growth came mainly from the information industry and professional and business services, but it was not enough to offset job losses in several other areas, including construction, education and health services, and transportation and utilities.
 ''We see the recovery as fragile,'' said Mr. Marlin, the city comptroller's chief economist. ''It is not affecting all sectors of the economy or the city.''
 Mayor Bloomberg, who is typically cautious when discussing the city's finances, last week presented a proposed budget of $46.9 billion, brimming with a projected surplus of $1.3 billion, a reversal from the deficits and dire warnings of mass layoffs he spoke of a year ago.
 The good fortune came by way of $791 million more in tax revenue for the fiscal year that ends in June than had been anticipated in January -- resulting from a healthier Wall Street, an increase in the property tax and a booming real estate market. But the good times may be short-lived, as Mr. Bloomberg predicts a $3.8 billion deficit for the fiscal year beginning July 2005. Indeed, if the recovery softens or reverses over time, the city could once again plunge into economic distress, economists said.

HEADLINE: From Hot Seat to Warming Up for Leno

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The annual Washington ritual that Ronald Reagan once called a spring prom unfolded Saturday night with a central question: Would President Bush attempt humor at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner, as is tradition, even though he got into political trouble for joking about weapons of mass destruction at another media dinner in March?
 Or, like last year, would he be serious?
 In an election year, with Americans still dying in Iraq, the president opted on Saturday night at the Washington Hilton for half and half -- an unusual decision that reflected the unsettled atmosphere in Washington. The dinner, which went Hollywood to much Beltway hand-wringing nearly two decades ago, still reveals something about the mood of the capital, or at least what's on the mind of the nation's chief executive and his joke writers. 
 So on the first anniversary of the day that Mr. Bush stood under a ''Mission Accomplished'' banner and declared major combat in the war at an end, the president adopted a tone of restrained self-mocking, coupled with a lot of mocking of the press. Then he made somber remarks about the war.
 Mr. Bush did not show a slide of himself on his hands and knees looking under the furniture in his office as he exclaimed, ''Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere!'' He told that joke at a dinner of radio and television correspondents on March 24, prompting outrage from Democrats and in some foreign capitals.
 On Saturday night, Mr. Bush mined such (relatively) safe material as his recent news conference, his decision to have Dick Cheney at his side when he spoke to the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks, and a new book by Bob Woodward, ''Plan of Attack,'' which includes information from three and a half hours of interviews with the president.
 Mr. Bush recalled that he had been asked at his news conference why he and Mr. Cheney were going to speak to the commission together.
 ''That was a toughie,'' Mr. Bush told the correspondents on Saturday. ''So from now on, Dick and I will be holding joint press conferences together. We can do it that way. Or we can do it this way: You can ask a question, then I can tell Bob Woodward. And he can tell you.''
 Mr. Bush also alluded to the recent crop of books about his administration, some of them negative. ''It really gets me when the critics say I haven't done enough for the economy,'' he said. ''Look what I've done for the book publishing industry.''
 Mr. Bush then praised the troops in Iraq. ''As I speak, men and women in uniform are taking great risks, and so are many journalists who are being faithful to their own sense of duty,'' he said.
 The president was followed by Jay Leno, the host of ''The Tonight Show'' and the evening's entertainment, who has made Bush jokes a staple of his repertoire. Mr. Leno evidently felt no restraints before 2,500 people in the Hilton ballroom, with Mr. Bush nearby on the dais.
 ''John Kerry stands by his claim that some foreign leaders have told him they hope he wins,'' Mr. Leno said. ''And of course President Bush said, 'Yeah, well, certain Supreme Court justices have told me I'm going to win.' ''
 And then:
 ''The Kerry campaign is spreading rumors about President Bush,'' Mr. Leno said. For example, he said, it was not true that when the president of Greece showed Mr. Bush a picture of the ruins of the Acropolis, Mr. Bush said, ''We'll get the scum who did this.''
 Mr. Leno offered equal treatment to Mr. Kerry, whom the Bush campaign has cast as a waffler: ''He can become the first president in history ever to deliver the State of the Union -- and the rebuttal.''
 And then, referring to Mr. Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, the ketchup heir: ''They say that John Kerry has become the first Democratic candidate in history to raise $50 million in three months. Which is really nothing. He once raised $500 million in one second when he said, 'I do.' ''
 Not least, Mr. Leno noted that John D. Negroponte would be the new ambassador to Iraq. ''How the hell do you get that job?'' Mr. Leno said. ''Do you make a big contribution to the Kerry campaign?''
 Mr. Bush laughed heartily at many of the jokes, including one by Carl Cannon, the departing president of the correspondents' association, who said that ''five years from now, if our editors keep us on the beat, we'll cover a second President Clinton.''
 As for the dinner itself, it was the usual over-the-top mob of Washington journalists inviting their best sources or, for attention, a celebrity. Spotted this year were Ben Affleck, Drew Barrymore and Meg Ryan, who whished ahead of the Washingtonians waiting obediently in the receiving line at a predinner Newsweek-Washington Post cocktail party.
 ''It's become like everything else,'' said Christopher Buckley, the comic novelist and a former speechwriter for Mr. Bush's father. ''It's become the Super Bowl.''

The New York Cayugas and the owners of the Monticello Raceway have received a crucial approval that could put them closer than any other tribes and developers to opening a casino in the Catskills.
 The eastern office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs last week recommended approval of the plan to build a $500 million Las Vegas-style casino on 30 acres at the raceway, a faded harness track that is widely regarded as a potential gambling gold mine because it is only 90 miles northwest of New York City.
 There is no guarantee that the Cayugas and their partners, Empire Resorts, will be successful in turning that approval into a casino. After all, the Catskills have become a kind of Bermuda Triangle for Indian casino deals, despite Gov. George E. Pataki's oft-stated support for gambling in former resort areas. 
 But the Cayugas' supporters say that full approval is almost certain to follow the recommendation and that settlement talks with the Pataki administration have been going well.
 ''It's a very good step,'' said Timothy Twoguns, the Turtle Clan representative to the Cayuga Nation Council. ''We're trying to see this through, and I believe the state wants to reach that end as well. This recommendation from the Bureau of Indian Affairs really goes a long way.''
 Todd Alhart, a spokesman for Governor Pataki, said yesterday: ''The state is encouraged by the proposed findings and awaits a final decision by the assistant secretary of Indian affairs.''
 Under the proposal, the Cayuga Catskill Resort and Casino would be built on 30 acres owned by Empire Resorts next to the raceway in Sullivan County. The proposal involves the relatively rare arrangement in which the federal government allows private land to be put into federal trust for a tribe, to be used for a casino; the Cayugas are landless. 
 The Cayugas and Empire Resorts still need approval from the full Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, the National Indian Gaming Commission and Governor Pataki. The governor has linked casino approval to a settlement of the tribe's claim to 64,000 acres at the northern tip of Lake Cayuga. Opponents of gambling also continue their legal challenges against casinos.
 The St. Regis Mohawks, the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohicans, the Wisconsin Oneidas and the New York Oneidas have eagerly ventured into the Catskills, hand in hand with their respective developers, only to have the projects bog down in Albany.
 Still, many continue to try. Local politicians and many residents hope that gambling will bring an economic boom to a depressed area once known as the borscht belt. Analysts believe that a Catskills casino, unlike the Indian casinos already operating in upstate New York, could reap $1 billion a year in revenue and lure gamblers away from Atlantic City.
 The 14-page analysis issued last week by the eastern regional office of the bureau recommends that the land at the raceway be taken into trust for the benefit of the Cayugas. The office made a two-part determination that the casino would mean jobs and income for both the tribe, which claims about 475 members, and the local community. If the bureau agrees, it would send a letter to Governor Pataki approving the casino project and asking for his agreement.
 The bureau has approved a so-called land-into-trust application only a handful of times since 1988, when Congress approved establishing casinos on tribal land. One of the earlier approvals involved Monticello Raceway and the same developer now working with the Cayugas, Robert Berman, chief executive of Empire Resorts. 
 Mr. Berman's history is an illustration of just how complicated the path to a casino opening can be. He has tried to open an Indian casino in Sullivan County for a decade, motivated in part by a desire to help revive the county where he grew up. His company, then called Catskill Development, signed an agreement with the St. Regis Mohawks and spent four years obtaining federal approval.
 Tentative approval was granted in April 2000 by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. A week later, the Mohawks renounced their partners and signed an exclusive arrangement with what is now known as Caesars Entertainment, the largest gambling company in the world.
 Caesars' executives then sought federal approval for a casino at Kutscher's Sports Academy in Monticello, saying they expected the get approval within four months. Four years later, that has yet to happen, although Caesars executives and Mohawk tribal leaders were in Sullivan County last week to describe their plans for a $600 million casino. 
 Mr. Berman and his group's casino project, meanwhile, were left for dead. Several of his partners in the deal, at a company called Alpha Hospitality, were indicted on tax-evasion charges in connection with a separate hotel company. Mr. Berman severed ties to those men, reorganized the company and established a new board of directors, whose chairman is David Matheson, a member of the Cour d'Alene tribe and a former deputy commissioner for Indian affairs at the Interior Department.
 A year ago, Mr. Berman's company struck a deal with a new tribe, the Cayugas, a federally recognized tribe that has no reservation, and restarted the approval process.
 ''This time I think we'll get there,'' Mr. Berman said yesterday. ''At the end of the day, it really is the governor's will that drives this.''
 The Cayuga project has the support of the mayor of Monticello, Jim Barnicle. The Cayugas and Empire are still at odds, though, with the Sullivan County Legislature and the nearby town of Thompson, which are demanding that the Cayuga casino agree to pay $15 million a year to offset the effect on law enforcement, traffic, schools and social services. The Mohawks and the Stockbridge Munsees have agreed to similar deals with the county.
 Mr. Berman has insisted he is standing by a prior deal to pay $5 million a year, a position supported by the bureau in a letter last month to the county.
 Meanwhile, Empire Resorts is bringing a form of gambling to the racetrack next month. On June 30, the company plans to open a so-called racino that will be called Mighty M Gaming, with 1,800 video slot machines. In preparation, they are renovating the track and hiring more than 400 people. 
 Video slot machines were approved for harness tracks in the state under legislation passed in October 2001. The legislation also authorized the governor to negotiate with Indian tribes for six casino resorts, three in western New York and three in the Catskills.
 The Seneca tribe signed an agreement with the state in September 2002 and opened its first casino in Niagara Falls on New Year's Eve 2002 and its second, outside Buffalo, last weekend. Little has happened in the Catskills, however, despite intense interest from well-connected developers, a half dozen tribes and politicians who are eager for jobs and revenue. 
 ''We're very frustrated that we don't have a casino in the Catskills,'' said State Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican from New Paltz. ''Maybe the pressure is finally building up on the governor.''

HEADLINE: As Household Debt Rises, New Risk in Higher Rates

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3 

 BODY:
Philo Thompson is 28, single and like many other Americans these days -- not afraid to stretch when it comes to buying a house. 
 A management consultant in Denver, Mr. Thompson bought a $500,000 townhouse last Friday in the suburb of North Cherry Creek.
 As many other first-time homeowners have done, Mr. Thompson put no money down. Instead, he took out a first mortgage for 80 percent of the purchase price and paid the rest by taking a home equity loan against the new house. To reduce his monthly payments, and to qualify for a big enough loan, he took out an adjustable rate mortgage that requires him to make only interest payments. 
 People like Mr. Thompson could get squeezed if interest rates start to rise. With economic growth looking strong and hints of inflation in the air, Federal Reserve officials have made it clear that the era of extraordinarily cheap money is slowly drawing to a close. Yet Mr. Thompson betrays no worries.
 ''I'm too young to be scared,'' he said last week, betting that both the value of the house and his income will keep rising. If the bet fails, he said, it will not be the end of the world, adding: ''There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Being broke is more of a temporary condition. Donald Trump has been broke a couple of times.''
 Mr. Thompson is not alone in such thinking. After a three-year period when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to their lowest level since 1958, Americans have become far more willing to load up on debt and banks have become far more willing to let them.
 Household debt climbed at twice the pace of household income from the beginning of 2000 through 2003, according to data at the Federal Reserve. Enticed by low interest rates, Americans took on $2.3 trillion in new mortgage debt during that period -- an increase of nearly 50 percent. Consumer credit, from zero-interest auto loans to the much more expensive debt on credit cards, climbed 33 percent, rising to $2 trillion in 2003 from $1.5 trillion in 2000.
 Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has repeatedly argued in recent months that rising household debt poses few problems. Fed officials note that the financial position of American households is, in some respects, stronger than ever. The value of household assets -- from resale prices of homes to the size of stock portfolios -- has increased even faster than debt. 
 Indeed, the collective net worth of American households is now higher than it was before the stock market bubble burst four years ago.
 And thanks in part to lower interest rates, monthly debt payments consume a smaller share of monthly income today than in late 2001.
 ''Although there are pockets of financial stress among households, the sector as a whole appears to be in good shape,'' declared Susan Schmidt Bies, a Federal Reserve governor, in a speech two weeks ago.
 But household debt could soon start to pinch. Fed officials, who will meet on Tuesday to set monetary policy, have made it clear that they must eventually raise rates. And while the Fed is not expected to take that action Tuesday, the main question is whether the move will come this summer or be delayed until early next year.
 Regardless of when it happens, economists predict that a significant rise in interest rates will come as a jolt to many people. Those with home equity loans will see their monthly payments climb almost immediately. Adjustable mortgages will increase more slowly, because many borrowers lock in rates for several years. But monthly debt burdens will eventually rise.
 In the meantime, housing prices could drop sharply in some overheated markets like New York and Southern California, where many homes have doubled in price over the last five years. People who bought their homes with no money down could find themselves unable to sell without owing money to their lenders. 
 Much has changed in the 10 years since the Federal Reserve embarked on its last sustained effort to raise rates. Inflation is much lower today and productivity growth is much higher, which may allow the Fed to take a more gradual approach than it did in 1994.
 At the same time, though, many consumers and banks have profoundly changed their attitudes toward borrowing and debt. Responding to lower interest rates last year, homeowners refinanced $140 billion worth of mortgages in which they borrowed additional money. Mortgage lenders, in the meantime, rolled out scores of new kinds of loans, allowing people to borrow far more than they might have contemplated a decade ago.
 The new loans go well beyond adjustable-rate mortgages. They include interest-only loans; ''no document'' loans, which allow people to borrow money at higher rates without proving their income or assets; and ''no ratio'' loans, which simply ignore a person's monthly income.
 Mr. Thompson, who completed the purchase of his townhouse near Denver on Friday, said he would have qualified to borrow $330,000 if he had taken out a traditional fixed-rate mortgage. He qualified for a loan up to $550,000 by taking an adjustable-rate mortgage that will be constant for the first five years and that requires only interest payments.
 He also avoided paying mortgage insurance, which could have cost several thousand dollars a year, even though he put no money down -- something that had been mandatory for those who borrowed more than 80 percent of the purchase price. Because of the home equity loan he also signed for, his primary mortgage amounted to only 80 percent of the purchase price.
 ''People are looking at their payments and asking, 'How much interest rate protection do I really need?''' said Richard Wohl, president of the mortgage banking group at IndyMac Bank, a large lender based in Pasadena, Calif. Nearly two-thirds of IndyMac's new loans in the first three months of this year were adjustable-rate mortgages, and a quarter of all new loans are subject to adjustments in the first year. 
 Nontraditional loans first proliferated in California and Washington, largely in reaction to soaring real estate prices. But IndyMac and other big Western lenders have been rolling out their full array of options to every part of the country, and competitors in every part of the country have followed suit.
 Nationally over the last year, homeowners have tried to lock in low fixed-rate mortgages. But as rates began to creep up in March, making it harder for some people to afford fixed-rate mortgages, home buyers began shifting to the riskier adjustable rates to keep up with high real estate prices.
 According to data compiled by the Mortgage Bankers Association, the share of people who took adjustable-rate mortgages jumped to 32 percent in March from about 13 percent last July.
 Local mortgage brokers, linked by computer to large lenders and automated loan-approval systems, say they can often find money for almost any kind of customer, sometimes within minutes.
 ''There are an incredible number of loans that get approved now that would have been way out of bounds a few years ago,'' said Ruben Ybarra, president of the Chicagoland Home Mortgage Corporation. ''I may think a person is being allowed to borrow too much. But if the computer tells them they're approved, what can you tell them?''
 The willingness to take risks is not limited to lower-income families struggling to buy a first home. Even as interest rates appear to be heading upward, a growing number of wealthy homeowners have decided to cut their monthly payments by switching to interest-only loans that adjust as often as once a month.
 Alan Bubes, owner of a linen-supply service in Washington, is refinancing a mortgage of more than $1 million on the home he and his wife own in Georgetown. By switching to an interest-only mortgage that adjusts every month, Mr. Bubes expects to cut his monthly payments and reinvest those savings.
 ''It's a gamble,'' Mr. Bubes acknowledged, saying that he could make more by reinvesting his savings than paying down his debts.
 Danny Schappell, a mortgage banker with First Savings Mortgage who works in Potomac Md., a wealthy Washington suburb, said demand for adjustable-rate mortgages, or A.R.M.'s, and interest-only loans was rising.
 ''It used to be that everyone wanted a fixed rate,'' he said, ''and now there I am getting calls for all these A.R.M.'s with interest-only payment options. Actually, I am getting ready to settle on a beach property for myself, and this will probably be an interest-only loan.''

HEADLINE: Forsaking Short-Haul Flights for the Joys of the Road

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
Business travelers who switched to cars after Sept. 11, 2001, are not cooperating with the airline industry's recovery plans.
 After a two-year slump driven by terrorist attacks, airport frustrations, a weak economy, SARS and the war in Iraq, the airline industry is showing signs of reviving. Traffic for major American carriers rose 8 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to the Air Transport Association. The Federal Aviation Administration forecasts that domestic air travel will grow at least 6.5 percent annually this year and next.
 But the recovery is coming in fits and starts, complicated by sharp increases in fuel prices, continuing terrorism fears and, for the big American carriers, a price war with low-cost carriers like Southwest. The airlines need every customer they can lure back, and with the economy recovering, business travelers are indeed flying more. 
 But not on short-haul routes, which just five years ago accounted for more than half of all flights. Having rediscovered the joys of driving two and a half years ago, many business travelers see no reason to return to the airport security delays and crowded planes they left behind.
 ''For 500 miles or less, I'm driving,'' said Spencer Jessee, the Midwest regional sales manager for Senco Products, which makes pneumatic nail guns and other fastening tools for construction.
 Like Mr. Jessee, many of those who have switched to driving say they are not coming back. Christa Metcalf, corporate travel manager for the Richard Wolf Medical Instrument Corporation in Vernon Hills, Ill., said that while most of her company's travelers stuck with planes because of the long distances, many who visit clients in the Midwest turned to cars, and ''those who have gotten used to it still do it.''
 From March 2000 to March 2004, airlines cut the number of short-haul domestic flights in the continental United States by more than a third, or three times the pace of the reduction for all domestic commercial flights, according to BACK Aviation Solutions, a consulting company in New Haven.
 For competitive reasons, airlines are reluctant to discuss in detail whom they fly where or how they plan to keep their customers, much less how they hope to win back the defectors. But consultants say it will not be easy to entice them out of their cars and back to the airport.
 ''Quite frankly, I think they're gone for a long time because I don't see anything changing on security anytime soon,'' said David Swierenga, chief economist at AeroEcon, a consulting firm in Vienna, Va., and a former economist with the Air Transport Association, the industry group for commercial airlines. ''They're just put off by the hassles of security and they would just rather drive.'' Indeed, some business-travel bookers say that their clients' resistance to flying short distances has only hardened in the last year or so. 
 Wendy M. Broome, travel coordinator for the Progress Energy Corporation in Raleigh, N.C., says more employees are opting to drive on shorter trips to cities like Charlotte, N.C., or Washington to avoid airport delays, ''reduced flight choices, lack of customer service and just the whole issue of air travel inconvenience.''
 ''While our travelers understand the need for heightened security, the days of pampered, user-friendly air travel are far behind us,'' Ms. Broome said. ''They consider it a better use of their time to either hitchhike on the corporate craft if available, teleconference, or to hop behind the wheel.''
 Travelers have returned to the airlines for longer distances, and the airlines have responded by adding flights on these routes. For example, the number of flights at distances of 1,800 to 1,999 miles has grown 25 percent since 2000, BACK Aviation found. Airlines say they have been able to fill those planes. By contrast, the number of flights under 400 miles has fallen 25 percent, a shrinkage that has helped fuel the switch to cars.
 Another development encouraging the trend is the industry's embrace of regional jets, generally defined as aircraft with 100 or fewer seats. While most of these smaller jets are powered by turbofan engines like those used by big commercial planes, they often have a single aisle with two seats on each side. The result is that even if the number of flights between two cities remains steady or grows, the number of seats can shrink and passengers rarely find an empty seat beside them.
 Whatever the discomforts of driving for a few hours to a business meeting, many travelers say, they pale beside the aggravations of flying.
 ''A one-hour flight gets to take four hours by the time you get to the airport early, park, check in, clear security and pick up a rental car at the other end,'' said Elaine Kretten, the travel and fleet manager of Senco Products, which is based in Cincinnati. ''Tack on another hour, and you can drive there yourself.''
 If two or more employees drive together, the savings are even greater, she noted. That is one reason the company has scrapped its national sales meeting this year in favor of six regional meetings. The sites for each gathering were chosen to let the greatest number of sales representatives get to a meeting by car. Ms. Kretten said that would cover about three-fourths of all employees who attend.
 Hiring six hotel meeting rooms instead of one ballroom may cost more, she acknowledged, but the process over all will be cheaper. ''We'd rather do that than spend the money on air,'' she said. Encouraging Senco employees to drive as much as possible will pare the company's travel bill by about 10 percent, a saving as great as $400,000, she estimated, even with high gasoline prices.
 There are even some benefits for travelers' families, Ms. Kretten said. Rather than ask employees to give up their weekends to qualify for cheap flights that require a Saturday night stay, she said, they now often drive home on Friday afternoons and leave on Monday mornings. ''It takes some time from selling, maybe half a day,'' she said. ''But they actually have more time at home.''
 Still, traveling by car does mean that people spend many hours watching the road, not working on a laptop computer in an airline lounge or a seat on a plane. Mr. Jessee said that he and his sales representatives compensated by using driving time to phone customers, conduct conference calls or listen to audiotapes describing new products.
 In any case, he said, driving is less annoying than the rigmarole he used to follow to find cheaper flights than those available at Cincinnati, where Delta accounts for 92 percent of the flights.
 He said it was not unusual for him to drive an hour or an hour and a half to airports in Columbus or Dayton, Ohio, or even Louisville, Ky., where there was more competition and lower fares. Many of the flights he would start at one of those airports would be on a Delta plane that connected through Cincinnati.
 ''I often found that I'd spent four and a half hours and gotten nowhere -- I was right back in Cincinnati -- just to save money,'' he said. Compared with that, he added, hopping into his roomy sport utility vehicle is a breeze.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Remains Strong; Construction Spending Surges

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
A gauge of manufacturing held close to a two-decade high in April as production increased and more factories added workers than at any time since 1987, an industry report showed yesterday. In addition, a report from the Commerce Department showed that construction spending rose in March to a record and was much higher than expected. 
 The Institute for Supply Management's 62.4 reading in its factory index followed a level of 62.5 in March. Readings greater than 50 signal expansion, and the 63.6 recorded in January was the highest since December 1983. 
 The supply managers' measure of prices paid for raw materials rose to the highest level since November 1979, while the index of order backlogs rose to a record. Increased corporate and consumer demand are encouraging some companies to plan price increases.
 Federal Reserve officials, who meet today, are not expected to raise the benchmark interest rate from 1 percent. But they are expected to take a step toward raising rates by changing the language in their policy statement. 
 The manufacturing survey's April employment index rose to 57.8, the highest since December 1987, from 57 the prior month. The production index, a gauge of work being performed, rose to 67 from 65.5 in March. The new-orders index, which accounts for about a third of the total, fell to 65 from 65.7.
 The manufacturing group surveys more than 400 companies in 20 industries. Manufacturing accounts for about one-seventh of the economy. 
 The Commerce Department's report on construction spending showed a rise of 1.5 percent, to an annual rate of $944.1 billion. Economists had expected an increase of 0.5 percent. The report showed a 0.7 percent increase in residential building.
 Federal government construction spending jumped 7.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Drivers Tend to Shrug Off High Gas Prices, for Now

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE

DATELINE: TYSONS CORNER, Va., April 30 

 BODY:
Gasoline prices in Northern Virginia have hovered at record highs for weeks, as they have all over the country. But Richard Wellhouse has yet to wince. 
 A 35-year-old computer engineer, Mr. Wellhouse visited the J. Koons Pontiac-GMC Truck dealership here one recent evening to test drive a Denali, a $50,000 sport utility vehicle bigger than some third world houses. The Denali, which gets 13 miles to a gallon in city driving, would replace Mr. Wellhouse's aging Suburban, which shares his garage with two Ford Explorers. 
 All of Mr. Wellhouse's vehicles consume prodigious amounts of gasoline. But Mr. Wellhouse is untroubled by high fuel prices that show few signs of falling soon. ''If it goes to $3 a gallon, it may hurt,'' Mr. Wellhouse said, ''but it won't really change anything.'' 
 Like Mr. Wellhouse, American consumers and businesses have so far been willing to shrug off high fuel prices without changing the way they use energy. Experts say that for a variety of reasons, they should be able to keep that up for a while -- but not indefinitely. As soon as the end of summer, by some estimates, if fuel prices have not fallen, many Americans will be feeling the pinch. 
 Several times in the last four years, gasoline prices have briefly spiked over $2 a gallon in parts of the country, only to fall back. But today's fuel prices are no spike. For nearly a month, the national average has been around $1.79 a gallon, the highest on record.
 The big numbers at the pump elicit plenty of political bluster and Congressional handwringing, and some popular grumbling about sticker shock, analysts said, but consumers continue to buy gas-greedy vehicles and drive lots of miles anyway. 
 ''Right now, the signs are that Americans are buying bigger vehicles and planning to take summer trips,'' said Geoff Sundstrom, a spokesman for AAA. ''The only time we saw people change their behavior or abandon their vacation plans was when we had such shortages that they were afraid they wouldn't be able to get fuel.'' 
 One reason is that Americans today spend a smaller share of their income on energy-related costs, including lighting and heating their homes as well as fueling their cars, than they did over most of the last 25 years, according to the Energy Information Administration, the analytic office of the Department of Energy. 
 Another factor in the failure of high gasoline prices to dissuade people from buying large S.U.V.'s is a provision in the federal tax law that allows small-business owners to deduct most of the purchase price of a vehicle weighing over 6,000 pounds in the first year of ownership.
 The growing strength of the economic recovery has also helped soften the impact of high fuel prices on consumers. But analysts said that the biggest cushion might have been built by the last round of tax cuts and, to a lesser extent, low interest rates. The tax cuts gave consumers about $70 billion in additional spending power this year, while the rise in crude oil prices, now around $37 a barrel, has so far cost Americans only about $35 billion, according to estimates by Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. 
 But Mr. Goldstein and others warn that the $70 billion in tax-cut proceeds will soon be used up; if oil prices remain high through late summer, Americans consumers may begin to feel higher energy costs eating into their income or savings.
 ''In that case, we're likely to see more evidence of weaker growth in demand, and slower economic activity,'' Mr. Goldstein predicted.
 The cost of crude oil is the main reason fuel prices are high, and growing demand is the main factor driving crude prices. With the pickup in the world economy has a come what most analysts now concede was an unexpectedly high jump in global demand for oil. Demand is up 3.5 percent this year, Mr. Goldstein said, far more than many experts who track oil markets predicted. The United States remains the world's biggest consumer, but China, once roughly self-sufficient in energy, has developed a powerful appetite for oil as well. 
 Strong demand has met a world oil market where supply has fallen short of expectations. Political turmoil in Venezuela, the world's fifth-largest producer, led to the near-shutdown of its oil fields last year, and production has been slow to rebound; so too in Iraq, where production has recovered much more slowly than expected after the invasion last year because of persistent looting and sabotage. 
 Iraq exports about 500,000 fewer barrels of crude a day than it did before the war, and Venezuela's output is still about 500,000 barrels a day short of where it was before the general strikes that rocked the country in early 2003, said Roger Diwan, managing director at PFC Energy, a Washington consulting firm. 
 Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has done its part by trimming its official production quotas, though nearly all its members are producing over quota to cash in on the high prices. 
 The effect has been amplified in the United States by environmental regulations that have come into force lately that have the effect of making it much harder to import refined gasoline, while at the same time domestic refinery capacity has not grown to match rising demand.
 Many Americans have done little beyond grousing about the cost of gasoline because they do not believe fuel prices will linger at such levels for long. ''No one really believes yet that these high prices are here to stay,'' said Mark Zandi, president of Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa. ''They are used to seeing prices go up and down so much over the last 10 years.''
 Businesses that are especially vulnerable to high fuel prices are coping for now as well, though some are having more difficulty than others. High jet fuel prices have obliged airlines like United to search for other costs to cut, said Bob Sturtz, who oversees fuel purchases for the airline. The airline, however, has not raised fares to offset the high prices. 
 Companies like FedEx and UPS long ago began adding fuel surcharges to their shipping rates that can fluctuate with market prices, company representatives said. Right now, each company applies a 5.5 percent fuel surcharge. Major trucking companies like Yellow Roadway use similar surcharges. But smaller companies are struggling, said Jeffrey H. Stineman, president of the National Truckers Association, an advocacy group. 
 ''The cost of fuel for most motor carriers is a major, if not the primary, factor in determining a trucking operation's year-end profit,'' Mr. Stineman said in an e-mail message. ''Fuel prices in the U.S. are up an average of 12 to 15 percent from last year. Small trucking companies have felt the crunch, and are left with the decision to compete or make a profit. Many companies have decided to pass only a portion of the price to their customers and concentrate on a profit margin that will simply keep them in business.''
 Businesses like trucking companies and UPS are looking for ways to conserve fuel. UPS has told its drivers not to leave their engines idling while they make deliveries, and uses computers to plan the most efficient delivery routes and to schedule maintenance on its trucks to keep them running well, a company spokesman, Norman Black, said.
 But fuel efficiency remains a remote concept for many consumers, even those with the least income to spare. Energy costs account for about 7.5 percent of spending for Americans who make less than $40,000 a year, according to information provided by Mr. Zandi based on Energy Department data from 2002. For the more affluent, energy costs amount to perhaps 5 percent.

SUMMER AIRPORT CROWDING PREDICTED -- Along with the rebound in world airline traffic, domestic traffic is showing steady growth this year. One consequence could be longer airport security lines this summer as vacationers add to the traffic and not enough screeners are on duty to expedite lines after layoffs by the Transportation Security Administration. ''The good news is we're coming back to pre-9/11 levels,'' said James C. May, the president of the Air Transport Association. ''This summer, we're looking at loads of roughly 65 million passengers a month for a sustained time,'' he said. ''But we're also looking at 6,000 fewer screeners. We're worried to death about lines and the usual hassle factor concerns.'' He said his group, the airline industry's main trade organization, was speaking with T.S.A. officials to try to ''find ways to expedite the process.''

QUICK SPANISH RECOVERY -- Leisure and business travel to Spain did not suffer as expected after the terrorist bombings on Madrid trains March 11, though some businesses reported short-term declines. ''Over all, the number of tourists to Madrid was up 7.9 percent for March,'' Antonio Nieto, general manager of tourism for the Madrid region, said in an interview Sunday at the World Travel and Tourism Council annual summit in Qatar. There were no cancellations of any international conventions or business in Madrid after the bombings, he said.

MORE FOREIGN VISITORS TO U.S. -- Leisure and business travelers to the United States from overseas rose 5 percent in January over January 2003, according to the Commerce Department. The biggest national increase, 11 percent, came from Britons. Japanese arrivals rose 9 percent in January and visits from Germany were up 8 percent. Meanwhile, analysts at the World Travel and Tourism meeting in Qatar predicted that as foreign travel expands into new markets, the United States will continue to see growth in overseas visitors in the coming decade, while the growth rate of Americans going abroad should remain relatively flat. ''We just are not the most educated people about the rest of the world. In fact, only 50 percent of the members of Congress have passports,'' said Gene B. Sperling, the former chief economic adviser to the Clinton White House.

PHILADELPHIA HERE THEY COME -- Reacting, as expected, to the arrival of Southwest Airlines, which starts operations in Philadelphia next week, US Airways slashed fares at its hub there and issued a statement noting that US Air, unlike Southwest, is a network carrier with routes offering ''nonstop service to 106 destinations'' in North America and ''10 European destinations from Philadelphia.'' In announcing lower fares (and the abandonment of Saturday night stay requirements) to battle Southwest on competitive routes, US Air also noted that its customers get ''advance seat assignments.'' Colleen Barrett, the president and chief operating officer of Southwest, which is known for its ''cattle call'' seating in which passengers take any available seat, described her company as ''simply ecstatic'' about coming to Philadelphia. On the Southwest Web site, she wrote: ''The very day Southwest arrives in a city, airfares drop dramatically.'' She added until Southwest decided to come in ''Philadelphians were paying some of the highest fares in the country.''

SONG ADDS FRILLS -- Increasingly, low-fare airlines are adding amenities even as their network competitors cut back. Song, the low-fare carrier created by Delta Air Lines, said it had completed installation of in-flight entertainment systems on its 36 airplanes. Each seat now has a personal video providing 24 live television channels. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Higher Oil Prices Are Damaging Global Economy, a Study Shows

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3 

 BODY:
Higher oil prices have hurt the global economy and could further hamper growth, bolster inflation and increase unemployment over the next two years if prices stay at their current levels, according to a study by the International Energy Agency released on Monday.
 ''World G.D.P. growth may have been at least half a percentage point higher in the last two or three years,'' the study found, ''had prices remained at mid-2001 levels.'' 
 If oil prices stay at their current level of more than $35 a barrel, more than $10 a barrel above their level of three years ago, ''world G.D.P. would be at least half of 1 percent lower -- equivalent to $255 billion -- in the year following a $10 oil price increase.'' 
 In New York, crude oil for June delivery rose 83 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $38.21 a barrel on Monday. 
 The United States, which still produces about 40 percent of the oil it consumes, would suffer less than other developed countries: the report forecasts a drop in G.D.P. of three-tenths of a percentage point. Still, the agency found, continued higher prices would cause unemployment in the United States to ''worsen significantly in the short term.'' 
 For developed nations as a whole, the effect of higher oil prices would include a rise of one-tenth of a percentage point in the unemployment rate, a rise of five-tenths of a point in consumer prices for 2004 and a reduction in economic growth of four-tenths of a point for the next two years.
 The agency, an independent body founded 30 years ago by major oil- consuming nations in the aftermath of oil price shocks, collaborated on the study with its sister organization, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Monetary Fund.
 The report attributed higher oil prices, in part, to ''supply-management policies'' by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, but it did not further explore the causes. At its most recent meeting, one month ago, OPEC members, led by Saudi Arabia, decided to restrain production further.
 Oil production data is opaque and unverifiable. One reason, energy experts say, is because OPEC quotas, based partly on production, are frequently exceeded by member countries.
 In the weeks since OPEC's decision, the trend of one production indicator, oil tanker movements, has shifted downward, according to Oil Tanker Intelligence Service, ''providing clear evidence that OPEC has indeed reduced exports.'' The service is a joint venture of Lloyd's Marine Intelligence Unit, based in London, and the PIRA Energy Group, which is based in New York.
 The federal Energy Information Administration reports that oil imports into the United States from Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest exporter, dropped significantly in the first two months of 2004, the latest reporting period. 
 Saudi Arabia, according to the administration's data, has been America's largest source of imported oil over the last few years, but this year it has been replaced by Canada. 
 Saudi supplies of crude oil in January and February dropped by almost 20 percent compared with the period in 2003.
 OPEC's production cuts, Saudi Arabia's dealings with Washington and higher gasoline prices are now a staple on the presidential campaign trail. These issues and the accompanying debate were on display here last week in a conference on United States-Saudi relations sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the U.S.-Saudi Arabian Business Council.
 Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, told the gathering that ''prices are being driven by other factors'' beyond supply and demand, including fears of instability, hedge fund investments in the commodities markets and refining bottlenecks, especially in the United States. 
 Mr. Naimi said it was wrong to blame OPEC for higher prices and he offered to ''invest in two new refineries'' to address gasoline demand in the United States.
 But Kyle McSlarrow, the deputy secretary of energy, said the ''price of crude is driving the cost of gasoline.'' In a similar vein, Guy F. Caruso, the administrator of the Energy Information Administration, told the conference that OPEC production cuts ranked higher as a cause for increased gas prices than tightness in the United States refining market.
 Mr. McSlarrow also played down the importance of shortages in refining capacity, noting that current refinery utilization is less than 90 percent.
 Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, is already involved in the American refining market: it jointly owns four refineries in partnership with the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. The joint venture recently agreed to sell one of those refineries, in Delaware.
 Mr. Naimi was asked by a reporter at the conference to explain his offer to invest in new refineries in light of Aramco's decision to shed the Delaware refinery. He said to ''talk to Aramco,'' explaining that while he is the chairman of the company's board he is not an Aramco executive.
 Saudi Aramco's president and chief executive, Abdallah S. Jumah, said in an interview that the Delaware refinery was sold because ''it was a good deal.''
 David Harrington, a Shell spokesman, said the sale was consistent with the joint venture's effort to strike a ''proper balance between refining and marketing assets.''

HEADLINE: Brazil's Road to Victory Over U.S. Cotton

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER and TODD BENSON; Elizabeth Becker reported for this article from Washington and Todd Benson from Sao Paulo.

 BODY:
It began with Brazil's soybean farmers.
 Pedro de Camargo Neto, then a top official of the Brazilian Rural Society, Brazil's most influential agriculture lobby, kept hearing complaints in the late 1990's from farmers that, just as they were starting to turn a profit with their soybean exports, they were getting clobbered by lower-priced American soybeans that were heavily subsidized with taxpayers' money.
 ''Something was wrong here,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''I didn't understand how this could be happening.'' 
 After looking closely at the subsidies for the richest American agribusinesses and their impact on Brazilian farmers, Mr. Camargo -- who was Brazil's deputy agriculture minister at the time -- began a campaign in 2001 to sue the United States at the World Trade Organization.
 Last week, the W.T.O. finally issued a preliminary ruling favoring Brazil and two African nations over the United States in the first case brought against a developed nation's domestic subsidies. The ruling concerned cotton, not soybeans, and Mr. Camargo is no longer in government, but he could not be more thrilled with the outcome.
 It was not an easy battle for Mr. Camargo, who faced political obstacles at almost every turn.
 A cattle rancher with a master's degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Camargo thought he had understood the logic of globalization and liberalized trade. He had been an adviser for Brazil during global trade negotiations in the Uruguay round. The premise was that developing countries like Brazil could better lift their farmers out of poverty through trade, and not aid.
 ''This is really a pioneering case,'' Mr. Camargo said after hearing about the preliminary outcome. ''I wish this would have happened while I was still in the government. It's nice to be recognized.''
 The W.T.O. ruled that the multibillion-dollar subsidies to the biggest American cotton farmers and agribusinesses amounted to unfair trading practices.
 It could mean a breakthrough in a decade-long fight by the world's developing nations to force rich countries to end their $300 billion in subsidies and supports to the biggest farmers.
 Another case is pending against the European Union for its sugar subsidies.
 ''He is the godfather, the visionary of the cotton and sugar cases,'' said Scott D. Andersen, the lawyer who represents Brazil from the Geneva office of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood.
 A slight, soft-spoken rancher, Mr. Camargo, 55, said he was surprised by the skepticism he first encountered within the Brazilian government when he broached the idea. Some officials at the ministry of foreign affairs did not want to take on the world's superpower over a farm issue.
 ''I'd bring them one study on challenging subsidies, and they'd say, 'Bring another,''' Mr. Camargo said. ''Then I'd take two and they would ask for four more. Some people did everything they could to get in the way.''
 One solution he came up with was to balance the pain. He pushed to file a suit against the European Union as well as the United States. He even floated the notion of filing a third suit, this one against Japan for its barriers to Brazilian beef exports.
 But the minister of agriculture at the time -- Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes -- said that might be too much.
 ''Pratini told me: 'Look, Pedro, you've already filed two complaints. Don't get us involved in a third,''' Mr. Camargo said.
 Moreover, those lawsuits are expensive -- already Brazil has spent over $1 million on the cotton case. Benin and Chad, two West African countries that have been badly hurt by the cotton subsidies, could never have afforded to bring their own case but were included as third parties in Brazil's lawsuit. It was the first time any African nation has been involved in any W.T.O. litigation.
 ''Brazil was getting hurt by the cotton subsidies, but the African countries were getting destroyed,'' Mr. Camargo said. ''We knew this would strengthen the case even more.''
 The World Bank, the United Nations Development Program and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have all done studies showing that the agricultural subsidies and supports of the world's wealthiest nations are the biggest impediments for poor countries trying to trade their way out of poverty.
 Indeed, the subsidy systems often hurt small farmers in the wealthy nations. In the United States, the country's biggest cotton farmers -- the top 10 percent -- received 78 percent of the $1.3 billion in subsidies in 2002, the last year for which figures are available.
 Mr. Camargo -- a wealthy rancher in Sao Paulo state in the middle of Brazil's farm belt -- is not one of the dispossessed.
 But he remains involved in the legal action, advising the private sector on the agricultural trade talks and acting as a consultant to Brazil's Commodities and Futures Exchange.
 ''I was already very involved in these issues before I joined the government, so there's no point in stopping now that I'm back in the private sector,'' Mr. Camargo said. ''This is what I do.''

HEADLINE: Google May Have Pre-empted Regulators on Public Offerings

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
As the symbol of one era of initial public offerings faces the possibility of prison, a new era that rejects the excesses of the past may be starting.
 For a few years at the height of the technology boom, Frank P. Quattrone was the most powerful investment banker, and among the most powerful people, in Silicon Valley. It was not just that his decision to bring a company public could make its founders wealthy beyond ordinary people's imaginations. He had the power to hand out wealth to others just by allowing them to buy the stock he was selling. 
 ''When someone gets control of the capital-raising process, it's very lucrative,'' said Andy Kessler, a hedge fund investor who once worked with Mr. Quattrone. ''But his downfall was that at the other end people lost money.''
 Yesterday, Mr. Quattrone was convicted of obstruction of justice for passing on an e-mail message urging investment bankers who worked for him at Credit Suisse First Boston to clean out their files. He passed on the message after he learned that regulators were looking into the I.P.O. process at the firm.
 Once, Wall Street considered it embarrassing to have a stock soar right after it went public, because the underwriters had obviously left a lot of money on the table and deprived the issuing company of the best price for the shares sold. 
 But in the late 1990's it became a badge of honor to have a new offering double or even quadruple the first day of trading. That meant the potential for phenomenal profits to those who could buy at the offering -- profits that could be realized within minutes after the stock began trading, long before it became clear whether the company would prosper or fail.
 Mr. Quattrone put himself at the center of that process. Moreover, despite nominal rules separating investment banking from research, Mr. Quattrone had analysts reporting to him, allowing him to influence their recommendations to clients. 
 Few were exercised about the matter until the bubble burst. Investigations began, and there was revulsion at the way the guaranteed profits of buying hot offerings were split up. 
 First Boston paid a $100 million penalty, but no criminal charges were brought against the firm. Mr. Quattrone, however, was indicted because prosecutors thought he had tried to cover up what had happened.
 Now the market has regained a good part of its losses. Many technology stocks have doubled or tripled -- admittedly from low bases -- in the last 18 months. And investors are bracing for Google, the most highly anticipated new offering in years.
 Some reforms have been introduced, including barring research analysts from communicating with bankers on public offerings.
 But imposing such institutional changes from outside can go only so far. Google, proprietor of a successful Internet search engine, wants to play by different rules. It proposes to sell its shares in a version of a Dutch auction. That means any investor -- whether the best friend of the lead underwriter or a small investor in Fargo, N.D. -- should have an equal chance of buying shares at the offering price. The auction will set the price.
 Whether either of those investors will do well is another issue. In the old days, investors in offerings known to be hot could be sure of making money, and so they pushed to get in on the offering regardless of how much they thought the shares might be worth or how likely the company was to prosper in the long term. They might flip the shares immediately for a quick profit.
 Consider VA Linux, now renamed Linux. It was a phenomenon when Mr. Quattrone's group brought it public in December 1999. The shares were priced at $30 in the offering, but traded for $320 the first day, ending that day at $239.25, for a gain of nearly 700 percent. By the end of 1999, the shares were trading for less than the first-day close, but were still viewed as a great success. (They later fell as low as 54 cents in 2002, and now sell for about $2.)
 It is an interesting intellectual exercise to wonder what would have happened had VA Linux used a Dutch auction. Presumably the price would have been well above $30, giving the company more money, but there is no way to know just how much above that price it would have traded. The list of buyers would have been far different, however. Those on the list would have been betting that the market price would rise -- not that the market price would be well above the offering price.
 Since regulators homed in on the world of new offerings, the rules have been focused largely on assuring that the profits from soaring first-day prices are not abused. The investment banking practices of spinning, offering allocations to executives at other companies in hopes of winning future business, and laddering, or requiring buyers to place aftermarket orders at higher prices to get allocations, are now clearly banned. 
 Regulators are considering trying to protect individual investors by requiring that orders to buy such stocks the first day must specify a maximum price that the investor will pay, rather than simply being for a market price that could have soared.
 But the Google plan makes such steps unnecessary, because first-day profits are far less likely to exist. By the nature of a Dutch offering, investors will know that they probably can buy in the aftermarket at a price comparable to the offering price -- just as investors who buy any stock now trading, whether General Motors or Yahoo, know that the market price tomorrow is likely to be pretty close to today's price.
 There is no certainty that Dutch auctions, if they catch on, will do an especially good job of raising capital. It may turn out that underwriters, in weighing markets and seeking to price offerings so that they will sell and rise maybe 15 percent in the aftermarket, did a good job for their customers all these years. 
 The risk in the auction process is of setting a price that will appear too high within days.
 But Mr. Quattrone and other investment bankers stopped doing an important part of their job in the late 1990's, even though few objected at the time. The bankers were quite happy to spread profits around to people they favored or people who could do favors for them. They left a lot of money on the table that could have gone to the companies that hired them.
 Now Google wants to change the system, and in the process pay investment bankers less for their services. That approach, as much as the conviction of Mr. Quattrone, reflects the reaction to the excesses of the era that enabled Mr. Quattrone to be paid more than $200 million from 1998 through 2001.


CORRECTION-DATE: May 7, 2004

 CORRECTION:
The Market Place column in Business Day on Tuesday, about a potential change in the environment for initial public offerings, misstated the new name of VA Linux, which went public in 1999. It is now VA Software, not Linux.

HEADLINE: Rail Tunnel Is Considered For L.I. Link To Manhattan

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP and AL BAKER

 BODY:
Searching for a rail link from Lower Manhattan to Kennedy Airport and Long Island, the Pataki administration is poised to choose between building a new tunnel or using the existing Montague Street tunnel on the M, N and R subway lines.
 The cost of a Long Island-Lower Manhattan link using the Montague Street tunnel has been put by officials and business executives at $5 billion to $5.5 billion. A new tunnel might add $1 billion to the cost. 
 Gov. George E. Pataki may declare the choice tomorrow in his semiannual progress report on downtown reconstruction. In these speeches, he typically lists recent accomplishments, makes several announcements and sets timetables for pending projects.
 Often, such matters are in flux until the last minute, so the reluctance of state officials to discuss the rail link yesterday could reflect either genuine indecision or their concern about pre-empting the governor.
 All that Lynn Rasic, a spokeswoman for the governor, would say was that Mr. Pataki will ''announce new initiatives that will help revitalize downtown.''
 Mr. Pataki may simply disclose the winnowing of choices for an East River crossing to bring trains into Lower Manhattan from Long Island, through Jamaica in Queens and Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn. Using a new tunnel or the Montague Street tunnel would eliminate the idea, central to two alternatives, of sharing the Cranberry Street Tunnel on the A and C lines.
 Four plans have been under study since February by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the city Economic Development Corporation. They had said they would announce their choice and a financing plan by the end of last month.
 The State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who represents much of Lower Manhattan, does not know which tunnel idea is favored, said a spokeswoman, Eileen Larrabee. But she added he had been pushing the governor, a Republican, for such a link to Long Island, ''knowing it will be a real boost to rebuilding efforts.''
 Gene Russianoff, staff attorney of the New York Public Interest Research Group Straphangers Campaign, said, ''It looks like the governor is leaning toward building a new under-river tunnel, but would not rule out using the existing tunnel.'' He said his group questioned the cost and benefit of a new tunnel, and opposed using the Montague Street tunnel because it would compromise subway service.

HEADLINE: Saudis Uneasily Balance Desires for Change and Stability

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
Saudis watching the newly introduced broadcasts of their country's Consultative Council a few months back were startled to discover the royal family's handpicked legislators discussing an almost comically minor problem: the theft of wood from the desert kingdom's forests.
 There are, in fact, endangered trees in Saudi Arabia, but the country faces far greater ills that the council seems to studiously avoid. They include the increasing spasms of Islamic violence that for the first time last week singled out the oil industry, coming on top of an unemployment rate rising by 100,000 men a year and a growing impatience with the extravagant lives of the royal family. 
 The attack on Saturday at the nation's petrochemical hub, which killed five foreign engineers and a Saudi officer, increased tensions already high after a suicide bombing in the capital and deadly shootouts between Muslim militants and the police, all in the last month.
 Interviews conducted during an 18-day reporting trip just completed in Saudi Arabia suggest that average Saudis seem caught between competing desires. On one hand, they want the royal family to yield power so citizens may have more say over their own lives. On the other, they fear the chaos spread by Islamic militants, and as they gaze next door at the bedlam in Iraq, they worry that replacing a clear authority with something more diffuse may usher in chaos. 
 There is an animosity toward anything American because of the Bush administration's unwavering support for Israel and the invasion of Iraq, reinforced this week by the shocking pictures of American abuse of Iraqi prisoners broadcast repeatedly by Arab satellite stations. Thus, the fact that Washington is pushing democracy gives it a bad odor.
 The result is that Saudi Arabia's political reformists in both the liberal and religious camps no longer have the confidence they had just weeks ago that reform will lead to real changes, like an elected Consultative Council tackling significant problems. 
 Many Saudis contend that the royal family recognizes the anger bubbling throughout the kingdom, but simply refuses to accept far-reaching changes as the answer.
 ''Up to now, the government has yet to take a clear decision that it wants to reform,'' said Abdel Aziz al-Qasim, a retired judge and a moderate Islamist heavily involved in trying to reshape the kingdom's educational curriculum. ''There are partial decisions or partial steps, but no central clear decision supporting reform.''
 Among the worrying signs for reformists: a dozen outspoken advocates for change were arrested in March, and there are no visible preparations for municipal elections promised this fall.
 Mr. Qasim and others offer three main reasons for the renewed hesitancy. First, the most hard-line advocates of change raised the stakes by discussing topics like constitutional monarchy, apparently frightening senior princes that change might mushroom out of control.
 Second, much of the pressure for change had come from Washington, but given the state of the American starter-democracy project next door in Iraq, the pressure has little effect. 
 Finally, the price of oil remains high, so the princes feel less need to appease public demands than they would if they were, for example, contemplating some kind of tax to raise revenue.
 Since the March arrests, newspapers that had been growing more daring all but stopped printing columns about major issues like unemployment, making public the full national budget and establishing an independent judiciary.
 Dissidents note that the new, government-appointed National Human Rights Association did little about the arrests other than issuing a statement saying it was following the case.
 The arrests came on the eve of a visit by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and were seen as a clear message to both the democracy proponents and the Americans to back off.
 Prince Saud al-Faisal, the foreign minister, said as much at a joint news conference with Mr. Powell. ''These people sought dissension when the whole country was looking for unity and a clear vision, especially at a time when it is facing a terrorist threat,'' the prince said.
 Those arrested were told that their freedom hinged on signing ''I'm sorry and I will not do it again'' confessions. Three of the intellectuals -- Ali Doulemi, Abdullah al-Hamid and Matrouk al-Falah -- refused and remain imprisoned.
 They were part of a group preparing a statement against the new human rights organization and planning to announce the formation of a similar, independent group.
 Crown Prince Abdullah initiated a ''national dialogue'' last June, inviting select groups of Saudi thinkers to attend several days of conferences to discuss important issues. He even took the unprecedented step of including women and members of the sometimes reviled Shiite Muslim minority. But no concrete plans have emerged from the discussions.
 The elections the crown prince promised for half the seats in municipal councils also remain a question mark. Saleh al-Malik, a member of the Consultative Council, said plans were proceeding to hold them in 178 municipalities. The Ministry of Municipal Affairs is working on the bylaws, but major questions remain unanswered, like the minimum voting age and whether women can vote, he said.
 The government will probably await a planned September census before developing voter registration rolls, which may mean postponing the elections scheduled for October. ''We have waited for so long, it won't hurt to wait a couple months more,'' Mr. Malik said.
 More important, the puritanical Wahhabi religious doctrine does not abet change. Jaafar Sheikh Idris, a Sudanese scholar in Saudi Arabia writing a book about Islam and democracy, notes that the most conservative clerics here say, ''If we take democracy to mean the rule of the people, that goes against the principle of Islam because in Islam this is God's right.''
 Saudi Arabia calls the Koran the only constitution it will ever need.
 ''They say Koran, Koran, do you want something other than the Koran?'' groused one retired professor, also declining to use his name because of recent arrests. ''Of course you have to say no.''
 The religious establishment feels it already lost one round this academic year when the lesson directing Muslims to shun non-Muslims was removed from religious textbooks. Some Saudis wanted it deleted because the principle was used to justify terrorist attacks, but conservative clerics depicted the change as the first step by the West in dismantling the country's religion through the education system.
 ''Saying that the Jews and the Christians are infidels is part of our religious dogma,'' said Saleh S. al-Wohaibi, the American-educated secretary general of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth. Any changes in the way it is taught should be decided by Saudis, he said, adding, ''It doesn't mean we try to incite hatred against others, but my religion has its own principles that should not be violated or changed.''
 Few Saudis say they want to replace the royal family, considered a stabilizing force, especially seeing what is unrolling in Iraq. But they believe strong government institutions could run the country more effectively than a few aging princes.
 No one believes that the recent terror attacks -- always attributed to ''deviants'' in official Saudi statements -- pose a real threat to unseating the royal family, the Sauds. 
 ''All the indicators that I see tell me that the government is strong and that the numbers who are opposing them violently are small,'' said James C. Oberwetter, the American ambassador.
 Reformists warn, however, that the royals are deluding themselves with the argument that they need to kill or capture those fomenting terrorism before they can consider opening up the political process.
 As long as young men cannot find jobs, remain frustrated with their prospects and have no means to express their problems, there will be deep problems here that will continue reverberating beyond Saudi Arabia's borders, they say.
 ''If reform was proceeding, we would not have arrived at this violence,'' said Mr. Qasim, the former judge.

HEADLINE: In Europe, Cellphone Profits Go Up as Clothes Come Off

BYLINE: By JENNIFER L. SCHENKER; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
EXECUTIVES of some of the world's largest telecommunications companies came to Amsterdam late last month and hobnobbed with sex shop owners, publishers of pornographic images and producers of hard-core videos.
 The thrill they were seeking, of course, was economic.
 Until recently, risque mobile phone services have been limited. But now that third-generation, high-speed networks and cellphones that offer video are on the European market, carriers are looking to make money by a proven method: pornography. 
 Gartner, the industry research company, estimates that sexual content over cellphones will generate $1.5 billion in Western Europe next year, or about 5.1 percent of the total mobile data market.
 The Vodafone Group, based in Britain and one of the world's largest mobile operators, has introduced what it calls ''risque'' content through its Vodafone Live portal in 10 of the 16 markets where the portal is available, and other mainstream cellphone operators and content providers are gearing up. For Vodafone, content ranges from off-color jokes to photos of topless women, but more hard-core material is expected to follow.
 ''It is a big commercial opportunity, so it is fair to say that commercial operators will have to exploit this opportunity in some way,'' said Tina Southall, head of content standards for the company.
 Sexual content represents ''one of the few possibilities for mobile operators to make significant revenues, even if they don't want to admit it,'' said Berth Milton, chief executive of the Private Media Group, a Nasdaq-listed company based in Barcelona, Spain, that distributes pornography. ''Operators have put billions of euros into 3G networks, so they need to generate revenues even more than the content providers.''
 Of course, there is the question of whether phones are a good medium for pornography. 
 Mr. Milton of Private Media Group said that videos would have be adjusted. ''We will have to edit them and make them more interactive,'' he said.
 So far, the public seems to like what it sees. Netcollex, a British company that offers both soft and hard pornography over cellphones, said that in 12 months it had signed up 67,000 customers, who pay $2.65 to see one of a selection of short video clips, plus transmission charges. 
 But while the financial rewards are clear, so are the complications. The question of how to get involved while remaining good corporate citizens was part of what brought executives from big carriers like Vodafone, Orange, MM02 and Virgin Mobile, among others, to a panel discussion that drew participants from overlapping trade shows on telecommunications and adult entertainment in Amsterdam last month.
 Virgin Mobile, which has 5.5 million customers in Britain, the United States and Australia, has created a position called ''head of adult services,'' said John Conlon, who holds the title. But he said that the company did not plan to introduce these services until safeguards were in place.
 Vodafone will work with banks to see if a person's address matches the credit card used, on the assumption that those under 18 do not have credit cards. It is also working to introduce filters that would permit parents to block their children's phones from receiving sexual content, Ms. Southall said.
 Richard Brown, group public affairs director for MM02, the British mobile phone company, said that while the Internet ''proved almost impossible to control,'' the industry hopes that installing safeguards early will provide some protection.
 Still, he said, ''It is harder to supervise such a personal device than it is to control what little Johnny is doing on a computer.''

HEADLINE: For Future Leaders, a Retreat Before a Hard Charge

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
The rock had to go. Simple as that. It was in the way, and it had to go. So Christon Harris and his friends took turns slamming it with a pickax, slipping their hands around, over and under it, prying and pushing until it popped out of the dirt where it had tripped up absent-minded hikers for who knows how many years.
 Similar battles -- some less successful, others more modest -- played out along a path in the Catskill Mountains shrouded in dangling branches and swarms of gnats. The symbolism was evident to even the most citified among them, since they had plenty of experience helping one another overcome various obstacles during high school. This ritual in sweat and stone, one of several during a weekend retreat, would unite them one last time before they scattered across the country and into college.
 ''I got a lot of tension out,'' Christon said later, sitting quietly among his friends as night crept over the campground. ''Everything felt in balance. New York City versus the woods.'' 
 Tension and balance. What was and what could be. That will define their lives for the next four years. Over the last four, they have been taught and counseled, encouraged and challenged in a leadership group for high school students blessed with talent and promise, but not money. In September, they will confront the competing tugs of identity, ambition, community and class as they enroll in some of the country's most selective colleges, where they will be in the racial and economic minority for the first time in their lives.
 Past generations measured success by the mile -- by how far they escaped from the streets and people of their childhood. These teenagers consider it a little more complicated: they want the impressive degree and the good job, but they are expected to remember the old neighborhoods as vital places that need their skills.
 ''We're helping them get through the glass ceiling,'' said Richard Rivera, the director of the program, which is known as the Institute for Leadership, Excellence and Academic Development. ''But we're also telling them: 'Look, you have been given an incredible opportunity. You have a responsibility to create opportunity for others. It's not about getting out and getting away. It's about coming back and making a difference.'''
 Seventy teenagers had barely started their freshman year at various Catholic high schools in the city when teachers and counselors decided they could be leaders and selected them for a new enrichment program financed by the Goldman Sachs Foundation. They had good grades and they were hungry. They were willing to sacrifice their Saturdays for classes and cultural activities and they spent their summers as scholarship students in college programs or foreign exchanges in places as far away as Australia.
 ''The only continent they haven't gone to yet is Antarctica,'' Mr. Rivera said. ''And I'm working on it.''
 As it is, college and professional careers are virgin territory for many of their friends on the block. But the 42 who survived all four years talk like veterans who have earned their place in college through hard work and determination.
 What others outside their world think, however, is curious. 
 Rhenita Brade, a clear-eyed and confident senior at Aquinas High School who is headed to Trinity College, remembered how two summers ago she was the only scholarship student in a summer program in Ecuador.
 ''The 20 other kids just had rich parents,'' she said. ''One night they were talking about drugs and sex and they said to me, 'You know what I mean.' To be honest, I had no idea what they were talking about. They just expected me to know because I am African-American and come from the Bronx.''
 Christon, a senior at Rice who is going to Cornell, knows it will not be easy. Then again, what was over the last four years? He was rambunctious and impatient in the beginning, often coming close to quitting. Then, something clicked. Maybe it was the fact that adults refused to accept his excuses. Maybe it was because they let him talk. Maybe he looked around his Bronx neighborhood and realized this was no game.
 ''I can't say I had an epiphany,'' he said. ''I just knew what I had to do. I changed.''
 Greater change awaits.
 ''I know I will be one of the few black males from a working-class family,'' he said. ''Maybe I can change the stereotypes people have about us. It doesn't scare me.''
 Such self-assurance came easily after the four years he and others spend supporting one another. Sure, there are cliques within the group, with shy loners or strutting jocks. But there was also a common goal and a spirit that pushed them along, a spirit forged in three previous retreats.
 A nervous, melancholy air hung over their final retreat, held on the last weekend in April. Some of them were full of bluster, as if to deny the fact they would soon be away from one another and on their own. Others were quiet, almost rebelliously so.
 To remind them one last time of themselves and their goals, they participated in ''The System,'' where they surveyed a room filled with seats arranged in a pyramid. Alvin Herring, the retreat leader, told them to sit where they thought that society had made a place for them. A few dashed to the top of the pyramid, many more in the middle. A couple of others rejected it outright and sat off to the side.
 The students broke into small groups and debated one another intensely. Do poor people choose to not get ahead? Is your parents' economic class your destiny? Was there an alternative? Who set the rules? Why not a circle? 
 ''I think the whole idea of an equal playing field is ridiculous,'' Rhenita said. ''The only person looking out for what is best for you is yourself.''
 While the arguments raged, a couple of teenagers walked around the room and knocked down all the chairs. Mr. Herring said it was the only time an exercise like this had ended with an impromptu class uprising. 
 ''That is one of the key challenges in higher education right now, since so many schools are pursuing a strategy of ethnic and cultural diversity,'' he said. ''But there is no class diversity. There is no class dialogue. As you can see, these kids want that dialogue. They feel comfortable in the chaos.''
 The next morning the circle won out. There was still tension, hard feelings over some nighttime pranks that got out of hand. They were gently reminded that goodbyes were near, that new beginnings were, too. They got up and walked around the room, saying quiet thanks and tearful farewells.
 ''Are you ready to lead?'' Mr. Herring asked.
 Jaleni Thompson gave it his own reading: he thought he was asked if he was ready to leave.
 ''I'm not ready,'' Jaleni said. ''But I know I have to.''
 Rebekah Grant was definitely not ready to go. She spoke haltingly about how relatives had always wanted her to do more, to take the spotlight. Mr. Herring gently asked her to stand beside him. Who was kind to her? Two people stood up and faced the girl. Who would like to be kind? Almost everyone joined them.
 Like a revival meeting, her friends talked about past moments of grace and laughter with her. One talked about how she listened when others wouldn't or couldn't. Someone got close enough to notice -- after four years -- that she had a dimple.
 ''I didn't talk much,'' Rebekah finally said. ''But I really like you. And I still need your help and encouragement.''
 The small crowd closed in on her. Even the jocks were biting their lips and dabbing at red-rimmed eyes.
 ''Can we hug her yet?'' someone asked.
 And they did. Simple as that.

HEADLINE: States' Tax Receipts Rise, Leading to Some Surpluses

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2 

 BODY:
States across the country are reporting stronger tax collections this spring for the first time in three years, fueling hopes that the bleakest budget-cutting days of the economic downturn are over, state officials and fiscal experts say.
 From Florida to Oklahoma to Oregon, tax revenues are up in recent months from the same period last year, the first consistent increases many states have experienced since Wall Street's bubble burst in 2001.
 ''Our economy has bottomed out and is improving slightly,'' said Ken Rocco, a fiscal officer for the Oregon Legislature, echoing the comments of many state budget officials.
 Stronger-than-anticipated tax revenues combined with tight spending practices over the past few years are allowing 32 states to finish their 2004 fiscal years with surpluses, according to a survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures.
 But most of those surpluses are small and a dark cloud remains: tax revenues are not growing fast enough to offset the rapidly rising costs of Medicaid, pensions and education, which account for most state spending. 
 As a result, 33 states faced projected revenue shortfalls in their 2005 budgets, and about 20 are still struggling to close them, the survey, released last week by the conference, said. Most states' fiscal years begin on July 1 or Oct. 1. 
 According to the survey, 30 states reported in March that personal income tax collections were at or above projections. In 36 states, sales taxes were coming in at levels as good as or better than forecast. And corporate income taxes were coming in on or above target in 37 states. 
 California has the worst budget problem by far, projecting a $15 billion gap in its 2005 budget. But for most states, the estimated shortfalls are significantly smaller than the yawning gaps they had to close in recent years, experts said.
 ''Yes, revenues are improving, but for almost all states, it is not enough,'' said Robert Kurtter, senior vice president for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service. ''Fiscal '05 is continuing to be a difficult budget year.''
 Experts said it would take significantly longer than a few months of improved tax collections to lift states out of their financial holes. Though the recession was short-lived, tax revenues have been down in most states partly because hiring and the stock market -- an increasingly important factor in state revenues -- have not returned to their peak pre-recession levels.
 Most states compensated for the lost revenue by cutting programs, raising tuition and fees, or borrowing, experts said. Only a few raised taxes during the downturn. As a result, many states are spending only slightly more today than they were five years ago, causing pent-up demands to spend in many legislatures.
 Governors expect expenditures for their 2005 fiscal years to rise 2.8 percent from 2004, well below the 26-year average of 6.2 percent, the National Governors Association, which released its own survey of budgets on Monday, said. The growth in spending is up from the 0.6 percent increase in the last fiscal year, which was the smallest increase in 20 years, the association said.
 ''During the previous downturn in 1991, two-thirds of states filled their shortfalls by increasing taxes,'' said Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the governors' association. ''This time, you've got the flip of that. Most states filled shortfalls by cutting budgets.''
 ''We're going to need two to three years of fairly robust revenue growth to get it all comfortable,'' Mr. Scheppach added.
 Despite the problems, budget directors expressed relief that state revenues were no longer shrinking.
 According to the survey by the legislatures' conference, eight states reported that revenues from all major taxes were higher than expected, a clear sign of economic recovery. Those states were Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Tennessee. 
 In Alabama, where voters last fall rejected a proposal by Gov. Bob Riley, a Republican, to increase taxes, improved tax collections this year have allowed the state to increase education aid. 
 Oklahoma has had even stronger growth, recording eight consecutive months of tax revenues above the previous year's levels. After experiencing the sharpest decline in tax collections in two decades last year, lawmakers responded to the good reports by calling for tax cuts and spending increases.
 ''We've hit bottom and are starting out of the trough,'' said Scott Meacham, finance director for Gov. Brad Henry, a Democrat. 
 But many more states are finding that improved revenues are not offsetting rising costs, particularly for Medicaid, which is expanding at rates of more than 10 percent in most states. Many of those states are looking at new cuts or new sources of revenue, like raising cigarette taxes or legalizing gambling. 
 Virginia, for example, has struggled to close a $6 billion shortfall over the last two years by trimming state jobs and programs. This year, its tax revenues have steadied. But Gov. Mark Warner, a Democrat, still projects that spending growth will outpace revenues by more than $600 million a year for years. 
 To close the gap, he has proposed overhauling the state tax system, cutting some taxes and increasing others to raise more than $1 billion in additional revenues over two years. After a contentious debate in which House Republicans proposed smaller increases and Senate Republicans sought much larger ones, a compromise was struck last week that approximated Mr. Warner's proposal. 
 The plan calls for increasing the sales and cigarette taxes, closing corporate tax loopholes and freezing a scheduled car tax reduction, while reducing income taxes for many residents and food taxes.
 R. Kirk Jonas, deputy director of a nonpartisan commission that analyzes state finances for the Virginia Legislature, said lawmakers felt compelled to accept new taxes because they were tired of cuts and because tax revenues, while steadier, were still not abundant.
 ''The economy is not growing that strongly,'' Mr. Jonas said. 
 Maryland has experienced stronger revenue growth than Virginia this year. But it is also facing chronic shortfalls, partly due to big increases in aid to public schools passed by the Legislature. The state is projecting an $800 million shortfall for 2006, growing to $1 billion the next year, even with improving tax collections. 
 Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a Republican, has called for legalizing slot machines to raise money and has vowed to reject any broad-based tax increases. But Democrats who control the House of Delegates say they will not accept his gambling plan unless it is linked to tax increases. 
 However, James C. DiPaula Jr., budget secretary for the governor, said: ''We've spent our way into this problem. We shouldn't be trying to tax our way out of it.''
 Some states are reporting only minimal revenue improvements, particularly in Midwestern manufacturing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana and Ohio, which have been hit hardest by layoffs.
 In Ohio, Gov. Bob Taft, a Republican, announced in March a budget shortfall of $372 million for 2005. Having struggled through three years of deep budget cuts, Mr. Taft began imposing a new round last week, eliminating some state jobs and reducing the state vehicle fleet, among other steps. 
 Tim Keen, the assistant state budget director, said personal income and corporate taxes were meeting projections for the first time in years. But they will have to grow much faster to offset anticipated losses in federal aid and increases in Medicaid costs next year, he said. 
 ''This recession might have been over quickly, but we were hit much more severely,'' Mr. Keen said.

HEADLINE: Ford's Sales Fell 4.4% Last Month

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 3 

 BODY:
Sales at the Ford Motor Company fell 4.4 percent in April from a year earlier, the company reported today, even though it relied more heavily on discounted deals with rental car companies than in previous months. The performance raised some questions about the sustainability of Ford's strong first-quarter earnings. 
 ''We bogeyed April,'' said George Pipas, Ford's chief industry sales analyst. ''We put more weight on our track record over the last eight months, and that has been good.'' 
 Ford has several product introductions coming up, including the new Ford Five Hundred sedan, the redesigned Mustang and the Freestyle wagon. But these vehicles will not reach showrooms until late summer. 
 ''Admittedly, these next few months, before the next wave of new products hit, I think will be difficult -- challenging,'' Mr. Pipas said. ''But we can't let one month's sales results dictate a change to our business plan and our strategy.''
 That strategy has been to emphasize profitable sales even if market share slides, a reversal of Detroit's recent approach. Ford eased its spending on rebates and low-rate financing deals last month; sale for sale, its incentives were the lowest of the Big Three for the second month, though still averaging $4,119 a vehicle, according to Autodata. 
 The major manufacturers usually report monthly sales the same day, but this month General Motors and its Isuzu, Subaru and Saab affiliates did not report because of a computer problem. The company said figures would be released Tuesday. 
 Toyota reported sales rose 10.1 percent in April from a year earlier, according to figures adjusted for daily selling rates by Ward's AutoInfoBank. Honda showed signs of weakness, with sales off 2.4 percent in April after a disappointing first quarter. Sales at Nissan rose 14 percent in April, largely because of its new entries in the full-size pickup and sport utility categories. Though they are selling below expectations, the new vehicles -- the Titan and the Armada -- are nonetheless adding several thousand vehicles to Nissan's total each month. Sales at the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler rose 1 percent last month. 
 Automakers said improving economic conditions should keep sales high this year. ''The latest data shows that a broad-based, sustainable recovery is under way,'' said Jarlath Costello, Ford's senior domestic economist. Mr. Costello added that rising sales of heavy trucks and Ford's Econoline van were signs of improved business spending. ''This point is worth emphasizing, because some months back, there was concern that the economy was overly dependent on consumer spending and therefore not sustainable,'' he said. ''That concern is now fading, with equipment spending having increased at a double-digit pace over the last several months.''

HEADLINE: A War for Us, Fought by Them

BYLINE: By William Broyles Jr.. 
William Broyles Jr., the founding editor of Texas Monthly, wrote the screenplay for ''Cast Away.''

DATELINE: WILSON, Wyo. 

 BODY:
The longest love affair of my life began with a shotgun marriage. It was the height of the Vietnam War and my student deferment had run out. Desperate not to endanger myself or to interrupt my personal plans, I wanted to avoid military service altogether. I didn't have the resourcefulness of Bill Clinton, so I couldn't figure out how to dodge the draft. I tried to escape into the National Guard, where I would be guaranteed not to be sent to war, but I lacked the connections of George W. Bush, so I couldn't slip ahead of the long waiting list. My attitude was the same as Dick Cheney's: I was special, I had ''other priorities.'' Let other people do it. 
 When my draft notice came in 1968, I was relieved in a way. Although I had deep doubts about the war, I had become troubled about how I had angled to avoid military service. My classmates from high school were in the war; my classmates from college were not -- exactly the dynamic that exists today. But instead of reporting for service in the Army, on a whim I joined the Marine Corps, the last place on earth I thought I belonged. 
 My sacrifice turned out to be minimal. I survived a year as an infantry lieutenant in Vietnam. I was not wounded; nor did I struggle for years with post-traumatic stress disorder. A long bout of survivor guilt was the price I paid. Others suffered far more, particularly those who had to serve after the war had lost all sense of purpose for the men fighting it. I like to think that in spite of my being so unwilling at first, I did some small service to my country and to that enduring love of mine, the United States Marine Corps.
 To my profound surprise, the Marines did a far greater service to me. In three years I learned more about standards, commitment and yes, life, than I did in six years of university. I also learned that I had had no idea of my own limits: when I was exhausted after humping up and down jungle mountains in 100-degree heat with a 75-pound pack, terrified out of my mind, wanting only to quit, convinced I couldn't take another step, I found that in fact I could keep going for miles. And my life was put in the hands of young men I would otherwise never have met, by and large high-school dropouts, who turned out to be among the finest people I have ever known. 
 I am now the father of a young man who has far more character than I ever had. I joined the Marines because I had to; he signed up after college because he felt he ought to. He volunteered for an elite unit and has served in both Afghanistan and Iraq. When I see images of Americans in the war zones, I think of my son and his friends, many of whom I have come to know and deeply respect. When I opened this newspaper yesterday and read the front-page headline, ''9 G.I.'s Killed,'' I didn't think in abstractions. I thought very personally.
 The problem is, I don't see the images of or read about any of the young men and women who, as Dick Cheney and I did, have ''other priorities.'' There are no immediate family members of any of the prime civilian planners of this war serving in it -- beginning with President Bush and extending deep into the Defense Department. Only one of the 535 members of Congress, Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota, has a child in the war -- and only half a dozen others have sons and daughters in the military.
 The memorial service yesterday for Pat Tillman, the football star killed in Afghanistan, further points out this contrast. He remains the only professional athlete of any sport who left his privileged life during this war and turned in his play uniform for a real one. With few exceptions, the only men and women in military service are the profoundly patriotic or the economically needy. 
 It was not always so. In other wars, the men and women in charge made sure their family members led the way. Since 9/11, the war on terrorism has often been compared to the generational challenge of Pearl Harbor; but Franklin D. Roosevelt's sons all enlisted soon after that attack. Both of Lyndon B. Johnson's sons-in-law served in Vietnam.
 This is less a matter of politics than privilege. The Democratic elites have not responded more nobly than have the Republican; it's just that the Democrats' hypocrisy is less acute. Our president's own family illustrates the loss of the sense of responsibility that once went with privilege. In three generations the Bushes have gone from war hero in World War II, to war evader in Vietnam, to none of the extended family showing up in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Pat Tillman didn't want to be singled out for having done what other patriotic Americans his age should have done. The problem is, they aren't doing it. In spite of the president's insistence that our very civilization is at stake, the privileged aren't flocking to the flag. The war is being fought by Other People's Children. The war is impersonal for the very people to whom it should be most personal. 
 If the children of the nation's elites were facing enemy fire without body armor, riding through gantlets of bombs in unarmored Humvees, fighting desperately in an increasingly hostile environment because of arrogant and incompetent civilian leadership, then those problems might well find faster solutions. 
 The men and women on active duty today -- and their companions in the National Guard and the reserves -- have seen their willingness, and that of their families, to make sacrifices for their country stretched thin and finally abused. Thousands of soldiers promised a one-year tour of duty have seen that promise turned into a lie. When Eric Shinseki, then the Army chief of staff, told the president that winning the war and peace in Iraq would take hundreds of thousands more troops, Mr. Bush ended his career. As a result of this and other ill-advised decisions, the war is in danger of being lost, and my beloved military is being run into the ground. 
 This abuse of the voluntary military cannot continue. How to ensure adequate troop levels, with a diversity of backgrounds? How to require the privileged to shoulder their fair share? In other words, how to get today's equivalents of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Dick Cheney -- and me -- into the military, where their talents could strengthen and revive our fighting forces? 
 The only solution is to bring back the draft. Not since the 19th century has America fought a war that lasted longer than a week with an all-volunteer army; we can't do it now. It is simply not built for a protracted major conflict. The arguments against the draft -- that a voluntary army is of higher quality, that the elites will still find a way to evade service -- are bogus. In World War II we used a draft army to fight the Germans and Japanese -- two of the most powerful military machines in history -- and we won. The problems in the military toward the end of Vietnam were not caused by the draft; they were the result of young Americans being sent to fight and die in a war that had become a disaster. 
 One of the few good legacies of Vietnam is that after years of abuses we finally learned how to run the draft fairly. A strictly impartial lottery, with no deferments, can ensure that the draft intake matches military needs. Chance, not connections or clever manipulation, would determine who serves. 
 If this war is truly worth fighting, then the burdens of doing so should fall on all Americans. If you support this war, but assume that Pat Tillman and Other People's Children should fight it, then you are worse than a hypocrite. If it's not worth your family fighting it, then it's not worth it, period. The draft is the truest test of public support for the administration's handling of the war, which is perhaps why the administration is so dead set against bringing it back.

HEADLINE: Building a Name as an Advocate for Public Health

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Tucked away in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's mostly unsurprising budget last week was one eyepopper: a gift of $200 million for the public hospital system's operating budget, money that will help pull the system out of its red ink. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's decision to sharply increase payments to the Health and Hospitals Corporation stands in stark contrast to the city's attitude during the Giuliani administration, which for years focused on cutting subsidies to the system and enforcing financial discipline at the corporation. 
 The change reflects Mr. Bloomberg's deep personal interest in the city's public health system, particularly its hospitals, which rivals Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's fixation with the Police Department. 
 Not only did the mayor propose using $200 million to help the system break even next year, but he has also increased the corporation's capital budget by roughly $700 million since he came into office, at a time when he has scaled back projects on other agencies. Among his plans are a major modernization of Harlem Hospital Center, budgeted at $225 million, a new outpatient center at Jacobi Medical Center and new clinics at Queens Hospital Center.
 The mayor has attended numerous news conferences at public hospitals -- more over two years than Mr. Giuliani attended during his entire eight-year tenure, said people who have worked for or monitored the system. Ambitious cancer screening programs have begun on his watch. And Mr. Bloomberg brags to anyone who will listen about the high ratings a number of public hospitals recently received from an outside monitor.
 Just yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg told a group of business leaders during a breakfast at Tavern on the Green that the public hospital system was the least recognized area of government. ''The thing that I find the most underreported, but is something that I am very proud of, is the quality of the 11 H.H.C. hospitals,'' he said. ''In the hospitals in this city, those at the lower end of the economic ladder arguably get better services than those at the high end.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's intense commitment to the city's public hospitals likely stems from his longstanding interest in public health, one of the few areas of government that he had direct experience with before he became mayor. 
 He has given millions of dollars to public health interests. The School of Public Health at his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, was recently named after Mr. Bloomberg, reflecting his sizable gifts. He has given substantial authority and berth to his health commissioner, Thomas R. Frieden, who was the architect of his controversial smoking ban. 
 While Mr. Bloomberg has had to learn the ins and outs of, say, transportation financing and development on Staten Island, he has been able to tick off statistics about childhood diarrhea and malaria for years. ''Definitely with Mayor Bloomberg you have somebody who is very sympathetic toward the public health agenda,'' said Dr. Benjamin K. Chu, president of Health and Hospitals Corporation.
 Not everyone is thrilled. ''He seems to have fallen in love with H.H.C.,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, a senior fellow with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group, noting that the city has just emerged from a fiscal crisis. ''This doesn't fall into the category of what he calls nondiscretionary spending. It is surprising to see him being so generous, if not profligate, in an area he does control.''
 The city's public hospital system has a long history of financial problems and scandals that have ended more than one Health and Hospitals Corporation president's career and embarrassed previous mayors. Soon after Mr. Giuliani took office, he tried to privatize some public hospitals and shutter others, moves that were stopped by community opposition and, finally, the courts.
 He then changed course, substantially decreasing the city's subsidy for the corporation, cutting 12,898 jobs and forcing it to stem its tide of red ink. The corporation responded under the tutelage of Dr. Luis R. Marcos, its longest-serving president, by trimming costs, reducing the number of days patients stayed in its hospitals and enrolling as many patients as possible in Medicaid programs, which eased the cost of caring for the hospitals' many uninsured patients. He also laid the groundwork for many hospitals -- some of which had serious problems with their quality of care -- to get the improved marks Mr. Bloomberg likes to crow about. 
 When Mr. Bloomberg appointed Dr. Chu, he expected him to carry out the corporation's mission to keep costs down. Dr. Chu also was encouraged to improve the quality of care and attack stubborn health care problems among its mostly poor 1.2 million patients. 
 At Jacobi Medical Center, for example, 70,000 women each year have been given mammograms since Mr. Bloomberg became mayor, and 1,000 women had their cancers discovered. A similar program for colon cancer is accelerating across the city. Dr. Chu has also reduced waiting times at many Health and Hospitals Corporation clinics to one hour, something unimaginable even a few years ago.
 Even though Dr. Chu has further reduced the system's uninsured patients from 490,000 in 2001 to 450,000 last year, he still faces a possible budget deficit next year, largely due to increased pension costs. Further, the corporation has run out of many of the one-shot budget maneuvers that have helped generate cash in the past. With the city's $200 million infusion, the corporation will break even next year, or end up with a deficit between $20 million and $50 million. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has also repeatedly said that he will not close any hospitals, and indeed will give them as much money as he can to pursue their public health care agenda. And talk of privatization is out.
 ''It certainly grabs your attention when the mayor gives them $200 million,'' said Charles Brecher, a professor of public and health administration at the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University. ''I think at some basic level the mayor has a bigger commitment philosophically to the mission of H.H.C. than Giuliani did, and a basic willingness to support it. I think he believes they are delivering good services.''

HEADLINE: Kerry Life Story Will Be Focus Of Big Ad Buy

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3 

 BODY:
John Kerry's campaign announced Monday that it was making what it called the largest single purchase of advertising time in a presidential race, unveiling commercials that tell Mr. Kerry's life story from birth to the Vietnam War to two decades in the United States Senate.
 Mr. Kerry's advisers described the advertisements, which are to run heavily in 19 states through the end of the month at a cost of $27.5 million, as the beginning of a long process of introducing the candidate to general election voters. It is a move many Democrats have warned was too long in coming.
 One of the 60-second advertisements also associates Mr. Kerry with Senator John McCain, a Republican popular with independents and swing voters, showing a picture of the two senators side-by-side and noting their cooperation with each other in accounting for Americans lost or taken prisoner in Vietnam. 
 The new advertising push -- its magnitude possible because Mr. Kerry opted out of the public finance system -- is in large measure Mr. Kerry's response to a two-month $60 million barrage of advertisements from President Bush, who spent the day traveling southern Michigan by bus. [Page A26.]
 Most of the Bush spots attacked Mr. Kerry as a political equivocator bent on raising taxes and soft on defense, an image that some Democrats and opinion polls suggested was beginning to take hold in voters' minds.
 Mr. Kerry's aides said Monday that his advertisements would establish his leadership credentials, highlighting his decorated combat record in Vietnam. They also said the advertisements would position his campaign as more positive than that of Mr. Bush, who weeks ago shifted to nothing but attack commercials.
 Mr. Kerry's aides asserted that the president's strategy was little more than to ''destroy John Kerry,'' and that it had failed because the two men were still running neck and neck in the polls. 
 ''While George Bush has spent $60 million to run negative ads,'' said Mary Beth Cahill, Mr. Kerry's campaign manager, ''John Kerry is up with a stronger message that will define the themes of his presidency: 'Together we can build a stronger America.' ''
 Mr. Bush's aides were dismissive of their opponent's effort to flesh out his biography. ''I don't think the problem is that people haven't been introduced to Senator Kerry,'' said Matthew Dowd, a senior Bush election adviser. ''I think the problem is they've been introduced to him in the last 60 to 90 days and they find his record and statements very troubling.''
 The new advertisements will run at a cost of $25 million between now and May 27, the Kerry campaign said. In addition, a 30-second advertisement that has been running for a few weeks is being extended at a cost of $2.5 million. 
 Mr. Kerry is able to spend so much at this point in the campaign because of his decision last December not to participate in the public financing system and accept its spending caps. At the time, the decision allowed him to use his own money to prop up his struggling campaign. Now it is letting him spend the tens of millions of dollars he is raking in at a rate beyond his fund-raisers' wildest hopes. Mr. Kerry's aides said that four years ago, Vice President Al Gore was held to spending no more than $9 million between Super Tuesday and the Democratic convention.
 Mr. Kerry's use of Mr. McCain's image came without his permission, though a campaign aide contacted the Arizona senator's office on Monday morning to inform him, said Marshall Wittmann, a spokesman for Mr. McCain.
 Mr. Wittmann said Mr. McCain was traveling and could not be reached for comment. 
 ''A plethora of presidential candidates have mentioned Senator McCain over the past year,'' Mr. Wittmann said, alluding to Democrats like Senator Joseph I. Lieberman who invoked Mr. McCain's name in the primaries.
 Mr. Wittmann added: ''The Kerry ad is factually correct, and who knows? Perhaps the Bush campaign will highlight Senator McCain's work with the president as well.''
 The new advertisements also show Mr. Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, and his daughter Vanessa praising his character. A crewmate on his swift boat in Vietnam and a former Green Beret whom Mr. Kerry rescued from a river both say that he saved their lives in battle.
 Even though such a large advertising purchase is unusual this early in an election year, some Democrats had agitated for Mr. Kerry to respond even sooner, watching as the Bush campaign steadily depicted Mr. Kerry as a flip-flopper in advertisements, speeches, news releases and appearances by surrogates.
 In one sign that Mr. Kerry's Vietnam record is still fodder for attack, a group of Vietnam swift boat veterans critical of Mr. Kerry plans on Tuesday to call on him to authorize the Navy to independently release all his military records.
 ''The Bush guys have indeed done some serious work to define Kerry,'' said one prominent Democratic strategist who refused to be named. ''The polls are striking. Some of the damage can be undone, some not.''
 But other leading Democrats called the advertisements a strong move. ''This is exactly what John Kerry needs to do,'' said Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader from South Dakota. ''He needs to introduce himself in a meaningful way to the people in the country now, especially now after this attack campaign launched by the Bush administration. It has worked, so I think it's very important for John now to step up and introduce himself and his vision to the country.''
 The advertisements will run on national cable television and on broadcast stations in 17 states seen by both parties as battlegrounds. They will also run in Louisiana, where Senator Mary Landrieu won re-election last year by taking aim at Mr. Bush, encouraging Democrats about the state, and Colorado, where there are some unexpectedly competitive congressional races this year. Bush campaign officials indicated Monday that they too might expand their advertising purchases to Louisiana and Colorado, and Democrats late in the day said the Bush campaign was indeed moving to go on the air in Colorado on Wednesday.
 Both new Kerry advertisements note that the candidate was actually born in an Army hospital outside Denver. They also make reference to Mr. Kerry's alma mater, Yale, which he has in common with the president. In one advertisement, Mr. Kerry explains that he joined the Navy after college in 1966 because ''I thought it was important, if you had a lot of privileges as I had, to go to a great university like Yale, to give something back to your country.''
 Some Democratic strategists said they were intrigued to see both advertisements emphasize Yale, which would call attention to Mr. Kerry's image as an intellectual. One senior Kerry strategist said that because Mr. Kerry saw his elite education as impelling him to serve in the military, ''the baggage you might think would come with it doesn't exist.''
 The same advertisement that mentions Mr. McCain takes other steps to make Mr. Kerry look like more than an orthodox Democrat. It cites Mr. Kerry's breaking with Democrats to vote for a law in 1985 requiring a balanced budget, as well as his ''decisive vote that created 20 million new jobs.'' That vote, aides said, was in 1993 for President Clinton's tax increase and economic package.
 Vice President Dick Cheney attacked Mr. Kerry on Monday, citing that same vote and saying that ''higher taxes form the basis of Senator Kerry's economic plan.'' Speaking to about 700 Wal-Mart workers at the company's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., Mr. Cheney said Mr. Kerry's record showed ''that he expects that billions of dollars in tax increases will somehow create new jobs.'' He added, ''Senator Kerry's tax hikes would choke entrepreneurs and cut the recent job growth in our country.''
 Two groups that track advertising spending, the University of Wisconsin Advertising Project and Campaign Media Analysis Group, said this did appear to be the largest single purchase of advertising by a presidential campaign on record. Republicans teamed to spend $35 million in the last three weeks of the 2000 campaign in the top 75 television markets in the nation, the Wisconsin project said. More than half of that came from large donations contributed to the Republican Party and outside groups. 
 Tad Devine, a senior Kerry adviser, said that two months ago ''the president had $110 million cash on hand and John Kerry had $2.3 million.'' He said the campaign chose to take its time to raise money and talk to voters about the issues most important to them before making an aggressive advertising outlay.
 Mr. Kerry's advisers said they expected that they would be able to sustain a heavy advertising presence through the summer, though they acknowledged they would need to keep up the pace of their fund-raising to do so.

HEADLINE: Battlefield of Dreams

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Last November the top economist at the Heritage Foundation was very optimistic about Iraq, saying Paul Bremer had just replaced ''Saddam's soak-the-rich tax system'' with a flat tax. ''Few Americans would want to trade places with the people of Iraq,'' wrote the economist, Daniel Mitchell. ''But come tax time next April, they may begin to wonder who's better off.'' Even when he wrote that, the insurgency in Iraq was visibly boiling over; by ''tax time'' last month, the situation was truly desperate. 
 Much has been written about the damage done by foreign policy ideologues who ignored the realities of Iraq, imagining that they could use the country to prove the truth of their military and political doctrines. Less has been said about how dreams of making Iraq a showpiece for free trade, supply-side tax policy and privatization -- dreams that were equally oblivious to the country's realities -- undermined the chances for a successful transition to democracy. 
 A number of people, including Jay Garner, the first U.S. administrator of Iraq, think that the Bush administration shunned early elections, which might have given legitimacy to a transitional government, so it could impose economic policies that no elected Iraqi government would have approved. Indeed, over the past year the Coalition Provisional Authority has slashed tariffs, flattened taxes and thrown Iraqi industry wide open to foreign investors -- reinforcing the sense of many Iraqis that we came as occupiers, not liberators.
 But it's the reliance on private contractors to carry out tasks usually performed by government workers that has really come back to haunt us. 
 Conservatives make a fetish out of privatization of government functions; after the 2002 elections, George Bush announced plans to privatize up to 850,000 federal jobs. At home, wary of a public backlash, he has moved slowly on that goal. But in Iraq, where there is little public or Congressional oversight, the administration has privatized everything in sight. 
 For example, the Pentagon has a well-established procurement office for gasoline. In Iraq, however, that job was subcontracted to Halliburton. The U.S. government has many experts in economic development and reform. But in Iraq, economic planning has been subcontracted -- after a highly questionable bidding procedure -- to BearingPoint, a consulting firm with close ties to Jeb Bush.
 What's truly shocking in Iraq, however, is the privatization of purely military functions.
 For more than a decade, many noncritical jobs formerly done by soldiers have been handed to private contractors. When four Blackwater employees were killed and mutilated in Falluja, however, marking the start of a wider insurgency, it became clear that in Iraq the U.S. has extended privatization to core military functions. It's one thing to have civilians drive trucks and serve food; it's quite different to employ them as personal bodyguards to U.S. officials, as guards for U.S. government installations and -- the latest revelation -- as interrogators in Iraqi prisons. 
 According to reports in a number of newspapers, employees from two private contractors, CACI International and Titan, act as interrogators at the Abu Ghraib prison. According to Sewell Chan of The Washington Post, these contractors are ''at the center of the probe'' into the abuse of Iraqi prisoners. And that abuse, according to the senior defense analyst at Jane's, has ''almost certainly destroyed much of what support the coalition had among the more moderate section of the Iraqi population.''
 We don't yet know for sure that private contractors were at fault. But why put civilians, who cannot be court-martialed and hence aren't fully accountable, in that role? And why privatize key military functions? 
 I don't think it's simply a practical matter. Although there are several thousand armed civilians working for the occupation, their numbers aren't large enough to make a significant dent in the troop shortage. I suspect that the purpose is to set a precedent.
 You may ask whether our leaders' drive to privatize reflects a sincere conservative ideology, or a desire to enrich their friends. Probably both. But before Iraq, privatization that rewarded campaign contributors was a politically smart move, even if it was a net loss for the taxpayers. 
 In Iraq, however, reality does matter. And thanks to the ideologues who dictated our policy over the past year, reality looks pretty grim.

HEADLINE: WALL ST. BANKER IS FOUND GUILTY OF OBSTRUCTION

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN; Gary Rivlin and Jonathan Glater contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Frank P. Quattrone, the banker whose deal making helped fuel the 1990's technology boom, was found guilty yesterday of trying to impede government investigations into how hot stock offerings were doled out to investors. The verdict makes him the most prominent Wall Street figure to face prison since Michael R. Milken.
 Yesterday's verdict came in a retrial of Mr. Quattrone after his first trial ended in a hung jury last fall. This time, however, jurors quickly concluded that Mr. Quattrone had tried to hamper criminal and regulatory investigations when he endorsed a colleague's e-mail message in December 2000 urging his staff of bankers at Credit Suisse First Boston to ''clean up those files.''
 Mr. Quattrone, who visibly gulped as the judge read the verdict aloud, was perhaps the most prominent banker in Silicon Valley during the 1990's, leading the initial stock offerings of technology giants like Cisco Systems and Amazon.com that often soared to unheard-of heights in their first days of trading. 
 After that success and the bursting of the technology bubble, Mr. Quattrone and First Boston came under the microscope of regulators and prosecutors, who began investigating whether the bank was soliciting kickbacks from investors in exchange for access to hot stock offerings. Such a case was never brought.
 Yesterday's verdict, together with the unorthodox egalitarian public offering announced last week by the Internet search giant Google, may represent the beginning of a significant change in the way Wall Street conducts business as it seeks to distance itself from some of the more controversial practices of the 1990's. [Page C1.]
 The verdict is also vindication for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, which failed to win the same case against Mr. Quattrone last fall. Questions had been raised about the prosecution's decision to bring an obstruction case based on a one-line e-mail message that was viewed in some quarters as weak.
 ''You have to view this as something of a come-from-behind victory for the prosecution,'' said Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor and now a partner at McCarter & English. ''The government has successfully convinced the public that obstructing an investigation into bank fraud is just as serious as committing the bank fraud itself. With this verdict and the Martha Stewart conviction we have now seen for the second time the prosecution successfully employing the tactic of sidestepping a complex financial fraud prosecution in favor of a far more simplistic obstruction case.''
 The verdict in federal court came after many people who attended both trials were predicting acquittal because of Mr. Quattrone's stronger performance on the stand this time. Indeed, he appeared more confident and less evasive under questioning by prosecutors.
 In many respects, Mr. Quattrone, who helped ignite the initial offering boom in technology stocks, was to the 1990's what Mr. Milken and his junk-bond financing was to the 1980's. Both generated cash that helped fuel a wave of innovation and a stock bubble. Mr. Milken pleaded guilty to six securities charges in 1990, essentially admitting to cheating some customers, aiding others in the violation of securities and tax laws, and manipulating the securities market to benefit a client. Mr. Quattrone, however, like Ms. Stewart and the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen, was not convicted of a securities or fraud charge, but of impeding an investigation. 
 The Manhattan jury of six men and six women, who began deliberating Friday afternoon, found Mr. Quattrone guilty of two counts of obstruction of justice and one count of witness tampering. He is expected to face a prison sentence of as much as two years when he is sentenced in September.
 After the verdict was read, Mr. Quattrone left the courtroom stone-faced and expressionless, pausing to embrace his weeping mother, whom he comforted, whispering: ''It's going to be O.K. It's going to be O.K.'' Mr. Quattrone's friends and several former First Boston colleagues who had come to support him throughout the trial looked on in disbelief.
 Outside the courthouse, Mr. Quattrone's lead lawyer, John W. Keker, said he planned to appeal. ''I feel like we failed Frank,'' he said. ''He's innocent. There's an awful lot of evidence that the jury didn't hear. Perhaps if they heard it they would have reacted differently.''
 Standing beside a silent Mr. Quattrone, Mr. Keker, a former prosecutor of Oliver L. North during the Iran-contra trial, added, ''We have to do this thing until we get it right.''
 Success on appeal is typically low, but Judge Richard Owen, who is widely regarded as a pro-prosecution judge, has had several major decisions overruled. Mr. Keker has accused the judge of being biased and making several improper decisions, including a pretrial decision to preclude the introduction of evidence that First Boston deliberately misled Mr. Quattrone and evidence about Mr. Quattrone's state of mind.
 ''There is no question that Judge Owen ruled overwhelmingly in favor of the government, but in order to overturn his rulings on appeal, the defendant will have to show he clearly abused his wide discretion,'' said Orin Snyder, a former federal prosecutor who practices in the New York office of Manatt Phelps & Phillips. 
 Judge Owen has denied in court accusations that he favored one side over the other.
 Jurors painted a picture of Mr. Quattrone, who made $120 million in 2000, as a victim of his own reputation. ''We felt he had risen to the top of his profession; he was too smart to let this all happen to him,'' Sheldon Silver, a former actor and receptionist at a publicity agency, said in the subway station across from the courthouse. ''I don't think it was accidental.''
 Jonathan Miller, a software entrepreneur, who acknowledged that ''there was no direct evidence of what was in his mind,'' said, ''It was a difficult decision.''
 ''It's difficult because the crux of this case was the intent of the defendant -- what was on his mind,'' he said.
 Indeed, the jurors accepted the prosecution's argument that ''maybe he just thought he was too powerful to get caught,'' as David Anders, an assistant United States attorney said during his closing argument. Mr. Quattrone ''knew about the ongoing investigation,'' Mr. Anders said, ''and he told his employees to destroy documents anyway. He did it to obstruct justice, and he did it to protect his lucrative business and livelihood.''
 Mr. Keker rebutted that theory, saying in his closing, ''This case is about this itty-bitty e-mail and whether it amounts to three crimes.''
 ''This is not a man who intended to obstruct justice,'' he said. ''The government is asking you to connect a lot of dots that weren't connected in Frank Quattrone's mind.''
 The case hinged on a series of e-mail messages that started when Richard Char, a banker at First Boston, without any knowledge of the investigations, proposed to his superiors on Dec. 4, 2000, that they send out a notice reaffirming the company's document retention policy because of the possibility of civil lawsuits over the collapse of many technology stocks they had underwritten. With the approval of his superiors, Mr. Char sent it out. The message had also been copied to Mr. Quattrone and a First Boston lawyer based in the firm's office in Palo Alto, Calif.
 The next day, David M. Brodsky, a lawyer for First Boston, talked to Mr. Quattrone by phone and told him more about the investigations, which he had first disclosed to Mr. Quattrone in an e-mail message on Dec. 3. During that phone call, Mr. Brodsky told Mr. Quattrone that he might need to hire a personal lawyer because he could be called as a witness related to the investigations.
 That same morning, First Boston's lawyers in New York told Mr. Char separately that he should not have sent his notice and that they would send another notice that day rescinding his e-mail message.
 They did not do so until two days later. But that evening, before Mr. Quattrone left the office, he pressed ''reply to all'' on Mr. Char's message and endorsed it. ''Having been a key witness in a securities litigation case in south Texas,'' Mr. Quattrone wrote, ''I strongly advise you to follow these procedures.''
 The verdict in the case was a surprise to spectators who had sat in the gallery during both trials because it appeared that Mr. Quattrone had made a stronger case this time.
 During the first trial, Mr. Quattrone appeared to offer conflicting testimony about his role in the allocation of initial stock offerings. Under questioning by his own lawyer, he left jurors with the impression that investment bankers had nothing to do with the allocation only to reverse himself on cross-examination, when prosecutors presented scores of e-mail messages that showed him repeatedly involved in trying to influence which clients received shares. This time, he was upfront about his role. Gone, too, was some of the most alarming testimony from the prosecution's star witness, Mr. Brodsky, who testified that he told Mr. Quattrone about a grand jury and Securities and Exchange Commission investigation just days before he sent the e-mail message. 
 Mr. Quattrone contended that when he sent his e-mail message, he was not thinking about the investigation and that he had never been explicitly told about the scope of it nor to preserve documents.
 Despite his better performance on the stand, this jury, just like some of the jurors in the previous trial, did not find him credible. ''I found him believable, but then again he was a great salesman,'' Mr. Silver said, explaining that when the jury first took a straw poll at the beginning of their deliberations that at least seven jurors believed Mr. Quattrone was guilty. Mr. Silver, who was originally holding out for an acquittal said that he changed his mind over the weekend as he ''connected the dots.'' Oddly, Mr. Silver acknowledged, ''Of course I have certain doubts.''
 Despite the ruling, Mr. Quattrone's peers in Silicon Valley, even some of his most ardent rivals, still stand behind him.
 ''I'm a little shocked; I think maybe the jury got all caught up in the whole Kozlowski, Scrushy, Enron, WorldCom fervor,'' said Sanford Robertson, a partner at Franscisco Partners, based in Menlo Park, Calif., and a co-founder and former chairman of Robertson, Stephens & Company, a one-time competitor. ''I don't think Frank did anything anywhere near the crimes that these other people are apparently guilty of, but I think his conviction was caught up in that.''
 Steven Bird, a partner at Focus Ventures, a venture capital firm based in Palo Alto, Calif., echoed the prevailing view in Silicon Valley.
 ''As far as I'm concerned, the prosecution had given up on prosecuting him for the one thing for which I had questions about, about using the I.P.O. business to further the profits of his firm,'' he said. ''Instead they tried him on obstruction of justice charge, which makes me think they wasted a lot of time and effort over something that's not very significant.''


CORRECTION-DATE: May 8, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Tuesday about the conviction of Frank P. Quattrone, the former investment banker, on charges of obstruction of justice referred imprecisely to the outcome of investigations into whether his bank, Credit Suisse First Boston, solicited kickbacks from investors for access to hot stock offerings. While no criminal cases were brought, the Securities and Exchange Commission did reach a settlement with the bank in a civil case.



An article in Business Day on Tuesday about prosecutors' use of obstruction-of-justice charges in corporate cases referred imprecisely to the jury's finding against Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm. While the firm was charged with obstruction based on the shredding of documents, several jurors said its conviction was based on an Andersen lawyer's alteration of a document, not on the shredding.

HEADLINE: Reins Are Passed, Somewhat, at Mexican Empire

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 3 

 BODY:
Although Carlos Slim Helu has passed the reins at Telefonos de Mexico to his son, the father, Latin America's richest man, is not heading into a quiet retirement. 
 The elder Mr. Slim, 64, who has long been grooming his three sons to follow him, becomes the honorary lifetime chairman of Telmex. His son, Carlos Slim Domit, 37, who was co-chairman of Telmex, becomes sole chairman and remains chairman of Grupo Carso, an industrial and retail conglomerate. 
 Mr. Slim senior ''will continue to be involved in decision making along with the board,'' said Rogelio Urrutia, the Mexico telecommunications analyst at Santander Central Hispano Investments. 
 ''This is a decision that had to be made, and it is better that it is made now,'' he said. ''This way investors know that it is his decision.''
 Since Mr. Slim acquired control of Telmex at its privatization in 1990, he has built his empire working with a very small group of trusted executives, including his sons and two sons-in-law. 
 ''This move generates confidence in the company's future,'' said Judith Mariscal, director of the telecommunications research project at the Center for Economic Research and Teaching, a Mexico City research institute.
 ''If all the company's capacities depend on Carlos Slim, what happens when he's gone?'' she said. ''This speaks to an institutionalization of the company which seems to be important for expectations in the future.''
 He has become such an important figure in Mexico that his every public statement is parsed for significance. After Mr. Slim recently criticized the government's economic model, President Vicente Fox immediately rebuked him, commenting that the Slim companies had done very well last year. 
 Expanding from telecommunications into retailing, heavy industry and banking, Mr. Slim's talent is in his ability to buy assets cheaply, strip out inefficiencies and turn them around. Companies controlled by Mr. Slim now account for almost 50 percent of Mexico's stock market index. His financial group, Inbursa, has become the lender of last resort to distressed companies, giving Mr. Slim stakes in some of the country's leading companies, including Grupo Televisa, the world's largest Spanish-language media company, and the industrial conglomerate Desc. 
 In the United States, he holds stakes in MCI and Global Crossing, and he owns the retail chain CompUSA. 
 At Telmex, Jaime Chico Pardo, its chief executive, will continue to run day-to-day operations of the company, which reported profits of $484 million in the first quarter. 
 Significantly, Mr. Slim remains chairman of his wireless company, America Movil, the largest in Latin America. Earlier this year, it overtook Telmex as Mexico's largest publicly listed company.
 ''America Movil is a younger company with a young management,'' Mr. Urrutia said. ''He has to be more in charge.'' 
 The younger Mr. Slim takes over just as Telmex is making an aggressive push into South America. Last week, a bankruptcy judge cleared the way for Telmex to buy a controlling stake in Embratel, Brazil's long-distance carrier, for $400 million from MCI. Telmex also bought 40 percent of Chile's No.3 long-distance phone company and control of the Argentina data company Techtel. In February, it closed the acquisition of AT&T Latin America for $207 million.
 ''The idea in the Latin American market is not to be the incumbent, but to focus on data transmission and go after the cream of the market,'' said Mr. Urrutia, the analyst.
 As the incumbent in Mexico, Telmex has been criticized by competitors and legislators for using its influence to head off stronger regulation. Although the market has been open to competition since 1997, Telmex controls at least 90 percent of all local traffic and about 70 percent of long-distance traffic, analysts say.
 But, they add, the problem is Mexico's weak regulatory framework.
 ''It's not the villain; it responds to the incentives of the market,'' Ms. Mariscal said of Telmex. ''The regulator has to respond.'' 
 Although growth has slowed in the last few years as Mexico's economy has stagnated, the company continues to generate copious cash for its shareholders. This year, with economic growth picking up, Telmex expects to invest $1.7 billion. 
 Given its importance as an employer, investor and taxpayer, regulators are unlikely to come down hard on the company. 
 ''They are showing their commitment to the country,'' Mr. Urrutia said of Telmex's domestic investments. ''Whoever leads Telmex can use all these elements as tools in negotiations with the authorities.''

HEADLINE: California's Accidental Governor

 BODY:
Here's one recipe for political success: Wealth, independently acquired. Enormous self-confidence. A brand of Republicanism coupling liberal social views with fiscal pragmatism. This mix has worked well for Michael Bloomberg, who, despite low popularity ratings, has turned out to be a productive and innovative New York City mayor. And it seems to be working even better for Arnold Schwarzenegger, California's governor. Six months into the job, the last action hero can seemingly do no wrong.
 Of the two story lines, Mr. Schwarzenegger's is the more improbable. Though people questioned Mr. Bloomberg's political experience, nobody scoffed at him the way they scoffed at Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was variously derided as a Hollywood lightweight and as an accidental product of California's crazy recall system, a crippling economic crisis and the staggering unpopularity of the incumbent, Gray Davis. 
 This page was among the vocal doubters, but nobody's laughing now. Since ousting Mr. Davis last October, Mr. Schwarzenegger has ended years of paralysis in the California Legislature and delivered on a string of campaign promises, like winning public approval for a $15 billion bond issue and reforming the state's hugely expensive workers' compensation system. Last week, in an announcement barely noticed outside the state, the governor offered a comprehensive energy plan that dealt the final blow to the unfettered deregulation that helped cause a series of blackouts in 2000, bankrupted a major utility and marked the beginning of the end for Mr. Davis. He then flew off to Israel, Jordan and the troops in Germany.
 Governor Schwarzenegger has had his stumbles. Given the fiscal crisis, it was surely a mistake to repeal $4 billion in automobile tax increases. His budget plan -- which essentially involves issuing new debt to pay off old debt -- could backfire if California's economy sours again. But at least things are beginning to happen. As Leon Panetta, a prominent California Democrat, said of the bond issue, adding to an already overburdened budget was the worst possible solution -- except for all the others.
 Celebrity helps a lot, as does wealth. Both provide protection against special interests. The governor's independence from the White House on issues like air pollution and global warming cannot hurt him in an environmentally conscious, largely Democratic state. As an executive, he is at once flexible and determined. He prevailed on the workers' compensation issue by agreeing to settle for less than he wanted while threatening to go directly to the voters if the Legislature did nothing at all. For good measure he gathered the negotiators in a windowless war room, where they survived on M&M's and the governor's special blend of trail mix.
 Even his critics find him a hard man to dislike. This is a governor who bombs around the freeways with his old motorcycle buddies every weekend, who loves a crowd and whose favorite word is ''fantastic.'' His wife is ''fantastic.'' Gray Davis is ''fantastic.'' He even described a $4 million judgment against him in a campaign finance case as a ''fantastic'' decision. Criticism bounces off like rubber bullets. When John Burton, the Democratic leader in the State Senate, accused him of ''pontificating,'' the governor called him up and said: ''That's funny! Pontificate. Like the pope!'' ''Nothing fazes him,'' Mr. Burton observed.
 Right now Californians are giving him fantastic leeway -- a 64 percent approval rating, including a majority of those describing themselves as liberals and Democrats, according to a recent Los Angeles Times poll. The poll also showed that if Mr. Schwarzenegger needed to renege on his no-new-taxes promise, most people would support him.
 All this good feeling could evaporate. Colorful newcomers have a way of wilting, as Mr. Bloomberg's popularity did when hypothetical tax increases became real. But for now, the accidental governor, besides having a great time, is starting to seem almost inevitable.

HEADLINE: Housing Subsidies for the Poor Threatened by Cuts in U.S. Aid

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
New York City is facing a shortfall of at least $55.5 million in federal housing subsidies this year because of a recent regulatory change affecting the government's primary housing program for poor Americans.
 The change, retroactive to January, stems from an effort by the Bush administration to control spiraling housing costs. In the past, the federal government paid the full cost of the 1.9 million rent vouchers given to poor tenants nationwide to help them pay for housing under the Section 8 program. But on April 22, the Department of Housing and Urban Development told housing agencies that it would pay only the cost of a voucher as of last August, plus an inflation adjustment.
 The change could affect more than 900 of the nation's 2,500 public housing agencies, particularly those in cities where rent increases outpace inflation, according to the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. New York City housing officials say that historically, the local cost of providing vouchers has gone up faster than inflation. 
 The total national shortfall could be hundreds of millions of dollars for the current fiscal year, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal Washington research group. That shortfall, in turn, may force housing agencies to freeze the number of vouchers, demand more money from tenants or do something that has never happened in Section 8's three-decade history: evict tenants from federally subsidized housing because of insufficient funding.
 No city has more at stake in the ruling than New York, which issues more than 118,000 rent vouchers a year, far more than any other city. While city officials are cautiously optimistic that they can work with HUD to avoid any evictions, they acknowledge that several thousand tenants with vouchers appear to be in a far more precarious position today than they were a few weeks ago.
 To underscore their concern, the city's commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, Shaun Donovan, and other top housing officials lobbied HUD officials in Washington last week. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote a letter on Friday to Alphonso R. Jackson, the secretary of housing, warning that the new formula would ''undermine the legitimacy of the Section 8 voucher program'' and leave many New Yorkers without housing.
 ''This formula falls well short of the actual cost of vouchers in 2004 for many housing agencies in New York, and will leave our most vulnerable residents without critical housing assistance at a time when the economy is uncertain at best,'' wrote Mrs. Clinton, who is a Democrat.
 A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers from several other states, as well as the governors of Massachusetts and Minnesota, both Republicans, have written their own letters to HUD expressing similar worries.
 In response, the agency's assistant secretary for public and Indian housing, Michael Liu, said in a conference call with reporters last week that the department was merely complying with Congress's desire in its own 2004 appropriations bill to contain the voucher program, which constitutes more than half of HUD's total budget. 
 ''The law is the law,'' he said.
 Any local housing agency that believes it deserves more money has until July 15 to make its case, Mr. Liu said. In a subsequent interview, he said that HUD would work hard to help. ''There will be dollars available to deal with needed adjustments in individual housing authorities,'' he said.
 Mr. Liu also suggested that some doomsday predictions were exaggerated, and might be the result of inefficient local management. For example, he said that reported shortfalls in Los Angeles and Boston were largely plugged after HUD scrutinized the books.
 ''There are an array of tools, management tools, that housing authorities can employ to manage their costs,'' he said.
 The debate stoked by the rule change illustrates a broader war of ideas over the Bush administration's determination to revamp the voucher program by employing market principles and fiscal discipline reminiscent of the welfare overhaul of the 1990's.
 Last year, the administration tried unsuccessfully to turn Section 8 into a block grant program for state governments, using a complicated formula to determine aid instead of basing it purely on the number of needy people. The attempt was turned back by Congress.
 Now, with this administrative ruling, HUD has infuriated lawmakers and housing groups who say the agency's actions could undermine confidence in the program among tenants, landlords and lenders who finance low-income housing.
 ''This is a cataclysmic failure of the federal government to keep the public trust,'' Sheila Crowley, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, an advocacy group, said last week in a statement that also announced a rally outside HUD's headquarters in Washington.
 Section 8 has long been popular with elected officials, private landlords and financial institutions because it steered the government away from public housing developments and toward the private marketplace. The program enables poor, disabled or elderly tenants to receive vouchers from a local housing agency and redeem them with any private landlord who is amenable. Tenants pay 30 percent of their income in rent, while the vouchers pay the rest, up to a limit set by the federal government, depending on the local market.
 The New York City Housing Authority provides 90,000 vouchers, or about three-quarters of the total in the city. About 83 percent of the authority's voucher recipients have incomes of less than $16,320. The median contribution from tenants with vouchers from the authority is $216 per month; the median payment to landlords is $670. Other vouchers are issued by the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. 
 In the last three years, the Section 8 budget nationwide has ballooned by 27 percent, said Representative James T. Walsh, a Republican of Syracuse, who is chairman of the House subcommittee that controls spending on housing. The situation has been most acute in places where the real estate market has been tight.
 At the same time, Mr. Liu said, too many housing authorities have become so accustomed to HUD's carte blanche approval of Section 8 costs that they have not performed with maximum efficiency. If the current system continues, he said, HUD will face a $191 million deficit.
 Mr. Liu acknowledged that some agencies would find the budget limits a ''challenge.'' But he expressed confidence that local authorities would soon adjust, because ''those who have worked with the program for years are used to change.''
 Representative Walsh agreed. ''I think we have treated Section 8 very well,'' he said. ''They got a 14 percent increase in '04. Given the federal budget, I can't think of anyone else who's gotten that kind of an increase.''
 But others, while agreeing with the need to cap costs, have criticized the agency methods. Chief among them are Governors Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, two first-term Republicans.
 ''Unless the federal government remains a strong partner, our mutual goal to end long-term homelessness and satisfy other critical housing needs will be at risk,'' Governor Pawlenty wrote in a letter on Wednesday to HUD, warning that 2,000 families may lose their rental assistance as early as June.
 In Fargo, N.D., housing officials are reluctantly asking tenants to contribute about $30 more per month to their rent, which now averages about $575 a month for a two-bedroom apartment. Otherwise, officials will have to stop giving vouchers to 46 of 1,100 families in the program, said Lynn O. Fundingsland, executive director of the Fargo Housing and Redevelopment Authority.
 Last week, Massachusetts housing officials were on the verge of mailing out termination notices to about 650 tenants because of a gap of $550,000. But state and federal officials struck a deal to intervene and were working to come up with a solution.
 In New York, meanwhile, city and federal officials have been scrambling to register their objections and plead their case with HUD. City officials said they understood the budgetary reasons behind the agency's decision, but they questioned whether Washington understood the human implications of its decision.
 ''The thing that's most clear is that the world has changed in Section 8, and I understand why,'' said Douglas Apple, the city Housing Authority's general manager. ''But we're hopeful HUD will understand. I don't believe it's HUD's intention to force people out of housing.''

HEADLINE: Star Wars: The Next Version

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: DELTA JUNCTION, Alaska 

 BODY:
As early as this summer, rockets hidden in silos near this wind-swept town will give the nation its first operating defense against intercontinental ballistic missiles since the 1970's.
 Although the system is not a secret, it has been revived with so little fanfare that few Americans seem to realize it exists.
 Among warfare experts, it is reviving the type of bitter debate that began in the cold war, culminating in an antiballistic missile treaty. And it is inspiring the same sort of passion that arose during the national fixation with President Ronald Reagan's Star Wars effort, officially the Strategic Defense Initiative. Unlike Star Wars, which faded into the realm of misbegotten high-tech dreams, the new system relies on agile but fairly ordinary rockets to smash incoming warheads rather than nuclear-powered lasers in space. In the new debate, Pentagon planners see the system as a bulwark against the ultimate calamity, a nuclear attack, while skeptics ridicule it as a defense that will not work against a threat that does not exist. 
 The decades have not washed away the political dimension of a missile defense, either. Deploying the system will fulfill a campaign pledge by President Bush, as well as a more specific directive, issued in December 2002, that the nation have a functioning missile defense system by this year.
 Critics of the system, which will cost $10 billion a year for the next five years and, potentially, hundreds of billions when the full defense envisioned by the Pentagon is installed, say it is being rushed before being fully tested. The critics call it a flawed defense against the ICBM's of yesteryear, not the suicide bombers and hijacked airplanes of the world since Sept. 11.
 Nevertheless, the system is taking on hard reality in this remote town. On a sunny but numbingly cold day, six white domes rise like igloos within a double-perimeter fence topped by security cameras. Just across a road, the charred and denuded trunks of a fire-ravaged forest of black spruce appear to stand sentry. The folded blues and whites of the Alaska Range loom among wispy clouds off in the distance.
 In this setting, the little domes are actually clamshell-shape doors that sit above silos dug 70 feet into the frozen earth. If one of the clamshells ever swings open to release a missile riding a tongue of flame, it will in all likelihood mean that the nation's leadership believes the United States has become the target of a nuclear attack.
 The silos are empty, but two huge Manitowoc industrial cranes nearby should soon be outfitting some silos with three-stage interceptors. Once those interceptors, each topped with a bundle of thrusters and optical sensors called a kill vehicle, are hooked into a global network of radars, satellites, computers and command centers, one of Mr. Reagan's biggest dreams will be reality.
 Critics of the shield find little hearing at the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency, headed by Lt. Gen. Ronald T. Kadish, an Air Force pilot with long experience in developing military hardware like fighter jets. ''We should not choose to be vulnerable,'' General Kadish said in an interview. ''We have proven that from a technological standpoint and a practical standpoint we can intercept ballistic warheads in flight. And to say now that we can technologically defend ourselves and then choose not to is, in my view, a recipe for failure.''

A Space-Age Battering Ram
 The first system will rely on interceptors in a handful of silos here at Fort Greeley, an Army base, and at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. In an attack, boosters would release the kill vehicle more than 100 miles above earth. With a heat-sensitive telescope, the vehicle would search the chill of space for the warhead, then maneuver with its thrusters and try to pulverize the weapon by simply ramming it at speeds faster than 20,000 miles an hour.
 Even that description does little justice to the complexity of the system, which spans nine time zones and uses 13,000 miles of fiber optics to link sites as varied as a radar installation on the bleak island of Shemya in the Aleutians and in a secret command center at Cheyenne Mountain, Colo. If it works as planned, the system may take the honorary title of the biggest machine ever built from the nation's electrical grid.
 As the nation discovered in the blackout last summer, of course, large machines can be unpredictable. The missile defense system, in fact, is so enormous and complex that it may never be fully tested unless an attack occurs. In highly controlled tests, the interceptors scored hits five times in eight tries.
 Critics say a true adversary would deploy cleverly designed decoys or metallic chaff or huge balloons around the warhead that would easily confuse the defense.
 ''It's totally useless,'' said Dr. Richard L. Garwin, a physicist who has advised the government on security for nearly 50 years and who, in 1998, was on a panel led by Donald H. Rumsfeld, now defense secretary, to assess ballistic missile threats.
 Dr. Garwin said the president was ''wasting money and he's impairing our security, because it will not work against ICBM's from anyone who has it in for the United States.''
 Officials at the Missile Defense Agency have said the system was developed to stop what they characterize as unsophisticated threats from budding nuclear powers like North Korea, not the highly developed arsenals of Russia or China. Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said the election, not any imminent threat, was behind the decision to deploy before full tests.
 ''It's a date which obviously was set politically so they could say before the election that they've deployed a system,'' Mr. Levin said. ''I doubt that they'll say in that announcement that they'll deploy a system which may or may not work.''
 Mr. Levin has also sharply criticized the administration's request for more than $500 million in the 2005 fiscal year to double its arsenal of interceptors, from 20 to 40, before any of the original batch has been tested. The first two tests of the full interceptor are scheduled for this summer.
 ''This is like deploying a military aircraft missing the wings, the tail and the landing gear,'' said Philip E. Coyle, a former chief of operational test and evaluation at the Pentagon, who is a senior adviser at the Center for Defense Information. ''And without testing to see if that aircraft can do its mission without wings, a tail or landing gear.''
 The White House has repeatedly said the deployment timetable is based just on the system's technical readiness. Republicans on the Armed Services Committee, including its chairman, John W. Warner of Virginia, have voiced strong support.
 The system has also found significant international support. England and Greenland are dedicating some radar sites to the program's early warning system. 
 In Japan, Parliament recently appropriated $1 billion toward a missile shield that would involve American-made radars and interceptors aboard its Aegis cruisers. The United States is talking with Australia about placing radar on its soil and more cruisers off its shores. The Bush administration spent $700 million in the 2004 fiscal year and has requested more than $1 billion in 2005 to develop the sea-based interceptor system, which would be deployed on American cruisers, as well.
 Some experts point out that some of the harshest naysayers have barely changed their criticisms since Star Wars was proposed. That plan featured fanciful -- and largely impractical -- elements like nuclear-powered lasers based in space. A blanket dismissal on technical grounds no longer resonates as it once did, those experts say.
 ''Before, it was so grandiose, so complex, so big,'' said Steven A. Hildreth, a defense specialist at the Congressional Research Service. ''There was no real empirical evidence to support the contention that it was possible. Here, with this, at least we have some limited data points that can support the contention that these defenses can hit a warhead and destroy it.''

Aspiring to Grandiosity
 The system has not entirely abandoned its claims to grandiosity. Beginning some time next year, the Pentagon expects to begin testing an advanced radar built on a heroic scale atop a floating oil platform so that it can rove about the world to provide high-resolution images of mock warheads and decoys in tests -- or the real McCoy. At a cost of $1 billion, the radar will tower nearly 300 feet above the water and include a deck almost the size of two football fields.
 After being assembled on the Texas Gulf Coast, the radar will be too large to pass through the Panama Canal. It will have to motor around the tip of South America at an estimated nine knots to its primary base off Adak Island in the Aleutians.
 Another futuristic component, an immensely powerful laser mounted in the nose of a Boeing 747 that would fly near hostile countries and try to zap their missiles to oblivion shortly after launching, has been repeatedly delayed by technical problems. Despite the setbacks, General Kadish of the Missile Defense Agency said, the laser ''represents such a revolutionary capability that we are going to stick to it.''
 Major contractors on the project include Boeing, Bechtel and Raytheon, which is constructing the kill vehicles, each of which weighs 140 pounds and takes 18 to 24 months to build in a warren of high-tech clean rooms in Tucson. ''We're building them as we speak,'' said Dean Gehr, director of business development for missile defense programs at Raytheon Missile Systems.
 Even if all elements of the giant program work just as in the computer simulations that the Pentagon is using to train the people who will operate the shield, some experts do not see the point. The cold war geopolitical landscape in which the system was conceived has shifted out from under it, said Dr. Dean A. Wilkening, director of the science program at the Stanford Center for International Security and Cooperation.
 ''I don't understand the rush to deploy by 2004,'' Dr. Wilkening said. ''I simply don't see the threat.''
 But with so much of the elaborate system in place and more on the way, Mr. Hildreth of the Congressional Research Service said, questions like that may no longer matter. ''I've sort of seen it as a juggernaut,'' he said. ''It's on a collision course with destiny, if you will.''

Armed at the Top of the World
 That destiny starts in the Alaskan interior, 100 miles southeast of Fairbanks along a winding highway where Mount Hayes, elevation 13,832 feet, appears suddenly around a bend. A carved wood sign welcomes visitors to Delta Junction, ''America's Friendly Frontier.'' The town has a population of 980, and buffalo burgers are a local delicacy.
 Why Alaska? ''Because it sits at the top of the world,'' General Kadish said, where the trajectories of virtually all ICBM's attacking the United States would pass. ''We can do the job better there, cheaper, in the long run, and be effective whether the warheads are coming from the east or the west.''
 Building silos and the electronics and communications systems to operate them in this part of the world comes with other challenges, said Lt. Col. John K. Leighow of the Army Corps of Engineers and a deputy district engineer for the Ballistic Missile Defense Support Division.
 The ground is loose and shifting, the construction season is short, and winter temperatures can reach 50 or 60 degrees below zero, so cold that tires on stationary vehicles can freeze overnight into irregular shapes and refuse to become round again.
 After the first shovel of soil was turned over for the silos two years ago, the schedule left no time for error, Colonel Leighow said, adding: ''It was go, go, go. The biggest challenge we've had with this program has been schedule.''
 A curious-looking yellow building with a white dome, for communicating with the interceptor, was built partly inside an immense cocoon to protect workers from the elements, he said. Hundreds of workers also built a large command center jammed with electronics next to the missile field, and two and a half miles of climate-controlled underground tunnels for pipes and utilities.
 A project manager for Bechtel, Mike Hayner, said the shifty soil led contractors to use a novel method to build the silos. They drilled a series of holes 70 feet deep and 3 feet wide around what would become the perimeter of each silo, carefully squirting concrete slurry into each hole as they drilled to keep the holes from collapsing.
 After the entire perimeter had been filled with concrete, the workers excavated the middle and outfitted it with a steel silo fabricated in the ''lower 48,'' at the Oregon Iron Works of Clackamas, Ore.
 ''We are shooting to be on alert by 30 September in response to the president's requirement to be on alert by the end of the year,'' said Col. Kevin Norgaard, director of the site activation command. ''We are where we need to be today, to be there.''
 The missile defense system is extremely popular in Delta Junction, where the short-term closing of Fort Greeley struck a grave blow to the economy.
 As the base reopens, Pete Hallgren, the city manager, said, ''The economic impact in our area is massive.'' In a town where the normal yearly operating budget runs to $250,000, the Defense Department has earmarked $25 million to help ease the impact on local services. The money will buy a new grade school, a library, a landfill and a fire station, as well as partly finance a recreation center, Mr. Hallgren said.
 ''I'm one of those true believers, who always thought we needed one,'' Mr. Hallgren said of a national missile defense.

HEADLINE: To Go to the Moon and Mars, NASA Is Told It Must Change 

BYLINE:  By WARREN E. LEARY

 BODY:
The presidential commission studying NASA's goal of sending people to the Moon and Mars said yesterday that the space agency would have to make major changes in the way it does business if it wants to go ahead with the plan.
 Concluding two days of hearings at the Asia Society in New York, the nine-member panel said it would issue a report on June 2 calling for about 10 fundamental changes in structure, management and business practices. It did not specify those recommendations yesterday. 
 "What we are writing is a blueprint to tell NASA how to implement the program it wants, but it will not contain details on everything the agency needs to do to make the program work, such as what rockets to buy," Edward C. Aldridge, the panel's chairman, said in an interview. "With only 120 days to study this, we can only provide the scaffolding on which NASA can hang the details of how to conduct each step."
The commission was asked to suggest ways for NASA to carry out President Bush's call in January for exploration of the solar system, starting with the Moon before 2020 and later on Mars. The president proposed initial financing of $12 billion over five years, $1 billion of it in new money and the rest redirected from other programs. The space shuttle program, for example, would end in 2010.
Testifying yesterday before the commission, Sean O'Keefe, the NASA administrator, said he was looking for a model to restructure his agency for a new kind of program that did not have a fixed timetable or budget.
The exploration initiative is seen as a pay-as-you-go program, he said, because it stays within current budgets and calls for finishing one step, like building a new human spacecraft, before going on to another.
Mr. O'Keefe said some members of Congress and other key figures have been pressing for estimates on what the entire program would cost over 20 or 30 years, and other details that are not immediately available. "This is not an Apollo-like program," he said, that would require a large infusion of money to meet a fixed goal and timetable to send Americans to the Moon.
Still, he acknowledged that some of the doubts stemmed from NASA's past budget problems and large cost overruns that have hurt its fiscal credibility. NASA is doing its best to convince people that the agency can manage its money, he said, but "this is not something that changes overnight."
At the end of the hearing, the fifth and last in a series held around the country over the last two months, the commissioners summed up the testimony and previewed themes that they would include in their report.
One commissioner, Carleton S. Fiorina, chairwoman and chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, said the panel had heard testimony that going to the Moon and Mars would be inspiring, fulfill mankind's need to explore and let the United States take the lead in what could be an international effort.
But she added that to sell the plan to the public and sustain it over decades, it would need some pragmatic purposes: lifting science and math education so today's children can compete economically in the future, and protecting the nation's industrial base and jobs.
"Leadership in the 21st century depends on technology," Ms. Fiorina said. "You have to lead in industries that create high-tech jobs. Space and aeronautics is one of those industries."

PERSON: Andrew Robert Buxton Cavendish 

HEADLINE: Devonshire, Peerless Homeowner, Dies at 84 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Andrew Robert Buxton Cavendish, the 11th Duke of Devonshire, who maintained his family's historically grand way of life by selling art masterpieces and converting his Chatsworth estate into one of Britain's most visited attractions, died Monday night at Chatsworth. He was 84.
 His death was reported on the Chatsworth House Trust Web site. No cause was given. 
 A tall, slim, elegant man known for wearing pale yellow socks that matched the racing colors of his thoroughbreds, Sir Andrew, as he became when dubbed a Knight of the Garter in 1996, was famously modest: he insisted in an interview with The Observer in 2002 that he hadno achievements to his name.
"I've never worked a day in my life, so how can I retire?" he asked.
The facts were that he was a war hero, cabinet minister, horse breeder and football club president. But his greatest achievement was overcoming an inheritance tax bill of nearly $20 million, partly by selling almost priceless art, tens of thousands of acres of land and a stately mansion or two. He even cut down on buying racehorses. (He was estimated to be wealthier than the Queen, even with his economies.) 
The grandest strategy, however, involved using the income from the sales to set up a trust that generates income to keep up the house. Paying visitors, more than 600,000 a year, paraded through his house and grounds, generating profits that outpaced expenses for the first time two years ago.
The contribution of the Duchess of Devonshire, whom the duke married in 1941, was not insignificant. She is the former Deborah Mitford, the youngest of the famously eccentric Mitford sisters and the only surviving one. She devised moneymaking projects from selling the Duchess's Marmalade and Duke's Favorite Sausages to overseeing a prosperous farm. 
As a result, one of England's finest country houses is splendidly preserved. A 16th-century mansion in rural Derbyshire, it has 297 rooms, 112 fireplaces, 68 lavatories, 32 kitchens and workshops, 26 baths, 17 staircases and more than an acre of roof. 
Its magnificent art, most of which the duke was able to keep, is also shared with the public, both at Chatsworth and on exhibition elsewhere. Some of it is now on display at the Bard Graduate Center in Manhattan.
Andrew Robert Buxton Cavendish was born on Jan. 2, 1920. He graduated from Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. In World War II, he served with the Coldstream Guards and won the Military Cross for gallantry in combat in Italy.
The course of his life was changed when his older brother William, the Marquess of Hartington, was killed in combat near the end of the war. Only weeks before, he had married Kathleen Kennedy, John F. Kennedy's sister. She died in a plane crash a few years later.
William's death meant that Andrew became the 11th Duke of Devonshire when his father died of a heart attack in 1950. He inherited a tradition of wealth harking back to Elizabeth Hardwick, who was born in 1527 and married four increasingly prosperous and powerful husbands.
She was able to leave her sons, all from her second marriage to William Cavendish, a real estate and commercial empire that has lasted her descendants for 14 generations.
For three generations after Betsy, the oldest sons were earls. The dukedom was granted to the fourth for services to the crown: he helped throw out one king, James II, and replaced him with another, William of Orange.
Andrew, the 11th duke, had thought he would get a publishing job with Macmillan, through Harold Macmillan, who was his uncle by marriage and part of the publishing family. Instead, he found himself mixing with the rich and powerful at Pratt's, the London dining club he inherited from his father.
When asked if he belonged to the club, the duke liked to answer that the club belonged to him. It was there that he became better acquainted with his Uncle Harold, by then prime minister.
This connection resulted in his being appointed parliamentary under secretary of state and then minister of state at the Commonwealth Relations Office -- a better result than he had achieved in two losing campaigns for Parliament. "My appointment at the time was the greatest act of nepotism in the century," the duke said in an interview with The Derby Evening Telegraph in 2000.
Among his happiest moments was when his horse Park Top won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot in 1969. He wrote his only book about the triumph: "Park Top: A Romance of the Turf," published in 1976.
He is survived by his two daughters, Lady Emma and Lady Sophia; his son, Peregrine, the Marquess of Harrington, who succeeds him as the Duke of Devonshire; eight grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
Publicity whirled his freewheeling lifestyle for many years, but in his last years he did not drink or smoke. He never lost his famous spirit.
"I had a terrible day two years ago when the Duke of Marlborough's grapes beat mine at the fruit show, and I got back to my club to read in The Evening Standard that the Duke of Beaufort was the best-dressed duke," he said in the interview with The Observer in 2002. "That was a bad day!"

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
OutpatientServices Are Making Medical Offices Hot

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: SEATTLE, April 29 

 BODY:
The 14-story building on the main campus of Swedish Medical Center, the largest hospital in Washington State, has a spacious lobby adorned with abstract art, a fast-food restaurant, a chain pharmacy and light and airy corridors with sleek wood trim. 
 Equally important, it also has 1,000 parking spaces and a skywalk leading to the hospital. 
 Completed in 1994, the building, known as 1101 Madison Medical Tower, is the trophy property in a portfolio of five medical office buildings that Swedish Medical Center has put on the market. Only one of the other buildings -- a six-story glassy structure at 600 Broadway, across from the hospital -- is of recent vintage, and two go back to the 1960's.
Swedish decided to sell the properties, which are nearly fully leased, to capitalize on the increasingly feverish demand for medical office buildings. The 600,000-square-foot Swedish portfolio, which includes two coffee shops operated by Starbucks, the hometown brand, has attracted 16 offers. The would-be buyers include health care real estate investment trusts, and private and institutional investors. 
The Swedish Medical Center properties are expected to be sold for $120 million, said the hospital's adviser, Philip J. Camp, the principal in charge of real estate banking services at Shattuck Hammond Partners, an investment bank. 
He said the price would represent a significant premium because the initial rate of return was expected to be less than 8 percent. Rents vary, according to the age of the buildings, from $24 to $32 a square foot, said Ronald K. Sperling, the hospital's chief financial officer.
Last year, $1.3 billion worth of medical office buildings individually valued at $5 million or more changed hands, according to Real Capital Analytics, a New York research company that tracks large real estate sales, up from $954.6 million in 2002 and $787.8 million in 2001. So far this year, Real Capital Analytics has identified $330 million in sales that have closed, with another $401 million under contract, said Robert M. White Jr., the company's president.
Last year, HCP Medical Office Portfolio, a venture of Health Care Property Investors, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, and GE Commercial Finance paid $575 million for 113 medical office buildings in 16 states owned by MedCap Properties. MedCap, which became part of Health Care Property Investors, is the nation's largest owner of medical properties, with 11 million square feet in 23 states, said Charles A. Elcan, an executive vice president of Health Care Property Investors and chief executive of MedCap.
In one of the costliest deals in terms of price per square foot, Washington Real Estate Investment Trust, a public company in Rockville, Md., paid $78 million, or $312 a square foot, for the three medical office buildings that make up the Prosperity Medical Center near Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Va. 
With many conventional office buildings struggling with high vacancy rates, medical office buildings, especially those on hospital campuses, have become attractive to investors because they are filled, often to capacity, with long-term tenants who are loath to relocate and are not buffeted by economic downturns, real estate specialists say.
Because such buildings are rarely built on speculation, their supply is limited. 
MedCap develops $50 million to $100 million worth of medical office buildings a year. Mr. Elcan said they cost about 15 percent to 20 percent more than ordinary office buildings, largely because of the need for extra walls and plumbing. The offices are divided into small examining rooms, each of which must be equipped with a sink. 
Another factor fueling the growing interest in this real estate niche is the aging of the population, said Steven W. Bolen, the president of LaSalle Investment Management Medical Office Fund, a division of Jones Lang LaSalle that was created in 2001 to invest pension funds in this sector. 
"The demographic shift in this country is putting a tremendous demand on services," he said, and procedures like tonsillectomies and cataract surgery that used to be performed in hospitals are increasingly taking place in medical offices. 
In March, LaSalle bought eight medical office buildings with 459,000 square feet for $69 million from Great Lakes Real Estate Investment Trust, which had in turn bought them for $59.6 million from the Advocate Health Care, a hospital system in Oak Brook, Ill., in 2002. (Great Lakes was acquired by a private company, the Transwestern Investment Company of Chicago, in January.)
In the past, many real estate investors were skittish about investing in this specialized niche, Mr. Camp of Shattuck Hammond said. "They didn't understand it and were kind of nervous about it," he said. "Now that moretransactions are being done, it is becoming more of an accepted property type."
Decades ago, hospitals began developing medical buildings to attract doctors, their main source of referrals, to their campus. 
And until relatively recently, the hospitals wanted to hold onto their real estate as a way of keeping the doctors happy so that they would not be tempted to move.
Only five years ago, Swedish bought 600 Broadway, one of the buildings it has put on the market, to have more control over the property, Mr. Sperling said. What has changed? "The marketplace," he said, "has evolved in the last five years to the point where we can have our capital out of these buildings, and still maintain a fair amount of control."
With so many potential buyers, Swedish will have no trouble finding one that has experience managing medical offices and dealing with doctors. Like many hospitals, Swedish will retain the ground lease, enabling the hospital to insist on certain conditions, Mr. Sperling said. The hospital will also become a tenant in the buildings, occupying about 20 percent of the space for clinical offices and outpatient departments.
Hospital administrators say that it makes sense to sell buildings that are not part of their core mission in order to use the proceeds to invest in capital-intensive needs like new and ever-costlier technology. 
Thomas H. Hansen, a vice president at Provena Health, a hospital system in Illinois that recently sold six medical office buildings for more than $24 million to the Dasco Companies, a medical real estate company in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., said the sale was fueled in part by declining reimbursement from third parties like Medicare coupled with the rapidly rising cost of technology. "Where do we want to invest our capital -- in commercial real estate or in medical services and technology?" he said. "We want to invest our dollars in things that benefit our patients."
Because of the weakened economy and lower interest rates, hospitals have been earning less from their investments, and receiving less from donations, according to a report by the Health Care Financial Management Association, a professional organization in Westchester, Ill. 
From 2001 to 2002, the amount of capital available to hospitals from bonds, loans, donations, equity issues and equipment leases dropped from $51.4 billion to $36.5 billion in 2002, the report said.
Laws intended to prevent doctors from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to health providers in which they have a financial interest have given hospitals another reason to remove themselves from the commercial real estate business. Under these so-called Stark laws, hospitals are required to lease space at fair-market rents. 
"What those laws do," said James M. Moloney, a San Francisco-based senior vice president of Cain Brothers, an investment bank, "is add to the burden of administering any relationship with a physician that is a financial relationship. Leasing of office space clearly falls into that bucket."
Mr. Hansen of Provena Health said doctors who lease space from hospitals are always looking for preferential treatment "that would recognize their contribution to the organization; we just literally can't do that." Selling eliminates that problem, he said.
A real estate company may also find it easier than a hospital to raise a doctor's rent. Medical Office Properties, a private real estate investment trust that owns 1.3 million square feet of space, has been gradually raising rents, so far without repercussions, said Daniel W. Colhoun, a senior vice president. 
"A doctor wouldn't move because of a rent increase of 50 cents a square foot," Mr. Colhoun said. "But a general office tenant would move overnight."

HEADLINE: Study Finds Widespread Problem of Inadequate Health Care 

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
Americans get substandard care for their ailments about half the time, even if they live near a major teaching hospital, the first comprehensive study of health care provided in metropolitan areas has found.
 The inadequate treatment leads to "thousands of needless deaths each year," said Dr. Elizabeth A. McGlynn, a researcher at the RAND Corporation and an author of the study, being published today in the journal Health Affairs. 
 Only a fundamental redesign of the health system will improve the situation, Dr. McGlynn said, adding, "It's a tremendous cultural shift we're asking for." 
The study's conclusions were based chiefly on a review of the medical records of nearly 7,000 people in 12 metropolitan areas, including Newark, Miami and Orange County, Calif. On average, the authors found, patients received substandard care, as defined by leading medical groups, 50 percent to 60 percent of the time. There was little variation among the metropolitan areas, randomly selected from 60 with populations of at least 200,000. The areas included cities and their suburbs.
Dr. McGlynn said the study's definitions of adequate care were developed not only from the recommendations published by specialty medical groups but also from four panels of doctors who practiced in a variety of settings. The recommendations reflected what was considered standard at the time the care in the study was delivered, from 1996 to 2000.
The team used the standards to measure average care for adults in an entire community, not the care delivered by specific hospitals, health care plans or doctors. The study did not make comparisons with earlier years or other countries.
"Quality in most areas of care was uniformly poor," said the authors of the study, which was financed by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. And Dr. McGlynn added that for the $1.4 trillion a year the United States spends on health care, it was getting "fairly dismal results."
In a telephone interview with reporters, she noted that doctors and hospitals were paid the same whether they provided "very good care or not-so-good care."
Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, president of the American Medical Association, said yesterday that "there is room for improvement" in medical care and that his organization had taken steps so that new recommendations and innovations are quickly communicated to all physicians.
"The main challenge is quick retrieval of pertinent information," Dr. Palmisano said in an interview from a meeting on improving patient safety he was attending in Boston. 
Although other researchers have concluded that American health care falls far short of its potential, their studies have not been as broadly based as the new one.
To assess the level of care in the 12 communities, the authors received permission from the patients who participated to scour their medical records for the two preceding years. The authors recorded information concerning 439 steps involved in the care of 30 acute and chronic medical conditions like high blood pressure, immunizations, heart failure, diabetes, broken hips and alcoholism.
For diabetes, the steps included measurements of blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol and examination of the feet and eyes. The steps were intended to measure control of the disease and its complications.
Quality of care for some chronic diseases was variable. High blood pressure ranked among the best while diabetes care ranked lowest in most communities, the authors said. Preventive care for sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS and substance abuse ranked lower than screening for high blood pressure and offering immunizations.
Saying that information about quality should be presented locally so officials could tailor action to community needs, the authors urged greater collaboration among communities to improve monitoring of health care.
As models, the authors cited efforts that 43 medical groups and hospitals in Minnesota were making to develop uniform practice guidelines for all health plans in the state. The authors also said monitoring and public reporting of heart bypass surgery in New York State had led to a decline in deaths from the procedure.
The authors also called on research agencies to conduct studies involving larger numbers of communities. They said it would require a study of more than 100 metropolitan areas to draw more definitive conclusions about the effects of the structure of health care systems and finances. (Besides Newark, Miami and Orange County, the areas studied were Boston; Cleveland; Greenville, S.C.; Indianapolis; Lansing, Mich.; Little Rock, Ark.; Phoenix; Seattle; and Syracuse.)

HEADLINE: National Science Panel Warns Of Far Too Few New Scientists 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
The United States faces a major shortage of scientists because too few Americans are entering technical fields and because international competition is heating up for bright foreigners who once filled the gap, a federal panel warned Tuesday.
 "I fear irreversible damage can be done," Robert C. Richardson, a Nobel laureate in physics and a member of the panel, said at a news conference in Washington, adding that he found the personnel trends "quite disturbing." 
 Warren M. Washington, chairman of the panel, the National Science Board, said the nation was in "a long-distance race" to maintain its edge in human scientific resources. 
"For many years we have benefited from minimal competition in the global science and engineering labor market," he said. "But attractive and competitive alternatives are now expanding around the world."
The solution, Dr. Washington added, is for the United States to work harder at developing its own scientific talent. But a board report shows declining interest among young Americans in science careers.
The board, a 24-member federal advisory panel established by Congress, released its report, "An Emerging and Critical Problem of the Science and Engineering Labor Force," as a companion to "Science and Engineering Indicators 2004," a detailed analysis of science trends it publishes every two years. The National Science Foundation, a federal agency that the board oversees, released both reports on Tuesday at its headquarters in Arlington, Va.
The board in its report noted "a troubling decline" in the number of Americans training to be scientists and said such trends "threaten the economic welfare and security of our country."
The recruitment problem, the report said, grows out of the nation's economic success and the rising demand for employees trained in science and engineering. For decades, such jobs have grown faster than overall employment. They went to 3.8 percent of civilian jobs from 2.6 percent between 1983 and 2002, according to the new indicators.
Unchecked, the trends in technical employment will leave a dearth of scientists to meet the rising demand, the board report said. At best, it added, the number of United States citizens qualified for science and engineering jobs could remain level.
But interest in such careers is falling compared with elsewhere. The 2004 report on indicators says the United States ranks 17th among nations surveyed in the share of its 18-to-24-year-olds who earn natural science and engineering degrees, behind Taiwan and South Korea, Ireland and Italy. In 1975, it was third.
Skilled foreigners have increasingly filled the gap: the board report shows that 38 percent of all the nation's scientists and engineers with doctorates are now foreign born.
But that inward flow is threatened, the board said, because of new limits on the entry of highly educated foreigners into the country and more intense global competition for their skills. Visas granted to students, exchange visitors and highly skilled foreigners dropped from 787,000 in 2001 to 625,000 last year. Visa applications have dropped as well.
At the same time, other countries, especially in Europe and Asia, have realized that science and technology are crucial to economic growth and prosperity and are rapidly catching up to the United States in the pursuit of science excellence. As a result, the numbers of foreigners who once came to the United States to do science are expected to drop.
"I don't think America is getting fat and lazy," Dr. Richardson remarked. But he added that if the nation failed to make the right investments soon, "we're going to be left behind in a cloud of dust."

HEADLINE: Senate Blocks New Rules On Pay for Overtime Work 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4 

 BODY:
The Senate handed the Bush administration a significant defeat Tuesday by voting to block new rules on overtime that opponents say would cause millions of workers to lose their eligibility for the extra pay. 
 With five Republicans breaking ranks, the Senate voted, 52 to 47, to ensure that the new Labor Department proposal does not deny overtime to any category of worker now qualified to receive it. The proposal, which the administration says would expand eligibility for millions of workers, has been a source of growing conflict. Seeking to ease opposition, the Labor Department revised them last month. 
 "I think it is a clear message to the administration," said Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who is a leading opponent of the proposal.
Mr. Harkin said the department should drop its initiative and "go back to the drawing board" to produce a fairer plan.
The defeat in the Senate does not necessarily mean that the proposed restrictions, supposed to start in August, will be thwarted. The Senate still has to vote on the corporate tax bill that includes the amendment blocking the overtime rules. The provision also faces an uncertain fate in the House. Last year, the White House was able to kill a similar effort to overturn the proposed rules.
The setback occurred despite the prior approval of a Republican plan to preserve overtime pay for 55 occupations. Republican leaders had hoped that alternative, which passed, 99 to 0, would prevent defections. But it was not enough to sway five of the six Republicans who last year also sided with Democrats in opposing the overtime changes. Two Republicans, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, are in tough re-election fights.
Opponents said the plan was a veiled effort to deny millions of mostly middle-income workers the ability to collect overtime pay that they rely on. Some Republican lawmakers and the administration said the proposal would make more workers eligible for extra pay after working 40 hours. The Republicans said that the effects of the proposal were being distorted and that such a change was badly needed to modernize the creaky Fair Labor Standards Act.
The administrator of the Wage and Hour Division in the Labor Department, Tammy D. McCutchen, told a Senate panel before the vote that the agency believed that its proposal would "strengthen and restore overtime protections" for many employees. Ms. McCutchen said the agency viewed Mr. Harkin's provision to preserve overtime for all those now eligible and to keep in place the elements that would increase eligibility as sowing confusion over who would be entitled to the pay.
"We have opposed the amendment, because we do not know what the law would be for any employee if the amendment is passed," she told an Appropriations Subcommittee.
The Senate added the overtime amendment to the corporate tax bill in the hope of ending a trade fight that has put new tariffs on some American goods. The measure has attracted amendments with political overtones, and Democrats intend to try to use it to extend unemployment benefits. But the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, said he intended to wrap up the legislation this week.
The Senate voted last year to block the overtime rules, and the House expressed a similar sentiment in a resolution. But the lawmakers, under White House pressure in negotiations over a major spending bill, lifted the prohibition. If the Senate passes a bill, it would again have to work out differences with the House. Mr. Harkin said he believed that election year opposition to the administration approach was growing.
Backers of the new proposal said it was a necessary effort to clarify rules that are increasingly a target of lawsuits.
"This is an attempt and a successful attempt to make the rules simpler, fairer and clearer," said Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama.
Mr. Sessions estimated that the proposal would add 6.7 million workers eligible for overtime pay, in part by raising the pay threshold of workers who are guaranteed overtime, to $23,660 from $8,060. 
In a revision last month, officials said the proposal would also explicitly guarantee overtime rights to police officers, firefighters, other emergency and public safety workers and licensed practical nurses, groups of employees whose potential loss of premium pay had helped stir opposition. Unless the rules are blocked, the administration could put them in place on Aug. 23.
In a statement after the vote, Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao indicated that she would resist Congressional intervention.
"The Harkin amendment puts at risk the new, stronger overtime protections for police, firefighters, blue-collar workers and millions of other Americans guaranteed by the department's final rules," Ms. Chao said. "As the issue moves to the House, we will continue to expose the misinformation campaign against the rules and strengthen overtime rights for workers."
Opponents said the new proposal had the potential to penalize millions of employees. "This is a blatant and flagrant effort of the administration in order to increase the bottom line for corporate America and to shortchange working families," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Lower Than Expected in April 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 4 

 BODY:
Sales of several popular large sport utility vehicles, including the Chevrolet Suburban, Ford Expedition and Cadillac Escalade, tailed off in April, but automakers generally insist that high gas prices are not changing the purchase decisions of customers. 
 Sales of sport utility vehicles and other light-duty trucks continue to dominate the market, but there were signs of a shift from the largest S.U.V.'s to smaller ones in the auto industry's April sales reports, which were released on Monday and Tuesday. 
 Over all, auto sales were lower than expected in April, up less than 1 percent from a weak April 2003, coming in at a seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 16.4 million vehicles. 
Discussion of gas prices is a touchy issue among automakers, who reap the most profits from sales of S.U.V.'s and other light-duty trucks, which are less fuel efficient than cars. 
"At today's prices at the pump, you do see some impact on the margin at least," said George Pipas, the Ford Motor Company's chief industry sales analyst. He added, "I don't expect fuel prices to have a substantial effect, maybe on the margin, until we see prices persist for a very long time and probably at levels that are even higher than we have today."
Paul Ballew, chief industry sales analyst at General Motors, said on Tuesday, "We didn't become too concerned about gas prices because we don't see it impacting our business as much as people would assume."
There were curious signs, though. 
Despite G.M.'s increased incentive spending on trucks in April, sales of its Hummer H2 and Chevrolet Suburban fell more than 20 percent compared with the month a year earlier. G.M.'s Cadillac Escalade declined 17.4 percent and the GMC Yukon XL decreased 19.4 percent. All of those vehicles had increases in the first quarter, except the Hummer, whose sales have been declining for several months. 
At Ford, sales of the large Expedition and larger Excursion were down 33.6 percent and 16.7 percent, respectively, and the Lincoln Navigator was lower by 25.3 percent. Nissan's Armada, its new full-size S.U.V., and the Titan, its new full-size truck, are not selling as well as the company had hoped. 
At the same time, sales of smaller, more fuel-efficient S.U.V.'s showed considerable improvement. Sales of G.M.'s Saturn Vue were up nearly 60 percent, and the Ford Escape was up 49 percent, though Ford now has more production of the Escape. 
Increasing numbers of smaller wagonlike S.U.V.'s, known as crossover vehicles in Detroit, are giving buyers more options. Some movement within G.M. could be attributed to two new crossovers, the Cadillac SRX and the Chevrolet Equinox. 
A study released by Kelley Blue Book and the polling firm Harris Interactive said that nearly 40 percent of potential car buyers say high gas prices are influencing their decisions. The groups polled about 1,700 people in late April who said they were in the market to buy a vehicle. 
"Many new-car buyers are opting for vehicles that are more fuel efficient than what they originally intended on buying," said Charlie Vogelheim, executive editor at Kelley Blue Book. "If gas prices remain at high levels through the summer, these smaller and more fuel-efficient S.U.V.'s should attract a great deal of attention." 
One month does not make a trend. Large S.U.V.'s accounted for 5.4 percent of the total new vehicle market last month, down from 6.2 percent in April 2003, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. But April 2003 was a strong month, proportionally, for sales of large sport utilities, and the decline from the first quarter has been less pronounced. 
"There is some evidence of a measured adjustment by consumers, but consumers are still buying the cars that meet their needs," said Paul Taylor, the chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association. "This is not like the shortage of gasoline in 1973, where people parked Lincoln Continentals and started driving small cars to work because they had to sit in line for gasoline."

Army Investigations Show Wider Pattern of Abuse
In the past 16 months, the Army has conducted more than 20 criminal investigations into misconduct by American captors in Iraq and Afghanistan, including two cases of criminal homicide, the Army's vice chief of staff said. The most severe penalties were less-than-honorable discharges and no prison sentences, military officials said. A1

Maj. Gen. Geoffrey D. Miller, the American commander in charge of military jails in Iraq, said he had decided to sharply cut the number of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison and to end the hooding of prisoners. But he defended practices like depriving prisoners of sleep and forcing them into "stress positions" as legitimate means of interrogation. A16

A man identifying himself as one of the abused Iraqis described in a detailed two-hour account his time at the Abu Ghraib prison. A1

The Bush administration offered its first apologies for the abuses but continued to have difficulty explaining its handling of them. Senior senators from both parties denounced Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's handling of the affair and demanded full-scale inquiries. A16

Clerics Tell Rebel to Withdraw
Representatives of Iraq's most influential Shiite leaders met in Baghdad and demanded that Moktada al-Sadr, a rebel Shiite cleric, withdraw militia units from the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala and return power to Iraqi security forces operating under American control. A1

The commander of American forces in the Middle East plans to maintain a level of at least 135,000 soldiers deployed there through 2005, Pentagon and military officials announced, putting on hold the goal of reducing troops in Iraq. A19

Surge in Afghan Violence
Taliban gunmen have killed up to 10 Afghan policemen and soldiers in two ambushes in southern Afghanistan in the past 24 hours, officials said. A5

Chemical Search in France
The French police were scrambling to locate 1,100 pounds of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that could be used to make a powerful bomb, after it was reported missing on Monday. A6

HEADLINE: Cities Enriched Pensions, but Now Struggleto Pay 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
A few years ago, the city of Houston decided to sweeten its workers' retirement benefits. Along with their traditional pensions, city workers nearing retirement were offered special accounts, fed with money from the city pension fund. Although the accounts would pay generous returns, a study showed that the cost to the city would be modest.
 What seemed a good idea then now looks ruinous. Hundreds of older workers will qualify for million-dollar payouts at retirement from these accounts. When their monthly pension checks start coming, some will actually have higher incomes than they did when they were working. 
 The city pension fund cannot support the payouts and has about $1.5 billion less than the benefits it owes the work force. The district attorney is looking into possible wrongdoing. City voters will go to the polls on May 15 to decide whether Houston should opt out of a Texas constitutional requirement that all pension promises be kept. 
 The people of Houston may not know it, but they have plenty of company. Similar pension sweeteners have backfired in Philadelphia, San Diego and Milwaukee. Prosecutors have been investigating the pension plans in each of these cities, though charges have been brought only in Milwaukee, accusing one official of misrepresenting the cost. Still these benefits plans are being promoted to other city officials across the country. 
 At the heart of the matter is a type of pension benefit that has generally been shunned by corporations but embraced by state and local governments. Known as a DROP, for deferred retirement option program, the strategy has been hailed as a way to keep hard-to-replace teachers, engineers and other public workers on the job as they near retirement. 
 Advocates say the plans allow workers to get big one-time checks when they retire, at potentially no additional cost. In practical terms, though, DROP's have been abused again and again by naive or self-interested officials, who have pumped up benefits well beyond what the rank and file expected or what the pension fund could pay. Records show that some of these officials set up rich programs to coincide with their own retirements.
 "The administration thought this was a good way to reward the employees," said Houston's human resources director, Lonnie G. Vara, who did not design the sweeteners but now has the job of explaining them. Houston, like many cities, he said, offered big pensions to make up for paying its workers less than they could earn in the private sector. Mr. Vara, with 30 years' service, stands to get a $1.5 million check from the program when he turns 60 in seven years. In addition, he will receive monthly pension checks totaling about $110,000 a year, according to an actuary hired by Houston.
Two years ago, San Diego offered individual pension accounts, after promising a cost study that was never done, according to a trustee of the pension fund, Diann Shipione. Some people there, too, stand to earn more by retiring than by working, and the city pension fund has a $1.1 billion shortfall.
Philadelphia tested the supplementary pension accounts in 1999, saying it would review the program after four years to see whether it was affordable. Last year, the mayor said the benefits were draining the pension fund and had to be abolished. But city pension trustees made them permanent. 
In Milwaukee County, residents were so angry to learn that supplementary pension accounts would turn some officials into millionaires that they held a recall election and voted seven county supervisors out of office. The county executive and two of his aides resigned under fire, and another official was prosecuted for misrepresenting the benefits' costs. Other criminal charges may be in the works, and several civil lawsuits are pending. 
"When I first saw a DROP I said, 'Oh my God, who came up with that?"' said Sean F. McShea, a managing director at Ryan Labs, an asset-management firm in New York that deals extensively with public pension plans. "Everyone believes it's a free lunch." 
In 1982, a handful of police and firefighters in Baton Rouge, La., came up with the idea of tapping their pension fund before they retired, and using the money to create individual escrow accounts. Their pension plan, like most traditional plans, paid their benefits as a stream of monthly checks, called an annuity. 
Working with an actuary, they figured out that if they turned down the longevity raises they were entitled to just before retirement, their pension fund could use that money to set up individual accounts. In other words, they could get two benefits for the price of one. 
As the stock market boomed in the late 1990's, the idea caught fire, spreading from firefighters and police departments to teachers, judges and all sorts of public workers. The idea of giving up something in exchange faded away.
Today, the basic concept works this way: When an employee becomes eligible to retire, he instead opens an escrow account, and then keeps on working at normal pay. His pension benefit stops growing, just as if he had retired. The pension fund starts sending monthly checks to his escrow account. The escrow money earns interest, and when the employee finally does retire, he gets a lump sum. He also starts receiving his monthly pension checks, which are based on his benefits before the escrow accounts were created.
Pension specialists have created all sorts of variations on the DROP -- the "drip," the "plop," the "backdrop," and so on, allowing workers to come in and out of the plans, for example. Financial-services companies began teaching pension officials how to set up the programs at conferences. 
In 2002, the money-management and record-keeping firms that sponsor Guns and Hoses, a yearly party for fire and police pension officials, urged delegates to send in the details of their escrow accounts, for compilation in a catalog. Every delegate got a copy to take home, for use in negotiating better benefits. The sponsors got the data.
Speakers at these pension conferences usually state that the accounts can be "cost neutral," but warn local officials not to sweeten the benefits too much. 
But when stock prices were booming, that caveat did not always register. Many pension officials assumed they could pack their programs with extras, and if it all cost too much, investment returns would make up the difference. Only later, when markets soured, did the magnitude of what they had promised become apparent. 
"In my experience, the majority of DROP's have not been cost-neutral," said Joseph Esuchanko, the actuary hired by Houston to help it cope with its pension morass. Most of the programs were made too rich, he said. "That's definitely true in Houston. They've got this fantastic benefits formula."
For example, Houston's pension trustees decided the escrow accounts should pay a guaranteed annual interest rate of 8.5 percent -- even more in years when the pension fund's investments did very well. In today's low interest rate environment, this has turned out to be a bonanza for the workers. Houston offered other sweeteners as well. 
Other cities have made their own mistakes. Milwaukee County's pension officials guaranteed 9 percent returns on their escrow accounts, and took other steps to enlarge both the lump sums and the monthly annuity checks. They placed no limits on how long the accounts could stay open, for example, allowing them to compound into jackpots. 
In October 2001, milwaukeeworld.com, a local news site, described how elected officials were qualifying for million-dollar retirement payouts. Existing retirees, who were ineligible for the new benefits, were outraged. They feared the big payments would suck money out of the pension fund, putting their own, smaller benefits at risk. 
County officials said they did not know how the big payouts came to be. But then state law enforcement agents seized documents from the office of the county personnel director, Gary Dobbert. They showed that he had traveled to at least six pension conferences, at Pebble Beach, Calif.; Lake Tahoe, Nev.; and other resorts, learning how to create supplementary pension accounts. His notes, included in court documents, show that the speakers stressed the need to design the programs frugally.
The court documents also show that back in Milwaukee, at least some officials were contemplating their own retirements as they put Mr. Dobbert's findings into practice. There were, for example, handwritten projections of how new benefit setups would affect the retirement of the county executive, F. Thomas Ament, depending on when he retired and other circumstances. One projection showed that if new benefits were put in place and Mr. Ament worked until 2008, he could receive an annual pension payout of about $35,000 more than his yearly pay. He also stood to get a seven-figure one-time payout in some projections. 
John D. Finerty, a lawyer for Mr. Ament, said that it was normal for public officials to check the effect of pension changes on their own benefits, and that Mr. Ament had not intended to withdraw the maximum. Mr. Ament stepped down in 2002 and did not earn the payout in any case. 
Mr. Dobbert's lawyer, Craig W. Albee, said that Mr. Dobbert had designed large pension benefits because he anticipated a tough round of union negotiations and could not raise wages without overwhelming the county budget.
In March, Mr. Dobbert pleaded no contest to one felony count of misconduct in public office and two misdemeanor counts, stemming from stating in a memo to other county officials that the escrow accounts could be added onto the pension plan at no additional cost. A judge fined him $11,000 and imposed a 60-day sentence, which he has already served, at a work-release center in downtown Milwaukee. He elected not to take his lump sum.
In Houston, it is not yet clear how the retirement account program came to be so generous. The City Council has asked the executive director of the pension fund, David L. Long, to appear and answer questions, but he has refused. Now the Council is trying to determine whether it can subpoena him.
Towers Perrin, the actuary for the pension fund, has issued a statement saying it is not to blame, even though it underestimated how many people would opt for the program. The statement pointed out that cost projections are often wide of the mark, "because those costs ultimately depend on a number of factors that cannot be predicted in advance." The statement also noted that even though the city had been informed that these were very optimistic projections, it went ahead anyway.
Charles A. Rosenthal Jr., the district attorney for surrounding Harris County, declined to discuss his inquiry, saying he was still gathering data and had not drawn any conclusions.But he noted that after the new benefits were approved, the pension fund's board was reconfigured to remove three trustees who had represented the city and its taxpayers.
"All the members of the board at this time stand to benefit from increases in the pension plan," he said. 
In addition, the Legislature approved a constitutional amendment barring cities in Texas from reducing pensions. It was made law in 2003. The amendment includes a provision giving municipalities one chance to decide, in a referendum, whether to opt out. Houston will decide this at the polls on May 15. 
Despite the uproar, Mr. Esuchanko said the DROP concept and its promise were still being promoted elsewhere. He went to an actuarial conference in March, he said, just as the scandal was breaking in Houston. The supplemental plans were discussed and the discussion of costs "probably took about five minutes," he said. No one mentioned the places where costs had exploded.

C5) Chart: "Stop Working, Earn More"A number of cities have created supplementary pension accounts, which can allow some workers to retire with incomes that are greater than if they continued to work.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Are Up as Fed Implies Rate Rise Will Be Gradual

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose modestly yesterday after the Federal Reserve's interest-rate-setting panel said that any increase in short-term interest rates would be "measured," though it declined to say again that policy makers would be patient in raising rates.
 "It gives equity investors comfort that things will be predictable," said Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at the J.P. Morgan Private Bank, "rather than excessively rapid or destabilizing to the pace of the recovery, 
 The Dow Jones industrial average added 3.20 points, or 0.03 percent, to 10,317.20. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.06 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,119.55. The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index gained 11.76 points, or 0.61 percent, ending at 1,950.48. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization stocks added 4.16 points, or 0.74 percent, to close at 569.64. 
 On the New York Stock Exchange, roughly four stocks advanced for every three that fell. Volume rose to 1.68 billion shares from 1.51 billion on Monday. 
 Investors received further signs yesterday that the economy is picking up. New orders at factories rose 4.3 percent in March, the biggest increase since July 2002. 
 Indexes of companies that produce raw materials and computer-related products had the biggest gains of the S.&P. 500's 10 industry groups, up 1.2 percent and 0.8 percent. First-quarter earnings of S.&P. 500 companies have climbed 27 percent, based on results from 423 companies that have reported and estimates for the rest, according to Thomson Financial -- more than double a 13.4 percent forecast on Jan. 1.
 U.S. Steel climbed $1.43, or more than 5 percent, to $29.27. The International Iron and Steel Institute said global demand for steel would increase 6.2 percent this year.
 Tyco International, whose products include electronic connectors, security systems and industrial valves, climbed $1.09, to $29.07. Profit this year, excluding some expenses, will be as much as $1.58 a share, the company said. It had forecast profit as high as $1.52.
 The American depository receipts of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries of Israel added $2.30, to $62.65. Each A.D.R. is equivalent to one share. Teva said first-quarter profit, excluding some items, was 64 cents a share, more than the 59 cents expected in a Thomson Financial survey.
 Macrovision, a maker of copyright protection software, surged $5.18, or 29 percent, to $22.74. The company increased its forecast of annual profit, excluding some items, to a range of 85 cents to 87 cents a share on revenue as high as $155 million. Previously, Macrovision had expected profit of 78 cents to 80 cents and revenue up to $150 million.
 The stock of Nortel Networks broke a series of six consecutive declines, adding 60 cents, to $3.98, in trading of more than 92 million shares. Nortel has fired top executives and is restating revenue and earnings amid accounting irregularities. 
 Among declining issues, Hospira, a hospital products company spun off from Abbott Laboratories, fell $1.04, to $26. In a March 25 letter to Abbott that was posted on the Food and Drug Administration's Web site yesterday, the agency said the unit violated quality standards. A company spokeswoman, Stacey Eisen, said Hospira had made necessary improvements and met with the F.D.A. to resolve the matter.
 In the commodities markets, crude oil for June delivery rose 77 cents, or 2 percent, to settle at $38.98 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Near-term oil futures last settled at this level in October 1990, when Iraq occupied Kuwait. The commodity price of oil is up about 50 percent from a year ago.

Treasury Prices Fall
(By Reuters)
 Treasury prices dropped yesterday after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady but suggested it was a step closer to tightening monetary policy. 
 Also of concern to the credit market was the April employment report, which is due Friday. A positive reading on the labor market would give the Fed an additional reason to increase rates.
 By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 15/32, to 95 19/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.56 percent from 4.50 percent on Monday.The 30-year Treasury bond was down 27/32, to 100 16/32. Its yield rose to 5.34 percent. The following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Fed Toughens Rate Hints, Seeing a Rise As 'Measured' 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve kept short-term interest rates at 1 percent on Tuesday but gave its clearest hint yet that it is preparing a retreat from its policy of cheap money.
 In what appeared to be an effort to prepare markets for higher rates as early as this summer, the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, said in a statement that it "believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured." 
 The statement was a retreat from the Fed's previous stance, when policy makers said they could afford to be "patient" before increasing rates. The Fed also declared that the risks to price stability "have moved into balance." 
The statement reinforced expectations among investors that the Fed would start to push borrowing costs higher before the November presidential election. If and when it raises rates, it would be the first time in four years and could lead to the first series of increases since 1994.
Traditionally, the Fed has been reluctant to increase interest rates in the middle of a presidential campaign. But Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has in the past made it clear he would be willing to do so.
Tom Schlesinger, executive director of the Financial Markets Center, a nonprofit research group in Philomont, Va., said, "The Fed feels confident that it has the autonomy and the built-up political capital to do what it thinks is right." 
But the Fed also emphasized on Tuesday that it felt no need to act abruptly, and suggested that it might move more cautiously than it did 10 years ago, when the economic cycle was at a somewhat similar stage. It indicated that it thinks inflation is not yet a threat, brushing aside an unexpectedly big rise in consumer prices in March.
"Although incoming inflation data have moved somewhat higher, long-term expectations appear to have remained well contained," the rate panel said in the statement.
Investors appeared initially confused by the mixed signals, with stock and bond prices gyrating after the statement was released. Reactions by the end of the day were muted, in part because many investors had been betting on higher interest rates sooner rather than later. Stocks ended modestly higher, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which is related to mortgage rates, had already climbed to around 4.5 percent from 3.7 percent in mid-March. It ended the day at 4.56 percent.
With recent signs that economic growth is strengthening and that inflation may be on the upswing, the Fed is at what policy makers call an "inflection point" -- the moment when its priority shifts from pumping up a weak economy to keeping it from overheating.
Mr. Greenspan cautioned last month that the central bank would have to push up interest rates "at some point," and the debate among analysts has been whether officials would act this summer or wait until early next year.
Robert V. DiClemente, a senior economist at Citigroup who has contended that the Fed would not act until next year, said on Tuesday that he had changed his view.
"I think they will move this summer," Mr. DiClemente said. "But I don't think this will be an uninterrupted series of rate increases."
Laurence E. Meyer, a former Fed governor who is now a senior adviser at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting company, said debate within the Fed appeared to have shifted to the pace and extent of future rate increases.
"It's almost a foregone conclusion -- they will go ahead sooner rather than later," Mr. Meyer said. "But the second message is, 'relax, the pace is going to be gradual."'
For much of the last year, Mr. Greenspan and other top officials have made it clear that they wanted to keep interest rates low until they saw signs of a sustained increase in job creation and concrete evidence of rising inflation.
After losing nearly three million jobs from early of 2001 through the end of 2003, the nation added 308,000 jobs in March. Though the surprisingly positive employment report was not enough to persuade Fed officials that the job market had begun to recover, it corroborated evidence of rapid growth in factory production and buoyant expectations of business executives.
Indeed, hours before the Fed announced its decision Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that factory orders increased 4.3 percent in March, the fastest pace in two years.
Last month, the Labor Department said that consumer prices increased at an unexpectedly rapid rate of 0.5 percent in March, and that report was corroborated by a separate estimate of inflation in the government's most recent estimate of economic growth.
But Mr. Greenspan and other officials have made it clear in recent weeks that they did not believe inflation is a threat. In testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress two weeks ago, Mr. Greenspan said that productivity continued to climb rapidly and that inflation could remain subdued even if companies felt compelled to raise wages as they hired more workers. 
Mr. Greenspan has assiduously sought to prepare investors for a return to higher rates, making a series of minute changes in the wording of Fed statements to signal that a change in policy was gradually drawing near.
In January, the Fed dropped its open-ended pledge to keep rates low for "a considerable period" and said it would merely be "patient" before deciding to change policy. 
Last month, Mr. Greenspan told Congress that the Fed was no longer worried about deflation and conspicuously refrained from using the word "patient." In announcing on Tuesday that the Fed would move in a "measured" pace to higher rates, it took the process one step further.
The big question now is how far the Fed will go when it finally does begin to raise rates. 
"They talked about the pace of the journey, but they didn't talk about the destination," said Paul McCulley, portfolio manager at Pimco Advisers, one of the nation's largest bond management firms. "We don't know where they are going to stop, and that is why the market is still fairly antsy."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 7, 2004

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Wednesday about the Federal Reserve's decision to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged referred incorrectly to the series of increases from February 1994 to February 1995, in which the federal funds rate rose to 6 percent from 3 percent. It was the last sustained rise, not the last one over all. (There was a rise of 1.75 percentage point from June 1999 to May 2000.)

HEADLINE: Libya to Open 8 Oil Projects To Bidders 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE

 BODY:
A senior Libyan oil official said yesterday that his country planned to hold an auction by the middle of the year to draw foreign investment into eight oil and gas projects, the first opportunity for American oil companies to do new business in Libya since President Bush eased sanctions 10 days ago. 
 Speaking by phone from an industry conference in Houston, Tarek Hassan-Beck, director of planning at the National Oil Company of Libya, said that he was leading a government group that was completing the terms of an open auction for eight projects across the country and off the coast. While the proposed projects, or blocks, are not producing at this time, they are near producing wells within what Mr. Hassan-Beck called "prolific basins." 
 The projects would not contribute immediately to worldwide oil supply and thus would have no near-term effect on oil prices, which have risen to levels last seen in 1990, when Iraq occupied Kuwait. In New York yesterday, crude oil for June delivery rose 77 cents, or 2 percent, to $38.98 a barrel. 
The easing of sanctions against Libya allows American oil companies to revive their participation in decades-old production ventures in the country, and already, Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil and Amerada Hess have moved to renegotiate their old leases. But the new projects Libya is preparing for auction would let American companies catch up to European rivals like Agip and Total that have moved in over the last 20 years to help develop Libya's reserves.
"American oil companies themselves have been pushing like mad because they have been excluded for so long, and they want to get where oil is, and they're dying to go," said one senior European oil executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the competitive nature of the industry. Of the Libyans, he said: "These guys need the money and technology, which oil companies can provide, and they have a lot of untapped areas that need developing. So why wastetime?"
Two of the proposed blocks are offshore. There is one block each in the Ghadames Basin and the Cyrenaica/Botnan Basin, and two each in the Murzuq Basin and the Sirt Basin.
"What we have to focus on is terms and conditions of the tenders," the executive said, "and the Libyans have never been known for being overly generous."
American oil executives have already visited Libya to renew relations with government officials and to investigate new projects. Libya sits atop at least 36 billion barrels of oil, but Mr. Hassan-Beck said that only 25 percent of the country had been explored for oil and gas. He pointed out that there are seven large basins in Libya where oil and gas are produced, but that "just 5 or 10 years ago, we didn't have discovery at some of them, and now we have a gold rush."
But American and United Nations sanctions severely restricted investment in Libya's oil industry over the last 18 years. As a consequence, the industry is now in dire need of new technology, management techniques and equipment, Mr. Hassan-Beck said. He estimated that Libya would need about $30 billion in investments over the next 10 years to modernize the oil sector. The country produces 1.2 million to 1.3 million barrels a day now, he said. With the proper investment, Libya could produce about two million barrels a day by 2007, he said.
Libyan oil officials are courting not just the major oil multinationals but smaller, more nimble exploration and production companies that could enter a project more quickly. The officials are also talking to oil field service companies that can help Libya increase the output of oil from wells that are already producing, Mr. Hassan-Beck said. 
Among Libya's top priorities, Mr. Hassan-Beck said, is developing its large natural gas reserves, mostly for export. A new natural gas pipeline has been built to Sicily, and its first gas should be flowing into Europe by September, Mr. Hassan-Beck said. But the longer-term goal is to make liquefied natural gas that would be shipped directly to the ever energy-hungry American market, an option that seemed very remote just a few months ago.
"Most of the gas we're dealing with now is something we bumped into," Mr. Hassan-Beck said. "Now we want to focus on gas production and liquefied natural gas and possibly bringing L.N.G. to the U.S. soon."

HEADLINE: Average U.S. Car Is Tipping Scales At 4,000 Pounds 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 4 

 BODY:
Detroit was recently ranked as the nation's most obese city by Men's Fitness magazine. Perhaps it is no surprise, then, that the Motor City's chief product is also losing the battle of the bulge. 
 The average new car or light-duty truck sold in the 2003 model year tipped the scales at 4,021 pounds, breaking the two-ton barrier for the first time since the mid-1970's, according to a report released by the Environmental Protection Agency last week. 
 The fattening of the nation's automobiles is a principal reason that average fuel economy has stopped improving and the nation's consumption of crude oil has been swelling: all else being equal, moving more weight takes more energy. Add in the additional pollutants and greenhouse gases released by burning more fuel, and it is not surprising that the upsizing trend is condemned by environmental groups. 
But ranged against them in an increasingly bitter debate are industry lobbyists and conservative groups who argue that girth is good, for crashworthiness and because people want more space and power, though Honda is a notable dissenter in the industry. 
At the center of the debate is the Bush administration's proposed rewriting of national fuel economy regulations. Though work on the plan is still in its early stages, one important aspect of it could lead automakers to make their vehicles even heavier on average. Environmentalists are distressed by the plan, but it has not been embraced by the auto industry, either.
In recent months, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been flooded with nearly 50,000 letters and detailed comments about the plan. Many have come from organizations with an interest in the outcome -- automakers, lobbyists, environmental and consumer groups -- but the majority have been from individuals, some of them angered by increasingly tanklike vehicles and others by the claims of industry lobbying groups that S.U.V.'s will somehow be regulated out of existence. 
And there are other motivations. "One of the things that triggers asthma is air pollution, and vehicular emissions are a significant source," said Dr. Ronald Saff, an asthma specialist in Tallahassee, Fla., concerned about rising asthma rates. Dr. Saff, 45, wrote a letter asking the agency "to make S.U.V.'s safer for families and the environment."
But Carroll Boyle, a 65-year-old retired educator from Manchester, N.H., wrote that tougher regulations "may force people into vehicles that are smaller, less powerful, and not as safe as our current options." She added, "In New Hampshire we have weather that requires an S.U.V. many days a year."
The E.P.A.'s weight statistics show that the average weight of a 2003 car or light-duty truck, like a pickup, sport utility, van or minivan, was heavier than in any model year since 1976, when the average peaked at 4,079 pounds. Just five years later, after the oil shocks of the 1970's, the average had fallen by more than 20 percent, to 3,202 pounds. The figures take into account the sales volumes of different models.
Average fuel economy peaked at 22.1 miles to the gallon in the late 1980's, according to the agency, but has eroded since then to 20.7 miles for the 2003 model year. 
The agency expects the 2004 model year to finish with an average weight of 4,066 pounds. 
New noncommercial vehicles are actually even heavier than the statistics show, because the largest vehicles sold to consumers, including Hummers and Ford Excursions, are not classed as light-duty, so they are not covered by fuel economy rules or counted in average weight calculations. They are also exempt from many safety standards and crash-test requirements. 
Government studies say these giant vehicles are increasing the overall number of deaths in accidents, mainly because of the threat they pose to people in cars they hit in collisions. The administration's plan does suggest that manufacturers be pressed to slim down the heaviest of the heavyweights, like the Hummer.
Though new vehicles are back to weighing what they did in the 1970's, they are obviously very different in shape, in part because of the fuel economy rules introduced then. Automakers must meet average mileage targets, now set at 20.7 miles to the gallon for light-duty trucks and 27.5 for passenger cars. By scrapping station wagons and large sedans in favor of minivans and S.U.V.'s, manufacturers have greatly increased the share of their total sales subject to the lower truck standard, and they have fought to preserve the two-tier system.
Federal regulators say safety has suffered as a result, both because S.U.V.'s and larger pickup trucks are more prone to roll over than cars are, and because they do more serious damage to vehicles they hit. 
Traffic deaths in the United States rose to 43,220 last year, the most since 1990. Before the S.U.V. boom, the country had the world's lowest highway death rate, taking miles driven into account, but it now ranks behind at least eight other developed nations, including Canada, Australia, Britain and Sweden. Lower rates of seat belt use and other factors play a part, but much of the difference stems from the composition of the national vehicle fleet, researchers say.
The Bush administration contends that most sport utilities should be given room to grow in any new fuel economy system, citing a government study that said lightening any but the largest vehicles would do more harm than good. Thus, one of the administration's leading proposals is to divide the light-duty truck category into classes, with more stringent requirements for heavyweights.
Most major automakers have reacted cautiously, especially to the idea of broadening the system to cover the largest S.U.V.'s.
"Studies show that making vehicles lighter has an adverse effect on safety," said Eron Shosteck, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which lobbies on behalf of General Motors, Ford Motor, DaimlerChrysler, Toyota and others. "If all vehicles were made heavier, it would have a positive impact on safety," Mr. Shosteck said. 
But Honda, which makes some of the most fuel-efficient vehicles, said its own research found that dimensions, design and materials often made more difference than weight. Honda cited government statistics showing that midsize cars have lower death rates than sport utilities, and that smaller S.U.V.'s do better than midsize S.U.V.'s.

HEADLINE: Impeachment Panel Gets Down to Business 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 4 

 BODY:
The last days of the annual legislative session are usually a time when the final crucial details of major bills are being negotiated and the state budget is at the center of contentious debate. 
 Not this year. 
 While some matters are remaining before Connecticut lawmakers adjourn on Wednesday, the budget passed last week and the major legislative action remaining at the Capitol is a matter that will be resolved only after all but 10 of the state's 187 lawmakers have gone home: the conclusion of the impeachment investigation of Gov. John G. Rowland. 
"We don't want to be up here mucking around when an impeachment process is under way," said the Senate president pro tempore, Kevin B. Sullivan.
The relatively peaceful session is, in large part, the result of unexpected positive economic news that eased budget talks. But the impeachment inquiry, while generating some partisan swipes and plenty of distraction, also helped keep the calm. Mr. Rowland, a Republican weakened by the scandal, often lacked the leverage to fight an issue with vigor, and many Democratic legislative leaders deliberately tried to avoid criticism that the politics of impeachment would paralyze them. 
"A lot of good will developed," said Representative John Wayne Fox, a Democrat from Stamford who is co-chairman of the 10-member bipartisan House impeachment committee, "a true desire to make this process nonpartisan." 
With the session ending Wednesday, the committee will begin its work in earnest just as the busy halls of the Capitol grow quiet. And, subject to revision, a script has been fashioned. 
A week or two of public hearings would begin in June, at the latest, with perhaps fewer than a dozen witnesses likely to be called. A recommendation to the House, either for or against impeachment, would follow immediately, no later than June 30. The full House would then take a few days to consider the issues before voting. If the House votes to impeach Mr. Rowland, a Senate trial will begin as early as July. It could all be over by August, if not sooner. Either Mr. Rowland stays in office or he is removed and Lt. Gov. M. Jodi Rell is promoted to governor. 
Adding another catalyst to the process, voters decide in November whether to re-elect state lawmakers. 
"It's an election year," said Representative Wade A. Hyslop Jr., a Democrat from New London who serves on the impeachment committee. "People don't want to be stuck up here in an election year."
Polls show more than two-thirds of people questioned want the governor to resign, perhaps further motivating lawmakers. 
As the business of the legislature has fallen into place, the work of the impeachment committee also appears to have found a groove. Peripheral legal battles that have delayed and distracted the inquiry have largely evaporated, from court battles over witnesses' Fifth Amendment rights to committee maneuvers to keep some of its work secret. 
This week the committee reached agreement with William A. Tomasso and Michael Tomasso, contractors close to Mr. Rowland who have received hundreds of millions of dollars in state work during his three terms. The Tomassos have agreed to provide documents relevant to the investigation, including work that Tomasso employees did on the governor's Litchfield vacation cottage and on a juvenile detention facility in Middletown, according to Mr. Fox.
The Tomassos were the last of the crucial witnesses to fight in court over whether they had to comply with subpoenas served by the committee.
Last Friday, the committee asked its lawyer to draft an article of impeachment accusing the governor of obstruction for not complying with subpoenas to provide financial records. While Mr. Fox and others say they are serious about the accusation, they also say they are not likely to recommend removing the governor based on that one charge. Mr. Rowland responded Friday by immediately sending letters to his banks and creditors asking them to provide the committee with his records.
In addition, Mr. Fox said he learned Tuesday that there were more "materials coming from the governor," though he did not elaborate. 
As the session comes to a close, many committee members are beginning to focus on the impeachment inquiry and feel its gravity. Some noted that the impeachment of Bill Clinton devolved into obstruction charges that the president had lied about his sexual affairs. 
"I was horrified by that," said Representative James W. Abrams, a Democrat from Meriden who is on the impeachment committee. "I don't want to do the same thing to this governor, regardless of how I feel about him."
The initial deadline for the committee to complete its work was April 14. That was extended to Wednesday and, on Tuesday, House Speaker Moira K. Lyons extended the deadline to June 30. She said she would be reluctant to extend it again. But the governor's in-house counsel, Ross H. Garber, gave little weight to the revised schedule. 
"This process should take as long as it needs to get the job done right," Mr. Garber said.
Mr. Garber has been critical of the committee, saying that before it worries about a deadline it should adopt clear standards for impeachment, publicly define the scope of its investigation and settle on the burden of proof by which Mr. Rowland will be judged.
But Mr. Fox said that while the first two deadlines were flexible, this one -- set long after the clutter of the session is over -- was firm. "It puts more pressure on us to recognize that this is the end of it," he said.

To the Editor:
 Why must the United States be first in scientific achievements? If science is valuable because it produces economic benefits, then it makes sense to worry about increasing competition from other nations. 
But if science is valuable because it produces new knowledge, then a world with more highly qualified scientists could bring more discoveries at a faster pace. 
 Shouldn't we see a larger and livelier scientific community as a welcome development?

HEADLINE: Indoor Soccer Added to Newark Arena Plans 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 4 

 BODY:
An expansion team of the on-again, off-again Major Indoor Soccer League will join the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League as tenants of a proposed Newark sports arena, which itself has been an on-again, off-again project over the last seven years, city officials said on Tuesday.
 The soccer team and the Devils would begin playing in the planned 18,000-seat, $300 million arena by the 2007-8 season, Mayor Sharpe James said. The mayor pointed to the addition of the soccer team as the most recent sign of progress on the arena project, which will be financed by the city and the Devils' owners. 
 The announcement came a day before Mr. James is expected to ask the Municipal Council to approve $210 million in bonds that will provide the city's share of the arena cost. Noting the history of ups and downs for the arena project and the city, Mr. James said during a news conference at the proposed site that the arena would be built.
"Everything I read in the newspapers about the troubles of the arena plans -- I remember reading about the troubles of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center," Mr. James said. The $189 million arts center endured more than a decade of skepticism, setbacks and opposition before it opened in 1998. Mr. James added, "The City of Newark, the New Jersey Devils, the M.I.S.L., more family entertainment, new businesses, jobs for our residents and countless other amenities -- that's tomorrow's Newark."
In the Major Indoor Soccer League, which owns all of its teams, the proposed arena would have a tenant whose history dates to 1978. The league was disbanded in 1992 and was resurrected in 2001. 
Steve Ryan, the commissioner of the league, has acknowledged the indoor game's troubled past, but on Tuesday he insisted that the Newark arena and the league "fit like a glove."
For one thing, he said, the city's sizable population of native Portuguese and Latin Americans created a ready-made fan base for the expansion team's five exhibition games and 21 home games during the October-to-April season. In addition, Mr. Ryan noted that the price range of $12 to $24 for an M.I.S.L. ticket made it inexpensive family entertainment compared with $35 to $95 for tickets to regular-season basketball games for the New Jersey Nets.
Newark had originally envisioned its arena as home for both the Devils and the Nets, who both play now at Continental Arena in East Rutherford, 12 miles from the Newark arena site. After the sale of the Nets to a developer who plans to move the basketball team to Brooklyn, Newark was confronted by an aggressive effort by the head of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, George R. Zoffinger, to keep open Continental Arena and compete to draw similar events like concerts, the Ice Capades and the circus.
Mr. Ryan said he expected the league to approve the expansion team when its management committee meets on May 17. 
Jeffrey Vanderbeek, the principal owner of the Devils who also helped bring the soccer team to the arena, said that with the arrival of the soccer league, the team that will manage the arena has more than 200 dates already booked for the opening season envisioned in 2007.

HEADLINE: Paris Looks Inward on Jobs and Industry 

BYLINE:  By KATRIN BENNHOLD

DATELINE: PARIS, May 4 

 BODY:
After hammering out a deal last week to create an industrial icon for France in a giant pharmaceuticals merger, Nicolas Sarkozy, France's new finance minister, is taking that effort further.
 In his first news conference since President Jacques Chirac moved him from the interior ministry in a cabinet shakeup, Mr. Sarkozy said on Tuesday that the government would move actively to keep jobs and crucial industries on French soil. But for the first time, he also called on European governments to join forces to keep the core of the economic bloc from turning into "industrial deserts." 
 "There are great companies in Europe, with a savoir-faire of the highest standard," he told a packed auditorium of journalists in a two-hour question-and-answer session. "We have to support them."
Promising to start an initiative on the European Union level, he added: "Neither France nor Europe can become industrial deserts. Solutions exist."
Some solutions sound familiar. Like his Socialist predecessors in the 1980's, Mr. Sarkozy urged that public money be freed up to support companies.
He labeled the European Union's state-aid rules "far too restrictive," and called for a relaxation to allow national governments to give their corporate elites a leg up in competitiveness. He also proposed a Europe-wide push for tax incentives aimed at forging industry hubs, Silicon Valley-style, to spur regional growth.
Taking a page from the United States, Mr. Sarkozy suggested that European companies bidding for public contracts be forced to disclose where subcontractors are from.
With unemployment near a three-year high and unease about globalization on the rise, Mr. Sarkozy's words are likely to strike a chord with French voters.
Three days after the European Union welcomed 10 new, mostly East European countries, his push to take the European stage is well-timed. As the region's geographical center moves farther away from Paris, French anxiety about losing economic and political influence is palpable.
Yet analysts warn that the strategy will do nothing to stop manufacturing jobs from leaving Europe -- and may well backfire.
"He is fighting against windmills -- the process of disindustrialization is inevitable," said Daniel Gros, director of the Brussels-based Center for European Policy Studies. "Those countries who slow that process pay. The problem is not that there is disindustrialization in France, but that it isn't happening fast enough."
Manufacturing accounts for just under 20 percent of the French economy -- roughly the same as in the European Union's other large economies, but much higher than in the smaller member countries, where it averages about 14 percent. This, Mr. Gros said, has slowed the process of establishing high-end service employment that complements, rather than competes with, the lost jobs. The only way to create lasting jobs and build an economy, he said, is either to increase spending on research and development or to make current spending more efficient.
While European governments spend about 1 percent of gross domestic product on research and development, the same proportion as the United States, America registers almost twice as many patents per researcher as Europe.
And private research and development spending amounts to 2 percent of G.D.P. in the United States, compared with 1 percent in Europe. One way to increase the private money available for this investment would be to open tender offers for government-run research projects to Europe-wide competition. Almost 95 percent of all research financing, Mr. Gros noted, is national.
One reason ambitions for a coordinated European response to job losses stemming from globalization may falter is that national governments -- and France particularly -- are loath to give more control to foreigners. That is what has motivated the latest talk about government intervention.
"This is why the idea of economic government was buried in Brussels 25 years ago," Mr. Gros said. "It doesn't make sense to have European champions -- national governments will just fight over whose national favorites are the winners and who are the losers."
According to Frederique Sachwald, an economist at the French Institute of International Relations, the government's interventionist rhetoric has a distinctly political ring to it. Only about 5 percent of the investment that leaves France can be defined as "disindustrialization," she said. While government measures should help to ease the restructuring pain when a large proportion of a local population is hit by a factory closing, she added, globalization should not become an excuse to go back to large-scale subsidy programs.
"We want industry that doesn't need to be subsidized all the time," Ms. Sachwald said. "For that we don't need 1980's-style industrial policies. It's very French to defend existing jobs and forget that we may hinder the emergence of new businesses and jobs in the process."
France has benefited from globalization. As Mr. Sarkozy pointed out at Tuesday's news conference, 15 million people in France are on foreign companies' payrolls. Last year, the country was the No.1 recipient of direct foreign investment, with 52 billion euros ($62 billion). The government has just begun an advertising campaign to persuade more foreign businesses to set up house on French soil.
"It's a contradiction to say to foreigners, 'Please come and invest here, but we'll do everything to stop our companies to go to you,"' said Philippe Waechter, chief economist at Natexis Asset Management.

HEADLINE: Citizens Financial Acquires Charter One 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER; Riva Atlas contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The Citizens Financial Group announced on Tuesday that it would purchase Charter One Financial, a regional bank with $41 billion in assets and branches in nine states, for about $10.5 billion in cash.
 The transaction, which Citizens said would make it one of the 10 largest bank holding companies in the country, is part of a wave of consolidation in the banking industry over the past few years. 
 Other recent consolidations include the purchase of Bank One by J.P. Morgan Chase, which was announced in January, and the acquisition of FleetBoston Financial by Bank of America, which was announced last October. 
Citizens, which will maintain its corporate headquarters in Providence, R.I., operates primarily in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states.
The Charter One purchase will give Citizens access to major markets in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Ohio and Vermont. Charter One currently has a branch-opening program that Citizens will continue, according to the Citizens announcement.
The purchase of Charter One is also further evidence that the Royal Bank of Scotland, Citizens' parent, intends to expand its operations in the United States.
The Royal Bank of Scotland bought Citizens in 1988 and the deal for Charter One would be its 26th acquisition since then. 
Charter One has been viewed as a potential takeover target for months now.
Its stock price has fluctuated somewhat in recent days in advance of the announcement of the transaction, and closed Tuesday at $35.95. Shares rose 22 percent, reaching $44, in after-hours trading in response to news of the transaction, which was announced after the markets closed. 
"The stock has been disturbed over the last couple of days just on speculation that ultimately proved true," said Scott Siefers, an analyst who follows Charter One for Sandler O'Neill & Partners, a boutique New York investment bank that has provided investment services to Charter One in the past.
But, he added, "For this size institution, the rumors simply go around periodically."
Citizens will pay $44.50 in cash per Charter One share, or $10.5 billion, according to a statement released by Citizens.
The acquisition will give Citizens 616 branches in nine states; after the transaction Citizens will have more than 1,400 branches in 13 states and will hold nearly $129 million in assets. 
Charter One is an attractive franchise because of its strong retail network, analysts said.
Banks with significant consumer-oriented operations have increased allure in recent years as more and more bank customers have turned to them as a safe place to park money, despite low interest rates, because of fear of market declines. 
In addition, Mr. Siefers said, "A strong retail customer base offers you the opportunity to cross-sell different products."
"It opens up another interesting range of options for Citizens to maintain their strong growth momentum and it consolidates Citizens' position as one of the leading banks in the United States," Fred Goodwin, chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Those Friendly Iranians 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Iran 

 BODY:
Finally, I've found a pro-American country.
 Everywhere I've gone in Iran, with one exception, people have been exceptionally friendly and fulsome in their praise for the United States, and often for President Bush as well. Even when I was detained a couple of days ago in the city of Isfahan for asking a group of young people whether they thought the Islamic revolution had been a mistake (they did), the police were courteous and let me go after an apology. 
 They apologized; I didn't. 
On my first day in Tehran, I dropped by the "Den of Spies," as the old U.S. Embassy is now called. It's covered with ferocious murals denouncing America as the "Great Satan" and the "archvillain of nations" and showing the Statue of Liberty as a skull (tour the "Den of Spies" on the Web at www.nytimes.com/kristof).
Then I stopped to chat with one of the Revolutionary Guards now based in the complex. He was a young man who quickly confessed that his favorite movie is "Titanic." "If I could manage it, I'd go to America tomorrow," he said wistfully.
He paused and added, "To hell with the mullahs."
In the 1960's and 1970's, the U.S. spent millions backing a pro-Western modernizing shah -- and the result was an outpouring of venom that led to our diplomats' being held hostage. Since then, Iran has been ruled by mullahs who despise everything we stand for -- and now people stop me in the bazaar to offer paeans to America as well as George Bush.
Partly because being pro-American is a way to take a swipe at the Iranian regime, anything American, from blue jeans to "Baywatch," is revered. At the bookshops, Hillary Clinton gazes out from three different pirated editions of her autobiography.
'It's a best seller, though it's not selling as well as Harry Potter," said Heidar Danesh, a bookseller in Tehran. "The other best-selling authors are John Grisham, Sidney Sheldon, Danielle Steel." 
Young Iranians keep popping the question, "So how can I get to the U.S.?" I ask why they want to go to a nation denounced for its "disgustingly sick promiscuous behavior," but that turns out to be a main attraction. And many people don't believe a word of the Iranian propaganda.
"We've learned to interpret just the opposite of things on TV because it's all lies," said Odan Seyyid Ashrafi, a 20-year-old university student. "So if it says America is awful, maybe that means it's a great place to live."
Indeed, many Iranians seem convinced that the U.S. military ventures in Afghanistan and Iraq are going great, and they say this with more conviction than your average White House spokesman.
One opinion poll showed that 74 percent of Iranians want a dialogue with the U.S. -- and the finding so irritated the authorities that they arrested the pollster. Iran is also the only Muslim country I know where citizens responded to the 9/11 attacks with a spontaneous candlelight vigil as a show of sympathy.
Iran-U.S. relations are now headed for a crisis over Tehran's nuclear program, which appears to be so advanced that Iran could produce its first bomb by the end of next year. The Bush administration is right to address this issue, but it needs to step very carefully to keep from inflaming Iranian nationalism and uniting the population behind the regime. We need to lay out the evidence on satellite television programs that are broadcast into Iran, emphasizing that the regime is squandering money on a nuclear weapons program that will further isolate Iranians and damage their economy.
Left to its own devices, the Islamic revolution is headed for collapse, and there is a better chance of a strongly pro-American democratic government in Tehran in a decade than in Baghdad. The ayatollahs' best hope is that hard-liners in Washington will continue their inept diplomacy, creating a wave of Iranian nationalism that bolsters the regime -- as happened to a lesser degree after President Bush put Iran in the axis of evil.
Oh, that one instance when I was treated inhospitably? That was in a teahouse near the Isfahan bazaar, where I was interviewing religious conservatives. They were warm and friendly, but a group of people two tables away went out of their way to be rude, yelling at me for being an American propagandist. So I finally encountered hostility in Iran -- from a table full of young Europeans.

HEADLINE: Texas Leads Nation in Percentage of Uninsured Workers 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4 

 BODY:
Texas leads the nation in the percentage of working people who have no health insurance, but the lack of coverage is a pervasive problem for workers in nearly every state, according to a new study for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
 The study also found that being uninsured has clear health consequences. People without coverage were less likely to get basic preventive care, like mammograms; less likely to have a personal physician; and more likely to rate their own health as only poor or fair. 
 Analysts said the study highlighted deep problems in a health care system that still assumes most people will get their coverage through their employers. The shift of many workers from manufacturing to lower-paid service-sector jobs, and from bigger employers to smaller businesses, means this assumption is increasingly out of date, these analysts said. 
Many small businesses simply cannot afford to provide their workers with health insurance, which is now approaching an average cost of $9,000 a year for each employee, according to Kate Sullivan, director of health care policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce.
The study found that Texas, where 27 percent of working adults were uninsured, had the highest rate among the six states where at least one in five workers lacked coverage. The others were Louisiana, 23 percent; Mississippi and New Mexico, 22 percent each; and Oklahoma and Nevada, 21 percent each.
States with the lowest uninsured rates among workers were Minnesota and Hawaii, 7 percent each; Maryland, 8 percent; and Iowa, 9 percent.
Officials in Texas said that the higher rate in their state probably reflected its labor force -- more likely to work for small businesses, less likely to be unionized. They also said that the state was working on the problem.
The new study was sponsored by a broad nonpartisan coalition of labor, consumer and business groups, including the chamber, as part of "Cover the Uninsured Week," a nationwide series of events to be held May 10 through 16 to draw attention to the issue.
Many health care advocates hope the week spurs debate over health care in the presidential campaign, where there are stark differences between President Bush and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the presumed Democratic nominee.
Mr. Kerry has proposed a $650 billion, 10-year program that aims to provide health insurance to 96 percent of Americans, including nearly all children. He would give new assistance to the states to cover low-income children and adults. And he would try to lower insurance costs for everyone -- business and workers -- with a new federal program to subsidize the costs of the most expensive catastrophic cases.
"I think health care will be a very big issue in the campaign -- both the lack of coverage and the rising health care costs -- and Senator Kerry has a plan for both," said Sarah Bianchi, policy director at the Kerry campaign. While the number of uninsured people and the cost of health care have jumped under the Bush administration, she said, "they've done nothing."
The administration has a far more modest proposal -- a $70 billion, 10-year package of tax credits to help the uninsured buy coverage. But many analysts expect the Bush campaign to produce a more expansive plan in the heat of the campaign.
Asked about that speculation, Trent Duffy, a White House spokesman, replied, "The short answer is, stay tuned."
He added, "The president is always looking for new and innovative ways" to control costs and increase access to health insurance.
The new study was prepared for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation by researchers at the State Health Access Data Assistance Center at the University of Minnesota using data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In general, the study found sharp disparities among working Hispanic, black and white adults: 35 percent of working Hispanic adults were uninsured, compared with 18 percent of working blacks and 11 percent of working whites.
Bob Blendon, an expert at Harvard on public opinion, said that problems in the health care system were clearly registering with the voters. The issue ranks fourth when people are asked "the most important issues for government to address," behind the economy, the war and terrorism. 
Mr. Blendon added, "It would have been much more of a centerpiece in the election if we were not on Iraq and terrorism every night."

HEADLINE: Gaza Pullout Is Endorsed, With Proviso, By Envoys 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 4 

 BODY:
Senior envoys of the United States, Europe, Russia and the United Nations gave a qualified endorsement on Tuesday to the stated intention of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel to withdraw from Gaza and parts of the West Bank in spite of the rejection of that plan by his own Likud Party.
 But the envoys, who were meeting at the United Nations to try to revive peace negotiations in the Middle East, stopped short of outright approval of the Israeli withdrawal plans, instead emphasizing the need for Israel to negotiate with the Palestinians and not to confront them with unilateral steps. 
 The envoys said their group, known as the quartet, had taken "positive note of the announced intention" of the withdrawal schemes. 
"The quartet welcomes and encourages such a step, which should provide a rare moment of opportunity in the search for peace in the Middle East," their statement added. 
The statement also employed strong language in insisting that any future disposition of Israel's borders and the status of Palestinian refugees who want to return to Israel "must be mutually agreed to by Israelis and Palestinians" based on a host of previous United Nations resolutions calling on Israel to trade land for peace with the Arabs.
Some diplomats involved in drafting that part of the statement said it amounted almost to a reversal of the policy set forth by President Bush last month, in which he argued that it was a matter of political reality that Israel would not have to return to its pre-1967 borders or accept the return of Palestinian refugees in a final peace settlement.
American officials did not agree, however, though some acknowledged that the statement might assuage anti-American feelings in the Arab world growing out of President Bush's embrace of Israel and the situation in Iraq.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, representing the United States at the talks, insisted that the statement issued Tuesday was fully consistent with Mr. Bush's declaration to Mr. Sharon. He said the Bush statement, while recognizing certain political realities, also called for everything to be settled through negotiations.
In another significant shift of emphasis, the quartet's statement delivered a slap at Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, by calling for an "empowered" prime minister with whom to negotiate and reforms of Palestinian security and economic structures. Some diplomats even said that it amounted to an acceptance of Mr. Bush's refusal to deal with Mr. Arafat. 
The lengthy statement had been hammered out over the past week in what diplomats said was a crosscurrent of tensions between the Bush administration and its quartet partners.
President Bush endorsed the withdrawal scheme last month and his aides have been trying to get the other quartet partners to follow suit. But those partners balked because they charge that Israel is using the withdrawal as a substitute for negotiating with the Palestinians.
Accordingly, they demanded that the statement put out Tuesday include language suggesting that Israel had to continue negotiating with the Palestinians and that the withdrawal had to amount to a complete end to Israeli "occupation." This was a code word, diplomats said, for a warning to Israel that it should not try to maintain control over Gaza's air and sea access.
Beyond these concerns, Europeans, Russians and the United Nations are furious with Mr. Bush for having endorsed some of Israel's territorial claims last month. While the Bush administration regards that endorsement as a help to ensuring that the withdrawals go through, European and other diplomats charge the president was motivated by American domestic politics.
The irony on Tuesday was that, now that Europeans and United Nations have endorsed the notion of unilateral withdrawals, the withdrawal plan itself is in disarray.
"This is a gallant attempt to make the most of the Gaza withdrawal," said a diplomat involved in drafting the statement, adding that the meeting was an effort to "lock in" Mr. Sharon before he moved too far away from what he said he would do, after a referendum within his party last weekend that rejected the withdrawal plan. 
Secretary Powell, who along with his aides seemed preoccupied by the furor over the Abu Ghraib prison abuses, repeated at a news conference Tuesday his denunciation of the conduct of American soldiers, but officials who observed him at the meetings said he seemed glum.
In another sign of the disarray in the Bush administration, American officials said that there had been an abrupt policy reversal: it had been decided to placate King Abdullah II of Jordan by issuing a letter of reassurance on Israel on the occasion of his visit to the White House on Thursday. 
The king had wanted a letter promising that Palestinians deprived of homes or land in a final peace accord with Israel would be compensated. On Monday night, administration officials said the White House had refused. On Tuesday, after press reports of that rebuff, they said they were forced to change plans, but it was not sure what the letter would say.
American officials said that some of the language from the quartet's statement on Tuesday to the effect that Palestinian-Israeli issues would have to be settled in negotiations -- and not by fiat from Washington or anyplace else -- might find its way into the letter.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: WORLD REACTION; 
Revulsion at Prison Abuse Provokes Scorn for the U.S.

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
Across the Arab world and beyond, the tormenting of Iraqi prisoners by their American guards shredded already thin support for Washington's invasion of Iraq and its vow to install democratic values and respect for human rights.
 The outrage over the abuse shown in pictures splashed across front pages and television screens drew emotional comparisons asking how the American occupation of the country could be distinguished from the way Saddam Hussein's government oppressed ordinary Iraqis. 
 A few commentators in the Middle East criticized what they called an element of hypocrisy in the reaction, since virtually no voices were raised during decades of torture in Iraqi prisons or elsewhere. But more commonly the images seemed to feed existing deep anger at the United States because it had promised that it would be better. 
"The United States already had very little credibility in the Middle East, and it is now approaching zero," said Abdelmonem Said, the director of Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo.
"What remains of the American logic for being in Iraq?" he asked. "If we start with the issue of weapons of mass destruction, there are no weapons of mass destruction. 
"There was talk about fighting terrorism, and they brought terrorism with them. Finally, the issue of democracy and respect for human rights: Saddam was a butcher who tortured people; now the United States is torturing people."
Even conduits for the Egyptian government's views, normally somewhat circumspect in taking direct potshots at the American administration except as regards its support for Israel, said the abuses confirmed that Washington had been lying when it said toppling Mr. Hussein was in the best interest of the Iraqis.
"The fact is that the behavior of these soldiers is totally in line with the mission for which they came to Iraq to begin with," the semiofficial daily Al Ahram editorialized, charging that Washington's real goals were "to invade this major Arab country, destroy its economic and military capabilities, tear up its state as a service to Israeli interests, control its enormous oil wealth and eliminate anything that might hinder these aims, whether coming from the army, the people or the armed national resistance."
Such reactions were not limited to the Arab world. Overall the treatment of the prisoners was seen as a vivid example of the chaos enveloping the entire enterprise. In France, where most people had opposed the war as misguided, some commentators could barely contain their sense of vindication.
Le Monde ran a front-page cartoon yesterday showing an American military boot crushing the head of an Iraqi while its owner told him, "Repeat after me: DE-MO-CRA-CY!" 
Some saw the episode as an extension of the United States exempting itself from international rules, for instance refusing to recognize the 600 detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as prisoners of war. "Countries like America that exempt themselves from international rules are vulnerable to such excesses," wrote Joseph Limagne in Ouest-France, the country's most popular daily.
A German paper, Die Welt, said it seemed to be yet another example of the problems in controlling Iraq arising because senior officials like Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld were determined to prove that it could be done with a minimum number of soldiers.
In Iraq, the Governing Council demanded that Iraqis gain a role in running the prisons and that Iraqi judges be included in investigating the abuses. "They should let the ministries here have free access to those prisons as well as human rights organizations," said Mahmoud Othman, a member of the council.
Small repercussions were already noticeable. At the United Nations, when the United States walked out of a vote for the organization's human rights agency, protesting the re-election of Sudan to the agency, the Sudanese ambassador fired back by accusing the Americans of ignoring the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners.
Some predicted a more dire reaction. "In the minds of many this may well justify attacks against Americans or other Westerners," said an American official in the Middle East.
A few remarked that focusing criticism solely on Washington was sheer hypocrisy, considering the history of torture in Arab jails.
Writing in the daily Al Bayan in the United Arab Emirates, Ahmad Amorabi said the United States probably expected to get away with such horrible abuse because Arabs had long been passive about torture.
"Who will take pictures of the even more hideous practices in the Arab world's prisons where thousands upon thousands of prisoners of conscience have been tortured for many years while we, the millions of Arabs outside the prisons, pretend to neither see nor hear?" he wrote.
Analysts expressed the belief that the fallout from the pictures would not just undermine the credibility of the United States, but that of local rights groups and individuals pushing Western democratic systems.
"Eventually the images will fade away, but it will be very difficult for the U.S. to preach democracy and freedom and respect for human rights," said Dr. Mohamed Kamal, an American-educated professor of political science at Cairo University.
That certainly seemed to be the reaction in the street.
"They do not respect us," said Mervat Ali, an Egyptian government employee. "They do not respect Islam or our humanity or values."
"Is this the democracy they are talking about?" she said. "To rape the Iraqis?"
Some papers made even nastier allegations than those reported in the American press. The opposition daily Al Wafd in Cairo published a front-page picture that it said showed the gang rape of an Iraqi woman by United States soldiers. Its authenticity could not be verified, and Al Wafd did not disclose its source.
Many commentators suggested that public trials were the only way to assuage widespread anger.
"If the U.S. seriously puts on trial, court-martials and punishes those from the highest to the lowest ranks, and thus shows the world that it is taking this seriously, this will get people to look beyond the photographs," said Mona Eltahawy, a columnist for the pan-Arab daily Al Sharq al Awsat.
She did note that President Bush has asked the world not to judge his countrymen on thedebased acts of a few. "That's what we said after 9/11," she said. "Don't judge the intentions of the Muslim world by the crazed, deranged acts of a few."

HEADLINE: German Security Plan Falters as Qaeda Suspect Faces Trial 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 4 

 BODY:
Even as the long-awaited terrorism trial of an accused operative of Al Qaeda opened in Berlin on Tuesday, a two-year effort by this country to make it easier to imprison or expel suspected supporters of Islamic terrorism seemed to collapse because of opposition from one of the junior partners in the government coalition. 
 The impasse, which has created a crisis for the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, dealt a sharp blow to German efforts to enact tougher security regulations in the wake ofthe Sept. 11 attacks, which were largely carried out by Muslim extremists living in Germany. 
 Prosecutors outlined their case on Tuesday against Ishan Garnaoui, 33, a Tunisian-born man who was arrested in March last year. He is accused of having attended a Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan in 2001 and, beginning in 2003, of organizing and training a group of Muslims at a Berlin mosque to carry out a series of bomb attacks against Jewish and American targets in Germany to coincide with the start of the American invasion of Iraq. 
 The indictment, which was read in court on Wednesday, said Mr. Garnaoui frequented Al Nur Mosque in Berlin, long believed by the police to be a center for Islamic militants. Police records are expected to show that the mosque was largely financed by a Saudi charity, known as the Haramain Foundation, long a focus of investigations in the United States and other countries. 
 The police records indicate that a diplomat at the Saudi Embassy in Berlin, Muhammad J. Fakihi, was a frequent visitor to the mosque and transferred money to it. Mr. Fakihi, who was director of the Islamic Affairs Department for the embassy, left the country last year after the German authorities raised questions about his possible support of Mr. Garnaoui and other Muslim militants. 
 According to the indictment, Mr. Garnaoui returned to Germany from Afghanistan in January 2003 with orders from Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, to carry out bomb attacks. He began recruiting Arab students and asylum seekers at Al Nur Mosque in the working-class neighborhood of Neukolln, setting up a sports club at the mosque, the indictment says. But the club's sessions were said to be classes in the concept of jihad, or Islamic holy war, and occasions for training in bomb-making and weapons use.
 On Tuesday, however, defense lawyers disputed the prosecution's contention that Mr. Garnaoui ever received training at a Qaeda camp in Afghanistan or became involved in terrorism in Germany.
 Almost simultaneously with the reading of the indictment against Mr. Garnaoui, the long effort to negotiate a new immigration law was abandoned by the Green Party, the main coalition partner in Mr. Schroder's government, party leaders said. The goal of the new legislation was to change German immigration laws, which block citizens of countries that do not belong to the European Union from coming here to work while making it very difficult to expel people who come illegally or who claim political asylum -- including those suspected of supporting terrorism.
 The German interior minister, Otto Schily, has expressed strong support for new measures, saying in recent interviews that the German police needed ways to deal with people who present what he called "a massive threat" to Germany.
 Mr. Schily caused a stir when he told a German magazine, Der Spiegel, last week that in cases in which there was a direct danger of terrorism it should be possible to take a suspect into preventive custody, or, under extreme circumstances, to carry out assassinations.
 "Is there not a right of self-defense against terrorists who plan mass murder?" he asked. "That leads to the question whether in extreme cases it is justified to kill that person in self-defense." 
 But in pressing for new legislation, the government ran into opposition on almost every front, from conservatives who wanted stronger security measures to Social Democrats who feared opening the doors to new immigration at a time of high unemployment. The Greens worried, among other things, that the regulations allowing easier detentions or expulsions of terror suspects would subvert Germany's civil rights protections. 
 Negotiations among the parties seemed to collapse Tuesday when the Greens announced there was no point in continuing them. "The game is over," Reinhard Butikofer, the party chairman, said. "Further discussions don't make sense."
 In addition to being blocked in its efforts to change the immigration law, the government has been frustrated by the outcome of recent terrorism trials, specifically those of two men accused of complicity in the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 One of the men, Abdelghani Mzoudi, was acquitted when the United States refused to make intelligence information available to the court in Hamburg that had been trying him. The earlier conviction of another defendant, Mounir el-Motassadeq, a former roommate of the Sept. 11 ringleader, Mohamed Atta, was overturned on roughly the same grounds.
 Mr. Schily has been reported by the German press to be furious that, under current law, neither man can be expelled from Germany and that both men have continued to live here. Mr. Motassadeq is suing the government for the right to resume his university studies in Hamburg.

HEADLINE: Arena Developer Rethinking Condemnation of Houses 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Building a glittering new Nets arena over the Atlantic Avenue railyards in Brooklyn may not require condemning more than 100 residences through eminent domain after all, an executive behind the arena proposal said yesterday.
 "We're working diligently to substantially reduce the amount of residential condemnation and eminent domain that will be part of this project," James Stuckey, executive vice president of the developer, Forest City Ratner, said at a hearing of the City Council's Committee on Economic Development. "We're looking at how we can reshape the plan, we're talking with residents and we are looking at how we can substantially reduce and possibly eliminate the need for residential condemnation." 
 The whole project is roughly bounded by Atlantic, Vanderbilt and Flatbush Avenues and Dean Street. 
The proposed development, which would bring a Frank Gehry-designed arena along with 4,500 residential units and four office towers to the crossroads of Prospect Heights, Fort Greene and Downtown Brooklyn, has been hotly debated since it became public last December.
Proponents, who include Bloomberg administration officials and labor leaders, say that the project will provide jobs, reasonably priced housing, cachet, tourism and other economic activity. Opponents say it will worsen traffic, ruin the hard-won character of revitalized neighborhoods and bring only transient jobs or those paying minimum wage.
But the reliance on eminent domain, a tool long used by government to acquire land for public projects, has been perhaps the most controversial element, conjuring images of ordinary Brooklynites being tossed from their homes by a developer. 
The original proposal would have required the state to condemn property around the railyards that now includes about 140 residences and 25 businesses employing roughly 200 people, according to a Forest City Ratner spokesman. (Forest City Ratner is the New York Times Company's partner in developing the new Times headquarters on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, in part through the use of eminent domain.)
"We object to the use of eminent domain to condemn the private property of residents and business owners of Prospect Heights for the benefit of one private developer, especially when that developer owns property adjacent to the proposed condemnation site which could be used for the proposed development," Norman Siegel, a lawyer for a group called Develop Don't Destroy, said in testimony submitted to the Council. 
Some opponents of the Atlantic Yards plan have suggested putting the arena at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, but Mr. Stuckey countered that only the Atlantic Avenue area had sufficient space and access to transportation to be feasible for the stadium as well as the planned office towers and residences.
After the hearing, Mr. Stuckey declined to elaborate on how the company planned to avoid condemnations, but said that it was considering redrawing the physical outlines of the plan and offering generous buyouts to property owners. "We think that there's a win here, that we can do this project, create these jobs, create this housing and do it in a way where we don't have to condemn people's homes as well," he said.
Still, the hearing appeared to do little to assuage concerns over jobs, housing and financing for the project among the council members, who do not have much power over the process because it is likely to be controlled by the state.
Andrew M. Alper, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, told the Council that it was too early to know precisely how much the city would contribute to the project, or in what form, but that the cost of the city's contribution would be less than the projected revenues from moving the Nets to New York and from the arena itself.
But for some council members, the talk of projected jobs and low-cost housing in the absence of hard numbers and concrete assurances was not enough. Letitia James, who represents Fort Greene, said that she had been at the Ingersoll and Whitman public housing projects over the weekend, where, she said, unemployment still hovers near 75 percent, as it did when Forest City Ratner built the Metrotech development nearby.
"Do you know how many dreams that I saw standing at Ingersoll-Whitman, dreams that were deferred and destroyed?" she said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 27, 2006

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in The Arts on Tuesday about Frank Gehry's design for the first phase of the Grand Avenue development project in Los Angeles misstated the location of the proposed Atlantic Yards project that Mr. Gehry is designing in Brooklyn. (The error also appeared in sports articles on Feb. 9 and April 11, in the City section on Jan. 15 and in several articles in 2003, 2004 and 2005.) It is on rail yards and other land in Prospect Heights and on a block in Park Slope; it is not in Downtown Brooklyn, although it is near that neighborhood.

HEADLINE: Picasso Work From Rose Period Sets Auction Record for a Painting

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
A rare Picasso, painted when the artist was just 24, became the most expensive painting ever sold at auction when an anonymous buyer purchased it for $104.1 million last night at Sotheby's.
 The price paid for ''Boy With a Pipe (The Young Apprentice),'' a 1905 work from Picasso's Rose Period, eclipsed the previous record for a painting, set in 1990 when van Gogh's ''Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' was sold at Christie's in New York for $82.5 million. The Picasso was one of 34 works auctioned last night from the famed Whitney collection in a sale that totaled $189.8 million, far above the high estimate of $157 million. Of the 34 lots, all but two found buyers. Proceeds from the sale go to the Greentree Foundation, established by the Whitney family to promote international cooperation. 
 The winning bidder was Warren P. Weitman Jr., chairman of Sotheby's in North America, who was standing in the salesroom either taking cues from someone in the audience or simply following a client's instructions. The auction house would say only that the buyer wished to remain anonymous.
 Four serious bidders competed for the painting up to the $75 million point. Then bidding slowed until Larry Gagosian, the Manhattan dealer, who was talking on a cellphone, jumped in at $80 million.
 Ever since Sotheby's announced the sale in January, many dealers had been saying that the Picasso could well become the most expensive painting in history (though, adjusted for inflation, the 1990 price of ''Dr. Gachet'' would be more than $116 million in 2003 dollars). Sotheby's had estimated the Picasso would bring at least $70 million.
 (Final prices include Sotheby's commission: 20 percent of the first $100,000 and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
 Speculation about the buyer began the minute the gavel went down. Possible buyers, dealers said, included Lily Safra, the widow of the billionaire banker Edmond J. Safra; Stephen Cohen, the Manhattan hedge fund manager, who has been one of the most important buyers recently; Stephen A. Wynn, the casino owner; the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles; the financier Henry R. Kravis; and Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft.
 More than 1,000 people packed Sotheby's York Avenue headquarters to watch what many in the art world had been predicting would be the sale of the decade: 34 paintings and drawings from one of the last great American collections still in private hands. It was formed by two generations: Payne and Helen Hay Whitney, heirs to a fortune made from oil, tobacco, street railways and real estate, and their son John Hay Whitney, the sportsman, financier, publisher and ambassador to Britain, and his wife, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney.
 During their 46-year marriage, John Hay Whitney, who died in 1982, and his wife, a New York socialite and philanthropist who died in 1998, amassed one of the world's most important art collections, rivaled only by those of the Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos and, in the United States, the Havemeyers, who were among the first collectors of French Impressionist art, and Walter H. Annenberg, another former ambassador to Britain. Like the Havemeyers and the Annenbergs, the Whitneys gave generously to museums. When Mrs. Whitney died, she left art worth more than $300 million to four museums: the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, and the National Gallery of Art and the National Portrait Gallery in Washington.
 The Picasso depicts an adolescent boy known as ''P'tit Louis,'' who hung around the artist's studio in Paris, holding a pipe in his left hand and wearing a garland of roses on his head. In the background are two large bouquets. Some art historians believe Picasso added the garland toward the end of the painting, transforming the boy from a moody teenager in blue overalls to a haunting, deitylike figure. The Picasso wasn't the only important painting up for sale last night, but it was the only one to bring a staggering price.
 The Whitneys also owned some of the country's greatest race horses, and that passion was reflected in the art they bought. Manet's ''Races at the Bois de Boulogne'' (1872), a scene of spectators watching a horse race at Longchamps, with the artist's friend Degas in the lower righthand corner, went to an unidentified telephone buyer for $26.3 million. Whitney bought the painting at Knoedler, the Manhattan gallery, in 1936 for $70,000 and $7,000 sales tax. Five bidders competed for the painting, estimated at $20 million to $30 million.
 Other paintings with an equestrian theme also did well. Five people wanted to buy ''The Red Prince Mare,'' a 1921 equestrian scene by Sir Alfred J. Munnings. Sotheby's thought the image of a mare held by her groom would fetch $400,000 to $600,000. It brought a record for the artist when an unidentified telephone bidder paid $7.8 million.
 Another telephone bidder bought Picasso's ''Tomato Plant,'' one of nine canvases of potted tomato plants executed in 1944. It brought $6.8 million, far above its $4 million high estimate.
 Several dealers tried to buy Braque's ''Bottle and Glass,'' a still life from 1910-11. Angela Neville, a London dealer, ended up buying the oval painting for $1.9 million, above the high $1.6 million estimate.
 One painting that ignited a bidding battle was ''The Good and Evil Angels Struggling for Possession of a Child,'' a hand-colored monotype by William Blake. Four telephone bidders and three in the room bid earnestly, and it sold to a telephone buyer for $3.9 million, more than double its $1.5 million high estimate and a record for the artist.
 While prices were strong throughout the evening, some dealers in the audience were surprised that there wasn't more Whitney fever. ''There was no mass hysteria,'' said James Roundell, a London dealer. ''The big price of the Picasso didn't affect the rest. Maybe people are wiser with their money.''
 But at the end of the evening, all that people were willing to talk about was ''Boy With a Pipe.''
 John Richardson, the Picasso biographer, was watching the evening's results with particular interest. ''It's very beautiful, very pleasing, very poetic and very lyrical,'' he said. ''But it's not one of my top 20 favorite Picassos.''
 Asked what he thought of the price, Mr. Richardson answered, without missing a beat, ''I don't think any painting in the world is worth $100 million.''

HEADLINE: Inflation-Wary Investors Get 2 More Treasury Bond Choices

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
With inflationary expectations on the rise in financial markets, the Treasury Department announced a major expansion yesterday in its issuance of inflation-protected securities.
 The Treasury will begin issuing a 20-year Treasury Inflation Protected Security, or TIPS, in July and a five-year TIPS in October. They will join the 10-year TIPS currently being sold. 
 The Treasury also said yesterday that it was considering reducing the volume of regular 10-year Treasury notes to make way for the new TIPS, and because deficit projections are shrinking. Based on the government's projected borrowing for this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the deficit could be about $100 billion less than the Bush administration's initial $521 billion forecast.
 TIPS pay a set interest rate based on principal, which is adjusted upward for inflation or downward for deflation. But the face value of the bond is guaranteed if it is held to maturity. Inflation adjustments are based on the Consumer Price Index.
 The TIPS announcement caps an effort by the Treasury to revive the program which started in 1997 but faltered when the original five-year TIPS were dropped in 1997 and the 30-year TIPS ended in 2001.
 Sales of TIPS, which totaled about $30 billion last year, could quickly swell to near $70 billion a year, according to analysts. There are about $200 billion TIPS in circulation. The Treasury did not say how large the sales of the new inflation-protected securities would be. 
 An increase in inflation would make TIPS more attractive to investors. Both the Consumer Price Index and the core index, which excludes food and energy, have begun to rise recently, year over year, from levels that were near the lowest in 30 years. Some analysts have argued that Federal Reserve policy makers are not moving quickly enough to raise interest rates to curb inflation.
 Dan Bernstein, director of research at Bridgewater Associates, which manages about $8 billion in inflation-indexed securities, said that while the 10-year TIPS is no longer at its most attractive price, it is still fairly valued compared with long-term inflation expectations.
 Mr. Bernstein said that if the C.P.I. rises at about a 2.6 percent annual rate for the life of the note, the return on the 10-year TIPS at its current price will match that of the nominal 10-year note. If inflation is higher, the return on the TIPS will be higher.
 Mr. Bernstein said that the Treasury, by issuing two new TIPS, has been more aggressive than he had expected. He said that big institutional investors, who have been waiting for the TIPS market to become bigger before they jumped in, now can see that it will.
 ''The ramping up of supply will not damage the market because demand will pick up the new supply,'' he said.
 In fact, the price of the 10-year TIPS rose 3/32, to 98 21/32, yesterday while prices in the nominal Treasury market fell. 
 For the nominal 10-year note, the price fell 5/32 to 95 14/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.58 percent, from 4.56 percent. New data showed that the service sector of the economy was growing strongly. The recent high for the 10-year note was 4.60 percent in September last year.
 Both the 5-year and the 20-year TIPS will be sold semiannually. The first 20-year TIPS will be issued in July, with second and third installments of the same security to be issued in January and July 2005. 
 The first 5-year TIPS will be sold in October, with a second and third installment in April and October 2005.

HEADLINE: For Technology, No Small World After All

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ERARD

 BODY:
OVER the last two years, Genevieve Bell, an anthropologist employed by Intel Research, has visited 100 households in 19 cities in seven countries in Asia and the Pacific to study how people use technology. Twenty gigabytes of digital photos later -- along with 206,000 air miles, 19 field notebooks, two camera batteries, five umbrellas, three hats, two doses of antimalarial drugs and one pair of her favorite sandals -- she has come back with some provocative questions about technology, culture and design.
 Some of what she learned in the field will be folded into Intel's design process, passed on to industrial designers and engineers and perhaps eventually embodied in a device. But many of Dr. Bell's findings also raise deep questions about the meaning of technology in an interconnected world. 
 Her fieldwork project began four years ago with the insight that Intel might have a misconception about the potential users of its products elsewhere in the world. ''We thought, there's a group of people just like us all over the world who will buy the technology and have it fill the same values in their lives,'' Dr. Bell said. ''I was fairly certain that wasn't going to be the case. I'm an anthropologist. Culture matters.'' 
 Dr. Bell, 37, who received her Ph.D. in anthropology from Stanford with a dissertation on American Indian boarding schools, joined Intel in 1998. She is working on a book for M.I.T. Press about her Asian research. 
 Her project sent her to seven countries: India, China, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea, and Australia. She found that in some places, ''it's harder for some forms of technology to get over the threshold of the home'' -- not simply for economic reasons but for religious ones as well. 
 For example, she said, values of humility and simplicity may make technology less welcome in some Hindu homes in India or some Muslim homes in Malaysia and Indonesia. ''If part of the value of the home is this space of purity that's protected from the pollutedness of the world, a place where you express values like simplicity, humility, modesty, grace,'' Dr. Bell said, ''that becomes a barrier to adopting some technologies.''
 She also pointed out that most American homes have space for leisure activities, and often that space is private. By contrast, Japan's tighter quarters afford little privacy, which may account for the attraction of young people there to text-messaging over mobile phones. 
 Even the reliability of power may be an American assumption to be overcome: in Malaysia, power surges caused by monsoons can fry computer motherboards.
 Such insights challenged Intel's vision of a world of ''smart homes'' and a chip-driven lifestyle, Dr. Bell said, which assumes that users are secular. In those visions, there's no point at which residents stop to pray, visit a church, or have a moment of internal reflection. All this prompted her to ask David Tanenhaus, Intel's vice president of research: ''What if our vision of ubiquitous computing is so secular, so profoundly embedded in a set of Western discourses, that we've created a vision of the world that shuts out a percentage of people in a way we can't really even begin to articulate?''
 Intel is not alone in wanting to know more about values and habits in emerging markets. ''Over the last 18 months we've seen more interest in doing international and intercultural research in design for products,'' says Mike Kuniavsky, a principal with Adaptive Path, a San Francisco-based consulting firm that works with international clients like Peoplesoft, a major business-software company.
 For instance, the Korean electronics company LGE has introduced a mobile phone with an embedded compass to allow Muslim users to locate the direction of Mecca using Global Positioning System technology. Myung Whoon Lee, a senior LGE designer, said the company sought to design something ''whose concept is reflected in the situation or culture of its actual place.'' 
 In the past, marketing teams might have been given the task of making a product cross-culturally palatable. Increasingly, however, culture is taken into account earlier, at the design stage. 
 For its part, Intel relies on a cycle of design that begins with high-level prognostication about potential markets. Then ethnographers like Dr. Bell and market researchers are sent to meet those people. The resulting information is incorporated into portraits of individual users. These portraits, called personas, describe a person's life.
 ''This personifies something that otherwise looks like an aggregate of people,'' explained Herman D'Hooge, Intel's innovation strategist, who is in charge of acting on insights like Dr. Bell's.
 One such ''persona'' that Dr. Bell produced in China describes ''Sally Lu,'' a 25-year-old woman living in Shanghai -- a day in her life, her activities and concerns, her attitudes about technology. ''She thinks that new high-tech products must not be too expensive, and the functions don't need to be too fancy,'' like cellphones with video screens, the document says. ''As long as it fulfills basic functions and is easy to operate, people will like it and buy it.'' 
 These personas become tools to help industrial designers and engineers understand how users think about products. The challenge, Mr. D'Hooge said, is to keep the element of innovation open for as long as possible in this process. By understanding their users, they hope to produce radically innovative concept devices for little risk.
 For Intel, a first iteration of this user-centered design cycle yielded a combination PC-entertainment center for use by people in small living spaces, while the second resulted in a PC-like device intended for Chinese users who could not afford a full-size machine. (This concept device has not yet been released.)
 Dr. Bell recognizes that translating her ideas into products is difficult. 
 ''These things are interesting as a design brief,'' she said. ''They're really hard as a product challenge.'' She said that technology companies like Intel should nevertheless be willing to consider information that challenges the grander visions of technology. This involves challenging some Western cultural assumptions about digital technology.
 ''I think I would like to imagine that I am doing the thing that all anthropologists do,'' she said, ''asking these harder questions about what is real and true.''

HEADLINE: An A for Effort to Restore Meaning to the Grade

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J. 

 BODY:
FOR a brainy young girl who started college about 40 years ago, one whose hobby was solving complicated math problems mailed to her by her accountant grandfather from Newark, there was the inevitable shock of measuring up to rigorous academic standards.
 ''I remember getting a D on a paper freshman year,'' said Nancy Weiss Malkiel, 60, as she sat on a couch in her office at Princeton University. ''I did not get more A's than B's until my senior year.''
 But time has been kind, or perhaps in some ways unkind, to students in the intervening decades. The tough grading that was a part of Dean Malkiel's education at Smith College, where she graduated summa cum laude, has given way to more generous appraisals. An A is not, at least in Dean Malkiel's view, an A anymore, or at least it wasn't on the Princeton campus until now. 
 ''This is part of inflationary patterns of evaluation in the larger culture,'' she said. ''It is the Lake Wobegon effect and it is pervasive. When students get the same grade for outstanding work that they get for good work, they are not motivated to do their best.''
 A recent Princeton study found that 44 to 55 percent of all grades were A's at Ivy League schools, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford and the University of Chicago. Princeton students get A's half the time, a jump from the early 1990's when they got A's just over a third of the time. 
 The faculty voted last week to reduce the number of A's awarded to students to 35 percent, although the proposal speaks of an ''expectation'' rather than a ''limit.'' The new guidelines will be start to be implemented this fall; all of the proposal's provisions will take three years to phase in. The plan, already lauded by officials from other colleges and universities, is expected to become a model.
 ''We contacted admissions deans at graduate and professional schools and employers and administrators of national fellowship competitions to make sure our students would not be hurt by this decision,'' Dean Malkiel said. ''They said that if we made plain what we were doing they would understand Princeton grades in the context of our new grading policy. They would know that a Princeton A was a real A in contrast to more inflated A's at some of our peer institutions.'' 
 As dean of the college, she is in charge of undergraduate education at Princeton. It is a job she has held for 17 years, the last two accompanied by her dog Skipper, whose numerous stuffed animals lay on a couch and in a basket under the dean's desk. She walks with Skipper to work, takes Skipper out for a midmorning stroll on the green lawns outside, and at the end of the day walks Skipper home. 
 ''I brought Skipper to my office when she was 12 weeks old,'' she said. ''It was meant to be a temporary arrangement, just until she was old enough to stay home. But everyone adopted her. She is the building's morale booster.''
 She thought of becoming a journalist. She went to Harvard to do her history doctorate and spent a summer, one her academic advisers viewed as frivolous, working as an intern at The Washington Post.
 ''It taught me the limitations of newspapers as historical sources,'' she said. 
 She fell unexpectedly, she said, into the job at Princeton.
 ''In those days when a position was open, faculty called faculty at other universities to see if they had any students who could fill a position,'' she said. ''My advisor recommended me although Princeton at the time had only one woman faculty member in the professorial ranks. He told me it would do Princeton good to have to at least consider me for the position.''
 Dean Malkiel, who did her doctoral work on the National Urban League, arrived at Princeton in the fall of 1969. She was the first woman to be hired in the history department. Her arrival coincided with the integration of women into the student body, something many Princeton alumni had fought to hard prevent.
 ''The university was undergoing tremendous change,'' she said. ''I was a curiosity. Male students would invite me to the eating clubs, and of course I was not a lot older than the students themselves. It was assumed I was a date. It became a little awkward once the other students realized I was a faculty member.''
 SHE taught and published, including a biography of the civil rights leader Whitney Young, before going into administration. 
 The rising tide of A's long unsettled her. She began six years ago, as the head of the Faculty Committee on Examinations and Standing, to collect data for the last 25 years on grade inflation and present it to the faculty.
 She has moved from the small apartment she had as a junior faculty member to a more imposing residence with her husband, the Princeton economics professor Burton G. Malkiel. They were married in 1988, ''rather late in life'' she concedes.
 She sees the curbing of grade inflation, however, as ''a small part of several major initiatives to strengthen undergraduate education at Princeton.''
 She has introduced a new freshman writing program, created diverse freshman seminars on topics such as the spy novel and bioethics and revised general education requirements to include ethical thought, moral values and quantitative reasoning.
 ''I want Princeton undergraduates,'' she said, ''to combine high intelligence, critical judgment and moral sensibility to make a difference in the world.''

HEADLINE: Pataki Backs New Tunnel Under the East River

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki threw his political weight yesterday behind a plan to dig a new tunnel under the East River as part of a $6 billion rail link from downtown to Kennedy Airport and points east along the Long Island Rail Road.
 Mr. Pataki said the rail link would offer travelers a ''one-seat ride to their terminal at J.F.K. in just 36 minutes'' from Lower Manhattan. As an economic and political matter, the link would be even more important as the downtown gateway for up to 100,000 Long Island commuters, greatly expanding the capacity of businesses in the financial district to attract suburban workers who now live at least two train rides away. 
 In his semiannual progress report on Lower Manhattan, the governor set July 4 for groundbreaking at the 1,776-foot Freedom Tower at the World Trade Center site. He said he and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg would create a Lower Manhattan construction command center next month to lessen what is sure to be a decade's worth of disruption.
 Mr. Pataki told the Association for a Better New York in a lunchtime speech at the Ritz-Carlton New York in Battery Park City that the design of the new Fulton Street Transit Center would be unveiled May 26, that a pedestrian promenade would be constructed along West Street and that he hoped that a downtown community center could be created under the operation of the 92nd Street Y.
 The governor then joined the developer Larry A. Silverstein for a tour of the 13th floor of 7 World Trade Center, which Mr. Silverstein is now building across Vesey Street from ground zero. It amounted to a demonstration of solidarity 219 feet in the sky.
 Mr. Silverstein has lost a series of legal battles with his insurers that have reduced by about a third the $7.1 billion he had hoped to receive on the main trade center site, where he holds a 99-year lease. His setbacks have raised doubts about his ability to complete all six trade center office buildings.
 But the governor said, ''Larry's been a great partner from the beginning.'' 
 Barely audible over the din of work on the open steel structure, Mr. Pataki continued: ''We're not going to let the vagaries and uncertainties of the court litigation process determine the future of the site. We're going to continue to move forward.''
 Mr. Silverstein added, ''With the governor by my side, we'll get this done.'' He also allowed that it would take a ''feat of financial engineering.''
 The highlight of the governor's speech was his embrace of a proposal for a new tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn to link Long Island and the city. An alternative being studied by state officials would be to use the existing Montague Street subway tunnel, through which M and R trains run. 
 Under the project favored by the governor, to be completed in 2013, travelers headed downtown from Kennedy would begin their journey on the existing AirTrain tracks that loop around the central terminal area and then along a viaduct in the middle of the Van Wyck Expressway to Jamaica, Queens.
 There, a new 1,500-foot elevated connector would carry the train from the AirTrain tracks to the existing tracks of the L.I.R.R. Atlantic Branch, permitting the journey to continue almost as far as Atlantic Terminal on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn.
 Just shy of the existing Atlantic Terminal, and joined to it through a new underground station, the three-mile tunnel would begin. It would burrow under Brooklyn and the East River into Lower Manhattan about 100 feet below ground. The tunnel would come close to Hanover Square, the intended terminus of the Second Avenue subway, and the World Trade Center, the existing terminus of the E train.
 ''The boring of this tunnel will create the capacity to extend additional rail lines -- such as the Second Avenue subway and existing services such as the E train -- across the East River from their endpoints in Lower Manhattan to Brooklyn and beyond,'' Mr. Pataki said.
 Holding out something for subway riders whose journeys begin and end in Manhattan or the Bronx, the governor said that direct Long Island Rail Road service to downtown would reduce congestion on the No. 2 and No. 3 lines between Pennsylvania Station and the financial district.
 Mr. Pataki said that both the new tunnel and the Montague Street tunnel options would be thoroughly analyzed in an environmental review process beginning this summer and that by the time the review was finished, ''we will have secured the financing necessary to begin construction.''
 That would include at least $560 million from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; unspecified amounts from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, through its federal community development block grant, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority; and what may be as much as $2.5 billion in unused tax credits from the federal relief package for New York.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, who told the Regional Plan Association last month that he would fight to obtain transportation financing from unused tax benefits, said yesterday that he thought the cost estimates for the tunnel projects were high.
 The association itself withheld an endorsement until there are more details but did say in a statement, ''We are gratified that the favored alternative will utilize a new tunnel and not impact subway riders or existing service.''
 The New York Public Interest Research Group Straphangers Campaign said the new tunnel ''makes sense only if it moves enough riders to be worth its high price tag'' and called the ridership projections ''weak or questionable.'' 
 The Labor Community Advocacy Network to Rebuild New York said community development grants intended to create jobs and housing ''should not be sucked into a tunnel that, if it makes sense at all, needs a real comprehensive financing plan.''
 Mayor Bloomberg endorsed the idea of a new tunnel in December 2002. ''To make Lower Manhattan a global center,'' he said at the time, ''our first priority must be direct, one-seat airport access.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey Guardrails Glamorous for Metal Thieves

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 5 

 BODY:
In all the miles of roadway in this state, and all the jokes about them, no one saw this coming.
 Unfortunately for state and local officials, no one saw anything going, either, and that makes this a bit of a mystery, as well as a madcap moment in the movie comedy starring the state of New Jersey.
 The mystery involves guardrails. Several miles of them. The aluminum rails have been disappearing in the dead of night on such heavily traveled highways as I-80, I-78 and State Routes 46 and 19. 
 The disappearances, which were first reported on Wednesday in The Record of Hackensack, have been noted from Paterson to Irvington. Aluminum facing has been painstakingly removed and the bolts holding it to posts sawed off, leaving stretches of stumplike posts lining the roads.
 Why, say the experts, is understandable. It's a little bit of chaos theory and the so-called butterfly effect meeting Adam Smith's invisible hand, say state transportation officials and scrap metal experts.
 They say that the explosive growth of the Chinese economy has made that country the No. 1 importer of scrap metal from the United States, meaning local dealers in scrap aluminum can get double their old rate for the metal and three times what scrap steel commands. ''The collection system has kicked into high gear'' to cash in and meet the demand, said Christopher Plummer, managing director of Metal Strategies, a consulting firm.
 ''But this is happening all over the world, from Russia to the Ukraine to Australia, and especially in poorer third-world countries,'' said Mr. Plummer. ''When it gets to the point of outright theft, then you can imagine the profits to be made.''
 But the thieves' profits are the State of New Jersey's loss, and raise concerns about serious accidents or even deaths. The state transportation commissioner, Jack Lettiere, said yesterday that his agency had begun replacing some of the stolen railings with steel railings, which are not quite as precious in the scrap metal market. So far, some 16,800 linear feet of railing have been bought and the department is still calculating how much more it will need.
 Maintenance crews have been asked to fill out forms, which are now filed daily, detailing any missing railings or other vandalism they spot along their routes. In addition, said Mr. Lettiere, his agency will alert county road departments to conduct a similar daily review and report to his agency.
 ''Generally most agencies at the county level will try to handle these things themselves,'' the commissioner said. ''But we are trying to document it and find patterns and see how widespread it is.''
 Sgt. Kevin Rehmann, a spokesman for the New Jersey State Police, said the department's investigators were determined to track down the culprits, who have struck mainly in Passaic, Essex and Morris Counties.
 ''There have been no arrests as yet, but we have been aware of this since last September, and the superintendent of state police has put the northern New Jersey commander in charge of the investigation,'' he said.
 The problem has not been as acute on state parkways and the New Jersey Turnpike, said Joseph Orlando, a spokesman for the agency that operates the toll roads. They are closed roadways, he noted, adding, ''You would clearly raise some eyebrows trying to bring a flatbed truck loaded with railings through a toll plaza.''
 Mr. Plummer of Metal Strategies said that aluminum was selling for about 80 cents a pound, more than three times the 15 cents to 25 cents a pound that the bellwether scrap steel was bringing. And even those prices, he said, are more than twice the average price some 10 years ago.
 Still, some in the industry like Robin Wiener, president of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, which represents scrap dealers and importers, said they were not aware of any particular problem with theft and black market scrap in the United States. Ms. Wiener said she had heard of thieves' dismantling an entire bridge in Ukraine last year and selling it for scrap.
 ''But I am not aware of anything like that in the U.S., and we certainly don't condone it,'' she said.

HEADLINE: After City Hall Lobbying, Group Postpones Stadium Vote

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Regional Plan Association put off a vote on whether to oppose a $1.4 billion West Side stadium after the Bloomberg administration began an intensive lobbying campaign to sway the group's vote.
 Fearing that the group was about to become the first major civic organization in the city to take a stand against the stadium, Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, the Olympic bid committee and the New York Jets started a remarkable counteroffensive this week. The 75,000-seat stadium is an important element of the city's bid for the 2012 Summer Games and would also be the home for the football team.
 So after some hot debate yesterday afternoon, the association's board voted to wait. 
 Board members said the group was prepared to begin a blistering critique of the heavily subsidized stadium, which the group's study paper suggested would ''deter rather than attract the large-scale redevelopment'' that the West Side needs. The board did not recommend an alternative site in Queens near Shea Stadium, as some had expected.
 ''We had a very intense discussion about the merits of West Side plans,'' said Robert Yaro, the president of the association. ''At the request of the deputy mayor, we are submitting a series of outstanding questions about the stadium and the West Side project. We will defer action until, probably, June.''
 Officials with the Jets and City Hall were exultant.
 The delay illuminated a behind-the-scenes effort by city officials and others to stifle opposition in business and civic circles, at least until after May 18, when the International Olympic Committee meets in Switzerland to pare its list of candidates for the 2012 Olympic Games.
 ''We didn't want this done on the eve of the Olympic decision,'' said one person active in the Olympic bid.
 But some supporters of the city's Olympic effort favor putting the stadium in Queens because they fear that opposition to a West Side stadium and potential lawsuits from West Side community groups, Broadway theater owners and elected officials could scuttle the bid.
 ''My concern is that we'll lose the Olympics because some crazies will sue over the stadium,'' said one board member whose organization has endorsed the West Side plans. ''I'd rather face the music now and go to Queens.''
 But Mr. Doctoroff and others are also anxious to head off any momentum for the Queens site, which they claim is not feasible. The Jets, which have committed to invest $800 million in the stadium, say they are unwilling to consider anything other than Manhattan.
 The city's hotel industry, real estate lobby, convention and visitors bureau and the chamber of commerce have all endorsed the city's effort to bring the Olympic Games to New York, to redevelop the West Side and to expand the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
 But privately, leading members of each of the groups say they are reluctant to express their misgivings about the stadium, because they are worried about alienating Mr. Doctoroff, the founder of the city's 2012 bid, who also presides over economic development projects in the city.
 Jay Kriegal, executive director of the Olympic bid committee, NYC2012, said that he called members of the plan association to alert them that the organization might take a position in contradicting their support for the Olympics. He said that some members had a host of questions, making him think that the group was making a hasty decision.
 Both PricewaterhouseCoopers, a consulting firm, and Merrill Lynch, an investment bank, sent letters to the plan association, objecting to a vote against the stadium.
 One board member who got a call from Mr. Doctoroff found it a little intimidating, if unconvincing.
 ''It didn't change my mind,'' that board member said. ''But whenever somebody like that calls, you have to pay attention because there are serious potential consequences. He makes important business decisions for the city.''
 Richard Ravitch, a board member and a former state economic development executive, said: ''If one's major interest is in the Olympics, why pick a site that rightly or wrongly will be the subject of a great deal of litigation and controversy? It's hard to imagine the International Olympic Committee will base their decision on the location of the stadium.''

HEADLINE: Worries About Higher Interest Rates Stifle Wall Street

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street, unable to shake a lethargy induced by interest rate worries, wobbled to a mixed finish yesterday as investors shrugged off a $10.5 billion bank takeover and a bullish upgrade of Dell.
 Those developments and a very upbeat reading of business activity in the services sector by the Institute for Supply Management helped keep shares afloat for most of the session, but persistent interest rate worries ultimately stifled the advance.
 ''The market rallied a bit on the I.S.M. numbers, but it seems to be a subdued rally,'' said David Hegarty, head trader at Commerzbank Securities. 
 ''The interest rate scenario obviously has been hanging over our heads,'' he said, ''and that will keep pressure on the equity market.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.25 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,310.95. But the Nasdaq composite index added 6.78 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,957.26, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.98 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,121.53.
 The market was still absorbing Tuesday's statement from the Federal Reserve, which left interest rates unchanged but suggested that it would be inclined to push them higher as the economy continues to improve.
 Analysts said trading was likely to remain volatile as the market further digests the Fed's revised position, along with other concerns that have overshadowed generally strong economic data and corporate earnings.
 ''Investors are focused almost totally on Iraq, concern over interest rates, and who might be living in the White House next year, and they're continuing to ignore the very positive economic fundamentals,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist with A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. ''It's very choppy because folks are not looking beyond the end of their noses.''
 The next market-moving data will be released Friday when the Labor Department issues its April jobs report. Economists are forecasting an increase of 165,000 nonfarm payroll jobs. But last month's surprise of 308,000 new jobs has many second guessing those estimates.
 Among yesterday's winners, Coca-Cola was up 82 cents, to $51.09, after it named a former top executive for one of its bottlers as its new chairman and chief executive. The appointment of E. Neville Isdell to succeed Douglas N. Daft, who is retiring this summer, ended months of speculation over who would be the next leader of the world's largest beverage maker.
 Dell rose 40 cents, to $35.71, on an upgrade from Banc of America Securities, which raised its annual forecast on improved margins and computer and notebook sales forecasts. 
 Charter One Financial soared $7.91, or 22 percent, to $43.86, after the Royal Bank of Scotland announced plans to purchase it for $10.5 billion through its Citizens Financial Group subsidiary. The combined entity would be one of the 10 largest banks in the United States.
 Oil services shares declined after Banc of America lowered its rating on the sector, citing volatility and an expected drop in drilling activity. Schlumberger lost 79 cents, to $58.39, and Halliburton fell 31 cents, to $29.74.

HEADLINE: Corporate Tax Legislation Remains Stalled in the Senate

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5 

 BODY:
After months of ferocious lobbying from almost every corner of business, Senate leaders struggled on Wednesday to reach agreement on a bill that would overhaul corporate taxes and create more than $170 billion worth of tax breaks for Rust Belt manufacturers, movie studios, drug companies, computer companies, shipbuilders and even Indian tribes.
 The bill has been stalled for weeks. It was originally intended to eliminate a tax break for American exporters that has been declared illegal by the World Trade Organization and replace it with new benefits for domestic manufacturers.
 Congress and the Bush administration are under pressure to act quickly because the European Union has started to impose retaliatory tariffs on American exports and the tariffs will rise to $4 billion a year if the tax break for exporters is not repealed. 
 To win enough votes for passage, however, lawmakers from both parties have added many special-interest tax breaks in recent months, and the bill's fate is still uncertain.
 On Wednesday, Democrats and Republicans became bogged down in a battle to extend federal unemployment benefits until the end of November. They expired for many workers at the end of last year, and Democrats contended that another extension of jobless benefits was necessary because millions of workers have been out of work for longer than six months. 
 Republican leaders, saying that Congress had already extended jobless benefits last year, threatened to seek a vote cutting off debate.
 Because of the European Union's mounting tariffs, the tax bill is considered essential legislation and has become a magnet for almost every business lobbying group.
 The bill's main portion would repeal the old tax break for American exporters -- which would effectively raise about $54 billion over 10 years -- and replace it with a reduction in corporate tax rates on profits from products manufactured in the United States.
 But that is only the beginning of the bill's benefits for American companies. It would also give American multinational companies a big one-time tax holiday on foreign profits they have been keeping outside the United States. That provision has been hotly pursued by pharmaceutical companies like Eli Lilly and Schering-Plough, as well as high-technology manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard and Cisco Systems.
 Industry analysts estimate that American companies have deferred paying American taxes on as much as $600 billion in foreign profits, and they can continue doing so as long as they keep those profits outside the United States.
 To encourage companies to reinvest that money in the United States, the Senate bill would give them one year to bring back those profits, which would be taxed at a rate of only 5 percent rather than the standard 35 percent corporate rate.
 The bill contains many other tax breaks, including many that were in the big energy bill that Congress failed to pass last year. Other special interest provisions include tax reductions for television and movie producers that would total nearly $800 million over 10 years; a tax break for liquor distillers worth $484 million; a tax break on bonds issued by Indian tribes that would cost the Treasury $257 million; and a break for Oldsmobile car dealers, who are struggling with the decision by General Motors to shut down the Oldsmobile division, that would cost $189 million over 10 years.
 The bill has considerable bipartisan support and was drafted by Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the committee's ranking Democrat.
 Though the bill would create about $170 billion in tax breaks for business, its sponsors said it would not cost the Treasury any money over the next 10 years because it would raise an equal amount by eliminating old tax breaks, prohibiting many tax shelters and imposing new customs fees.
 Some Democrats attacked the bill as a giveaway to special interests. Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, read off a list of beneficiaries that included Oldsmobile dealers and liquor companies.
 ''That might make some people happier, but whether it will get them a job or not is less certain,'' Mr. Graham said, offering an amendment that would have replaced most of the tax breaks with a tax credit for companies based on the number of additional workers they hire.
 Republicans, joined by a number of Democrats, rejected the amendment by a vote of 77 to 22.
 Republicans also defeated an amendment by Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, that would have forced companies to actually invest in the United States any of the foreign profits they bring back into the country during the tax holiday.
 Like many Democrats, Senator Breaux said he would probably vote for the overall bill and was philosophical about the special interest provisions. ''It's the last train leaving from the station, so people do what they have to do,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Congress Ducks the College Aid Crisis

 BODY:
The Higher Education Act of 1965, due to be re-authorized by Congress this fall, was meant to ensure that no academically qualified American would be barred from college for financial reasons alone. But the door has been steadily closing, thanks to soaring tuition costs and declining student aid. 
A federal commission estimates that up to 4.4 million Americans will be turned away from four-year colleges for financial reasons in this decade alone.
 House Republicans have suggested changes in the law that would make things worse. Their bill would fail to increase federal Pell grants, which covered more than 80 percent of the average public-college tuition for the poorest students a quarter-century ago but covers only about 40 percent today. Without a long-overdue increase for Pell grants, everything else amounts to tinkering at the margins. Meanwhile, the bill would increase students' debts by wiping out a provision that allows students to consolidate their loans at a fixed low rate. That provision would benefit private lenders, which are eager to charge whatever the market will bear, and would burden students by driving up interest rates.
 On the plus side, the bill would require banks to return a portion of their excess profits on student loans to the government. But it ducks a much more important reform: replacing the Federal Family Education Loan Program, which unnecessarily enriches the banks, with a direct loan program that would allow students to borrow directly from the government. This would save billions of dollars that could then flow to student aid, not the banks.

HEADLINE: House Approves Curb on Minimum Tax

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5 

 BODY:
The House on Wednesday approved legislation that would curb -- for one year only -- the alternative minimum tax, which was meant to prevent the wealthy from taking unfair advantage of tax breaks but has affected many middle-income families.
 The bill, passed 333 to 89, would cost $17.8 billion in lost tax revenue next year and would shield about nine million individuals and families from paying the tax.
 Under the legislation, which adjusts the alternative tax to take account of inflation, three million to four million taxpayers would still pay the tax next year. That is close to this year's number. The Senate is expected to pass some version of the legislation, which has the strong support of the White House. 
 By offering legislation that expires after one year, Congress once again sidestepped the political perils inherent in a costly long-term fix of a tax widely viewed by both Republicans and Democrats as highly complex, flawed and overreaching. Such a fix, no matter how it is done, will cause the nation's swollen budget deficit to grow much larger.
 Simply extending what the House passed on Wednesday for the next decade would cost $337 billion, the Joint Committee on Taxation said. Repealing the tax altogether could cost up to $900 billion over the same period, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said. 
 Because the tax is, technically, still in full force after this year, official projections for future government revenue and deficits are required to assume that the tax will raise hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming decade, despite the clear intent of Congress to scale it back substantially, if not get rid of it altogether. That has obscured the costs of the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003, critics of those tax cuts say.
 The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal group in Washington, said the cost of extending the Bush tax cuts until 2014 would grow to $1.7 trillion from $1.3 trillion if relief from the alternative minimum tax was included. The White House and Congressional leaders continue to use the tax ''as a major budget gimmick,'' the group contends, ''to mask the true cost of tax-cut proposals and to sharply understate the likely size of future deficits.''
 But the White House says the one-year fix is needed to give the Treasury Department time to come up with a long-term solution.
 The tax was originally intended for wealthy taxpayers who took large deductions for tax shelters and other tax-avoidance schemes, and by 1999 it still affected fewer than 1 percent of taxpayers. But the tax is not indexed to inflation, and with the 2001 Bush tax cuts, it has begun to reach deeply into the middle class, especially for families that take exemptions for children or large deductions for state and local income taxes. By 2010, the tax, if left unchanged, is expected to apply to one-fifth of all taxpayers -- or close to 30 million -- including two out of five married couples.
 ''What began as a way to make sure that high-income Americans paid their fair share has today become little more than an unfair surcharge on people who choose to get married, have children and work their way into the middle class,'' said Representative Rob Simmons, a Connecticut Republican who sponsored the House bill.
 Mr. Simmons said families that were spared from paying the tax next year would save an average of $1,520.
 Another Republican, Representative Amo Houghton of New York, said, ''This is a stopgap measure, but it's essential.''
 While most Democrats were unwilling to cast an election-year vote against a tax break, they attacked Republicans for what they said was a failure to come clean about the cost of fixing the tax, in light of the Bush tax cuts and a deficit that the Congressional Budget Office estimates at $478 billion this year.
 ''When is the Republican majority going to face up to the hole in the tax structure that you have dug?'' said Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington.
 Republicans defeated a Democratic alternative in a 228-to-197 vote that would have created a blanket exemption for individuals with adjusted gross incomes of $125,000 or less and couples with incomes up to $250,000 while paying for the fix by closing tax loopholes. Democrats said their alternative was simpler and more fiscally responsible; Republicans said it would raise taxes and retard some business investment.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart's Big-City Plans Stall Again

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 5 

 BODY:
Less than a month after voters in Inglewood Calif., rejected Wal-Mart's effort to build a store there, Wal-Mart was dealt another blow on Wednesday when the Chicago City Council postponed a vote on zoning changes that would have allowed it to open its first two stores here.
 The setbacks in Chicago and Inglewood reflect the increasing difficulty Wal-Mart is facing as it tries to push in to more urban markets.
 Most of Wal-Mart's more than 3,500 stores in the United States are in rural and suburban areas. Chicago may be a major test of whether organized labor, which is relatively strong here, can block or obstruct the company's plans to continue expanding in big cities. 
 ''It would be nice to have seen the proposal go through and be voted on today,'' said John Bisio, a Wal-Mart spokesman, ''but this just gives us the opportunity to engage people and go back and dispel a lot of the misinformation that's out there.'' 
 The dispute has pitted some of the city's most prominent politicians, clergymen and civic leaders against each other. Both sides brought busloads of people to City Hall for the council meeting, and there were boisterous demonstrations in the corridors and on nearby streets.
 Supporters of Wal-Mart's expansion plans here say the company offers both badly needed jobs and rock-bottom prices. They said they were disappointed by the council vote, but still expected it to approve the zoning changes at its next meeting on May 26. Individual aldermen are able to block a vote on such changes once, but under council rules a roll-call vote must be taken at the next meeting. 
 Opponents vowed, however, to intensify their campaign against the giant retailer, which they say crushes small businesses and lowers labor standards by paying low wages, offering minimal benefits and opposing efforts by its employees to unionize.
 Aldermen who represent the poor and mainly African-American neighborhoods in Chicago where Wal-Mart wants to build the stores support the company. They say the neighborhoods, on the South Side and West Side, are desperate for the estimated total of 600 jobs Wal-Mart will bring. The City Council usually defers to the wishes of local aldermen on zoning matters, but the Wal-Mart proposal has stirred such controversy that the Council set aside that tradition on Wednesday.
 ''This is certainly not a local issue for one ward or for Chicago,'' said William J. P. Banks, an alderman who voted against the plan. ''It's a nationwide issue, and it's not going to go away anytime soon. People are looking for a quick fix in areas where economic development is very poor, but down the line they'll see that along with that quick fix come a lot of problems.''
 A leading opponent of Wal-Mart, Jamie Daniel, who heads a coalition of labor, religious and civic groups called the Chicago Workers' Rights Board, said she thought opponents had ''a good shot'' at blocking the company's plan.
 ''This vote shows that aldermen still have a lot of questions and concerns about Wal-Mart,'' Ms. Daniel said. ''We've been organizing like maniacs, and now it's going to be even more intense.''
 The most vocal supporter of Wal-Mart on the Council, Emma Mitts, who represents the neighborhood where the West Side store would be built, said she was ''a little upset'' by the Council's decision. 
 ''Let them try to organize in my community,'' Ms. Mitts said of the opponents. ''We've been organizing for a year. How are they going to organize in a month?''
 Labor unions are stronger and more combative in Chicago than in most places where Wal-Mart has opened outlets. Seeking to counter their influence, Wal-Mart has hired a formidable team of local public relations and legal consultants, including the law firm of Michael Daley, brother of Mayor Richard M. Daley.
 Mr. Bisio, the Wal-Mart spokesman, said his company was ''a very good corporate citizen'' and had contributed tens of thousands of dollars to community projects in cities and towns near Chicago where it has stores.
 ''Our average hourly wage is $10.70 an hour, which compares favorably to other Chicago retailers like Target and Home Depot,'' Mr. Bisio said. ''As far as having an impact on the overall economy, if you talk to the Chambers of Commerce in any town where we're present, they'll tell you that we not only create jobs, but we also help attract sales revenues for ourselves and neighboring retailers, which generates taxes that pay for law enforcement jobs and roads and everything else.''
 Mr. Bisio said that Wal-Mart was not anti-union, and that ''the reason our associates haven't wanted third-party representation is because they have faith in the company, and it provides them with tremendous opportunity.'' 
 In recent days, both supporters and opponents of Wal-Mart's entry into Chicago have held public meetings to rally support.
 Opponents gathered at a South Side church on Saturday and heard a succession of labor leaders and economists denounce Wal-Mart. Oneeconomist, Chirag Mehta of the University of Illinois at Chicago, presented a report by the university's Center for Economic Development that predicted that the West Side Wal-Mart would drain customers from 763 nearby stores and ''displace more jobs and income than it creates.''
 On Tuesday afternoon, about 200 West Side residents who support the retail chain gathered at the site of the proposed Wal-Mart for a rally that had the fervor of a revival meeting. The Rev. Pearlie Freeman opened it with a prayer that concluded, ''We need Wal-Mart to come here, God, and make a difference for our people.'' 
 The final speaker was Alderwoman Mitts, who whipped the crowd into a shouting fervor. She promised that she and her constituents would transform Wal-Mart once it opened here.
 ''We want to take the worst retailer in the world, the worst, as they say, and make it the best,'' she said. ''But you know something? To make them the best, you've got to have them inside.'' 
 Some retail experts doubt, however, that Wal-Mart would make concessions in Chicago that it has refused to make elsewhere.
 ''Wal-Mart has a lot of power,'' said Kenneth Thompson, a professor of management at DePaul University. ''It would be very hard for a few aldermen or community figures to negotiate with a company that's this tough. And what do they do if Wal-Mart says no? Once the store is open, they can hardly close it down.''
 The proposed South Side Wal-Mart would be part of a large new mall, while the one on the West Side would be a free-standing store with 150,000-square-feet of shopping space. There is a Walgreen's a block away from the site, and a mall across the street has a large grocery store, a beauty supply store, two shoe stores and chain outlets including Old Navy, Radio Shack and Marshall's.
 Wal-Mart's uniquely powerful role in the American retail economy and its reputation for vigorously fighting unions, has attracted increasing attention from labor leaders. One of them, John Wilhelm, a member of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Executive Council, said on a visit to Chicago this week that he had asked John Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, to make Wal-Mart the central focus of the American labor movement.
 ''After the 2004 elections are over, we should make this our main project,'' Mr. Wilhelm said. ''No one union can organize Wal-Mart. We need to face this in a comprehensive way.''

Senate Works to Reach Accord on Corporate Taxes
Senate leaders struggled to reach agreement on a bill that would overhaul corporate taxes and create more than $170 billion worth of tax breaks for businesses.
 The bill has been stalled for months. It was originally intended to eliminate a longstanding tax break for American exporters that has been declared illegal by the World Trade Organization. Congress and the White House are under pressure to act quickly because the European Union has started to impose retaliatory tariffs on American exports. [Page C5.]

Economic Pessimist Stands Firm
Richard Yamarone, the chief economist at Argus Research, was pummeled by reality last month, when his forecast that employment would grow by only 44,000 in March met the reality of 308,000 new jobs. But as investors await the Labor Department's release of April figures tomorrow morning, he is sticking to his guns, forecasting a slim gain of 95,000 jobs. Mr. Yamarone's position at the bottom end of the job forecast range is getting lonely. [C4.]

New Trial Rejected for Stewart
A federal judge refused to grant a new trial for Martha Stewart and her former stockbroker, rejecting arguments that a juror in their case was biased and provided false information about his background. [C7.]

HEADLINE: Here Come European Banks, Looking for Deals

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, May 5 

 BODY:
The $10.5 billion acquisition of Charter One Financial, announced this week by a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland, could be the first in a string of American buyouts by cash-rich European financial institutions that are looking across the Atlantic for growth after failing to do deals on their own turf, bankers and analysts say. 
 Many European banks have enjoyed strong, steady income from corporate and consumer loans in the last year. But the financial industry has already consolidated within many Western European countries, with the notable exception of Germany. That leaves some of Europe's largest banks peering beyond their borders for deals that would increase market share and profits -- without politically unpopular layoffs. And so far, the promise of cross-border deals in Europe has failed to materialize. 
 But the United States, the largest financial services market in the world, has one of the least concentrated banking systems, and a weak dollar is making purchases look cheap from overseas. For some European banks, particularly those like Royal Bank of Scotland that already have a foothold in the United States, this is one of the most attractive places to look for deals. 
 ''There are a lot of acquisitions still to make'' in the United States, the chief executive of the Royal Bank, Fred Goodwin, told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday. He said there could be ''a couple thousand'' attractive takeover targets in the United States, ''versus almost none in Europe.''
 In addition, the Charter One deal signals a move into the Midwest for Royal Bank of Scotland, after years of concentrating on the Northeast. Citizens Financial Group, the United unit of the Edinburgh-based bank, will be the sixth-largest bank in Detroit and the fifth-largest in Chicago when the Charter One deal closes in the fourth quarter, Mr. Goodwin said. 
 Charter One is ''not a fixer-upper,'' he noted, and is a strong company in its own right. It also expands Citizens near its existing franchise, particularly by adding branches in areas with greater populations and a larger small-business base, he said. 
 Mr. Goodwin earned the nickname Fred the Shred when his bank took over National Westminster Bank and slashed hundreds of jobs. But in the United States, he said, he expects to keep the number of jobs at Charter One flat. 
 Paul Gibbs, head of mergers and acquisitions research at J.P. Morgan, said that more European financial institutions might do deals in the United States because ''they can't find this kind of property in Europe.'' 
 Some European banks that would be attractive acquisition targets are not public, Mr. Gibbs explained. Others are owned by shareholders who will not sell, he added, and at many of these institutions cutting costs will be more difficult than in the United States. 
 Europe is still fraught with regulatory, fiscal and cultural barriers to cross-border banking consolidation, said a Fitch Ratings report in March. ''Synergies from merging two banks in different countries are not that evident,'' the report added. 
 Despite all the positive trends, European banks that lack American operations should be cautious about deals in the United States, said Gerry Rawcliffe, a London-based Fitch analyst. ''If they're not already there, they may have missed the boat.'' 
 Many midsized banks in the United States already have a takeover premium factored into their stock. 
 Opportunities may look too great to resist, though. Despite a wave of consolidation in the late 1990's, America still has an estimated 8,000 banks. ''Several European institutions will most likely continue to look to buy in the United States, because the economy offers a favorable relative growth rate, and there are ample acquisition opportunities, unlike in Europe, where cross-border M.&A. has been difficult to achieve,'' said John Balkind, an analyst with Fox, Pitt, Kelton in New York. M.&A. is mergers and acquisitions.
 European banks that want to buy now are aided by the fact that four of the largest, most acquisitive United States banks are in the midst of their own mergers: Bank One with J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America with FleetBoston Financial. 
 So Mr. Goodwin has not been alone in looking west. In February, Baudouin Prot, chief executive of BNP Paribas Bank in France, said that he was looking for new business in Europe and the United States, and that his bank had 5 billion to 6 billion euros pegged for deals. Then in March, BNP's American subsidiary, BankWest, bought Community First Bankshares of Fargo, N.D., for $1.2 billion. 
 In February, Barclays Bank held discussions with Providian Financial about buying some of its credit card assets. In March, at HSBC's, year-end earnings announcement, its chairman, Sir John Bond, said there were acquisition opportunities in the United States. HSBC already owns Household International, a United States consumer loan business.
 Most foreign buyers have focused on a certain geographic area in the United States, and are likely to continue to do so to maximize the benefits of any deal, Mr. Balkind of Fox, Pitt, Kelton noted. For example, he said, the Netherlands bank ABN Amro, which owns LaSalle Bank in Chicago, is not expected to buy something in California. 
 British banks are in a particularly strong position to do deals outside their home country. Both the housing and consumer credit markets in Britain are booming. Meanwhile, the last time a British bank tried to buy another one, three years ago, it was rebuffed by regulators. 
 ''The key issue for any U.K. bank is what do with your excess cash,'' Mr. Gibbs of J.P. Morgan said. The alternatives, he said, are to spend the cash on mergers, or to hand it back to shareholders.

HEADLINE: Twilight of the Sitcom Gods (Cue the Strings)

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
The network that concocted a contestants' reunion even before ''The Apprentice'' ended could hardly be expected to let ''Friends'' go quietly. NBC's send-off has been the most overwrought and prolonged farewell since Violetta's death scene in ''La Traviata.''
 And that makes this an easy time to scorn ''Friends.'' The network's bathos has drained much of the fun out of tonight's two-hour finale. So has the show's 10-year streak of mass popularity. ''Friends'' is the television equivalent of the tree-in-the-forest conundrum: if a sitcom is put on network television and everybody likes it, is it still good? 
 People have a way of measuring taste in binary terms: Leno or Letterman, Tchaikovsky or Shostakovich, ''Friends'' or ''Seinfeld.'' For a vocal, if perhaps snobbish, minority, ''Friends'' was too cute and sunny to rival the sly misanthropy of ''Seinfeld'' or ''The Larry Sanders Show.''
 ''Friends'' was not original. ''Seinfeld'' had already charted the territory of single, self-absorbed slackers. ''Mad About You'' had already started down the path of yuppie love. The racy reputation of ''Friends'' had more to do with its family-hour time slot at 8 p.m. than with groundbreaking material. And season to season it was not as sophisticated or witty as ''Frasier.''
 That NBC sitcom is also ending next week, after an 11-year run, giving the network yet another pump at the emotional well. But most of these panegyrics are well deserved: ''Frasier'' earned extra credit for amusing huge audiences without the prop of a young, alluring cast talking incessantly about sex.
 ''Frasier'' was original for its time. The show, about a Seattle radio psychiatrist, resurrected a marginal type of television character -- the finicky, opera-loving aesthete -- that television had not showcased properly since Felix Unger on ''The Odd Couple.''
 Much has been made of the fact that Kelsey Grammer, first on ''Cheers,'' and then on its spinoff ''Frasier,'' played the same character for 20 years, a record matched only by James Arness, who played Marshal Matt Dillon on ''Gunsmoke'' from 1955 to 1975. That is not so surprising. The two actors played archetypal American roles: Marshal Dillon was a lone gunman struggling to preserve order and civility in a violent, lawless frontier town; Frasier was a lone pedant struggling to uphold grammar and erudition in a television landscape of illiteracy and multiple-choice game show questions.
 Depending on the viewer's sensibility, Frasier's more effete brother Niles (''From now on I'll be relegated to B-list charities: grubby little theater companies and last year's diseases'') served as either Chester or Miss Kitty.
 The jokes on ''Frasier'' were aimed more at Mensa members than at the masses. In an episode in which Christine Baranski played Dr. Nora, a cruel, dismissive radio shrink, Frasier exclaimed, ''This is a woman who thought the Spanish Inquisition was just tough love for heretics.'' 
 ''Friends'' was just as well written of course, but the jokes were pitched to a lower common denominator, particularly through Joey, the dimwit who was brilliant at mangling the English language. ''It's a moo point,'' he tells Rachel in one episode. When she asks what that means, he replies: ''It's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.'' 
 ''Friends'' was very well written. The challenge of creating weekly scripts that move seamlessly among six clearly defined principal characters cannot be underestimated. 
 And no matter how weary viewers grew of teasers for the ''Friends'' finale, voiced in the hushed, lugubrious tones usually associated with a space-shuttle disaster or an assassination; no matter how many times ''Today'' flashed pictures of the stars embracing tearfully between takes; and notwithstanding yesterday's two-hour retrospective on a special edition of ''Dateline,'' with Katie Couric and Matt Lauer as hosts, the cast of ''Friends'' really was quite special: six young, appealing actors who formed a smooth ensemble. At least one became a pop-culture phenomenon: Jennifer Aniston had more effect on average women's hair and clothing than anyone since Farrah Fawcett Majors starred in ''Charlie's Angels.'' 
 But timing was also an important factor in the show's success. The best sitcoms echo the larger mood of the nation. ''M*A*S*H,'' whose finale in 1983 drew the largest audience for a single episode of a television series, provided gallows humor in the gallows era of Vietnam and Watergate. ''Friends'' came along after the Reagan-Bush recession of the late 1980's and early 90's, a period that had fostered shows like ''Married . . . With Children,'' ''Roseanne'' and ''The Simpsons,'' caustic comedy centered around dysfunctional, financially strapped, families. 
 ''Friends'' didn't just ride the economic recovery. It tapped into the country's rediscovery of New York at the dawn of the Giuliani shape-up-or-ship-out era. Suddenly, and in large part because of ''Friends,'' Manhattan once again looked like a safe, fun and romantic place to be. The six stars of the show became the non-nuclear family that everybody really wanted. ''Friends'' was a slightly sexier, more knowing version of sitcoms like ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ''Cheers.'' Other shows came along that also romanticized New York, most notably HBO's ''Sex and the City,'' which pushed past the bonhomie of ''Friends'' to a more postfeminist place where women could please and be pleased by men without befriending them at all. 
 ''Friends'' remained more cozily mainstream, adding a hip, modern tone to the classic sitcom formula. ''Will & Grace'' is a spinoff of its sensibility, if not of one of its secondary characters. And no new sitcom has come along that comes close to the popularity of ''Friends'' or ''Frasier''; even ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' on CBS is nearing its ninth season.
 NBC, which has tried desperately to come up with a sitcom to replace ''Friends,'' has apparently given up. ''Joey,'' a spinoff set in Los Angeles, is an experiment. The network is counting on ''The Apprentice'' to anchor its Thursday night. 
 Viewers grieving over the end of ''Friends'' and ''Frasier'' are not just bidding farewell to their favorite sitcoms, they are mourning the genre itself, and that may well justify some hoopla and hyperbole.

HEADLINE: Green Gets Real

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
JOHNNY RODRIGUEZ knew he was lucky when he qualified to buy a brand new, subsidized three-family house in the South Bronx for just $300,000. 
 But his luck did not stop there. Mr. Rodriguez, who now shares a duplex with his brother and rents out two apartments in the house, said his hot water and heating bills for the whole house -- 4,000 square feet -- have averaged just $225 a month. 
 His unusually low gas bills are courtesy of green building measures, including high-efficiency insulation, appliances and boiler. As part of a campaign to bring energy-conserving design and long-term economies to lower-income residents, the measures were introduced on Mr. Rodriguez's block by Les Bluestone, a developer who interspersed 70 brick houses among public housing towers and abandoned lots. 
 Until recently, green design was a preoccupation of those who could afford to tinker with geothermal wells, air-filtration systems and solar panels. But green features are now appearing in places like Harlem and the Bronx, as energy-efficient materials and appliances, and the resulting economies, start to show up in affordable housing. 
 Advocates point out that green design offers bigger payoffs to low- and middle-income residents than to wealthy homebuyers and tenants. ''Energy bills are the second-highest bills that a family faces after rent or mortgage,'' said Matt Petersen, president of Global Green USA, a nonprofit environmental group. ''To a low-income family, to save $100 a month means a lot.'' 
 Energy-saving features, however, often require an upfront investment. As more developers of affordable housing consider building green, they are debating who should pay.
 In the case of Mr. Rodriguez, 27, a technology analyst who met the requirement of an income no greater than $75,000 a year, home energy economy came at a price for the developer. 
 Mr. Bluestone said the energy-efficient boiler cost him about $3,800 more than most boilers used in affordable housing. The energy-conserving kitchen appliances also came at a premium. Though New York State and the Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation together gave him $2,200 a house for green features, he is $5,800 out of pocket for each. 
 While Mr. Bluestone, who has built a similar project in Brooklyn, said he reduced costs by using experienced contractors and negotiating better prices for equipment, other developers do not think the green measures are worth it. ''If the developer is not going to live there or benefit from the lowered operating costs, then sometimes it is harder to persuade them to make the investment,'' said Peter R. Smith, the president of the State Energy Research and Development Authority, which pays developers $500 for each affordable unit to install high-efficiency appliances. (The subsidies often do not cover the full costs.) 
 Even in rental housing, where developers can realize lower utility bills by installing energy-efficient features, builders resist, said Patty Noonan, the vice president for economic development of the Partnership for New York City, a business group. '' 'Over time' is not any builder's favorite phrase,'' she said. ''You can argue you can make your money back in three years or one month, but you're still having to fight the inertia of 'this is the way my father did it.' ''
 Some developers believe the benefits to their community outweigh the costs. One Harlem developer, Carlton Brown, is building 93 subsidized condominiums with geothermal heating and cooling wells and high-efficiency appliances, which he predicts will save residents about $1,000 a year. On top of that, he is installing air filters on ducts and kitchen cupboards that do not emit volatile organic compounds, which the Environmental Protection Agency has warned can exacerbate conditions like asthma. ''Harlem is a hotbed of asthma, and most asthma attacks occur because of bad indoor air quality,'' Mr. Brown said.
 His subsidized condos, priced at $150,000 to $250,000, are reserved for buyers with incomes from $45,000 to $101,000. (Yes, in New York City, those earning more than $100,000 can qualify for affordable housing.) Mr. Brown said that by re-engineering the building's foundation to lower costs, he could spend more money on green features.
 Naturally, some of his buyers are more focused on purchase price than on utility bills. Kamala Redd, 36, a Harlem-born adult education teacher and single mother of two, said she considers herself a ''real environmental type,'' who likes the idea of geothermal heating and air filtration. But for her, the bottom line was the $200,000 price for her two-bedroom unit -- lowered from $266,000 by a city subsidy -- which allowed her to become a homeowner for the first time. 
 And in California, neither solar panels nor formaldehyde-free carpets attracted Estelle Johnson-Spalding, 81, to Colorado Court, a low-income rental project built by the Community Corporation of Santa Monica, a nonprofit housing developer. For Ms. Johnson-Spalding, it was the $345 monthly rent, about a third of the going rate. ''And it's four blocks from the pier and the ocean, and the view is exquisite,'' she added.
 Despite such responses to green building, government agencies are offering subsidies to developers who install energy-saving measures. Illinois pays $600 to $2,500 a unit for energy-saving insulation, heating and double-paned windows. New Jersey offers builders up to $7,500. But though these subsidies have existed for six years, only 5 percent of all affordable housing built in this period included green features, said Susan Bass Levin, the commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs. 
 Builders of moderate-income housing in California generally must include green features to compete for affordable-housing tax credits. Four years ago, the state introduced a new set of criteria for energy-efficient appliances and heating, fluorescent lights and formaldehyde-free cupboards, among other features. Phil Angelides, the state treasurer, said that though developers do not receive extra money for building green, such features give applicants an edge in competing for limited public funds. 
 In Seattle, the office of housing strongly encourages builders who want to qualify for housing subsidies to include features like water-conserving plumbing, low-energy lighting fixtures and extra ventilation in bathrooms and kitchens. 
 Developers find themselves making trade-offs. The architects who designed Traugott Terrace, a 50-apartment Seattle building for recovering drug and alcohol addicts on low incomes, decided they could not afford no-formaldehyde kitchen cabinets, but they invested in an electricity-saving elevator.
 Sandra Mallory, a coordinator on the development, noted that there is ''a lot you can do without extra money.'' Traugott Terrace has low-flow water fixtures and paints that do not emit hazardous gases, near to the cost of other fixtures and paints, she said.
 Indeed, said Chris Benedict, an architect who is designing four buildings of moderate-income rental housing for the Lower East Side People's Mutual Housing Association in Manhattan, ''the only way this type of work is ever going to be successful is to do it for the same price as typical construction.''
 On Monday, Ms. Benedict picked her way through the construction site of a building on Third Street near Avenue D, pointing out insulation sandwiched between a brick facade and an interior concrete wall. She said this step, with other measures that did not raise construction costs, would help cut energy use by 75 percent.
 Other developers hope to persuade low-income buyers to pay slightly more for energy-saving green features. But in Austin, Tex., one builder, Richard Huffman, said he has difficulty convincing buyers that they will save money in the long run if they pay about 7 percent more upfront, the cost of better insulation, more efficient air-conditioners and a sun-reflecting aluminum foil roof lining, which brings down cooling costs. 
 Although he does not believe in subsidies for green measures, Mr. Huffman wants his city to educate low-income buyers. 
 ''When a salesman is telling you that, you almost inherently distrust that,'' he said. ''It's far better if the city says: 'Look, you should look for green features in a house. They really do save you money.' ''

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

''ARCADIA AND METROPOLIS: MASTERWORKS OF GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM FROM THE NATIONALGALERIE BERLIN,'' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, through June 7. In 1937 the Nazis seized a large collection of Expressionist works from the Kronprinzen Palace in Berlin, Germany's first museum of contemporary art. But this branch of Berlin's Nationalgalerie has made great strides in restoring what was the heart of its collection. This show of 40 works by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Emil Nolde, Max Beckmann, George Grosz, Otto Dix, Hannah Hoch, Paula Modersohn-Becker and others touches on the history of German modern art -- Expressionism, Dadaism, Neue Sachlichkeit -- from around 1910 through the post-World War I period. Its title is drawn from the early preference of the Expressionists for rural places versus their later attraction to the city. One of the show's great ''Metropolis'' paintings is Kirchner's large ''Potsdamer Platz'' (1914); in the ''Arcadia'' mode is Modersohn-Becker's ''Kneeling Mother With Child'' (1907). Satirical thrusts at the failures of the Weimar Republic by Hoch, Dix and Grosz are also standouts. Hours: Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7 for students and 65+ (Grace Glueck).

* ''BYZANTIUM: FAITH AND POWER (1261-1557),'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through July 4. This vast and humblingly beautiful show about the waning centuries of the Byzantine empire reminds us that political decay does does not necessarily mean artistic decline. Full of amazing exotica -- manuscripts, miniature mosaics, textiles, drawings, paintings -- the exhibition ends with a room of great Northern Renaissance art indebted to icons that proves Byzantium's continued reach. People who are not Eastern Orthodox believers can enjoy the earthly pleasures of aesthetic spectacle linked with historical enlightenment. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7 (Michael Kimmelman).

''CHRISTO AND JEANNE-CLAUDE: THE GATES, CENTRAL PARK, NEW YORK,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through July 25. At last ''The Gates,'' the long-plotted Christo-fest in Central Park, is about to be realized: in February 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels, each suspended from a free-standing 16-foot-high framework, will be installed for 16 days on 23 miles of park walkways. The project, 25 years in the making, is saluted in this preview installation of Christo's drawings, collages, photographs, maps, diagrams and samplings of the actual ingredients, like poles, panels, bolts, supports and self-locking nuts. Like everything else the collaborative team of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, his wife, does, this documentation is as yawningly thoroughgoing as a space exploration log, sparing the viewer no detail. But for anyone who wants a pre-game fill-in, this show is indispensable. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).

* ''FASHIONING FICTION IN PHOTOGRAPHY SINCE 1990,'' Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 33rd Road and Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9600, through June 28. With its first exhibition of fashion photography, the Modern dips a toe into a very large body of water, and dithers. The works by 13 artists and fashion photographers, including Cindy Sherman, Nan Goldin, Phillip-Lorca diCorcia and Cedric Buchet, focuses on the recent uses of narrative in both magazine features and advertising. How recent this development is could be debated, but mainly the Modern seems determined to make everything look like appropriation art. This seems unnecessary in a museum known for showing all kinds of everyday design objects. The show sticks too closely to the mainstream fashion press, which keeps it too superficial, too polite and in some ways misleading. Largely missing are the field's raunchy underbelly and cheap thrills: the intimations of heroin chic, grunge, homoeroticism and teenage sex that can make perusing a fashion magazine feel like a vaguely subversive act. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays to 7:45 p.m. Admission: $12; $8.50 for students and 65+ (Roberta Smith).

* ''FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,'' National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, (212) 514-3700, through October 2005. That Native American art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker collection. Masks, baskets, pots, clothing, baby carriers, painted hides, drawings and other treasures are displayed here not as ethnological artifacts, but as objects of art. The works are as beautiful as any you are likely to find in a private holding. The show affirms the distance achieved in allotting Native American art a worthy aesthetic place in world culture. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays until 8 p.m. Free (Glueck).

* ''GUSTAV KLUTSIS AND VALENTINA KULAGINA: PHOTOGRAPHY AND MONTAGE AFTER CONSTRUCTIVISM'' AND ''WAR IN IRAQ: THE COORDINATES OF CONFLICT, PHOTOGRAPHS BY VII,'' International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through May 30. Provocatively buttressed by two smaller shows, these imposing exhibitions dovetail into a chillingly informative examination of the roles of photography in art, history and science. The political, the personal and the formal alternate energetically in the first exhibition in this country devoted to Klutsis and Kulagina, who were married, and is primarily the tale of an artist whose striking photomontage posters helped establish the graphic look of the young Soviet Union, until Stalin had him assassinated. ''War in Iraq'' makes manifest the kinds of events that swirled around but rarely registered within the work of Klutsis or Kulagina. Starting with the ruins at ground zero, 53 images by nine intrepid photojournalists associated with the agency VII record the havoc that war, violence, dictatorial regimes and fanatical faith have wrought in our own time. Whether riveting, shocking, seductive or merely banal, few can resolve the question raised by even the most seemingly straightforward photograph: does it bring us closer to reality or does it distance us from a reality that is already constructed largely of photographs? Hours and admission: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7 (Smith).

* ''MOMA AT EL MUSEO: LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN ART FROM THE COLLECTION OF THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART,'' El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, through July 25. The first broad-scale exposure of the Modern's extensive holdings from Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America, the 150 or so objects here are a small selection from the more than 2,000 it owns. But they form an arresting show, from the powerful Surrealist-
influenced ''Jungle'' (1943) by the Cuban artist Wifredo Lam to an untitled 1995 sculpture by the Colombian Doris Salcedo that invokes the political violence in her country. The sardonic humor of Marisol (Venezuela) and Fernando Botero (Colombia); the geometric tweakings of Jesus Rafael Soto and Gertrude Goldschmidt (Venezuela); the Conceptual hatchings of Felix Gonzalez-Torres (Cuba) and Cildo Meireles (Brazil), among others, remind us of the artistic richness south of the border. This show joins the strength of the Modern's resources with the growing importance of El Museo as a showcase of Latino culture. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $7; students and 65+, $5 (Glueck).

''NEXUS: TAIWAN IN QUEENS,'' Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Queens, (718) 592-9700, through July 4. Twenty artists, all Taiwanese, are assembled for an exhibition about immigration, assimilation, isolation, cultural identity and related issues. Many works are straightforward illustrations of the theme: Lu Hsian Fu's installation of red paper Chinese lanterns threaded with strings of Christmas lights, for example, is about the immigrant's bicultural experience. Some works, like C. J. Yeh's cybernetic translations of Mondrian paintings, resonate more broadly. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission, $5 (Ken Johnson).

''OPEN HOUSE: WORKING IN BROOKLYN,'' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Aug. 15. This all-Brooklyn show of new art has been timed to coincide with the inauguration of the museum's new front entrance pavilion and public plaza. With 300 pieces installed in the fourth- and fifth-floor galleries, and spilling over into the permanent collection galleries, it's a very crowded affair. It's also all over the place in terms of media, styles and themes, not to mention quality; the good, the bad and the iffy mingle. Still, there's plenty of good work by artists you know and by some you don't, drawn from across a borough that has many different art worlds. Also on view, though not part of the show, is Alexis Rockman's mural-size painting of Brooklyn 3,000 years in the future, submerged under water as a result of global warming. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 62+ (Holland Cotter).

* ''ROTH TIME: A DIETER ROTH RETROSPECTIVE,'' Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400, and P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084, through June 7. This exhaustive, exhausting but ultimately astounding exhibition offers total immersion in the art of the German-born, Swiss-based multimedia dynamo Dieter Roth (1930-1998), who not only erased the line between art and life, but also fused them into a single insoluble entity. With nearly 400 works of painting, drawing, prints, sculpture, assemblage, collage, music, poetry, film, photography, video and sound, and using every imaginable kind of found object or material -- foodstuffs included -- the exhibition moves through 50 years of incessant, obsessive art-making with remarkable clarity. It culminates in a presentation of five enormous installation pieces at the Modern's little-sister institution, P.S. 1, that reveal a seemingly boundless universe of artistic activity and a radically new picture of an artist at work. MoMA Queens hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays to 7:45 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $8.50. P.S. 1 hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 62+, $2 (Smith).

* ''SINGULAR FORMS (SOMETIMES REPEATED): ART FROM 1951 TO THE PRESENT,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through May 19. A lavish, mostly in-house display of Minimal art and its progeny. Along with the requisite examples by standard-bearers (Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Robert Ryman) and a few by predecessors (Robert Rauschenberg, Ad Reinhardt), it features post-1960's works by a range of artists including Gerhard Richter, Charles Ray, Robert Gober, Liam Gillick, Sherrie Levine, Rachel Whiteread and Damien Hirst. Ultimately, Minimalism doesn't describe everything here. The show is a hodgepodge. But it's a stimulating hodgepodge, and it looks great in Wright's building. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., Fridays until 8 p.m. Admission: $15; students and 65+, $10 (Kimmelman).

* ''WHERE GODS AND MORTALS MEET: CONTINUITY AND RENEWAL IN URHOBO ART,'' Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700, through Aug. 16. This engrossing show documents aspects of a so-called traditional African art as it existed in the recent past, and as it survives in a 21st-century world. Africa in this case means a society called the Urhobo of the Niger Delta, and the art ranges from spectacular larger than life-size figures of ancestor spirits to carvings of grotesque beasts with gaping, saber-toothed mouths, images meant to both encourage and control male aggression. Although some sculptures are now rarely produced in their original forms, they are in the paintings and prints of Bruce Onobrakpeya, a contemporary Delta-born artist of international stature, in whose art Urhobo traditions live on. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 5 p.m. Admission: $6; students and 65+, $3 (Cotter)

* WHITNEY BIENNIAL, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through May 30. Easily the best biennial in a long time. The spirit is upbeat and ingratiating -- almost polite -- on the surface at least, with a utopian streak and a youth-heavy emphasis on gloss and craft. There's plenty of painting and drawing, ratifying the much-hyped trend, and multigenerational work, stressing ecstatic engagement and meticulousness. But the real story is the stress on the handmade in general, on materiality in whatever medium -- a change from the politics-heavy, slacker installations of recent years. The cross-generational dialogue is an interesting subtext. Among the younger set utopia does not mean 1960's-style radicalism; it implies something unattainable, except perhaps in a hand-me-down form, and therefore smaller and inherently poignant. Look for a few standout works from artists both younger and older, including Yayoi Kusama, Alec Soth, Catherine Opie, Julie Mehretu, Jim Hodges, Eve Sussman, Raymond Pettibon, Slater Bradley, Robert Mangold and Stan Brakhage, who died last year. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 62+, $9.50 (Kimmelman).

* ''FRED WILSON, OBJECTS AND INSTALLATIONS: 1979-2000,'' Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, through July 4. Mr. Wilson, who represented the United States at the 2003 Venice Biennale, made his reputation with conceptually pointed, technically polished and visually engaging installations and objects that focused on excavating American racial history and illustrating the exclusionary power nature of cultural institutions shaped by social, economic and ideological domination. Elements of his subversive museum projects appear in this traveling show, along with sculptures and a fine, short new film. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 62+, $3; children under 12, $1 (Cotter).

Galleries: Uptown

BRICE BROWN AND DON JOINT, ''A Marriage in Paint,'' Naumann, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 472-6800, through May 22. Painters who share a life as well as a studio, Mr. Brown and Mr. Joint nevertheless have distinctly disparate abstract styles. Mr. Joint's is one of exuberant high-key color laid down in hard-edge geometric and biomorphic shapes; Mr. Brown's looser brushwork and softer palette relates more to Abstract Expressionism. But subtle similarities might be discerned and the two have painted a collaborative canvas that comes off. Soft shapes and hard ones form a pleasant melding; wayward linear trackings play off precisely formed edges. The colors get along. But each is a persuasive painter in his own right (Glueck).

* JEFF KOONS, ''Highlights of 25 Years,'' C&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, through June 5. This excellent 27-piece survey touches on all phases of Mr. Koons's career, including greatest hits like the basketballs mysteriously hovering in aquariums; the Mylar ''Rabbit'' balloon cast in shiny stainless steel; and the sexy blonde embracing the Pink Panther in glazed ceramic. The climax of the show is the 10-foot-tall ''Balloon Dog.'' Made of stainless steel and coated in coppery translucent orange, it is a breathtaking symbol of the inflationary euphoria and anxiety of our times (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

''ANIMALS AND US,'' Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 245-6734, through May 22. This menagerie of an exhibition offers many different species of animals viewed through many stylistic lenses. It includes Sue Coe's expressionistic anticruelty cartoons; William Wegman's comic photographic dog portraits; Frank Noelker's photographs of live animals in zoos; Hiroshi Sugimoto's eerie photographs of simulated animals in museum dioramas; and Rona Pondick's surrealist stainless steel dog, which has a human head and hands cast from life with a smooth and shiny canine body (Johnson).

* LES KRIMS, ''Fact or Fiction,'' Laurence Miller, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-3930, through May 15. In the 1970's, feminists hated Mr. Krims's staged pictures of naked women in absurd and humiliating situations. Today, these small prints from the late 1960's and early 70's are striking for their psychological urgency and mold-breaking inventiveness. His famous picture of a screaming legless man on a small table in a windowed alcove remains an image of frightening intensity. His mother seated naked in her dimly lighted living room is an image of heartbreaking vulnerability (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

JOE ANDOE, Feigen, 535 West 20th Street, (212) 929-0500, through May 15. Mr. Andoe's ghostly monochromatic paintings of pretty, erotically alluring young women and boxy 1960's-vintage cars rolling through barren, nocturnal landscapes are about memories of teenage years devoted to drinking, drugs and reckless driving on the outskirts of Tulsa, Okla. They exude the nostalgic romance of a Bruce Springsteen song (Johnson).

NIGEL COOKE, Andrea Rosen, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000, through May 15. This young British painter's landscapes combine Magic Realism, postapocalyptic fantasy and extreme shifts of scale. Along the bottom edges of canvases measuring up to 6 by 12 feet, Mr. Cooke paints scruffy landscapes of dirt, weeds, and rubble in miniaturistic detail. Above, immense walls rise with passages of graffiti here and there. Looking closely you discover that tiny human heads, separated from their bodies, are unaccountably scattered about the ground (Johnson).

''REVISITING HISTORY: SELF-PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHY,'' Cristinerose/Josee Bienvenu, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 206-0297, through May 15. This show of postmodernist, photographic self-portraiture includes Yasumasa Mormura in drag, in big parodies of Pre-Raphaelite paintings; giant-size prints of Orlan as a Baroque Virgin in white robes with one breast exposed; Kimiko Yoshida in blackface wearing an American Indian headdress and as a white-faced nun; Janieta Eyre wearing Edwardian costumes in surreal pictures of herself and her imaginary twin; and John O'Reilly's naked body as an element in small Cubist montages (Johnson).

ERIK SCHMIDT/NEAL ROCK, Henry Urbach, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-0974, through May 22. Mr. Schmidt, a Berlin painter, depicts corporate sterility in high-contrast, photo-derived images of spectral businessmen and office buildings. Crusty painterly surfaces call to mind stale cake frosting. The London-based Mr. Rock created ''Work From the Polari Range,'' an installation of sculptural reliefs, by squeezing colored silicone out of pastry bags. Suggesting reeflike accumulations of tropical submarine creatures, they are grotesque, seductive and comical (Johnson).

* WILLIAM SCOTT, Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through June 5. Pots, dishes, fruits, vases and other domestic shapes form the basis for much of this Scottish-born painter's imagery, magically reduced to lyrical, luminous ghosts of themselves. Scott, a figure of some importance in postwar British art, was well known in New York, too. This small but engrossing show progresses from 1954 to 1977, and in his spare, sensual paintings shape, space and color play beautifully together (Glueck).

Galleries: Downtown

''THE ART OF AGING,'' Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum, 1 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 674-5300, through June 25. The idea behind this packed show of 80 artists (not all of them so old) is to engage ''the larger community'' in Jewish values relevant to the aging process. It's a large order, entrusted here not only to painters and sculptors, photographers and craftsmen but also to cartoonists. The theme gets a little lost. If ever a show needed editing, this is it (Glueck).

FORD CRULL, ''Horror Vacui,'' Cheryl Pelavin, 13 Jay Street, TriBeCa, (212) 925-9424, through May 15. Mr. Crull produces layered, richly colored and textured paintings in which passages of brushy smearing and linear scrawling emphasize the surface, while blended areas create spaces of illusory luminosity. Heraldic, alphabetic, geometric, numerological and other kinds of mystically suggestive symbols are woven into the painterly fabric (Johnson).

ROY LICHTENSTEIN, City Hall, City Hall Park and the Tweed Courthouse, Lower Manhattan, through October. Rising five stories under the octagonal skylight of the Tweed Courthouse's fabulous Italianate rotunda, Lichtenstein's clunky tower of giant cartoon brush strokes is an impressive sight, the centerpiece of a Public Art Fund installation of four sculptures in and around City Hall. Call 311 to sign up for a Friday-only tour (Johnson).

* ''OCEAN FLOWERS: IMPRESSIONS FROM NATURE,'' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, through May 22. Dense with ethereal images and silhouettes of seaweed, this unusual exhibition shows how the needs of Victorian botanists, book publishers and inspired amateurs pushed traditional drawing and printmaking into the realm of photography without so much as touching a lens. The driving force was the need to get the wonders of nature down on paper, one way or another. Those ways run riot here and provide a startlingly revised view of the mongrel hands-on origins of the age of mechanical reproduction (Smith).

''TACTICAL ACTION,'' Gigantic Artspace, 59 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-6762, through June 10. This lively but crowded and unfocused exhibition is designed to promote leftish dissidence. Highlights include scenes of the war in Iraq, drawn on location by Steve Mumford; clever anticorporate lenticular photographs by David Byrne and Danielle Spencer; David Krippendorff's noirish video about the eroticism of hate; Michele Pred's American flag sculpture, made from pen knives confiscated at airports; and a mock prison visitors' booth, with a soundtrack about teenage gang violence, by Dread Scott (Johnson).

Other Galleries

''THE DEVONSHIRE INHERITANCE: FIVE CENTURIES OF COLLECTING AT CHATSWORTH,'' Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, through June 20. The stately English country home Chatsworth has been occupied since its construction in 1552 by the Cavendish family, headed by a long succession of dukes and duchesses of Devonshire. They have enriched it with notable collections of fine and decorative arts, an awesome library of books and manuscripts, scientific instruments, silver, furniture and needlework. A glimpse of these treasures is provided by this show, which has works by Rembrandt, Raphael, Titian, Durer and Lucian Freud; books and drawings by Andrea Palladio; a spectacular jewelry ensemble worn at the coronation of Czar Alexander II and much else to light up the eyes of the most jaded connoisseur. The next step is a visit to Chatsworth itself, still a private home for the Cavendishes but very much open to the public (Glueck).

* ''DRAWING OUT THE VOID,'' Vestry Arts, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212) 995-1774, through May 15. This excellent show of drawings in a beautiful new gallery brings together two famous Surrealists, now dead, and two living contemporary Neo-Surrealists. Hans Bellmer's Freudian amalgamations of body parts drawn in elegantly spidery lines, Pavel Tchelitchew's glowing pictures of a giant eye and heads seemingly made of neon tubing, Steve DiBenedetto's colored-pencil visions of octopuses, Ferris wheels and helicoptors, and Peter Schoolwerth's diagrammatic Pop-Surrealist narratives prove that drawing is still an excellent way to explore the weirdness of modern experience (Johnson).

Last Chance

* ''BOCCIONI'S MATERIA: A FUTURIST MASTERPIECE AND THE AVANT-GARDE IN MILAN AND PARIS,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Sunday. The Italian Futurist Umberto Boccioni's view of his mother as she sat before her apartment window was far from conventional. Her broken-up face is done in a distinctly Cubist style, her enormous folded hands are given frontal prominence, and the Futurist concept of simultaneity makes street activity almost part of her personage. The painting ''Materia'' is the centerpiece of this ambitious show, which studies Boccioni's work in relation to that of some European contemporaries, among them Braque, Delaunay, Duchamp, Gris and Picasso. The indebtedness of Italian Futurism to French Cubism and their rivalries are also addressed. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).

* CHARLES GAINES/DERRICK ADAMS, Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 865-0783, through Sunday. Mr. Gaines has an underground reputation in contemporary art, which is another way of saying he's underknown, at least in New York. Aligned with the post-minimalist art of the late 1960's and early 70's, he showed early with Leo Castelli and was included in a Whitney Biennial. But he has been living and teaching in California for years, and has seldom shown here. This small survey gives a sense of what he's been up to of late, in complex installations and text-and-photos pieces that tackle racial prejudice and disaster. It's time to get him squarely back on the radar. Also on view is a video performance piece by the intriguing young New York artist Derrick Adams, which incorporates fuzzy animal costumes and William's Blake's poetry (Cotter).

* ''INDIGESTIBLE CORRECTNESS,'' Participant, 95 Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 254-4334, through Sunday. With sculptures by Louise Bourgeois and Richard Prince, one of Lutz Bacher's great Vargas paintings, a gender-blending collage by the artist-team Breyer P-Orridge, and metal shoes by the couturier Imitation of Christ, this show is a fervid, twisty, demimondaine tangle of fashion, pornography and youth culture (Cotter).

''PARADISE NOW? CONTEMPORARY ART FROM THE PACIFIC,'' Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, through Sunday. Surveying 15 artists from the Pacific -- including Hawaii, Fiji and Samoa but mostly from New Zealand -- this exhibition reflects the new consciousness of Pacific or Polynesian cultures in the art and life of the region. Sometimes local motifs and themes are merely affixed to well-worn contemporary art strategies. But there is plenty to look at and think about, especially in an impressive video installation by Lisa Reihana, who uses the power dynamics of a 19th-century photographer's studio as the jumping-off point for a piercing meditation on colonialism and its aftermath. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., Fridays until 9 p.m. Admission: $7; students and 65+, $5 (Smith).

HEADLINE: Adelphia Trial Is Told Directors and Public Were Misled

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
As the Adelphia Communications Corporation approached financial collapse in early 2002, a top executive, Timothy J. Rigas, continued to mislead both its directors and investors about how much his family had borrowed though Adelphia and their ability to repay those loans, a former company official testified yesterday.
 In his fourth day of testimony in Federal District Court in Manhattan, James R. Brown, Adelphia's former vice president for finance, offered descriptions of how he and Mr. Rigas covered up crucial financial information about those loans.
 Mr. Brown said that he and Mr. Rigas decided to conceal the size and nature of the borrowing by the Rigases and their inability to repay because disclosing that information would have probably caused Adelphia to collapse even earlier. 
 ''We wanted to downplay it as best we could,'' said Mr. Brown, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in 2002 and has been testifying as a government witness.
 In the trial, Timothy Rigas and three other men are charged with bank fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy. They are his father, John J. Rigas, Adelphia's founder; his brother, Michael J. Rigas, the former executive vice president for operations; and Michael Mulcahey, the former director of internal reporting. They have pleaded not guilty.
 Mr. Brown offered an insider's view yesterday of a mad scramble that went on inside Adelphia in 2002 to conceal how the Rigases had used the publicly traded company to benefit private entities they controlled.
 At issue were so-called co-borrowing agreements, or bank loans with both Adelphia and businesses owned by the Rigases jointly liable for repayment.
 While those agreements were publicly disclosed, Adelphia's stock collapsed in early 2002 when investors learned that the size of the family's borrowings had reached $2.3 billion, money the family could not repay.
 Mr. Brown said that Adelphia's auditors, Deloitte & Touche, had first pressed Adelphia in 2001 to disclose the amount that the Rigases had borrowed as part of the company's annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A prosecutor, Christopher J. Clark, showed Mr. Brown draft versions of that document containing such a disclosure.
 Mr. Brown, however, testified that he quickly met with Timothy Rigas, who told him that he should resist the auditor's suggestion.
 He quoted Mr. Rigas as saying: ''We should give up on other points if we have to, but that is the last point that we want to give up on with the auditors.''
 Mr. Brown said he was able to persuade Deloitte to drop the recommendation by arguing that disclosing the total amount of debt available under the co-borrowing agreements was a more ''conservative'' course.
 Mr. Brown said his real agenda was different. ''I didn't want it disclosed to the public,'' he said.
 Nondisclosure ceased to be an option, however, in early 2002, when new S.E.C. guidelines required disclosure of the amount of off-balance-sheet debt or debt commitments.
 Mr. Brown said that he and Timothy Rigas decided then to make deceptive public disclosures about the size and nature of the Rigases' debts. 
 He also said that while the Rigases publicly said that they spent most of the money they borrowed to buy and upgrade cable systems, more than 50 percent of it was actually used to buy Adelphia stock.
 He added that such false representations were made in early 2002 to Adelphia's audit committee and board by him or Mr. Rigas.
 The public crisis came in March 2002, when Adelphia publicly released results that disclosed for the first time the size of the Rigas family's debt.
 In a conference call in March, one worried analyst, Oren Cohen, then of Merrill Lynch, questioned Mr. Rigas and Mr. Brown about the family's ability to repay the debt.
 Near the close of yesterday's testimony, prosecutors played a portion of that conference call to jurors. In it, Mr. Cohen repeatedly pressed Mr. Rigas for details about the debt and whether the Rigases could repay it.
 ''That's an awful lot of debt that is not on the consolidated balance sheet,'' Mr. Cohen said.
 Mr. Rigas sought to reassure him. ''So we've run the numbers, and we are very comfortable,'' he replied at one point. 
 The time for comfort, however, was over. Soon after that conference call, Adelphia's stock collapsed, leading the company to file for bankruptcy protection. Several months later, the three Rigases, Mr. Brown and Mr. Mulcahey were arrested.

HEADLINE: Filings by Jobless Plunge; Productivity Up in Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6 

 BODY:
The productivity of American companies rose solidly in the first quarter of this year, and new filings for unemployment benefits plunged last week to their lowest level in more than three years, according to government reports released Thursday. 
 The Labor Department reported that productivity -- the amount an employee produces for every hour on the job -- rose at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the January-to-March quarter, up from a 2.5 percent pace registered in the previous quarter. 
The number matched the forecasts of analysts.
 In the quarter, companies increased output at a 4.9 percent rate, up from a 4.2 percent pace in the previous quarter. Workers' hours, meanwhile, rose at a 1.3 percent rate in the first quarter, after a 1.6 percent growth rate in the previous quarter.
 Companies' unit labor costs increased at a rate of 0.5 percent in the first quarter, after being flat in the final quarter of last year. It was the biggest increase in a year.
 The economy grew at a 4.2 percent rate in the first quarter of this year, a slight improvement from the 4.1 percent pace registered in the previous quarter. Economists say the economy is expanding at about a 4.5 percent to 5 percent pace in the current quarter.
 In a second report from the Labor Department, new applications filed for unemployment insurance dropped by a seasonally adjusted 25,000, to 315,000, for the week ended Saturday, the lowest level since Oct. 28, 2000. Economists had forecast claims to drop to about 335,000.
 After months of sluggish payrolls gains, the economy added 308,000 jobs in March, the most in four years. The government releases the employment report for April on Friday, and most economists are predicting significant growth in payrolls.

HEADLINE: Fannie Mae Is Ordered To Revalue Some Losses

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
Fannie Mae, the giant housing finance company, has improperly accounted for some of the bonds in its $1 trillion portfolio, a federal regulator said yesterday.
 The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulates Fannie Mae, ordered the company to recalculate losses on the bonds by next Friday. The recalculation could force Fannie Mae to restate its profits downward, although the oversight office did not order that step.
 It is not clear how large a restatement Fannie Mae might have to make. The bonds under scrutiny include $8 billion in securities backed by mobile homes and $300 million backed by aircraft leases. Although the securities make up less than 1 percent of Fannie Mae's portfolio, they have become a focus for critics who say that the company hides losses and is riskier than it appears. 
 The order yesterday came in a letter from Armando Falcon, director of the oversight office, to Franklin D. Raines, the chairman of Fannie Mae. In the letter, Mr. Falcon also said that the oversight office was continuing a broader inquiry into Fannie Mae's accounting. 
 In a statement, Fannie Mae said it would give the oversight office ''the information required within the time frame requested.'' 
 ''We look forward to continuing to discuss our views with O.F.H.E.O.,'' Fannie Mae said in the statement. Fannie Mae said it was also seeking guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 With $1 trillion in assets at the end of 2003, Fannie Mae is the third-largest financial institution in the United States, behind Citigroup and Bank of America.
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, its corporate cousin, are government-sponsored companies that play a crucial role in the home mortgage market. They buy mortgages from banks and other lenders with money that they borrow from investors around the world. Most of their profits come from the difference in interest rates between the mortgages that they buy and the bonds they issue.
 The securities under scrutiny by the oversight office are bonds backed by mobile homes and aircraft leases. Even if the company is forced to restate their value, the change will have little effect on its overall financial position.
 But the demand from Mr. Falcon adds to the political and business pressure on Fannie Mae, an unusual company that benefits from being closely associated with the federal government.
 ''I guess Fannie's books were dirty after all,'' said Lawrence Kam, a hedge fund manager who has sold the company's stock short, betting that it will decline.
 Fannie Mae has said that its accounting methods are proper. Both KPMG, its auditor, and Ernst & Young, an auditor retained by Fannie's outside counsel, say its accounting practices comply with accepted standards, the company said yesterday.
 Since February, when the Federal Reserve and the White House stepped up criticism that Fannie Mae is too big and too risky to taxpayers and the financial system, Fannie's stock has fallen 14 percent. Yesterday, shares of Fannie Mae fell $1.27, or 1.8 percent, to $68.88. Shares in Freddie Mac have dropped 10 percent in the same period. 
 Part of the drop is probably a result of rising interest rates, which generally hurt financial institutions. But Fannie and Freddie have fallen much more than big banks like Citigroup over the period.
 The government created Fannie Mae in 1938 to help provide home mortgages in the wake of the credit squeeze that worsened the Depression. Freddie Mac was formed in 1970.
 Because of their government charters, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have several advantages other companies do not. They are exempt from state taxes and have a small line of credit with the Treasury.
 As a result, investors generally believe that the government would not allow Fannie and Freddie to fail if they ran into financial difficulty. So Fannie and Freddie can borrow more cheaply than almost any other private company. They have used that advantage to grow sharply over the last decade.
 Some economists and politicians say that the companies are too big, making them highly vulnerable to rapid changes in interest rates. The companies' critics also complain that compared with other big financial institutions, Fannie and Freddie do not have enough equity capital, the first cushion against losses in their portfolios.
 ''Evidence is mounting of inadequate disclosures in the world of housing finance,'' said Representative Richard H. Baker, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets. ''Clearly O.F.H.E.O.'s forensic audit of Fannie Mae's books need to continue.''
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac say they manage risk very carefully and are adequately capitalized. Home mortgages are generally very safe investments, the companies say.
 The securities at issue are not part of Fannie Mae's core mortgage portfolio but are part of a small group of higher-yielding investments by the company. They are mainly bonds backed by mortgages on mobile homes, also known as manufactured housing.
 But in the last several years, many buyers of mobile homes have defaulted on their loans.
 During the last several years, credit agencies have cut their ratings on many of the bonds, but Fannie Mae has been slower than some competitors to recognize losses on them.
 The company says that its internal models show that the bonds are suffering only a temporary loss in value and that it does not need to write them down. But Mr. Kam notes that when the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York sold its portfolio of manufactured housing securities last year, the bank took an 18 percent loss on the sale.

HEADLINE: Losing Our Technical Dominance

 BODY:
The United States remains the pre-eminent scientific and technological power in the world, but there are signs that it is losing ground to foreign competitors. To some extent this is inevitable -- and even desirable. The greater the diffusion of scientific capabilities, the better off the world will probably be. Still, the situation in the United States is worrisome. Fewer and fewer young Americans seem interested in technical careers, and fewer young foreigners will be arriving to take their places. If this trend is not reversed, the pool of trained scientists and engineers in this country will shrink, and the shortfalls may harm economic growth and the technical underpinnings of national security. 
 These measures of America's success and decline were laid out in articles this week by William J. Broad of The Times and in a voluminous report by the National Science Foundation. The United States still spends far more on research and development than any other nation. That has enabled this country to dominate high-technology exports, publish more scientific papers and win more Nobel Prizes than other nations, but they are closing the gap.
 The number of articles published in scientific and technical journals by American authors has flattened out for the past decade after three previous decades of growth. Western Europeans now publish substantially more papers than Americans do. The American researchers' share of Nobel Prizes has fallen to about half. 
 Although this is hardly a time of crisis for American science, common sense suggests efforts to head off further erosion. The administration seems misguided in planning to cut research funds in real terms for 21 agencies in coming years while increasing only the research concerned with defense, domestic security and the space program. The administration should ease the security-driven visa restrictions that keep away foreign students and scientists. Most important, the decline in the number of Americans training to become scientists and engineers suggests the need to reinvigorate science education in the public schools. Manpower trends can take a decade or two to reverse.

HEADLINE: Indians Who Worked in Iraq Complain of Exploitation

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE

DATELINE: VELICHAKKALA, India, May 5 

 BODY:
Last summer an agent for an Indian recruitment company offered what seemed like the chance of a lifetime to Abdul Aziz Hamid and his younger brother Shahjahan.
 For an $1,800 fee, the recruiter promised to get the two young south Indian men jobs as butchers on a military base in Kuwait for two years, they said. With salaries of $385 a month, a small fortune by Indian standards, they would join more than three million Indians already working in the Persian Gulf and enriching their families back home.
 They mortgaged a relative's house and land, paid the fee and flew to Kuwait in August with two of their friends. What they say they encountered when they got there landed on the front pages of Indian newspapers this week, with one headline declaring ''Indians Abused in Iraq'' in ''U.S. Slave Camps.'' 
 Within days, the brothers said, they and their friends found themselves on an American military base in northern Iraq working for a Saudi subcontractor of Kellogg, Brown & Root, or KBR, a subsidiary of Halliburton. They said their supervisor, who had taken their passports in Kuwait, told them they were obligated to work on the base for six months and could not leave.
 Working alongside 200 other laborers, from India, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, they first cleaned American latrines and then washed American dishes, the brothers said. Their pay was roughly $150 a month, they said, less than half of what the recruiter had promised.
 ''We were in hell,'' said Shahjahan, who returned here with his brother last week. ''I told my wife over the phone, 'If God wills us, we will meet again.' ''
 Officials from Gulf Catering Company, a Saudi company hired by KBR to provide food services at six American bases in Iraq, confirmed that it employed the four men. But the officials denied that the men had been exploited, underpaid or prevented from leaving Iraq.
 ''The passports are only kept for safekeeping,'' said Nico Smith, the company's human resources manager. ''When they wanted to resign we never said they can't go.''
 Wendy Hall, a spokeswoman for KBR, said Gulf Catering was a ''second tier'' subcontractor, one hired by another KBR subcontractor to work in Iraq. She said that this was the first time KBR had heard the allegations of worker mistreatment and that the company would aggressively investigate them.
 ''KBR has a policy to terminate any and all subcontractors if we know of mistreatment of employees,'' Ms. Hall said. ''Under KBR policies our employees are allowed to quit and leave the sector at their choosing.''
 While KBR and its subcontractors deny mistreating the men, their allegations of exploitation have reverberated in India. The new charges come after graphic images of American soldiers humiliating and sexually abusing Iraqi prisoners have been splashed across Indian television screens and newspapers for a week.
 Taken together, Indian officials said, the allegations have further dimmed the already remote chances that India might send troops to aid the American effort in Iraq.
 In the wake of the allegations this week, the Indian government is demanding that the United States investigate and give an accounting of how many Indians are employed in Iraq and how they are being treated. 
 A Pentagon spokesman said that the Defense Department was aware of the Indian government request and that any illegal activities would be investigated. He referred questions to the State Department, where an official said the reports were being taken seriously.
 On April 15 the Indian government banned Indian workers from going to Iraq, but government officials acknowledge that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of Indians already there. Two weeks ago, two men working for a contractor died in Iraq, according to an Indian government official, who did not identify the contractor.
 The problem, according to Indian officials, is that despite their country's booming economy, millions of Indians are desperate for the wages the contractors can offer. The two brothers said 250 other men were lined up at the recruiter's office in Mumbai, or Bombay, when they arrived last summer.
 At the time, the Indian news media hailed the jobs with the United States military, with one headline declaring, ''Mumbai Boys Get Ready to Cook Curry for U.S. Marines.'' Another declared, ''Indian Job Seekers Join Bush Coalition.''
 The Hamid brothers and their friends said their biggest complaint was with the Indian firm that recruited them, Subhash Vijay Associates. The men said they had not been told they would be going to Iraq and bitterly complained about the $1,800 fee, which is more than four times India's average annual per capita income of roughly $400.
 In a series of telephone interviews, Shukla Yadav, who described himself as an executive at the recruiting company, confirmed that it had sent the men to Kuwait. But he said he had no idea that they would then be sent to Iraq. He said the men had not paid an $1,800 fee, but declined to say what fee, if any, they or other clients pay.
 Mr. Smith, the human resources director for Gulf Catering, said all of its workers were aware that they would be going to Iraq. But he said that many workers from India and other Asian countries complained about having to pay excessive fees to recruiting companies.
 Mr. Smith, who joined Gulf Catering in February, said he tried to negotiate a reduction in the fees with the recruiting companies. Indian newspaper accounts quoted recruiting executives as saying they made fees of $300 to $800 per recruit.
 ''We got absolutely nowhere,'' Mr. Smith said. ''They tell you one thing over the phone and things go on the same way.'' He said he had eventually been advised to ''leave it be'' and give up the effort.
 While agreeing that the recruiting fees could be excessive, Mr. Smith said the men's accounts of being mistreated in Iraq were false. He said that no workers were held against their will and that passports had been collected after a fire on an American base destroyed some workers' passports.
 To refute the men's account, he produced the name and telephone number of another Indian who had recently returned from Iraq. The man, who identified himself as Thomas Joseph, said in a telephone interview that he had been recruited by the Bombay firm and then worked for Gulf Catering in Iraq.
 He said that he had paid the Bombay firm a $350 fee for locating the job and that he had signed a contract saying he would work for six month in Kuwait and, if necessary, Iraq. He said he had made $1,000 a month working as an executive chef in Iraq and remembered the four men who filed the complaints, whom he described as cleaners and dishwashers.
 Mr. Joseph accused the men of making false statements but said he, too, had been put under pressure to remain in Iraq through the length of his contract. He said he had been told he would not receive a promised air ticket home to India if he left Iraq early.
 ''They said if you don't work the six months, they will not pay for the round-trip ticket.''
 Faisal Aliyalgunj, a 34-year-old father of three who is one of the four men complaining of mistreatment, said he blamed the Indian recruiting agent for his woes. 
 The fee he paid was so high, he said, that he actually lost money on his nine months in Iraq. His hopes of earning enough money to return home, buy land and build a house for his family died on a bleak American base in the desert of northern Iraq.
 ''We can blame neither the Americans nor the Iraqis,'' he said. ''It's the company which cheated us.''

HEADLINE: Shares Fall as a Jobs Report Fuels Interest-Rate Worries

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks slid yesterday after a report that initial jobless claims fell last week added to speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates soon, crimping corporate profit growth.
 The shares of producers of raw materials declined after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said Chinese economic growth will slow, reducing demand for commodities. Retail stocks like Wal-Mart Stores dropped on concern that rising gasoline prices and higher interest rates may lead consumers to slow spending in coming months, investors said. 
 The jobless report, along with data to be released today on employment, may heighten speculation that higher borrowing costs are warranted.
 ''Earnings news is good, but inflation and interest rate news is starting to shake people up a little bit,'' said John Forelli, who helps manage $10 billion at Independence Investments in Boston. ''Investors are a bit confused right now.''
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 7.54 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,113.99, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 19.52 points, or 1 percent, to 1,937.74. Both benchmarks declined for the first day in four. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 69.69 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,241.26.
 More than four stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.5 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 2.5 percent more than the three-month daily average.
 An index of companies that produce raw materials and another that includes retailers had the two biggest drops among the S. &P. 500's 10 industry groups. Alcoa, the biggest aluminum producer, shed 62 cents, to $30.50. United States Steel, the No. 1 steel maker in the Americas, dropped $1.07, to $28.25. Allegheny Technologies, the nation's biggest maker of specialty metals, lost 58 cents, to $10.52.
 Retailers' sales at stores open at least a year increased 4.4 percent in April, according to International Council of Shopping Centers, less than its forecast for a gain of 5 percent.
 Wal-Mart lost $1.28, to $54.58. The stock was the second-biggest contributor to the S.&P. 500's drop. Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement chain, lost 90 cents, to $34.36. Sears, Roebuck fell $1.92, to $38.08. Family Dollar Stores sank $2.51, or 7.8 percent, to $29.51, for the second-biggest drop in the S. &P. 500.
 Citigroup, the world's largest financial services company, lost $1.12, to $47.51. The Securities and Exchange Commission has requested information on the company's Argentine business in 2001 and 2002, when the bank lost more than $2 billion there.
 King Pharmaceuticals sank $2.22, or 13 percent, to $14.72, for the steepest drop in the S.&P. 500. The company, a maker of heart drugs, is being investigated by two government agencies. It withdrew a 2004 profit forecast after its first-quarter loss widened.
 Greenhill & Company, an investment bank and asset management company, closed at $20.50 in its first day of trading. The company raised $87.5 million in its initial public offering.
 Treasury notes fell in advance of today's employment data and after yesterday's report hat the number of weekly jobless claims was less than expected. The benchmark 10-year note fell 5/32, to 95 9/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.60 percent, from 4.58 percent on Wednesday.

*++ ''ASSASSINS.'' This is what they always wanted, isn't it? A clear shot at the big time, where people would have to pay attention to them? More than a decade after they first surfaced to critical shudders and head-scratching, the unhappy have-nots of ''Assassins'' -- the glitteringly dark musical by Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman about Americans who dream of killing their country's presidents -- have finally made it to Broadway. So can these desperate people, whose greatest fear is of being thought small, actually expand in proportion to the lavish production they have been given? Oh boy, can they ever. Accompanied by a sumptuously full orchestra, and portrayed by a cast that finds the magnetism in rage and resentment, the frightening title characters of ''Assassins'' are restating their demand to be noticed in this Roundabout Theater Company production. And under Joe Mantello's direction, they are doing so with an eloquence and an intensity that makes a compelling case for a show once regarded as a mere curiosity as a major piece from a major composer (1:50). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $91.25 (Ben Brantley).

''BOMBAY DREAMS.'' Colors don't come any juicier than those that saturate this $14 million musical about movie-love Bollywood-style. Scarcely a scene goes by that isn't splashed with gorgeous heaping helpings of oranges, golds, greens, purples, yellows and more shades of pink than even Estee Lauder had names for. Yet such is the perverse spell cast by this friendly, flat and finally unengaging tale of glamorous movie stars and lovable untouchables that everything seems to melt into one neutral blur before your eyes, like a monochromatic symphony in the key of beige. A R Rahman's score has a certain rhythmic infectiousness. And as a self-centered Bollywood screen siren, the deliciously superficial Ayesha Dharker helps turn the central production numbers into lively paeans to Bollywood kitsch. But under the direction of Steven Pimlott, this retooling of a hit from London feels trapped in a listless limbo between tipsy spoof and sober sincerity (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $42.25 to $101.25 (Brantley).

+ ''CAROLINE, OR CHANGE.'' A carefully wrought, impeccably performed chamber opera from Tony Kushner (''Angels in America'') and Jeanine Tesori (''Thoroughly Modern Millie''), directed by George C. Wolfe. In temperament this sung-through show is much like its stoical, uncompromising title character (Tonya Pinkins), a black maid for a Southern Jewish family in 1963. A current of self-denial runs through ''Caroline,'' from a libretto that refuses to sentimentalize its heroine to its deliberately fragmented score, which avoids anthems of uplift. The tone throughout is even-handed, slightly distanced compassion as people of different classes are revealed as pawns of a corrupting economic structure. Ms. Pinkins, who has never been better, gives an intense, controlled and commanding performance. In ambition and achievement, ''Caroline'' handily tops this season's new musicals. But it is almost too good to be good (2:35). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $26 to $101 (Brantley).

*++ ''JUMPERS.'' Acrobatics aren't just for athletes in this high-flying revival of Tom Stoppard's 1972 play. Though the show features an enthusiastic team of bouncing gymnasts, everyone in ''Jumpers'' jumps, in one way or another -- verbally, emotionally, morally. And with a cast headed by Simon Russell Beale, in a dazzling Broadway debut, such exertions turn this comic mystery of murder, marriage and metaphysics into one of the most entertaining exercise sessions available. Leaps of faith; back-flipping politics; somersaulting, self-inverting words and free-falling nervous breakdowns are all on offer in the restless, relativistic world of ''Jumpers.'' The director David Leveaux appropriately serves up a show that never seems to stop spinning, from its chic revolving set to the frantic, farcical movements of its characters. But at the same time, this luscious import from the National Theater of Great Britain, which also stars the divine Essie Davis, finds a wounded, hungry heart beneath the razzle dazzle. A play often dismissed as too clever by half now registers clearly as a poignant acknowledgment of the limits of cleverness (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m.; Tickets: $60 to $95 (Brantley).

''A RAISIN IN THE SUN.'' Sean Combs's shadow precedes him in this seriously off-center revival of Lorraine Hansberry's epochal drama of an African-American family in Southside Chicago. Will the very 21st-century figure who is Mr. Combs (a k a P. Diddy), whose career has been a triumph of nerve over probability, be able to evoke a man of thwarted dreams from the mid-20th century? Unfortunately, while the opening, engagingly boyish moments of his performance have promise, his Walter Lee Younger never appears to change, happy or sad, drunk or sober. His evenly measured words and debating team captain's gestures remain pretty much the same. And while Audra McDonald and Phylicia Rashad do sterling work as Walter Lee's wife and mother, much of Kenny Leon's production exudes the single-note perkiness of a sitcom. Instead of contrasting the forces of an older, God-fearing generation with a fresh revolutionary spirit (embodied by Walter Lee and his sister, played by Sanaa Lathan), the show becomes an unwitting counterpoint of mature and callow acting styles (2:30). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $26.25 to $91.25 (Brantley.

Off Broadway

+ ''ENGAGED.'' Everything looks decorous and refined in the Victorian world of ''Engaged.'' This being a play by W. S. Gilbert, the decorous and the refined provide a light cover for strategic lunacy. Everything looks delightful in the Theater for a New Audience production, directed by Doug Hughes; the problems lie almost everywhere else. The outcome is a heavy tramp through a play that needs to be an airy romp. Gilbert satirizes the gap between emotional proprieties and financial greed, and parodies the English fad for the rustic. Marriages and engagements are made and unmade at top speed, and there are moments of antic madness. To be staged effectively, ''Engaged'' should be cut. Most important, it must be directed with musical lightness and speed. Here speeches turn into exposition, when every fiber of one's being calls out: ''No! This is supposed to sound as if the character is bursting into song'' (2:05) Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich VIllage, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 (Margo Jefferson).

*+ ''THE NORMAL HEART.'' This absorbing revival allows you to register some of the gale force with which Larry Kramer's benchmark play hit New York in 1985. In portraying the early impact of AIDS, Mr. Kramer lashed out at the institutions and individuals of power he felt had looked away from a crisis-in-the-making, including The New York Times and Mayor Edward I. Koch. Dramas that run high fevers of social outrage tend to cool off over time, of course. But there is nothing quaint about this production, directed by David Esbjornson and starring Raul Esparaza as Ned Weeks, the truth-telling gay writer who is Mr. Kramer's alter ego. At its best, this production has the fraught urgency of a dispatch from a war zone. And it illuminates a poignant, quieter pattern of a longing to connect in a world that keeps building new walls among people (2:45). Public Theater/Anspacher Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55 (Brantley).

*+++ ''THE TRICKY PART.'' You may feel you've had enough of confessional one-person shows. But don't rule out Martin Moran's translucent account of a Roman Catholic childhood that was brought to an abrupt end when, at age 12, he was seduced by a 30-year-old church camp counselor. What gives this play, directed by Seth Barrish, its disturbing immediacy is Mr. Moran's gift for summoning the confused boy he was with exact sensory detail. The emotions stirred are not simple, and Mr. Moran gives such acute and urgent life to his memories that you have no difficulty believing that he has remained in their thrall ever since. A frills-free work of theater, involving little more than an actor and his audience, ''The Tricky Part'' vibrates with the vertigo that descends when past and present coexist. Mr. Moran may say he has yet to let go of the wounded child he was. But there is surely some redemption in rendering chaos with this kind of clarity (1:15). McGinn Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 279-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $26 to $51 (Brantley).

Last Chance

*+ ''BIRO.'' A man stands before us in an orange cotton uniform: standard issue for American prison inmates. But his voice marks him as a foreigner. He is not an invention. The Ugandan-American photographer Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine has interviewed and photographed Ugandans for 18 years to document how they have endured, even prevailed, in the face of war and AIDS. This, his first play, is an eloquent intimate solo piece. He portrays a composite figure named Biro: his days in the army fighting two brutal presidents, his AIDS diagnosis, his flight to the United States to obtain medicine for himself and money for his son's care, only to end up in a Texas jail. Mr. Mwine and the director, Peter DuBois, let momentum build, then slow down so our emotions can coalesce. Following the map of Biro's life and the map of AIDS across three continents, we know we are facing terra incognita (1:40). Public Theater/LuEster Hall, 425 Lafayette Street, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Jefferson).

* ''MRS. FARNSWORTH.'' Political candidates poised to sling mud might take a pointer from A. R. Gurney: good manners can be lethal weapons. Playing a wealthy high-WASP couple, Sigourney Weaver and John Lithgow deploy annihilating charm in this new play. Though it deals with revelations that are the stuff of smear campaigns, ''Mrs. Farnsworth'' is as polite and sweetly subversive a political attack as you're likely to come across. Set in a creative writing classroom (with the excellent Danny Burstein as the teacher), the play unfolds around its title character's desire to write a novel about her youthful involvement with a man who sounds awfully like George W. Bush. ''Mrs. Farnsworth'' directed by Jim Simpson, is a polemical exercise that never screams at you. Instead, it feels as if it is spoken out of the side of the mouth -- sotto voce and through a locked jaw. As delivered by Ms. Weaver and Mr. Lithgow, this turns out be a thoroughly disarming technique (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, (212) 352-3101. Tonight at 7; tomorrow at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50; the run is sold out, but a cancellation list is begun at the box office 90 minutes before the performance (Brantley).

* ''ROAR.'' Betty Shamieh's play is part tender drama, part searing comedy. Ahmed and Karema, a Palestinian-American couple, have built a life together from the ground up but have scant affection to show for it. Their daughter, Irene, is a touchy, strong-willed adolescent determined to become a famous singer. Her uncle, Abe, is passing as an Egyptian Jew. Things boil over when her glamorous aunt, Hala, who always hurts a few other people in a constant balancing act between survival and self-destruction, unexpectedly arrives from Kuwait. (It is 1991, and Iraq has invaded that country). She and her sister grew up in a Jordanian refugee camp; their complex relations are caught beautifully by Sarita Choudhury and Annabella Sciorra. Irene tries to keep her distance, but no child can escape her family's legacy. Nothing is emotionally predictable here. Beautifully directed by Marion McClinton, the actors seize hold of Ms. Shamieh's language as it rushes out to find just the right cadence for each richly drawn character (2:00). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Jefferson).

+ ''THE STENDHAL SYNDROME.'' Richard Thomas rides the waves of Wagner's music like a heldentenor on a surfboard. Not that Mr. Thomas sings a note in ''Prelude and Liebestod,'' the terrifically enjoyable second part of this unbalanced evening from Terrence McNally (''Master Class''). But portraying a preening orchestra conductor who finds an autoerotic mirror in his music, Mr. Thomas generates a stormy passion that surely qualifies as Wagnerian. Directed by Leonard Foglia, and assisted by the ravishing Isabella Rossellini in her New York stage debut, Mr. Thomas churns up the seemingly shallow waters of this portrait of a flashy star of classical music. The evening's first play, ''Full Frontal Nudity,'' about American tourists in the presence of Michelangelo's David, is sketchily written and awkwardly staged. But ''Prelude'' enjoyably contrasts the grandeur of great art with the human pettiness of those who create it (2:15). 59E59, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Tuesday at 2 and 8 p.m.; Wednesday at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $60 (Brantley).

HEADLINE: China Anxiously Seeks a Soft Economic Landing

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 6 

 BODY:
After a decade with the economic throttle wide open, China is overheating, and the country's leaders are now grappling with ways to slow the breakneck growth without choking it off. 
 Being able to apply the economic brakes just right to achieve what is known as a soft landing after a spectacular boom is a difficult challenge for any country. It may be doubly so for Beijing's leadership, who are fairly new to the market economy game and who lack many of the finely honed policy tools available to central bankers in the West and Japan. Indeed, economists are deeply split over whether a soft landing or a hard landing is more likely for China.
 Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has sought to assure foreign investors that China is taking significant steps to achieve a soft landing. During a visit to Brussels on Thursday, he said that his government would pursue ''forceful'' measures to ''reduce the speed'' of the economy ''but not a sudden braking.'' He promised to slow the swift increases in the money supply and in bank lending that have fueled the recent acceleration in growth, but said that a loosening of the peg of China's currency to the dollar would have to wait for banking reforms. 
 Much is riding on Beijing's efforts. The global recovery now depends on China as one of its twin engines, along with the United States. A hard landing -- a steep decline in economic growth leading to higher urban unemployment and a sharp drop in imports -- would rattle economies across Asia and around the world.
 But it would probably bear little resemblance to the last economic crisis in the region, the cascade of financial and currency collapses that swept through many East Asian economies (but not China) in 1997 and 1998, a memory still fresh and painful for many investors. 
 If China runs into serious trouble, experts say this would most likely take months to unfold rather than be a financial collapse that becomes apparent in a few weeks, as happened in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea nearly seven years ago.
 ''The problem is more of a long-term affair,'' said Desmond Supple, managing director of Asian research at Barclays Capital. ''If we get a hard landing, it wouldn't be anything like'' the last Asian crisis.
 A soft landing is more probable, say agencies like the International Monetary Fund and some investment banks, with growth gradually slowing to a bit more than 7 percent annually from the 9.7 percent annual pace recorded in the first quarter of this year. 
 Seven percent a year would still be a scorching growth rate in most economies of some size. But Chinese experts say that is the minimum the country needs just to keep urban unemployment from worsening, as millions of migrants from rural areas pour into cities, straining the social fabric and possibly sowing the seeds of political unrest.
 Growth of only 3 percent or 4 percent would feel like a serious economic slump, and zero growth or a contraction would be devastating, the experts say. 
 ''We don't think a really hard landing is a likely scenario'' for the economy as a whole, said Huang Yiping, a Citigroup economist in Hong Kong. But there may be crashes, he said, in a small number of industries where overinvestment has been greatest, adding, ''You probably will see a very, very hard landing in steel investment.''
 To avert such a slump, the Politburo as well as the State Council, China's cabinet, have in the last two weeks each issued strong warnings about excesses in large sectors of the economy like steel, aluminum and real estate. 
 The central bank, meanwhile, has raised bank reserve requirements twice in two months to discourage lending and is strongly hinting at its first interest rate increase since 1995. China's most important step lately, but also the hardest to fine-tune to avoid overdoing, lies in sending the police and prosecutors after local officials who have gone on pursuing grandiose projects despite warnings since June from senior economic officials in Beijing.
 Because China lacks functioning bankruptcy laws and foreclosure proceedings, the government must rely on criminal fraud investigations to deal with wayward companies, said Andy Xie, a Morgan Stanley economist.
 ''Yesterday's entrepreneur is today's 'you stole money, you didn't pay taxes,''' Mr. Xie said, while adding that this approach can chill investment quickly in ways that might be hard to control.
 The Chinese economy faces several, more significant structural problems, some experts say. The country enjoys an immense trade surplus with the United States, with its exports exceeding imports by a ratio of eight to one.
 But with the world as a whole China has, fairly suddenly, slipped into deficit, in large part because it has rapidly outgrown its domestic resources -- raw materials like iron ore and oil -- and must now import them at prices driven up by its growing appetite. 
 Chinese trade statistics, moreover, probably err on the rosy side. Many mainland companies exaggerate their export volume to claim tax credits. Many imports go uncounted because of widespread smuggling to avoid customs duties, which remain steep despite China's pledge to the World Trade Organization to bring them down in stages by 2007.
 Although official figures suggest a much milder problem, Mr. Xie estimates that China's true overall trade deficit this year will be around $90 billion -- just as big, relative to the size of its economy, as the American trade deficit.
 China does not loom large as an export market for the United States. But many Asian nations now depend heavily on selling to China, especially after its overall imports jumped 40 percent last year.
 The Chinese accounted for a third of all the growth in Japan's exports, and a similar share of South Korea's, according to Stephen S. Roach, Morgan Stanley's chief economist, and they took two-thirds of the growth in Taiwan's exports. A sharp slowing of growth in China would hit those economies hard.
 To finance its trade deficit, China must continue to attract substantial foreign investment. Unlike some Southeast Asian nations before 1997, China relies heavily on long-term investments instead of ''hot money'' flowing into stocks. Nor does it bear another Southeast Asian nemesis: large-scale short-term borrowing by banks in dollars to finance domestic loans.
 Unlike Thailand and Indonesia in 1997, China fully guarantees bank deposits, making it far less likely that the country will see crippling runs on banks by depositors demanding their money. And China still links its currency to the dollar, limits its convertibility into other currencies and imposes restrictions on large capital flows -- all steps that insulate it from the global economy. 
 But bankers here say that the way multinationals are financing their investments has changed sharply in the last two years and can increase China's vulnerability to sudden outflows of capital.
 Multinationals used to borrow as much as possible of their investment costs in China from Chinese banks in the local currency, known as the yuan or the renminbi. But more recently, they have borrowed in dollars or euros, betting that the yuan will appreciate in value and make it cheaper to repay their debts. 
 Because of this change in financing, China has been hit with very large inflows of foreign currency that are being swapped for yuan. The same companies would have the legal right, under Chinese laws, to convert large amounts back into dollars to repay these debts, and might do so if China's economy becomes less attractive.
 Even without this risk, the last time China's economy slowed, in 1994, its foreign exchange reserves plunged. Companies resorted to a wide range of tactics, like overcharging their foreign subsidiaries for export shipments, to get money out of the country.
 China has immense reserves now; at more than $400 billion they are the second largest in the world after Japan's, and are believed to be invested mainly in United States Treasury securities. But some economists worry about a run on them nonetheless. 
 ''All the elements of a meltdown are evident, including balance-of-payments risk,'' wrote Carl Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics, in a report on Monday. ''The only question for us is when something might break.''
 Others, like Liang Hong at Goldman Sachs, are more sanguine. They suggest that the government can slow some industry sectors, including real estate, without harming consumer confidence too greatly, and without cutting back on investment in infrastructure to address the economy's bottlenecks. 
 The most crucial bottleneck is electric power. Shortages have become so severe that the Chinese have begun importing power from Russia for the first time, according to a report from the official New China News Agency on Wednesday. 
 Multinational companies, which do not depend on the country's banks to finance their projects, are still building factories in China at a brisk pace: Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler each announced plans for additional assembly plants this week. 
 ''We're still seeing a lot of activity,'' said Michael G.W. Adams, head of Chinese business development for Gammon Skanska, one of Asia's largest construction companies. ''In fact, our prospects have increased in recent weeks.''
 Over all, investment in fixed assets in China rose 43 percent in the first quarter, a pace that makes the American telecommunications and Internet investment booms of the late 1990's look modest by comparison. It took the United States economy several years to work through its excesses when the bubble burst.
 The biggest risks are that China will find itself with another very large round of nonperforming loans, in an already limping banking system, and that economic troubles could stir political unrest. 
 The last true hard landing in China occurred in 1989, around the time of mass demonstrations in Beijing that ended with the killings in Tiananmen Square.
 With that memory, Mr. Supple said, ''The government's very afraid of the unemployment consequences of a hard landing.''

It was the last sustained rise, not the last one over all. (There was a rise of 1.75 percentage point from June 1999 to May 2000.)

Regulators File Suit Against Pimco Adviser
The Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit against an adviser to the Pimco stock funds, accusing it of permitting a hedge fund to make billions of dollars worth of trades in and out of its portfolios.
 The S.E.C.'s civil complaint was filed nearly two months after a similar case was brought against the adviser, PEA Capital, and related entities by the New Jersey attorney general. But the S.E.C.'s suit differs because it does not name the managers of the Pimco bond funds as defendants. [Page C2.]

HEADLINE: Bush Proposes a Plan to Aid Opponents of Castro in Cuba

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6 

 BODY:
President Bush announced a plan on Thursday to use military aircraft to help American broadcasters reach Cuba and to increase sharply the money for Cuban critics of the government of President Fidel Castro.
 In a White House ceremony to mark his receipt of a nearly 500-page report on Cuba by a presidential commission, Mr. Bush said his actions would help hasten an end to the Castro government, which has held power for 45 years.
 The measures, which include further restrictions on travel and cash transfers to Cuba, were embraced by Republican Cuban-American lawmakers and other adherents of a hard-line position toward Havana, and they were expected to be viewed as provocative by Mr. Castro. 
 But the moves ran into a wall of criticism by Democrats and a bipartisan group of lawmakers, mostly from farm states, who are seeking to take the policy in the opposite direction. Over the administration's objections, Congress has steadily sought to increase travel and trade with Cuba in recent years.
 Representative Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the lone Cuban-American Democrat in Congress, accused Mr. Bush of pandering to Cuban exiles in South Florida, who White House advisers have acknowledged are central to Mr. Bush's re-election strategy.
 ''The need and timing of a White House Cuba Commission and its release of a report today is highly dubious and politically transparent,'' Mr. Menendez said. 
 Other critics questioned the plan's expense. Officials said the administration would cover the costs by taking up to $59 million from other foreign spending accounts.
 Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the ranking member of the Finance Committee, said the new plan amounted to a misuse of taxpayer money.
 ''At a time when the United States faces very real terrorist threats in the Middle East and elsewhere, the administration's absurd and increasingly bizarre obsession with Cuba is more than just a shame, it's a dangerous diversion from reality,'' Mr. Baucus said. 
 The president declined a proposal to cut the payments that Cuban Americans send to relatives in Cuba, ending an internal squabble within the commission, officials said. Proponents of cutting or freezing remittances, which have been valued by the United Nations at more than $800 million a year, said it would deprive the Castro government of cash, but opponents said it would hurt the most vulnerable people in Cuba.
 The president's plan calls for more closely supervising the cash transfers and limiting them to direct family members who are not Communist Party officials. He also called for scaling back family visits from once a year to once every three years, and cutting back on educational travel to curtail what officials say is disguised tourism.
 Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Miami Republican, praised Mr. Bush for striking a balance between humanitarian impulses and the desire to keep cash from reaching Mr. Castro.
 ''Closer scrutiny of remittance regulations and travel permits will help to ensure the Castro regime does not plunder the Cuban-American exile community's hard work and contributions to their family members suffering in the island,'' she said.
 But critics countered that the Treasury Department, which enforces economic sanctions, is already spending an inordinate amount of time on Cuba, largely in response to domestic political pressure. Of the 120 employees at the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Senator Baucus said, 21 are dedicated to enforcing the Cuba embargo and only 4 to tracking the finances of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.
 Administration officials said the best-financed part of the program would be to provide $36 million for Cuban dissidents, youth groups and others, most likely in materials, not cash, delivered through third parties. 
 Roger F. Noriega, the assistant secretary of state for the Western Hemisphere, predicted that more dissidents would risk their freedom in coming months and years, despite a crackdown last year by Mr. Castro that sent about 75 prominent critics to jail, many for allegedly conspiring with the United States. 
 Mr. Bush approved spending up to $18 million to use a specially equipped plane to broadcast the Spanish-language government TV station, and its radio partner, to Cuba. The plane, an EC-130 known as Commando Solo, has been used in psychological operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Haiti and Panama and may be able to overcome Cuban jamming as it flies in international waters near the island. TV Marti has been effectively jammed since it was set up in 1990.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Warns of Deficit As Big Threat to Economy

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned on Thursday that rising federal deficits may be the biggest threat to the nation's longterm economic stability.
 In a speech that ranged from Americans' household debt to the nation's huge foreign debt, Mr. Greenspan said he was optimistic that most financial imbalances could be reduced smoothly through the effect of normal market forces.
 ''But that is certainly not the case for our yawning fiscal deficit,'' he told a conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. ''Our fiscal prospects are, in my judgment, a significant obstacle to long-term stability because the budget deficit is not readily subject to correction by market forces.'' 
 Mr. Greenspan refrained from directly criticizing either the Bush administration or Congress, and he made no reference to the bitter battles under way in Congress over making President Bush's tax cuts permanent.
 But his comments suggested growing alarm about the budget deficit, which is likely to run more than $400 billion this year and is widely expected to remain high even though tax revenues are now rising because of faster economic growth.
 In his speech, Mr. Greenspan appeared to be defending the kind of consumer debt that Federal Reserve policies have encouraged while criticizing the budget deficits that are outside its control.
 The central bank's prolonged policy of very low interest rates has fueled a surge in consumer borrowing over the last several years -- most of that in the form of bigger home mortgages and home equity loans, but some in the form of higher credit card debt.
 Mr. Greenspan said much of the added consumer debt had gone hand in hand with a rise in home ownership to a record level of 69 percent. ''It can scarcely be argued that the substitutions of debt service for rent materially impaired the financial state of the new homeowner,'' he said. The federal budget deficit, by contrast, is the one big area of American borrowing that is outside the central bank's control. 
 Both kinds of borrowing helped push the current account deficit -- the nation's indebtedness to the rest of the world -- to a record of more than $500 billion last year.
 In recent months, Mr. Greenspan has repeatedly urged Congress to reinstate ''pay as you go'' rules for federal budgets, under which tax cuts and new spending programs would have to be financed with tax increases or spending reductions in other areas.
 President Bush and most Republicans in Congress are adamantly opposed to applying any such requirements to tax cuts, because such a move would derail Mr. Bush's goal of permanently extending the tax cuts from 2001 and 2003.
 But Mr. Greenspan stayed out of that argument on Thursday, perhaps because he was reluctant to be drawn into the pitched and partisan battle over that issue in Congress.
 While noting that ''a free lunch has still to be invented,'' the Fed's chairman said globalization and technological innovation had made it much easier for the United States to attract a major share of the world's savings without dire consequences.
 The changes, he said, have created ''a paradigm somewhat different from that which fit much of our earlier post-World War II experience.''
 Staunchly defending free trade and brushing aside political anger over ''outsourcing'' of jobs to foreign countries, Mr. Greenspan said that expanded trade would make it easier rather than harder for the United States to reduce its foreign borrowing.
 As he has before, Mr. Greenspan warned political leaders against erecting trade barriers in an attempt to shield American companies from foreign competition. ''Protectionism, some signs of which have recently emerged, could significantly erode global flexibility and, hence, undermine the global adjustment process,'' he said.
 Though Mr. Greenspan said his outlook for the next few years had ''brightened,'' he was gloomier about the long-term outlook, which he described as ''opaque.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Forces Move on Outskirts Of Najaf, Installing a Governor

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and DEXTER FILKINS; Edward Wong reported from Karbala, Iraq, for this article and Dexter Filkins from Baghdad.

DATELINE: KARBALA, Iraq, May 6 

 BODY:
American forces on Thursday captured the governor's office on the outskirts of the holy city of Najaf and quickly installed a new Iraqi leader there. It was the most aggressive move yet against the radical Shiite cleric, Moktada al-Sadr, who has led a monthlong resistance there. 
 The seizure of the governor's office came on another day of heavy fighting with Mr. Sadr's militia in southern Iraq. In a skirmish near the neighboring city of Kufa, where the bulk of Mr. Sadr's militia is concentrated, the Americans said they had killed 41 insurgents. 
 As American troops secured the governor's office, L. Paul Bremer III, the top American administrator in Iraq, announced the appointment of the new governor, Adnan al-Zurufi, and promised the restoration of American-backed authority in Najaf.
 Mr. Zurufi, an opponent of Saddam Hussein who lived in exile for a time in Detroit, appealed to ordinary Iraqis and the country's religious leaders to help him disarm the militias in the city. Then he headed for the governor's mansion, where American officials said he started work right away. 
 The American move into Najaf, part of an operation that began earlier this week, reflected a high-risk strategy designed to subdue Mr. Sadr without alienating Iraq's Shiite majority population. The 31-year-old cleric and his armed followers, known as the Mahdi Army, took control of the two cities last month. 
 So far, in operations in Najaf and here in Karbala, another holy Shiite city, the Americans have avoided moving into the city centers, where the holiest shrines are. The governor's mansion is less than two miles from the Imam Ali shrine in Najaf, said Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, the chief military spokesman in Baghdad, and near the military base the Americans took over from the departing Spanish troops last month. 
 American military operations continued in Karbala, seizing a large store of weapons being used by the Mahdi Army and killing one insurgent in an amusement park. Also Thursday, a videotape of a blindfolded man said to be a Pentagon worker in Iraq was shown on an Arabic-language television station. 
 The American operation against Mr. Sadr began Tuesday, just hours after moderate Shiite leaders in Baghdad issued a statement calling on Mr. Sadr to take his army out of the two cities. 
 The move bolstered the Americans' confidence in going forward with assaults on Mr. Sadr, a 31-year-old firebrand. The Americans seemed to be gambling that the insurgency that broke out in April was rapidly running its course. But the moderate Shiite leaders also warned the Americans against attacking Najaf and Karbala, where, they said, a misstep could turn the country's Shiites decisively against them. 
 Mr. Sadr and his militia have sought refuge in Najaf and Karbala in the hopes that Shiites across this country and elsewhere will turn against the Americans if the occupation forces invade two of the holiest cities of Shiite Islam. 
 But the Americans seemed, at least for now, to be avoiding the kind of all-out attack they mounted in Falluja, the Sunni stronghold west of Baghdad. A massive assault there by American marines last month left hundreds of Iraqis dead and inflamed anti-American sentiment across the country, including in Shiite areas.
 A senior American military officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said his soldiers would try to strike the Mahdi Army inside the two cities while refraining from harming its holy sites. 
 ''Najaf is not the target; Moktada al-Sadr remains the target,'' the American officer said. ''We certainly have an obligation to restore Iraqi authority. We now have a governor who can go into the city so he can start exercising authority.'' 
 It was unclear how ordinary Iraqis would react to the American military action. Administrators at two hospitals in Najaf said Thursday that 5 civilians had been killed in the fighting and 24 wounded. 
 An Iraqi reporter working for The New York Times who was at Al Hakim hospital in Najaf said there was gunfire around the hospital. 
 The Americans sent a convoy of eight American tanks into a neighborhood in the southwest corner of Karbala that is believed to be a stronghold of the Mahdi Army. 
 In Baghdad, American officials also said today that two American soldiers were killed and two were wounded in a roadside bomb explosion just before midnight on Wednesday. According to the Reuters news agency, three American soldiers were killed in clashes in Diwaniya, where the Americans are also conducting operations against the Mahdi Army. 
 The video that showed what appeared to be a new Western hostage in Iraq was shown on Al Arabiya, a television network based in Dubai. The network said the tape was from a militant group that calls itself Islamic Fury and said the hostage's name was Aban Elias, a civilian engineer working for the Pentagon who was taken hostage on May 3. 
 The group made no demands in the tape. In Washington, Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, confirmed that the man in the tape was an American citizen but offered no other details. 
 Although Mr. Bremer and the new governor of Najaf, Mr. Zurufi, promised a restoration of an American-backed administration in the city, it was unclear how much authority the new leader would exercise. When the Mahdi Army took control of the city last month, the local government and police force collapsed. The previous governor, Haider Mayali, fled to Iran. 
 But with a scheduled transfer of sovereignty to Iraqis less than two months away, American officials say they want to resolve the standoffs in Najaf, Karbala and Falluja. 
 In remarks on Thursday, Mr. Bremer made it clear he intended to crush Mr. Sadr's rebellion, one way or another. ''There is no room in Iraq for the kind of lawless, self-interested behavior we have seen over recent weeks,'' Mr. Bremer said. ''First, Sayyid Moktada must face Iraqi justice for the crime of which he has been accused and, second, his armed followers must disarm -- as must the members of all such groups.''
 American military officers say their intention is still to ''kill or capture'' Mr. Sadr. In his remarks, Mr. Bremer asked the Iraqi people for help. ''No individual is above the law, no group is beyond the law,'' he said. ''That is why we encourage Najaf community leaders to come forth with proposals to bring matters to a reasoned and just resolution.''
 For his part, Mr. Zurufi also said his goal was to disarm the militias and restore American-backed authority there. He also promised to bring economic development and tourism to the city. Like Mr. Bremer, Mr. Zurufi appealed to local Iraqis. 
 ''Now, I, as governor of Najaf, ask the religious authorities, the Maarja, the political parties and organizations, and the civil and humanitarian organizations, to help me achieve the goals we all seek,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Oil Crunch

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Before the start of the Iraq war his media empire did so much to promote, Rupert Murdoch explained the payoff: ''The greatest thing to come out of this for the world economy, if you could put it that way, would be $20 a barrel for oil.'' Crude oil prices in New York rose to almost $40 a barrel yesterday, a 13-year high. 
 Those who expected big economic benefits from the war were, of course, utterly wrong about how things would go in Iraq. But the disastrous occupation is only part of the reason that oil is getting more expensive; the other, which will last even if we somehow find a way out of the quagmire, is the intensifying competition for a limited world oil supply. 
 Thanks to the mess in Iraq -- including a continuing campaign of sabotage against oil pipelines -- oil exports have yet to recover to their prewar level, let alone supply the millions of extra barrels each day the optimists imagined. And the fallout from the war has spooked the markets, which now fear terrorist attacks on oil installations in Saudi Arabia, and are starting to worry about radicalization throughout the Middle East. (It has been interesting to watch people who lauded George Bush's leadership in the war on terror come to the belated realization that Mr. Bush has given Osama bin Laden exactly what he wanted.)
 Even if things had gone well, however, Iraq couldn't have given us cheap oil for more than a couple of years at most, because the United States and other advanced countries are now competing for oil with the surging economies of Asia. 
 Oil is a resource in finite supply; no major oil fields have been found since 1976, and experts suspect that there are no more to find. Some analysts argue that world production is already at or near its peak, although most say that technological progress, which allows the further exploitation of known sources like the Canadian tar sands, will allow output to rise for another decade or two. But the date of the physical peak in production isn't the really crucial question. 
 The question, instead, is when the trend in oil prices will turn decisively upward. That upward turn is inevitable as a growing world economy confronts a resource in limited supply. But when will it happen? Maybe it already has. 
 I know, of course, that such predictions have been made before, during the energy crisis of the 1970's. But the end of that crisis has been widely misunderstood: prices went down not because the world found new sources of oil, but because it found ways to make do with less.
 During the 1980's, oil consumption dropped around the world as the delayed effects of the energy crisis led to the use of more fuel-efficient cars, better insulation in homes and so on. Although economic growth led to a gradual recovery, as late as 1993 world oil consumption was only slightly higher than it had been in 1979. In the United States, oil consumption didn't regain its 1979 level until 1997. 
 Since then, however, world demand has grown rapidly: the daily world consumption of oil is 12 million barrels higher than it was a decade ago, roughly equal to the combined production of Saudi Arabia and Iran. It turns out that America's love affair with gas guzzlers, shortsighted as it is, is not the main culprit: the big increases in demand have come from booming developing countries. China, in particular, still consumes only 8 percent of the world's oil -- but it accounted for 37 percent of the growth in world oil consumption over the last four years. 
 The collision between rapidly growing world demand and a limited world supply is the reason why the oil market is so vulnerable to jitters. Maybe we'll get through this bad patch, and oil will fall back toward $30 a barrel. But if that happens, it will be only a temporary respite.
 In a way it's ironic. Lately we've been hearing a lot about competition from Chinese manufacturing and Indian call centers. But a different kind of competition -- the scramble for oil and other resources -- poses a much bigger threat to our prosperity. 
 So what should we be doing? Here's a hint: We can neither drill nor conquer our way out of the problem. Whatever we do, oil prices are going up. What we have to do is adapt.

HEADLINE: Europe Lets Rate Stand; Britain Opts For Increase

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, May 6 

 BODY:
The Bank of England raised its benchmark interest rate Thursday to the highest level since 2001, while the European Central Bank opted to keep its rate at a 60-year low, illustrating the divide between the economies in Britain and the rest of Europe. 
 In Britain, runaway increases in home prices and widely available credit have fueled a consumer spending and borrowing boom, and the Bank of England seems to feel it has a mandate to rein in the trend, economists say.
 Continental Europe, meanwhile, is slowly recovering from a downturn, with some corporations expressing cautious optimism, but most consumers remaining tightfisted. 
 Over the short term, ''indicators available still provide mixed evidence'' about Europe's economic health, said Jean-Claude Trichet, the central bank president, at a news conference on Thursday in Helsinki, Finland. ''All in all, they suggest that the recovery of real economic activity in the euro area has continued into 2004, albeit at a modest pace.''
 The central bank left its benchmark rate at 2 percent, where it has been for 11 months. Some economists had speculated that Mr. Trichet would lower rates to foster growth. 
 The Bank of England raised its repurchase rate on Thursday by 25 basis points, to 4.25 percent, the third increase in six months. Britain does not use the euro, though it is a member of the European Union, and it sets its own interest rates. The country has the highest base rates of any of the Group of 7 industrialized nations. 
 ''Retail spending continues to be robust, underpinned by income growth and unexpectedly strong house price inflation,'' the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee said in a statement. ''Investment prospects have improved. Inflationary pressures are likely to build despite a higher level of sterling than at the beginning of the year.'' 
 Rising home prices in Britain have allowed consumers to take out ever bigger loans against the value of their homes, and many are spending the equity freely. Consumer debt is at a record 83 percent of gross domestic product, versus 80 percent in the United States and 49 percent in the euro zone countries, according to Merrill Lynch. British consumers, however, are more directly affected by changes in interest rates than Americans, because most mortgages have adjustable rates. 
 Gerald Lane, an equity strategist with Morley Fund Management in London, said the Bank of England's policy of slowly raising rates carried some risks.
 ''The British consumer is like a frog,'' Mr. Lane said. ''If you put a frog in a pan of cold water and slowly turn up the heat, he'll die, rather than jumping out.'' Ultimately, he said, the strategy could result in a collapse in housing prices, as consumers fail to rein in spending until it is too late. 
 Others argued that because the Bank of England is responsible for the health of the banking system, as well as for hitting a specific inflation goal, it has few options.
 The Bank of England has ''only one instrument,'' Ian Stewart, an economist with Merrill Lynch in London, said. ''The hope is you'll get a stronger U.K. economy that leads to a rise in manufacturing, exports and investment.''
 Most economists predict that growth rates in Britain and the rest of Europe will continue to diverge in 2005, with Britain's growth slowing and the euro zone's quickening. Some speculate that the Federal Reserve may follow the Bank of England by raising rates in June to curb consumer spending in the United States.

HEADLINE: Conservative Methodists Propose Schism Over Gay Rights

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, May 6 

 BODY:
Frustrated by years of rancor between the left and the right in the United Methodist Church, conservative members proposed Thursday that the denomination dissolve itself and split into separate churches.
 The call for separation came on the 10th day of the church's quadrennial general conference, a marathon policy-setting meeting that has only highlighted the church's gridlock over homosexuality and scriptural infallibility.
 After losing several critical votes this week, hundreds of gay clergy members and lay people and their supporters paraded through the convention hall on Thursday singing the Methodist hymn, ''We Are the Church.'' Their leaders insisted that they had no plans to leave the church because they expected the gay rights cause would inevitably prevail. 
 Although a schism is far from imminent, the proposal is part of a long-term strategy and an indication that Methodist conservatives intend to use the gay issue as a wedge to precipitate a fracture -- just as conservatives have in the Episcopal Church USA, in which some churches are forming a rival network. Methodist conservatives do not plan to advance the proposal here but to build support for it among church members in advance of the next convention in 2008. 
 In nearly every mainline Protestant denomination, from the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. to the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, conservatives are mounting increasingly organized challenges to denominations long associated with theological diversity and liberal causes. 
 ''It is time for us to end this cycle of pain we are inflicting on each other,'' said the Rev. Dr. William Hinson, president of the Confessing Movement, a conservative Methodist network, who presented the proposal for separation at a breakfast meeting of conservative supporters. 
 ''There is a great gulf fixed between those of us who are centered on Scripture and our friends who are of another persuasion,'' said Dr. Hinson, the retired pastor of the First United Methodist Church of Houston. ''Repeatedly they have spoken of the need to get our church in step with our culture. We, on the other hand, have no desire to be the chaplain to an increasingly godless society.''
 With 8.3 million members in the United States, United Methodists are the country's third-largest Christian denomination, behind Roman Catholics and Southern Baptists. More than many churches, Methodists represent the nation's geographic, economic and political diversity. President Bush is a Methodist, as is Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 Liberals said they were offended that the conservatives seemed to be offering to buy them out in order to be rid of them. The Rev. Troy G. Plummer, executive director of the Reconciling Ministries Network, an alliance of churches that support inclusion of openly gay people, said that the idea of a split would have been anathema to Methodism's 18th-century founder, John Wesley.
 ''John Wesley said schism is sin,'' Mr. Plummer said.
 The conservatives' proposal for an amicable divorce stunned many here because conservatives appear to many church observers to be gradually gaining ground. Areas where the church is growing, in the South and Midwest, are increasingly evangelical in theology and worship style. The church has also been skewed toward conservatism with growth in Africa, Asia and Latin America, whose delegates make up about 20 percent of the voters at the general conference. 
 The conservative movement, whose members call themselves orthodox or evangelical, has also been bankrolled by some of the same conservative foundations that give money to conservative political causes. The Institute for Religion and Democracy, which backs a move to the right for the Methodists and other Protestant churches and coordinates initiatives to influence several mainline denominations, has received funding from Richard Mellon Scaife and the John M. Olin Foundation, which also fund conservative political causes, according to a recent book, ''United Methodism at Risk,'' researched and written by church members concerned about a conservative takeover.
 In multiple votes on gay issues at the conference here, the nearly 1,000 delegates have consistently opposed changing their church doctrine to include acceptance of gay sex or openly gay ministers. But the votes have ranged from 60 to 40 percent to as close as 55 to 45 percent, giving both sides ammunition to claim that at this general convention they gained ground since the general conference four years ago.
 There are 36,000 Methodist churches in the United States. About 1,400 belong to the Confessing Movement, the conservative, evangelical alliance which is led by Dr. Hinson. 
 On the liberal side is the Reconciling Ministries Network, which counts 194 member churches, welcomes openly gay people and often allies itself with other liberal caucuses. 
 In a meeting with reporters, four active bishops and one who is retired said that they had been taken by surprise and saddened by the proposal. 
 ''We share a church that's a moderate church, that's pretty centrist,'' said Bishop Warner H. Brown Jr., of the Denver area. ''You cannot say that either a more liberal or a more conservative view is unwelcome in this church.''
 The Methodist Church divided over slavery in 1844, but reunited in 1939. Since then, the bishops said, there had never been another proposal to split.
 The conservatives are proposing that the church convene a task force made up of liberals, centrists and conservatives. In the separation, they propose, churches would keep their own property, and clergy would keep their pensions. 
 Conservatives, however, suggested that they had no intention of actually presenting the proposal to the delegates in Pittsburgh.
 Mark D. Tooley, who works at the Institute for Religion and Democracy and directs United Methodist Action, its program focused on Methodists, said in an interview that the proposal was intended not for the delegates here, who are ''institutionalists'' likely to defend church unity, but for church members and clergy around the country. 
 The strategy, he said, is to float the idea so it would be embraced by church members around the country, both conservatives and liberals, who would come to see that separation is a practical solution. Four years from now, after the proposal has had time to be thoroughly digested, the actual dismantling of the church could begin to be put in motion when the church meets again for its next general conference, he said. 
 Mr. Tooley said that conservatives had been hoping to engineer a divorce from liberals for years. He said that a large group of conservative caucuses in the church supported the idea, even though Dr. Hinson said in making his proposal that he was speaking only for himself. 
 The proposal was made at a breakfast sponsored by the church's conservative ''Good News'' caucus. The free breakfast buffet, financed by foundations, in the hotel adjoining the conference center draws about 300 attendees daily, including many voting delegates. 
 With their eggs and bacon, convention delegates get a power-point presentation showing them how to vote on the legislation coming up that day.
 James R. Wood, a professor emeritus of sociology at Indiana University (Bloomington) who has studied the changing views of Methodists on homosexuality and has been attending the conference, said of the conservatives, ''It's an efficient, highly organized grass-roots movement.''
 He predicted, however, that the proposal could backfire. Most Methodists are centrists, he said, and are likely to reject the idea that disagreements over homosexuality are a reason to divide the church.
 But he said that the initiative was an indication of the conservatives' growing confidence and muscle.
 ''A decade ago, the conservatives just wanted to get control of their property so they could leave,'' Dr. Wood said. ''Now they feel secure enough to say, we'll give you your property and pensions so that you can leave.''

HEADLINE: Kerry Wants $30 Billion For Teachers

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: COLTON, Calif., May 6 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry called Thursday for a ''new bargain'' with teachers, proposing to spend $30 billion over 10 years to recruit, coach and reward better teachers. In return, he said, he would require stiffer testing of new teachers and swifter ways to remove poor ones from the classroom.
 Fleshing out the details of his education plan as he wrapped up a three-day West Coast swing, Mr. Kerry told an audience at a high school here, near San Bernardino, that he would attract, or keep from quitting, 500,000 teachers over four years in what aides said would be the biggest federal expenditure of money for teacher salaries yet. 
 A major part of his plan, and one that could face opposition from teachers' unions, is to set aside $9 billion to get school districts to raise teacher salaries across the board but also to reward teachers for demonstrating excellence, using measurements including their students' improvement on standardized tests.
 ''Greater achievement ought to be a goal,'' Mr. Kerry said, ''and it ought to be able to command greater pay, just the way it does in every other sector of professional employment.'' 
 Mr. Kerry's speech, fittingly enough, came a day before he is to speak to the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist group that was an incubator for many of the Clinton administration's policies on economics, welfare and trade.
 Since locking up the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. Kerry has been dropping the populist rhetoric he employed in the primaries and playing up instead his moderate New Democrat credentials as a deficit hawk and an ''entrepreneurial,'' not a ''redistributionist,'' Democrat.
 His proposal Thursday on teacher pay, too, went against the grain of liberal orthodoxy, as a partisan, teacher-heavy crowd showed in its reaction.
 ''I believe we need to offer teachers more pay,'' he began, interrupted by applause. 
 He continued: ''More training, more career choices, and more options for education. And we must ask more in return. That's the bargain.'' And there was silence.
 Mr. Kerry said he would demand accountability of poor teachers by setting up speedy evaluation processes, including peer review, to remove them. 
 ''Some people who choose to go into teaching will be great, but some will not,'' he said. ''It's like any profession. Not everybody always has the ability to make it.''
 He said he would ensure due process for teachers through their contracts with schools. 
 ''People deserve protection as we always have protected them against politics, and personality, and whimsical decision making,'' he said, ''but at the same time no one can have a lock on a job forever, no matter what.'' 
 Kati Haycock, director of the Education Trust, a nonpartisan organization in Washington, said Mr. Kerry was showing political courage by taking on pay-for-performance and risking the ire of the National Education Association.
 ''It's gutsy,'' Ms. Haycock said, ''in the sense that it's not often that Democrats push teachers on pay for performance, and more pay for teaching in high-poverty schools, which is exactly what we need, but what the largest teachers union, the N.E.A., has opposed wholeheartedly.''
 A spokesman for the National Education Association, Michael Pons, called Mr. Kerry's the ''most comprehensive'' proposal on teacher quality he had ever seen from a presidential candidate and said that it included much that the union wanted: higher pay, mentoring and professional development programs and heightened standards for new teachers.
 He said the N.E.A. opposed Mr. Kerry's idea of bonuses for new math and science teachers. But he noted that even some of the union's affiliates -- in Arizona, New Mexico, Denver and North Carolina -- had embraced pay-for-performance measures much like Mr. Kerry's.
 ''I think there's something to work from there,'' Mr. Pons said.
 Mr. Kerry's plan includes $5 billion to send teams of principals and teachers into failing schools for several weeks to help them turn around.
 About half of the money Mr. Kerry proposes spending would be used for $5,000 bonuses to those who teach in geographical and subject areas with teacher shortages, like inner cities and poor rural communities, and math and the sciences. The bonuses were part of an education trust he proposed in November. He also called then for a $10,000 tax credit to steer good teachers to failing schools, but that item has been dropped, aides said.
 Mr. Kerry's plan also envisions applying new standards to colleges of education, by monitoring their graduates as they take jobs in schools, seeing how much their students learn and making future federal aid to those colleges of education contingent on their graduates' meeting federally set performance levels.

HEADLINE: He Does Get Some Respect, but the Critics Still Have His Number

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., May 5 

 BODY:
Not long ago, William Clay Ford Jr., chief executive of Ford Motor, found himself signing autographs for some young admirers. 
 ''I only have two heroes in my life, and he's one of them,'' said Christopher Larsch, a 12-year-old clearly being groomed for management by his mother, a Ford accountant. Chris, wearing an outsize Detroit Red Wings jersey, was among a throng crowding Mr. Ford at company headquarters here during Take Our Children to Work Day. 
 Chris's other hero? Bill Gates. 
 Of course, the chief executive autograph seems kind of 1999. What about the Red Wings, Chris? Steve Yzerman? Brett Hull? 
 ''It's not the same,'' he said, explaining that Mr. Ford was at the top of his list, ''because of what he's done for the company. But he'll also just walk up to you like a normal person and shake your hand.'' 
 Chris isn't the only person in Dearborn feeling better these days about Mr. Ford, 47, now that he has pulled his great-grandfather's company out of a sinkhole. After losing $6.4 billion, cumulatively, in 2001 and 2002, Ford eked out $495 million in net profit last year and more than quadrupled that in the first quarter to beat its Detroit rival, General Motors, for the first time in three years.
 ''It's really gratifying to see what we're doing pay off,'' Mr. Ford said in an interview here on Monday. ''There has been no shortage of skeptics.''
 An espresso-chugging baby boomer, Mr. Ford is the scion of two auto families, the Fords and Firestones. He is also vice chairman of the Detroit Lions football team, and wealthy enough to easily afford to earmark his $1.5 million bonus to scholarships for children of Ford workers, including an older brother of Chris Larsch. 
 But outside Dearborn, there are still plenty of skeptics. Wall Street is encouraged but regards Ford and G.M. as overly dependent on North American sport utility and truck sales, plus profits from car loans that could get harder to generate as interest rates rise. Prospects are darkened by Toyota's long shadow, Hyundai's momentum and the general saturation of the American car market, which has led the Big Three into a bruising discounting battle. 
 Environmental groups remain wary of a man they once thought could be a rare industrialist ally. One group, Bluewater Network, recently ran an ad depicting Mr. Ford as Pinocchio for backing away from the company's goal of improving S.U.V. fuel economy by 25 percent. Safety issues persist four years after the scandal over Ford Explorers equipped with Firestone tires. These include a recent string of fuel leak problems in Ford police cruisers and lawsuits over faulty doors that open during crashes. 
 ''There are some encouraging signs, but he's not come close to dealing with Ford's legacy of producing dangerous, gas guzzling S.U.V.'s,'' said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, which last year published a blistering report on the company's handling of lawsuits involving the discontinued Ford Bronco II.
 ''If he's going to live up to his image, as someone who is going to turn this company around in every way, socially and environmentally,'' he added, ''that has to be dealt with.'' 
 Signs of a fresh environmental strategy are finally emerging. In the early fall, the company will sell the first S.U.V. with hybrid electric technology, a version of its Ford Escape. Ford will be the world's third automaker, after Toyota and Honda, to offer a hybrid with substantial fuel-saving ability. 
 Mr. Ford said this year that the company now thought that higher gas prices might well persist long into the future. That's a big problem for Ford: among the major automakers, it has the lowest average fuel economy, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, largely because of its high proportion of truck sales.
 ''If you look at where society is headed, whether it's the Kyoto compact, whether it's the Hollywood movie that's coming out this summer on global warming, all of those things will truly have an impact on the debate,'' Mr. Ford said, referring to ''The Day After Tomorrow,'' a doomsday movie about global warming to be released this month. 
 ''I don't want Ford to be caught unaware or for us to be always saying no, we can't do something,'' he added. 
 This month, Ford reopened its storied River Rouge plant here in Dearborn. Once Henry Ford's showpiece and a symbol of early-20th-century American industrial might, where steel came in one end and cars out the other, it is the younger Ford's plant now. With a skylight-strewn roof covered with a special plant that sucks up carbon emissions and nets surrounding it to grow greenery, it could be the first Ivy League auto plant.
 It also is a reflection of modern, so-called flexible manufacturing. The steel mill was sold long ago and the parts building outsourced to suppliers. The plant that once built the Model A -- and only the Model A -- can now build nine different vehicles, from sedans to the F-Series pickup.
 ''During the last two and a half years, when things were not going well here and we were counting every penny, a lot of people said to me, 'You've got to kill the Rouge,''' he said. ''To me that was our future. To me it would be like not making a Mustang.''
 Mr. Ford faced down the critics, both inside and outside Ford. ''We could have really made the short term look better,'' he added, ''by canceling the Rouge, cutting product spending, not investing in new hybrids and things like that.'' 
 When Mr. Ford ousted Jacques Nasser as chief executive in 2001, the company was mired in red ink and wasteful practices built up during the flush times of the late 1990's. Just about everyone was angry, from customers to dealers to suppliers. Mr. Ford has tried to emphasize stability, consistency and a touch of paternalism at a company that has not been run by a Ford since the late 1970's. 
 One crucial factor in Toyota's successes, he said, is that it has not had a new chief executive uprooting strategies every few years. It just builds quality vehicles. 
 With an eye to longevity, Mr. Ford shuffled his management team last month, cementing a younger tier of executives. Five men are leading candidates to one day succeed Nicholas V. Scheele, Ford's president, and follow such notables as Robert S. McNamara and Lee A. Iacocca. They are Mark Fields and Lewis W.K. Booth, the top European executives; Greg C. Smith, who runs Ford's operations in the Americas; Mark A. Schulz, Asia and Africa chief; and Philip R. Martens, product development chief in North America. 
 ''In terms of operating management, those five guys are kind of the next generation,'' Mr. Ford said. ''Ultimately I'll judge them on their results but also their ability to work together.''
 Much of the improvement has been achieved through cost-cutting and wringing inefficiency out of a system that has been an industry laggard. The corporate cupboard is also being stocked with new Fords, Lincolns and Mercuries that will arrive over the next 18 months, including several crucial vehicles, like the large Ford Five Hundred sedan that will make its debut in the late summer. 
 Aspects of the company's strategy are controversial. Ford has been willing to lose market share in the United States by giving up discounted deals to rental companies and corporate fleets and reducing incentive spending. That paid off in the first quarter, but there are questions about how long it can be sustained after weak April sales. Ford just enchanced the deals offered on some of its marquee S.U.V.'s. 
 ''He should be feeling better,'' said Stephen Girsky, a Morgan Stanley auto analyst. ''They've been pulled back from the brink.''
 ''On the other hand, the company's share loss is alarming,'' Mr. Girsky added. ''The profit picture suggests they're focusing on profits instead of share, which you can do as long as the market is growing. If the market is shrinking, or if capacity is coming into the market, it becomes a challenge.''
 Having too many auto factories in the industry is already a problem for Ford, and it could get worse with Nissan entering the big pickup and S.U.V. market and Toyota and Hyundai breaking ground on new plants. But Ford may be better positioned than G.M. to cope. 
 Chris Struve, an analyst at Fitch, the debt rating service, said the short-term outlook was better for Ford than for G.M., because Ford has plans to keep production under better control. He left G.M. with a negative outlook this week but lifted Ford's.
 ''When we look forward a year or two, we don't see Ford worse than we see them today,'' he said. ''Arguably we see them better. The probability of them doing worse is fairly close to zero.''

HEADLINE: West Point Is Scouted As a Model For Kabul

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WEST POINT, N.Y., May 7 

 BODY:
Afghan officers studying how to create a military academy for their war-scarred country are walking in the footsteps of Grant and Patton.
 A delegation trying to start the National Military Academy of Afghanistan has been getting a cadet's-eye view of the United States Military Academy at West Point this week -- observing classes, having lunch in the mess hall and watching drills. The visit amounts to a cram session at a storied place that has produced a long line of American military leaders. 
 ''To start the new academy, we needed the help of our friends here,'' said Maj. Gen. Abdul Razaq, who would be the Afghan academy's commander.
 American military officials see an Afghan military academy as part of the rebuilding effort in a country riven by ethnic strife and economic problems after years of war. The academy could help to foster a stable democracy by producing graduates loyal to a national identity instead of to a warlord, Col. George Forsythe said.
 Asked why the United States is helping create a foreign academy, Colonel Forsythe said, ''So that my grandson doesn't have to go to Afghanistan and fight.''
 For now, the Afghans have little more than a design, a name and a preferred site in Kabul. But General Razaq said the academy could start accepting students next spring, a timetable that Colonel Forsythe called tough but possible.
 The visit by General Razaq and two other officers is the second part of an effort begun last fall with an overseas trip by American officers. Afghan officials told the Americans they wanted a modern military academy to produce an educated cadre of military leaders who could help build up the nation, Colonel Forsythe said.
 The colonel and his colleagues spent more than a month in Afghanistan developing a curriculum, an admissions process and a command structure as well as an honor code akin to West Point's own code, ''Duty, Honor, Country.'' ''We would write goals, translate it into Dari and take it to the Afghans,'' he said.
 All week, Afghan officers were briefed on what is taught at West Point and how it is run. Colonel Forsythe said the objective was to apply some West Point concepts to a new academy that would reflect the host country's culture, not to create a carbon copy.
 The Afghan general, in a green dress uniform, spent some time this week mingling with the gray-clad cadets. He said he was particularly impressed with a demonstration of engineering projects.
 Standing at ease as cadets explained laser-guided vehicles, General Razaq and his aides, through an interpreter, peppered the students with questions. Cadet Scott Boone of Holland, Pa., was, in turn, impressed with the Afghans. ''They actually got into the nitty-gritty, the physics of it, what the power source was,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Boeing Pressed by Questions on Tanker Proposal

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7 

 BODY:
It has been a tough year for Boeing here and it may become worse as the company learns more about the fate of its proposed $23 billion contract with the Air Force to lease airplanes as refueling tankers and as a federal investigation surrounding the deal unfolds. 
 At the moment, a crucial report ordered by Donald H. Rumsfeld, the defense secretary, is being reviewed within the Pentagon, pending its release shortly. Those who have seen the report by the Defense Science Board, a quasi-governmental agency, say it undercuts the Air Force's contention that a new tanker fleet is needed immediately.
 What's more, the report suggests other options for the Air Force that do not involve Boeing -- from buying used commercial planes and converting them into tankers to contracting from companies like FedEx. 
 This is hardly good news for Boeing, whose ambitious plan to lease up to 100 767's for use as aerial refueling tankers has become so mired in controversy that many military analysts now say it will not survive. In December, the Pentagon suspended the project until Mr. Rumsfeld could review half a dozen studies ordered on the subject. 
 ''If the tanker deal for Boeing isn't dead,'' said Richard Aboulafia, a military analyst at the Teal Group, an aerospace consulting firm in Fairfax, Va., ''it's coughing blood. It's not looking good.''
 The investigation into misconduct by Boeing executives involved in the tanker arrangement is not helping Boeing in Washington. Last month, a Boeing executive, Darleen A. Druyun, pleaded guilty to conspiracy in federal court for having secretly negotiated with Boeing officials for a job at Boeing while she was still working at the Air Force and overseeing the tanker deal. After an internal investigation concluded that Michael M. Sears, the company's former chief financial officer, secretly negotiated with Ms. Druyun, he was fired and the chief executive, Philip M. Condit, resigned. 
 Now, in an effort to avoid prison time, Ms. Druyun is cooperating with federal officials in their investigation of Mr. Sears and possibly other officials at Boeing.
 Between a string of harsh governmental reports on the tanker-lease arrangement and the taint of the Druyun scandal, many say it is hard to see how Boeing can prevail. 
 ''My gut feeling is that the tanker lease will die,'' said Loren Thompson, a military industry analyst at the Lexington Institute, a nonprofit research group. ''The Air Force leadership saw a great opportunity to get a great deal from Boeing. But step by step, it has melted down. It's severely impaired, and I don't see anything happening for a couple of years here.''
 Even Dov Zakheim, who recently left the Pentagon where he was defense under secretary and comptroller, says he believes that the many controversies about the tanker lease deal might be too difficult to overcome. ''In this form it is problematic, there is so much baggage,'' said Mr. Zakheim, now a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton. ''All this other stuff makes the arrangement difficult to implement.''
 At the same time, Boeing's competitors are seizing the opportunity to elbow in. Even if the need for new tankers to replace a fleet that dates back to the Eisenhower era is not as urgent as the Air Force might contend, no one doubts that replacements will be needed in the not-too-distant future.
 Airbus, which is 80 percent owned by EADS, Europe's largest aerospace company and Boeing's archrival, has its own aerial tanker -- and recently won some overseas orders that Boeing had hoped to land. 
 And Airbus, which has sold its aerial tankers to Britain, Australia, Germany and Canada, has just invested $90 million to redesign its models to United States Air Force qualifications. In addition, Airbus promises to have 50 percent American-made content in its tankers and would do its final assembly in the United States.
 ''We have every intent of making the Airbus a U.S. product,'' said Diane Murphy, a spokeswoman for the company's North American operations, based in Washington. ''If the U.S. market opens up to us, we'll be ready.''
 In addition, FedEx and airlines with spare planes on their hands have stepped up their lobbying efforts in Washington.
 For its part, Boeing continues to issue rosy statements about the tanker lease program's future, most recently in a spate of full-page newspaper ads across the country. It has also said in Securities and Exchange Commission filings that it is ''probable'' it will receive the tanker order this year. 
 ''We look forward to the secretary of defense allowing us to move forward with the Air Force and the program,'' said Douglas Kennett, a Boeing spokesman.
 But, behind the scenes, Boeing is more cautious. It has already stated in S.E.C. filings that it anticipates a one-time write-off of $300 million if the lease deal collapses, an amount that increases by the month. In a bid to save money, Boeing has slowed the 767 production line and laid off employees -- efforts that have cut its expenditures for the tanker program to $5 million a month from $30 million. 
 Moreover, Boeing's new chief executive, Harry C. Stonecipher, in a recent conference call with analysts, struck a guarded tone: ''So we still think there will be a tanker program for the United States Air Force. And the timing of when that thing comes about is anybody's estimate right now.''
 Time, of course, is not on Boeing's side. As initially conceived the tanker-lease program was to have breathed life into an aging 767 production line, threatened by a downturn in commercial orders. ''This probably means the end of the 767 production line, instead of continuing it for another 15 to 20 years,'' said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research, based in Newport, R.I. The tanker program promised to bring $3 billion in annual revenue for decades to come to Boeing, which has annual revenue of $50 billion. It would add an estimated $300 million annually to its bottom line. 
 In addition, Boeing's Web site had optimistically predicted $100 billion in overseas tanker orders, as foreign governments followed the Air Force. 
 If Boeing is in a box, so is the Air Force. Should the lease option fail, it would have to buy the tankers outright -- forcing the Air Force to make hard budget decisions. Paying for tankers means it might have less money to buy its top priority, the F/A-22, which costs over $200 million a plane. It also means that Boeing might have to cut its per-tanker price.
 ''Ultimately, the Air Force will need these tankers,'' said Nick Fothergill, a military analyst for Banc of America Securities in London. ''I think this deal will go ahead. But there may be delays and Boeing may have to take some charges. And the economics for Boeing will not be the same.''

HEADLINE: Job Report Sends Stocks and Bonds Sharply Lower

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
An unexpectedly strong employment report sent interest rates sharply higher and stocks lower yesterday as investors balanced their fears of the impact of rising rates against signs of a building economic recovery.
 The latest data, showing solid job growth, should set the stage for the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark rate very soon and send other rates, including those on home mortgages, higher in the months ahead. That environment may not help stocks. But the rise in interest rates is expected merely to slow growth, not undermine it, and if that is the case, should give some support to the stock market. 
 The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note, a major influence on mortgage rates, shot up to 4.78 percent, its highest in 22 months, from 4.60 percent after the Labor Department said yesterday morning that 288,000 new jobs were created in April, about 100,000 more than had been expected. The government also revised higher the number for March, to 337,000 new jobs, from 308,000, itself a number that was better than expected at the time. The price of the 10-year note, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, fell 1 9/32, to 94.
 Stocks fell initially, rebounded but then collapsed in the afternoon, ending at their lows for the day. All three major market gauges now show declines for the year and are just points away from their 2004 lows, reached in late March. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.4 percent, or 15.29 points, to 1,098.70, and is down 1.2 percent for the year. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 1 percent, or 19.78 points, to 1,917.96, for a 4.3 percent loss on the year. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.2 percent, or 123.92 points, to 10,177.34, and has declined 3.2 percent this year.
 In the foreign exchange market, the dollar rose 1.5 percent against the euro and 2.2 percent against the yen on the expectation that higher interest rates would make the dollar more attractive. As the dollar rose, gold fell 2.4 percent, to $379.10 an ounce, its lowest since November.
 While a rebounding economy is usually a negative for the bond market, it should not be an outright negative for stocks. Bond investors worry that both rising rates and inflation will eat into their returns. Stock investors, though, can take comfort in the idea that job growth will allow consumers to spend and offset some of the crimp in corporate profits caused by higher borrowing costs.
 The market outlook, though, is subdued for some. ''Our position is that even with strong employment reports, stocks may be flat over the next 12 months,'' said Ian Morris, chief United States economist at HSBC. He said the slowdown in productivity that would come as hiring picks up would cut into corporate earnings. ''Stock markets always find it hard to adjust to a higher interest rate environment,'' he added.
 Also weighing on stocks is the war in Iraq, the presidential election and a recent rise in prices, particularly oil, which crossed $40 a barrel before slipping back at the end of the day. 
 And the stock market appears to still be expensive by some measures, despite the S.&P. 500's 4.5 percent decline since early April. According to Thomson Financial, the S.&P. 500 is overvalued by 7.9 percent given current interest rates and an estimated 15 percent growth in its components' earnings this year. 
 Joseph T. Keating, chief investment officer at AmSouth Asset Management in Birmingham, Ala., said two powerful forces -- earnings and interest rates -- are battling in the stock market and the question is whether the Fed's interest rate increases overwhelm the improvement in corporate earnings. 
 ''Our view,'' he said, ''is that investors should bet on earnings growth winning out in the near term,'' with the S.&P. 500 rising about 10 percent over the next year. ''But clearly the market is spooked at the moment.'' 
 Thomas McManus, equity strategist at Banc of America Securities, is predicting that the S.&P. 500 will rise about 5 percent over the next 12 months, after surging 26.4 percent last year.
 ''It was the anticipation of the broad earnings recovery that allowed stocks to do as well as they did in 2003,'' he said. ''Now stocks are beginning to anticipate the result of the rising interest rates, which is a slower but more sustainable rate of growth in the economy.''
 In addition, Mr. McManus said that ''inflation is on the way up and that is going to have an impact on stocks not only in 2004, but also in 2005 and beyond.'' Inflation reduces the value of future earnings. 
 There is some support for stocks in the forecasts of economic growth through early next year, which already assume some interest rate increases by the Fed. 
 According to the average of 46 forecasts collected in the new Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, the gross domestic product is expected to climb 4 percent in the second half of this year, below the 4.5 percent forecast for the first half, and 3.7 percent in the first three quarters of 2005.
 The jobs data forced analysts to revise their forecasts about when Fed policy makers would begin raising their benchmark interest rate, now at 1 percent. A June increase, which seemed unlikely before the release of the March jobs report on April 2, is now incorporated in many forecasts. 
 Yesterday, J.P. Morgan moved up its expectations of an increase to June. The bank was leaning toward an August rate increase after the March jobs data and had forecast a December increase before that.
 Analysts who had predicted no rate increase this year threw in the towel. Goldman Sachs now expects a rate increase in June, and HSBC is predicting one in August.
 ''Today's report shows you pretty unambiguously that the labor market is in a strong cyclical recovery and that just kind of pushed us over the edge,'' said Jan Hatzius, senior economist at Goldman Sachs.
 But the rise in rates, in Goldman's view, is not bad for the economy in the short term because of the new momentum in hiring. ''If we thought it was all negative, we would have cut our growth forecast going forward,'' Mr. Hatzius said. ''But we raised it,'' to 3.5 percent from 3 percent for the second half of the year.

HEADLINE: A Rent-Free Place, if You Can Find a Spot to Park

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
Let other people moan and groan about sky-high rents and real estate in New York City. Jimmy Hines, 50, has found a solution: living rent-free in an R.V.
 ''It's my apartment on wheels,'' he said, leaning back this week in his faded 27-foot Gulfstream Sun Sport camper that was sitting on a fairly busy Queens street, wedged next to the curb in a line of parked cars.
 Last fall, Mr. Hines gave notice on the Queens apartment he was renting and bought a camper with his savings. It is his sixth month living curbside in the camper, and he swears he will never have a landlord again. 
 Mr. Hines is no skylarking eccentric looking to prove a point about human self-sufficiency. He is rather a man pushed to an extreme situation by extreme circumstances: the New York City housing market.
 He parked the rig on a busy stretch of Main Street south of the Long Island Expressway, on the edge of a commercial strip in an Orthodox section of Kew Gardens Hills, where streets are lined with kosher food shops and boxy brick houses.
 Stepping out his front door to the sidewalk, he faces a cemetery. To the right is a bus stop and to the left a gas station. In accordance with city parking regulations, he moves the vehicle at 7 a.m. on Mondays for one half-hour, for street cleaning.
 Mr. Hines said he was paying $900 a month for an apartment on Kissena Boulevard. He had recently lost his job as a vending machine repairman and was receiving a $150 weekly unemployment check.
 ''I started really thinking about what they're getting for an apartment in the city these days and I figured: 'Why should I keep paying rent? It's crazy,' '' he said.
 So Mr. Hines took most of his savings and bought the 1987 Sun Sport for $6,000. He began living in camper in December. Rather than ramble to less expensive areas, Mr. Hines wanted to stay in Queens, where he was born and raised and still near his friends.
 ''It was the wisest thing to do, considering my conditions,'' he said, stretching out in the camper on a smallish bed that barely accommodates his 6-foot frame.
 The place rivals some Manhattan studio apartments. Mr. Hines, who is single, keeps the place like a typical bachelor pad. There are dishes in the sink, overflowing ashtrays and a picture of his first hot rod. Traffic whooshes by, several feet from his window. He keeps his shades down for privacy.
 ''Don't mind the place, it's a bit of a mess,'' he said, showing a visitor around on Thursday. The inside of the R.V. has shag carpet, simulated wood paneling and floral-patterned wallpaper. There is a comfortable couch, and some swivel seats next to a smallish table. In the rear, past the bathroom, refrigerator and closets, is a small bedroom with twin beds.
 His kitchen console includes a four-range stove, oven and refrigerator, all powered by propane. A gas-powered generator provides electricity and heat. Mr. Hines also keeps perishables in a plastic cooler, replenished daily with store-bought ice.
 His portable toilet deposits the waste in plastic bags, which he puts in street trash cans. For water, he fills up large jugs at a gas station. Without a water hookup, he takes showers at a friend's or at the gym at Queens College. His mail is sent to a friend's house.
 After paying $500 a year for auto insurance, camper living is incredibly inexpensive, Mr. Hines said. Except for extreme hot or cold weather, he pays about $10 a week for propane, for which he must drive the camper to Nassau County for refills. He pays $25 a week in gasoline for the generator.
 He spends $7 a day on cigarettes, $4 on coffee and the rest on food.
 ''I make a mean chicken cordon bleu in that oven,'' he said. ''I don't even have an excuse to eat out.''
 He has a 9-inch color television with a built-in DVD player for movie rentals. He is set to buy a satellite dish for more channels.
 ''It's got everything my apartment had, except space,'' he said. ''But who has a lot of space in New York?''
 He holds regular poker games with his friends and has even taken a date back to the camper.
 ''The guys like coming here to get away from their old ladies,'' he said, adding that they debate what is crazier: living as an urban camper, or a lifetime of indentured servitude to a mortgage?
 ''A lot of my friends have kids and bills and they're all bald,'' Mr. Hines said. ''Me, I'm not living large, but life is still good. I'm living on my own terms. I have an apartment on wheels. I can pick up and go whenever and wherever I want.''
 Mr. Hines grew up in Flushing. His camper is parked near John Bowne High School, which he attended. Mr. Hines calls himself ''a product of the 60's'' and wears his hair in a ponytail, his head wrapped in an American flag bandanna. 
 The high cost of housing has forced people in Manhattan to go home to the Midwest and other locales, and some with fewer resources go homeless. But for a man from Queens with meager means and a few friends, living in camper just made sense.
 There is a stream of people on the sidewalk who pass his camper and another, larger R.V. that Mr. Hines said was owned and parked nearby by a local homeowner. But few take notice, even when Mr. Hines is standing in his doorway sipping his coffee.
 No one has tried to intrude on his domain, he said. A police officer did drop by a week ago, he said, to say that there had been a complaint about the noise from the generator, but Mr. Hines said he was not bothered.
 ''I think he just wanted to check me out,'' said Mr. Hines, who says his living situation is totally legal.
 Is it? A half-dozen city agencies could not answer the question. A spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings said it had no jurisdiction. (''It's not hooked up to any utilities, so it doesn't seem like a dwelling.'')
 But Keith Kalb, a spokesman for the city's Department of Transportation, said that traffic rules prohibit keeping boat trailers, mobile homes and mobile medical diagnostic vehicles on city streets for more than 24 hours at a time, although the regulations are usually enforced only in response to complaints.
 Several merchants in the area said Mr. Hines had done very little to attract attention in the past five months, so they gave little thought to why the camper was even there.
 David Fisher, 79, a retired auditor who lives nearby, walked by the camper on Thursday. He did a double-take at Mr. Hines in the doorway.
 ''I see him here all the time, and I wondered if it's legal to live in that thing,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''It takes up parking space and is a bit of an eyesore, but if the man needs it, I guess it's necessary.''
 He added: ''It's a unique solution. I wish him luck.''

HEADLINE: For a Family of Albanians in America, an Immigrant Dream Dies With a Brother

BYLINE: By THOMAS CRAMPTON

 BODY:
When six siblings gathered for a funeral Mass on Monday at Our Lady of Shkodra in Hartsdale, N.Y., with more than 1,000 other ethnic Albanians from the New York area, they did more than lay to rest their brother, whose mutilated remains were abandoned on a muddy roadside last month.
 They buried the immigrant dreams brought to their adopted land.
 ''Our family truly lived the American dream, but that dream has now turned into an American nightmare,'' said Martin Vulaj, 39, the younger brother of the dead man, Zef Vulevic. ''I don't know how to describe the pain caused by his death and the way it happened.'' 
 The body of Mr. Vulevic, 41, a chef and restaurateur who was also known as Joe Vuli, was found April 24 chopped up in several plastic bags that had been dumped in the underbrush at the end of a dead-end road near a highway exit in Bedford, N.Y. 
 On Monday, after a service at the Westchester church conducted in Albanian, the mourners drove through a light drizzle to the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in nearby Valhalla for the burial.
 Mr. Vulevic was last seen alive the night of April 4 at Gusto's, the upscale Italian restaurant in Danbury, Conn., that he owned with a nephew. The Danbury police have collected evidence from the restaurant, including a meat cutter, but have referred all questions about the investigation to the state's attorney's office in Danbury. 
 Stephen J. Sedensky III, a senior assistant state's attorney, said on Tuesday that an arrest was unlikely this week. He would not discuss any details of the investigation. 
 Gusto's and the half dozen other restaurants run by the family in Manhattan, Westchester and Connecticut are a world away from the two-room stone house at the base of a rugged mountain in Montenegro that the family left in 1971, Martin Vulaj said in an interview this week.
 Montenegro, then one of the Yugoslav republics, was governed by a Serbo-Croatian majority, and ethnic Albanians were discriminated against, Martin Vulaj said. His home life consisted of subsistence farming with only the smallest of pleasures for children, he recalled, like secretly punching through the family's crop of ripe watermelons to eat fistfuls of juicy meat. The Vulajs and other Albanians were discouraged from using their mother tongue in favor of Serbo-Croatian, and discriminatory hiring policies left highly educated Albanian neighbors no choice but to work as subsistence farmers, Mr. Vulaj said. Government policies forced the children, five boys and two girls, to change their Albanian surname, Vulaj, to the Serbo-Croatian Vulevic. (Their parents, George and Sage, were allowed to keep Vulaj.) By 1971, George Vulaj had decided to seek a better life for his family in the United States.''America stood as a beacon for freedom and economic opportunity in a way that most people in this country do not appreciate,'' Martin Vulaj said. ''But this was also before the era of globalization, so my father had no idea at all what to expect.''
 Fleeing persecution at home, they spent 11 months in a refugee camp in Italy waiting for asylum, which gave the children a chance to see television for the first time, study English and learn Italian. They were eventually granted asylum in the United States.
 The nonstop free soda on the flight to New York stunned the boys. When they arrived, the older boys, Paul and Nick, were immediately sent to work while their older sister, Mary, stayed home. And all the boys, except for Zef, eventually changed their names back to Vulaj.Paul washed dishes in an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn, while Nick worked in a nearby Italian bakery. The younger children -- Pjeter, Zef, Martin and Linda -- were sent to school instead. Martin said that he excelled at his studies, but that Zef dropped out to work at a succession of restaurants, including Portofino on City Island, where Frank Sinatra occasionally dined.Martin worked as a busboy in each restaurant, watching his brother develop as a chef. ''He took his spirit of courage into his cooking,'' Martin Vulaj said. ''He created each dish in a new way, not in a mechanical way.''
 Zef worked frying pans like a xylophone player, and would dump stocks and sauces that had taken 18 hours to make if he considered them substandard, Martin said. ''He abused himself in search of perfection,'' he said. ''He accepted nothing less than perfection.''
 By combining their resources, the brothers opened their first restaurant in Lower Manhattan, called Fino, in 1985. Featured in Architectural Digest, the Art Deco-style restaurant soon turned enough profit for the brothers to branch out and eventually open six more. In the summer of 2000, Zef opened a rotating restaurant on top of the Marriott hotel in Stamford with his brother Paul.
 The Stamford location struggled, Mr. Vulaj said, but Zef still could not resist taking over Gusto's restaurant in Danbury last year.
 Retooling Gusto's as an upscale restaurant with an Manhattan ambience, Mr. Vulevic took on Marash Gojcaj, who is the son of his sister Mary, as a partner.
 For all his success in the kitchen, however, Mr. Vulevic faced financial and personal troubles.
 Court records show that he filed for personal bankruptcy at least four times in the last four years, that his wife filed for divorce in October, and that a bank foreclosed on his house last month. Mr. Vulaj said he was sure that Mr. Vulevic and his wife, Valbona, would have gotten back together eventually. ''He and his wife spoke the evening he disappeared,'' Mr. Vulaj said. 
 A second home mortgage had been taken out to support the restaurants, Mr. Vulaj said, but the problems were not insurmountable.
 ''Cash flow can be tough with a new venture,'' Mr. Vulaj said. ''But in life these things will pass and he could always call us for help.''
 It was the police who received a call for help on the last evening Mr. Vulevic was seen alive.
 The officer who responded came upon a confrontation in front of Gusto's between a former employee and Mr. Gojcaj, Mr. Vulevic's nephew and the co-owner of Gusto's, the police have said. As the officer tried to calm down the combatants, a third man burst out of the restaurant, shouting angrily. A police report refers to the third man as Gusto, but according to Martin Vulaj, that man was Zef. He walked away to calm down, Mr. Vulaj said. 
 Zef often disappeared for days at a time, so at first his family did not think anything was amiss. Six days later, another brother, Nick, reported him missing. Two weeks later, his dismembered body was found.
 As for the killer's identity, Mr. Vulaj suspects that it was a disgruntled former employee.
 ''Any restaurant run by Joe was like a boot camp,'' Mr. Vulaj said. ''Like West Point, there was sharp discipline that could make you into an officer, a gentleman and a soldier, but some people really don't like that.''

HEADLINE: Krispy Kreme Runs Head-On Into a Low-Carb Wall

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, the hot new stock offering of 2000 that stayed hot even as other new offerings plunged, has suddenly chilled. It blames the Atkins diet.
 Shares in the company -- whose stores use flashing lights to notify customers when a fresh batch of doughnuts is ready -- plunged 29 percent yesterday, closing at $22.51, down $9.29. The stock has lost more than half its value since it peaked last August at $49.74. 
 ''For several months, there has been increasing customer interest in low-carbohydrate diets,'' said Scott A. Livengood, the chairman and chief executive, adding that the most serious effect on Krispy Kreme had come in grocery store sales, where it has been expanding its business.
 As a result, the company said, it did not earn as much as it had expected in its first quarter, which ended May 2, and was cutting its forecasts for the fiscal year by about 10 percent. The company is to report quarterly results on May 25.
 ''I hope it's a fad,'' Mr. Livengood said of low-carbohydrate diets. But if the trend accelerates, company officials said, profit forecasts might have to be reduced further.
 Krispy Kreme itself was viewed by some as a fad, with long lines outside new stores as it expanded from its base in the Southeast United States to most of the United States, as well as Canada, Mexico, Britain and Australia.
 But now Krispy Kreme is closing a handful of company-owned stores and reducing plans to open new ones. ''For the first time in recent memory, retail customer counts have declined,'' said John W. Tate, the chief operating officer.
 Krispy Kreme doughnuts have been around since 1937, but it was only in the 1990's that they became a phenomenon. The company opened its first store in New York in 1996 and promptly gained a cult following.
 But New York now appears to be a problem for Krispy Kreme. Mr. Tate said yesterday that the company was trying to renegotiate its arrangement with a joint-venture partner to reduce its risks in the city. 
 ''I consider New York to be a very special geography,'' he said. ''It is best for us and our shareholders if we do not participate heavily in the development costs.'' He did not elaborate.
 Krispy Kreme also said it was closing its Montana Mills Bread stores, an operation that it bought a year ago and that as recently as mid-April it said it planned to continue refining and expanding. It said it would take a write-off of as much as $40 million on the venture.
 Until recently, the company appeared to be nearly unstoppable. When the shares were first sold to the public in April 2000, during the boom in high-technology public offerings, Krispy Kreme was hailed as an old-economy growth story. The shares rose 76 percent the first day of trading, and did not look back.
 Even as the new high-technology issues lost most of their value, Krispy Kreme surged ahead. Short-sellers criticized the company's high ratio of price to earnings. Even after yesterday's fall it is selling at more than 20 times its estimate of operating earnings, before charges, of $1.04 to $1.06 for the current fiscal year. But its profits grew, and so did its share price.
 Even including the big decline yesterday, investors who got in at the offering or within a few months of it have good profits. The offering price, adjusted for two stock splits in 2001, was $5.25 a share. But the stock price yesterday was the lowest in three years.
 Until yesterday, the company had never reported profits that failed to meet its forecasts, but there had been signs that its business was not the growth engine it had seemed to be. Just two months ago, it told investors it had not seen ''a measurable impact'' from low-carbohydrate diets, but it also reported a decline in average weekly sales per store, sending the stock down 10 percent in a day, to $34.22 a share.
 Volume yesterday came to 20.5 million shares, the largest ever for Krispy Kreme and amounting to a third of the shares outstanding. The volume yesterday was greater than the number traded during the entire month of April.
 Mr. Livengood told investors on the conference call that despite the problems, there was plenty of growth left for the company. ''We are only beginning to scratch the surface of our potential,'' he said. He added that the company's franchisees ''remain extremely successful'' and said in answer to a question that ''there are no plans to reduce royalties, or no need to even consider anything of that sort.''

HEADLINE: In New York, a High-Rise City, Children Face Less Risk of Harm in Falls

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
A child falls from an apartment window, and the story resonates for New Yorkers who peer from their own high-rises and see this as an obvious peril of life in their vertical city.
 Obvious but, as it turns out, overstated. People in New York City are far more likely than other Americans to live high above the ground, but the city's children are far less likely than those in other places to be hurt in falls from buildings, Columbia University researchers have found. 
 The reason, they say, is that New York is the only major city in the country to require window guards in all apartments where young children live.
 The study, which will appear this week in the journal Applied Environmental Science and Public Health, looked at information collected by 27 states, including many in the Northeast, on all hospital admissions in 2000. It found that more than 1,000 children were hospitalized as urgent or emergency cases after falling from buildings, a rate of almost 3 per 100,000.
 But in New York City, the rate was about 1.5 per 100,000, barely half as high.
 (The report does not address deaths from falls because some victims are pronounced dead at the scene, and so are not included in the hospital data.)
 Across the 27 states, more than 40 percent of the injured children were under age 5. Those youngest children are the most likely to suffer head injuries when they fall, the researchers found, and also the most likely to fall from windows, instead of rooftops or fire escapes.
 Among children under age 10, blacks and Hispanics were twice as likely as whites to be seriously hurt in falls from buildings, and children from low-income ZIP codes were also more likely to be injured. Joyce C. Pressley, one of the authors, said those differences are probably connected to the fact that many more small children fall from buildings in hot weather than when it is cold.
 ''We think it's because low-income families are more likely to open the windows to cool off, while people who are better off economically are more likely to have air-conditioning,'' she said. She noted that other studies have shown that minority children are at higher risk for all sorts of accidental injuries, like burns.
 The researchers found that when teenagers fall from buildings, mental illness, alcohol or drugs are often involved. In that age group, whites are just as likely as minority children to be hurt in such falls.
 New York has required window guards since the 1970s, and its first years, the law produced a sharp decline in injuries from building falls. Yet the idea has met with resistance in other cities.
 ''The opposition has mostly come from fire departments, because they are concerned about being able to get in the windows, even though the New York City Fire Department has said it's not a problem,'' said Dr. Barbara Barlow, an author of the study. She said some fire officials do not understand the difference between window guards and the taller, sturdier grates meant to keep out intruders.
 Ms. Pressley and Dr. Barlow are both on the faculty of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia, and Dr. Barlow is also the director of surgery at Harlem Hospital.
 A voluntary window guard program in Boston has had limited success, and Chicago's City Council is considering a law similar to New York's, Dr. Barlow said.

HEADLINE: A Beaten Path Back to Prison

BYLINE: By Jennifer Gonnerman. 
Jennifer Gonnerman, a staff writer for The Village Voice, is the author of ''Life on the Outside: The Prison Odyssey of Elaine Bartlett.''

 BODY:
Until just a week ago, Lerome Hilson seemed to be in better shape than most of New York City's other parolees. He had been out of prison for 14 months, and now had his own apartment and a full-time job at a Manhattan restaurant. He showed up regularly for his appointments at the parole office and had passed his most recent drug test. 
 There was no reason to suspect he would join that small group of parolees whose actions earn them a spot on the evening news. Then came last Saturday. Mr. Hilson, who had spent six years in prison for burglary, reported for his job as a porter at Pop, a restaurant in the East Village. According to the police, he then confronted his boss and bashed him in the head with a fire extinguisher, killing him. 
 The headlines in the city's papers were easy to predict. ''Parolee Accused of Killing Popular Restaurant Manager,'' read one. Another declared: ''Parolee Arraigned in Murder.'' By now, crime stories featuring a parolee as the perpetrator have become a staple of the nation's newspapers. Yet most parolees who return to prison are not sent back because they committed a serious violent felony. Nevertheless, parole officers live in fear of the day when they'll pick up a paper and see one of their parolees staring back at them.
 Could Mr. Hilson's parole officer have stopped him from killing (if Mr. Hilson indeed committed the crime)? Of course not. Nobody can watch all their parolees all the time or anticipate their every move. But in the wake of gruesome crimes, the temptation to blame one government agency or another can be overwhelming. In cases like this one, the target is usually the parole system. This scapegoating is unfair. However, it is true that the parole supervision system is desperately in need of wholesale reform.
 For most of the time after his release from prison, Mr. Hilson was assigned to the state's parole office at 119 West 31st Street. Inside, signs of the agency's lowly status abound. The officers have no voice mail; yellow message slips cover their desks. They don't have computers, either, and take notes by hand. When an officer wants to send a parolee back to jail, he typically drives him in an aged Ford Taurus equipped only with child safety locks.
 This lack of resources is the legacy of a hundred Lerome Hilsons. Every parolee who commits a high-profile crime ensures that the parole system's reputation sinks further. Parole officers may be the best-educated people in law enforcement -- every officer in New York State has a four-year college degree and many have master's degrees -- but they receive little respect. Unsurprisingly, morale is low.
 For officers, there are few rewards for good work. If your parolee finishes his sentence without getting into trouble, reporters do not call to interview you. Nobody shakes your hand or gives you a promotion. But if your parolee lands in the news for committing a vicious crime, you can expect plenty of calls, including one from your boss regarding your own interrogation.
 Maybe this time there should be a different sort of response. The parole supervision system -- in New York and across the country -- needs to be re-examined. This year our prisons will release 630,000 men and women -- a population larger than Boston, Seattle or Washington. The question of what goes on inside parole agencies should be a matter of urgent concern to every governor and state legislator. 
 Is the main purpose of officers to help parolees reintegrate into society? Or is it to monitor them and send them back to jail? It is the age-old debate: should the officer act as social worker or cop? Even within a single parole office, officers disagree about how to define their jobs. Nevertheless, over the last few decades, as the prison population has exploded and society has become more punitive, parole supervision has changed, too. Parole agencies once strove to rehabilitate former prisoners; today their mission has more to do with locking them up. 
 The officers assigned to the 31st Street building spend most of their time on surveillance -- testing urine, conducting curfew checks -- and less time trying to help parolees rebuild their lives by assisting them in getting a job, an apartment, an education or health care. Their caseloads are so large that even if they wanted to spend more time helping, they couldn't. In 1980, New York State had 650 parole officers for 18,000 parolees. Today there are 869 officers for 44,570 parolees. Supervision often means devoting just two hours a month to each parolee.
 It can be far easier to send a parolee back to prison than to try to ferret out the source of his problem and search for solutions. In 1980, 17 percent of people entering New York's prisons had been sent there for violating parole; 20 years later, that number was 32 percent. In other words, nearly one-third of New York's incoming prisoners have not been convicted of a new crime, but instead are being locked up for parole violations, like failing a drug test or skipping appointments or staying out past their 9 p.m. curfew.
 Sending so many parolees back to prison is, of course, expensive. It's a short-sighted policy that has attracted many critics, especially in California, where taxpayers spend nearly $900 million a year to lock up parole violators. If states sent fewer people back to prison, they could use that savings to help former prisoners re-enter society. They could hire more parole officers, shrink their caseloads and improve their equipment and training. 
 We can no longer afford to pay attention to parole officers only when something goes wrong. Figuring out how to reinvent the parole system requires their input, too. It's in everyone's best interest. How these officers perform their jobs -- and how well parolees adjust to life on the outside -- has an enormous impact on the safety, economics and soul of our nation.

HEADLINE: Benefits Outlined For Adjuncts At N.Y.U.

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
In its first contract with its unionized part-time faculty members, New York University has agreed to provide health benefits, pension contributions and some job security, as well as wage increases, according to a contract outline released yesterday by the union.
 About 2,300 part-time instructors, or adjuncts, would be covered by the contract. The union, A.C.T.-U.A.W. Local 7902, was formed in 2002, in affiliation with the United Auto Workers, and says it is the largest adjunct-only union at a private university. 
 Scott Sommer, a U.A.W. organizer who helped negotiate the contract, said yesterday that providing health insurance and pension benefits ''are major steps forward for adjuncts'' and that pay rates compare favorably with those at other universities. 
 University officials said they believed that salary increases and benefits would make N.Y.U. a top choice for adjuncts.
 ''This is a good and fair agreement that embraces part-time faculty as a meaningful part of the university,'' said Cheryl Mills, a senior vice president at N.Y.U. who represented the university in the bargaining. ''They are part of the vision our president sees for the future of the university, and we believe this is an important step.''
 She would not provide an estimate of the cost of the contract.
 Daniel S. Hamermesh, a labor economist at the University of Texas at Austin, said the contract was ''clearly a breakthrough,'' adding that it could prove costly for the university. He predicted that N.Y.U. would seek ways to reduce the number of adjuncts, or, at least, the number who qualify for benefits. 
 ''This will affect employment of these folks,'' he said.
 Officials at the union and the university said that N.Y.U. needs the skills the adjuncts bring. And they said they did not anticipate cutbacks.
 Under a six-year contract, to take effect in September, adjuncts who have taught for six consecutive semesters (not counting summers) will be informed by May what they will teach the following year. 
 N.Y.U. may alter assignments if enrollment is low, a class is cancelled or there is a change in curriculum. But the six-semester adjuncts would receive severance pay if they were not renewed for other reasons, and they could appeal nonrenewals.
 ''The termination pay is totally brand new,'' said Cate Fallon, an N.Y.U. adjunct who teaches at the Tisch School of the Arts and who took part in the negotiations. ''And we've never had a grievance process before. All you could do is appeal to your chair.''
 She said that having health care coverage and other benefits ''makes a big difference to me personally.''
 The agreement creates four categories of compensation for part-time teachers and sets minimum pay scales that will rise each year of the contract. 
 In the first year, adjuncts teaching lecture courses will earn at least $90 for each class hour. Those earning more than $75 an hour now will receive a $15-an-hour pay increase instead. (The minimum for a lecture course with three hours of meetings a week for 14 weeks would be $3,780.)
 Minimums for other types of teaching are lower. Studio course teachers will get a minimum of $65 an hour in the next school year. Adjuncts providing individual instruction, like piano lessons, will receive at least $55 an hour. And part-time teachers in noncredit courses will get a $50-an-hour minimum.
 N.Y.U. will also pay half or three-quarters of the cost of individual health care plans for adjuncts who teach a certain number of hours each year. Beginning in 2008, it will contribute 5 percent of an adjunct's salary to a pension fund for those who have taught for two years or more.
 The university will pay half the cost of individual health coverage in the next school year for those teaching at least 84 hours during the year (not counting the summer), or at least 150 hours of individual instruction. And it will pay three-quarters of the cost for adjuncts teaching 126 hours a year, or 225 individual instruction hours. The payments can also be applied for family coverage.
 Mr. Sommer of the U.A.W. said he did not know how many adjuncts would be eligible for benefits like health care and pension contributions.

HEADLINE: Attacks in Mideast Raise Fear of More At Oil Installations

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS; Neela Banerjee, in New York, contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, May 7 

 BODY:
With oil prices climbing to a 13-year high after two deadly attacks on oil installations within a week, security has become the central preoccupation of Mideast oil producers.
 The killing last Saturday of five Western contractors at Saudi Arabia's western oil hub in Yanbu and the attempted suicide bombing of Iraq's main oil export terminals on April 24 have raised market-rattling fears that oil workers and facilities may be Al Qaeda's new targets of choice.
 The price of crude oil jumped above $40 a barrel in New York on Friday, its highest level since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. It eventually settled at $39.93, up 56 cents from Thursday's price. For months, high demand and tight supplies have pushed the price of oil upward. 
 Most countries are producing at or near maximum capacity, and the only country with spare capacity is Saudi Arabia. Iraq's barrels are also badly needed. While last week's attacks did not do great damage, traders worry that a more serious disruption of Middle East oil production remains possible and that it would shake the fragile stability of the already strained oil market. 
 ''It's the combination of fears of what might happen and the fundamental tightness of the market that has sent prices higher,'' said Leonidas P. Drollas, chief economist with the Center for Global Energy Studies, a London consulting firm.
 Saudi refineries, pipelines and ports in Eastern Province, home to Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, are widely seen as relatively well-fortified targets. 
 But the incidents at Yanbu, where oil is exported to North America and Europe, and at Iraq's only gulf outlet, exposed vulnerabilities that require swift remedies, analysts and oil industry executives said. 
 ''What you really have in these two incidents is a new phase, a new type of attack,'' said Walid Khaduri, editor of The Middle East Economic Survey, based in Cyprus. ''And the common denominator in both is a lack of security. So the only thing that countries can do is more and more security.''
 In Yanbu, guards had been posted at the entrances to the sprawling residential area for foreign workers and at the adjacent petrochemical industry complex. But they were armed, if at all, with handguns, according to contractors at the site.
 Their pistols were no match for the heavy weapons used by the Saudi gunmen who killed the employees of the Texas-based ABB Lummis. They had semiautomatic rifles and went on a rampage in a stolen truck through the neighborhood, dragging the body of one victim. After they were cornered and killed, witnesses said one attacker was wearing what appeared to be a vest rigged with explosives. 
 The earlier incident in the waters off Basra, in southern Iraq, involved three small boats laden with bombs. One blew up when American sailors pulled alongside for a routine check as the boat approached the Khawr al- Amaya terminal, killing three of the sailors. The attackers' other two boats were destroyed as they raced toward the Basra loading dock.
 The attacks were widely attributed to Al Qaeda or independent terror groups it has inspired. Three weeks before the Iraq attack, a specific threat against oil installations was made in a statement posted on a radical Internet site that was signed by Abdulaziz al-Muqrin, the presumed Qaeda leader in Saudi Arabia.
 ''Strikes on oil wells and pipelines in Iraq may lead to the withdrawal of foreign companies or at least destroy the security and stability needed by them to plunder the wealth of Muslims,'' the posting said.
 The fear of further attacks has set off a small, but possibly temporary, exodus of foreign workers. All 90 Lummis employees at Yanbu were evacuated, at their request, and other companies have offered their workers similar options. 
 ''Our company has urged dependents to go home for now, because upgrading security here will take a month or so,'' said Max Wilks, an executive with Saudi Arabian Parsons Ltd., an affiliate of the Parsons Corporation of California, which has provided management services to the Yanbu project since it began in 1979.
 He said a few of Parsons' 160 foreign staff members had already resigned. ''All the others are either going to stay or are in the undecided mode,'' added Mr. Wilks, who has worked at Yanbu for more than 20 years and has decided to stay.
 Some foreign oil workers are now also calling for more intensive background checks of the Saudis who work alongside them, based on the disclosure that three of the Yanbu attackers worked at Yanpet, a company inside the industrial zone.
 The topic dominated a meeting between American businessmen and the American ambassador to Saudi Arabia last Sunday, said David Cantrell, president of the American Business Association here. 
 ''Probably 30 of the 60 minutes were taken up by that subject,'' he added. ''I said if we could just find a company to vet the Saudi employees, it would be the next big thing. At the moment there is no mechanism to do it.'' 
 But the Saudi culture, and the government's official campaign to force companies to hire locally, could risk irritating local sensitivities. 
 ''This is still a tribal society, and it's traditional that someone is vouched for because he's a cousin or a relative,'' said one longtime expatriate worker here. Saudi oil ministry officials, in any case, have insisted that they scrutinize all oil sector hirings. 
 But other security suggestions were adopted almost immediately after the Yanbu attack. 
 Sandbagged checkpoints run by uniformed members of Saudi Arabia's elite National Guard were quickly set up outside hotels and housing compounds catering to foreign oil workers. Outside the Holiday Inn, which abuts a large housing compound for expatriate oil workers, a maze of concrete barriers was put up to slow approaching cars. 
 Armored vehicles with machine guns patrol the perimeter of the port and industrial complex, and Saudi officials have been meeting daily with Western workers. 
 ''Our Westerners want to see more guards, armed vehicles and heavier weapons, which we didn't like to see one week ago,'' said Mohammed Abdulaziz al-Juwaiser, the director general of the Royal Commission in Yanbu, which administers the oil industry development zone. ''They have started to ask for more forces on the ground, especially around the work area.'' 
 He said the government was ready to meet their demands, but he cautioned that no one could provide an air-tight guarantee of safety against determined killers and terrorists. ''You cannot build fences and put a guard around every person,'' Mr. Juwaiser said. ''This is a city where people come and go.''
 Aramco workers appeared less worried, noting that their operations have been in the line of fire for years, especially after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait when Saddam Hussein fired Scud missiles at the kingdom. The Saudi military as well as Aramco's own 5,000-strong security force monitor the pipelines, including the strategic line of pipes that carry gas and crude oil from the wells in Eastern Province across 750 miles of desert to the plants and port at Yanbu. 
 But the Saudi government takes the danger of further terrorist attacks seriously and, after a long period of complacency, has been aggressively searching for Al Qaeda operatives, killing a number of suspects in recent weeks.
 Their own citizens have also become victims. Last May, 35 people were killed when suicide bombers rammed into a residential compound in Riyadh that housed both foreigners and Saudis. A car bomb attack last week at a crowded police headquarters in Riyadh left 5 people dead and 145 people wounded.

HEADLINE: Texas Town Pays High Human Cost for Iraqi War

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Tex., May 3 

 BODY:
Baldemar Benavides cannot seem to banish the war in Iraq from his thoughts. Reminders are everywhere.
 The road into this South Texas town, through cotton fields and cattle ranches, is lined with yellow ribbons and recruitment billboards for the Marines. Bumper stickers on pickup trucks read, ''Half of My Heart Is in Iraq.'' In businesses throughout the town, there are photos of Mr. Benavides's grandson Jose Amancio Perez III, a 22-year-old Army specialist killed last year in an ambush north of Baghdad.
 ''You can put this in there, I don't care, I'm an old man and I'm humble and poor but I want to be heard,'' Mr. Benavides, 69, a retired welder, said in Spanish in an interview at his home as he clutched a photo of his grandson. ''His death wasn't necessary. None of the deaths in that place were necessary.'' 
 ''Iraq'' is not a word Mr. Benavides likes to utter. The Persian Gulf is not an area he likes to talk about. A son, Baldemar Benavides Jr., a private first class in the Army who was known as Billy, was killed in the region in 1992 shortly after hostilities there ended. 
 San Diego, with 4,800 residents, on the grasslands between Corpus Christi and Laredo where the wet heat sticks to shirts in early May, is paying a hefty price for the war in Iraq. Last month, the town lost a second resident, Lance Cpl. Ruben Valdez Jr., 21, of the Marines in an attack in Husabayah near the Syrian border, making this one of the smallest communities in the nation to have more than one resident killed in the war.
 Corporal Valdez and Specialist Perez were buried next to each other in San Diego's cemetery, down the street from the neighborhood of trailer homes and decaying bungalows where they grew up and played together. For this tight-knit town that is 97 percent Hispanic, where many residents are related by blood or marriage or both, the deaths have created a feeling of dread over who might be killed next. 
 Luis Pizzini, the principal of San Diego High School, said the town had more than 25 residents in the military, with most serving in Iraq and a handful in Afghanistan. After Corporal Valdez's death, which was mourned in April at a candlelight vigil at the St. Francis de Paula Roman Catholic Church in San Diego's plaza, Mr. Pizzini said he was considering steps to curtail military recruiting at the school.
 ''One more death would cripple our community,'' Mr. Pizzini said in an interview in his office. ''I definitely wish this war was over, but it's too late for that.'' 
 The school graduates about 90 students a year, and just a handful go on to college. With jobs in the area hard to come by, military service provides an alternative. Some graduates join the military a year or so later after not finding work.
 Many people here are openly critical of the war and saddened by the continuing casualties. Others question whether they would have supported the invasion of Iraq, as most people here did, if they had known that no unconventional weapons would be found in the country more than a year later. 
 ''Enough is enough,'' said Mary Aleman, owner of the Mauro P. Garcia Funeral Home, where services for the two dead soldiers were held. ''We should be out of there already.''
 Still, nearly everyone in San Diego voices strong support for the soldiers in Iraq. The town, as many residents are quick to point out, is no stranger to war. A plaque in front of the Veterans of Foreign Wars building lists the losses from past wars: 9 in World War I, 16 in World War II, 1 in the Korean War and 2 in the Vietnam War. 
 All of the surnames on the plaque are Hispanic, a reminder that many people in San Diego trace their roots to settlers who came here more than two centuries ago when the Spanish crown granted them land in 1800. Since then, San Diego has retained a strong Hispanic influence even if newer immigrants from across the border seek out the ''greener pastures of Houston or San Antonio,'' as Ruben Escobar, the retired postmaster, put it. Those who have stayed in San Diego have done so largely because of strong family and emotional ties. 
 ''We got a little bit of oil fields, a little bit of agriculture and the military,'' said Mr. Escobar, who served in the Air Force in the Vietnam War. ''With those career options I can't blame anyone for signing up. It's just sad that our kids are bearing the brunt of this situation.''
 Outside the St. Francis de Paula Church, a support group for parents with children in the war holds prayer meetings every Wednesday night. 
 San Juanita Gonzalez, whose son, Dagoberto Gonzalez Jr., is in the Army in Iraq, said she was selling patriotic bumper stickers for $1 each so she could send him and others in his unit packages of insect repellent, beef jerky seasoned with chili and surgical masks so they can breathe easier in desert sandstorms. The First State Bank of San Diego bought 50 of the bumper stickers, Ms. Gonzalez said. 
 ''When the latest little boy died, I went to his family and told them, 'I'm here for you today, you might be here for me tomorrow,' '' said Ms. Gonzalez, between sobs, a photo of her son pinned to her shirt. 
 Her husband, Dagoberto Gonzalez Sr., a natural-gas pipeline worker who calls his son D.J., said he, too, was afraid. 
 ''I don't care how much of a man you are, I cried for that boy and I cry with worry for my own son,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. ''I don't want to get into politics, but the middle class and the poor are fighting this war for everyone else.''
 Middle class might not be the best way to describe San Diego, where the average family income is $19,250 a year, according to the 2000 census, and the unemployment rate is 9.6 percent. The potholed tarmac of State Highway 44, which runs through the town, is bordered by shuttered gas stations and a view of abandoned, graffiti-splattered rail cars from the old Texas-Mexican railroad. Wal-Mart has deemed San Diego not important enough for a store, locating its nearest 10 miles east in the town of Alice, which is four times larger.
 The military, however, has recognized San Diego as fertile ground, filling the halls of the high school with informational pamphlets and visits by recruiters. Heavily Latino communities like San Diego are increasingly important sources of enlistment for the military, especially among those who possess the necessary educational credentials -- mainly a high school diploma or the equivalent -- and the right immigration status. 
 Latinos make up 8.2 percent of the work force qualified to join the military but represent 9.5 percent of the military's enlisted ranks, according to a study by the Pew Hispanic Center. Latinos are also overrepresented among soldiers who handle weapons on the front lines, accounting for 17.7 percent of that category. (The casualty rate for Latinos in Iraq is hard to determine since the Department of Defense has not released casualty data by ethnicity.) 
 For Ruben Valdez and Jose Amancio Perez, San Diego was a place to escape from. Friends who attended school with them described Ruben as a joker and Amancio, as he was known, as more serious, though the two had a lot in common. 
 After Amancio's parents separated, he moved to a relative's home less than a hundred yards from Ruben's house. Their friends said the two would often play together outside their homes on Luby Street, the same road residents now take to visit their graves. 
 ''They were a different generation from me, but I understood them perfectly,'' said Ana Garcia, 41, who attended Specialist Valdez's funeral in her desert fatigues after returning from a year in Iraq with the Army National Guard. 
 ''The pull of the military is dangerous and kind of irresistible,'' said Ms. Garcia, who plans to work at a temporary agency in Corpus Christi before re-entering the National Guard later this year, possibly to return to Iraq. ''It's the pull of the world out there.''

HEADLINE: If Affirmative Action Fails . . . What Then?

BYLINE: By DAVID L. CHAPPELL. 
David L. Chappell is the author of ''A Stone of Hope: Prophetic Religion and the Death of Jim Crow.''

 BODY:
The 50th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decision this month is a well-deserved feel-good moment for civil rights strategists, but it is only a temporary distraction from the deep conflicts that remain.
 Many people earnestly believe that aggressive remedies like affirmative action are still necessary to eliminate the inequality at which Brown made only a glancing blow. Even the most ardent supporters of affirmative action are frustrated, however, because of its persistent unpopularity and its very limited success in closing the academic and economic gaps between black and white Americans.
 The Supreme Court's decision last year involving the University of Michigan Law School, though it defended a form of affirmative action, appears to put a 25-year limit on the court's tolerance of even the most scrupulously moderate considerations of race. In the companion decision on Michigan's undergraduate program, the court banned broader forms of affirmative action altogether. 
 So what now?
 Of the shelfload of new books that try to answer that question, ''The Pursuit of Fairness: A History of Affirmative Action'' by Terry H. Anderson (Oxford University Press) is a good place to get your bearings. Following the political scientist John David Skrentny and the historian Hugh Davis Graham, Mr. Anderson emphasizes the ''ironies of affirmative action,'' the policies' logical contradictions and perverse effects. Mr. Anderson, a history professor at Texas A&M, defends many of the policies from simplistic attack. But he makes clear that the best defense of affirmative action has always been that the alternatives to it are even worse.
 Mr. Anderson will surprise many with his reminder that the federal government did not commit itself to affirmative action until the Republican administration of Richard M. Nixon. Racial hiring preferences had been declared illegal after President Lyndon B. Johnson's brief experiment with them. Nixon revived them, Mr. Anderson says, partly from political calculations. Democratic liberals would be forced to defend and expand Nixon's affirmative action policy. Black hiring preferences would supersede white workers' hard-won seniority rights, thus driving a wedge between union members and black voters. Nixon was able to capitalize on the division by the end of his first term, turning against his own initiatives and other strong remedies, like court-ordered busing. As Nixon hoped, white rank-and-filers abandoned the Democrats in droves. 
 Opposition to affirmative action persisted, partly because racists resented black success. But people who were not racists also found it hard to justify violating the 14th Amendment's equal-protection clause to serve its deeper purpose. And when affirmative action worked at all, it tended to aid those who least needed aid: black students who had already qualified for university admission or come very close. That increasingly meant affluent black students with college-trained parents. Affirmative action offered little to those who suffered most from racism, the poor.
 Sheryll Cashin, a law professor at Georgetown, offers the most refreshing path away from the confusion: integration, a goal so long out of fashion that it is ripe for revival. In ''The Failures of Integration: How Race and Class Are Undermining the American Dream'' (PublicAffairs), she warns upwardly mobile black parents that their growing separatism is a swindle even as she sympathizes with their desire to forgo fighting for acceptance in their neighborhoods. Black enclaves in leafy suburbs are now available. But one of the selling points of these enclaves -- the huge racial discounts on nice houses that white buyers won't consider because too many neighbors are black -- make the benefits short-lived. Real estate agents steer black buyers into these areas, emphasizing that they will ''fit in.'' They don't mention that economic development is moving away from these areas or that underfinanced schools and services often explain much of the racial discount. Black enclaves are often closest to declining areas of the city. 
 Ms. Cashin addresses the white middle class with equal seriousness, seeing among them too many flight risks. They, too, are getting cheated. As the rich hunker down in gated communities or otherwise remove themselves from the common tax base, they stick the rest of America with the bill for their extended sewer lines and commuting time (increased road maintenance, pollution, accidents). 
 Ms. Cashin presents historical evidence that America's unusual stratification does not result from individual choices or market forces. Laws have trapped a desperate underclass in ghettos and ferried a decadent overclass away. The Federal Housing Administration, created in 1937, underwrote one-third of all new housing construction in its first 35 years. Its manual required that all properties ''continue to be occupied by the same social and racial classes.'' The Interstate Highway Act (1956), in addition to subsidizing oil barons in Texas and Saudi Arabia, directly displaced 330,000 poor families, mostly black. State laws made things worse. A combination of new town charters (which encourage creation of low-tax havens), zoning laws (which artificially concentrate both poverty and wealth) and local building codes (which make housing affordable to a select stratum) have sharply segregated, and to some extent created, social classes. 
 The recent vintage of these policies is important. The widespread barriers -- which are arguably more harmful than legal segregation or the lingering effects of slavery -- created the world we live in today. 
 In ''Silent Convenants: Brown v. Board of Education and the Unfulfilled Hopes for Racial Reform'' (Oxford University Press), Derrick Bell tacks in the opposite direction from Ms. Cashin, insisting that separatism is unavoidable and that benefits can be had within it. It is significant that Mr. Bell, who provocatively posits that black people might have been better off without the Brown decision, still strongly supports affirmative action. White opponents of affirmative action were deluded, he writes: affirmative action never deprived them of opportunities or benefits. This is hard to square with Mr. Bell's advocacy of slave reparations. His logic seems to be: white people resisted giving black people their due when it cost them nothing. Why don't we try making them pay a lot of money instead?
 Mr. Bell's main theme is the ''interest convergence'' theory he advanced 24 years ago -- that white leaders grant concessions to black people only to prevent upheaval or otherwise serve their own interests. The theory was novel not so much for its realism as for the outrage that Mr. Bell conveyed when explaining it. Though many call him a cynic, Mr. Bell, a visiting professor at New York University Law School, still appears deeply hurt that white people do not voluntarily give up their privileges.
 Mr. Bell's most practical section covers alternatives to school desegregation. He will irritate liberals and union supporters by advocating experiments with vouchers, along with charter schools and single-sex education. Unfortunately, he leaves the proposals underdeveloped. Showing advanced symptoms of academic celebrity, he may be too busy to put in the long hours of contemplation or to do the digging necessary to come up with fresh, factually rich arguments to vie with Ms. Cashin's.
 Charles Ogletree Jr., a professor at Harvard Law School, names Mr. Bell as a mentor and is clearly on the celebrity track with him. Like Mr. Bell, he is a brilliant lawyer, but he writes evenhandedly in ''All Deliberate Speed: Reflections on the First Half-Century of Brown v. Board of Education'' (W. W. Norton), more like a judge than Mr. Bell, who is content to advocate one side. Mr. Ogletree shares Ms. Cashin's concerns about black flight and, like her, takes economic divisions, including those within the black population, very seriously. The best part of his book is an invigorating memoir of his rise from poverty. He found opportunity and hope in desegregation, which balance his disappointment with Brown's unfinished business.
 Mr. Ogletree gives critics of reparations a fair hearing, though he ultimately rejects their arguments. His proposal for reparations, one of many in this wide-ranging book, is his most fully developed idea -- perhaps because he is preparing a related suit, on behalf of victims of the Tulsa race riot in 1921. Since the Tulsa victims are few, and since they sustained direct injuries, their case sidesteps some of the objections to reparations for slavery: slavery was perfectly legal until 1865; its victims and perpetrators are long dead; only racists think guilt is genetically transferable. (So far, the Tulsa suit does not answer the objection that, politically, reparations are a pipe dream.)
 If the suit helps revive black commitment to the freedom struggle, or white support, it will revive the most elusive part of the struggle's half-century-old heyday. If not, the frustrations of the affirmative-action era may not go away so much as change form.

HEADLINE: BIG GAIN IN JOBS FOR A 2ND MONTH

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The nation's employers added hundreds of thousands of jobs for the second month in a row, the Labor Department reported yesterday, offering clear evidence that the pace of hiring is finally picking up speed in response to the strengthening economy.
 The eruption in new jobs -- 288,000 in April after the addition of 337,000 in March -- brought total employment in the United States above where it was when the economic recovery officially began nearly two and a half years ago.
 Although job opportunities are improving, unemployment in April edged down only slightly, to 5.6 percent from 5.7 percent in March, suggesting that there is still plenty of slack in the labor market.
 ''Employment has finally joined an array of other economic indicators in depicting strong growth,'' said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities. 
 President Bush pushed that theme in a campaign speech in Dubuque, Iowa. ''People are finding work in this economy,'' he said. ''The tax relief we passed is working.''
 By contrast, his likely Democratic opponent, John Kerry, focused on the fact that the total number of people on payrolls, 130.9 million, is still nearly 1.5 million below where it was when Mr. Bush took office in January 2001, on the eve of the last recession. ''Let's be clear,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''We still have a long way to go to get America working again.'' 
 The hiring last month showed up in nearly every sector, even in manufacturing, which had lost jobs steadily in a slide that began 46 months ago, well before the onset of the recession. Virtually all of the 1.5 million jobs that Mr. Kerry referred to were in manufacturing. 
 The job losses in manufacturing finally ended in February, and since then manufacturers have added back 37,000 workers, according to revisions issued by the Labor Department yesterday. That is still a small contribution to the total of 708,000 jobs that were created over the last three months, a pace not experienced since the booming 1990's. The revisions added 66,000 jobs to the original estimates for February and March. 
 The stock and bond markets, apparently viewing the job numbers as firm evidence that the recovery is gathering steam, braced for an increase in interest rates when the Federal Reserve's policy makers meet in late June. Several Wall Street economists who had argued that the Fed would not act until after the November presidential election revised their forecasts yesterday, asserting that if the Fed does not act by June, it surely will by August. 
 ''We now think the Fed will tighten in June,'' Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs, said. ''We had thought it would be 2005.''
 Stock prices often decline in response to rising interest rates or expectations of rate increases; yesterday was no exception. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 123.92 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,117.34. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, an indicator of the direction of mortgage rates and car loans, rose sharply, to 4.78 percent.
 Until recently, the recovery that began in November 2001, after an eight-month recession, was not strong enough to generate any employment gains. Indeed, jobs continued to disappear as employers found ways, through productivity improvements, to increase output with fewer workers. That ended last July, when the economy suddenly surged. 
 Since then, economic output has advanced at an annual rate of 5.5 percent, and to keep up with the rising demand, employers finally began easing up on layoffs and started to fill slots. Since midsummer, they have added 1.1 million jobs, a majority in the last two months. 
 ''You knew that if you had above-trend economic growth into this year that the jobs would come back, and they have,'' said Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting and forecasting firm in St. Louis.
 For starters, many companies have brought in temporary workers rather than full-timers, and the ranks of temp workers continued to swell last month, up 35,000 over March. Employment also rose smartly in April in health care, restaurant work and in industries related to the booming housing sector -- architectural services, real estate firms, mortgage banking, landscaping, building material stores and construction, the latter adding 18,000 workers in April and 83,000 since January.
 Manufacturing employment, up 21,000 in April, got nearly half of that job growth in fabricated metals. Those companies are big suppliers to the healthy construction industry, which has done well with interest rates so low. 
 Although the jobless rate barely moved last month, it came down most sharply for African-Americans. Unemployment for blacks fell to 9.7 percent in April from 10.2 percent in March. Among whites, the unemployment rate fell 0.2 percentage point, to 4.9 percent.
 But for all the improvement in jobs, the slack in the labor market is clearly evident not only in the failure of the unemployment rate to fall significantly -- it has been stuck at 5.6 or 5.7 percent since December -- but also in relatively weak wage growth, which has not kept pace with inflation. Moreover, there has been little improvement in the number of long-term unemployed -- those who have been looking for work for 27 weeks or more -- or in the reluctance to hire the college-educated.
 Of the 8.2 million people who listed themselves in the monthly job survey as unemployed and looking for work, 1.8 million in April have been doing this for 27 weeks or more. That total came down by 188,000 from March, but the long-term unemployed are still a historically high 22 percent of all the unemployed.
 The percentage of the adult population holding jobs ticked up to 62.2 percent in April from 61.1 percent in March and has held roughly at that level most of this year. But the gains have gone mostly to men and women with some college training, usually at community colleges, but less than a four-year bachelor's degree.
 ''College grads are flooding the job market, but they don't have as many opportunities as you would expect at this stage of the recovery,'' said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. ''Offshoring is part of it. They are getting jobs in finance, insurance, legal services and accounting, but they still have not shaken off the after-effects of the dot-com bubble bursting.''

HEADLINE: Africans May Claim Much of $3.5 Billion in U.S. Reform Rewards

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7 

 BODY:
African nations are poised to claim a major part of $3.5 billion in American aid under a Bush administration plan to reward countries that govern responsibly and invest in their people, officials and experts say.
 The administration's Millennium Challenge Corporation this week selected 16 nations that can receive aid, eight from Africa. Latin America produced three candidates, and Asia and Eurasia five. 
 The administration sought to match the aid to government commitments to political, economic and social policies that promote economic growth. It used indicators from outside government, like a ranking by a human rights group, Freedom House, on civil liberties. 
 The nations may now submit proposals for specific projects to be financed; President Bush has asked for $2.5 billion for the next fiscal year, and hopes to reach $5 billion a year for the program.
 The selected countries are Armenia, Benin, Bolivia, Cape Verde, Georgia, Ghana, Honduras, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Senegal, Sri Lanka and Vanuatu. 
 Mr. Bush announced the Millennium Challenge strategy in 2002, calling for ''a new compact for global development, defined by new accountability for both rich and poor nations alike.'' 
 In contrast to traditional foreign aid, the process aims to have countries design their own aid programs, apply for project financing, sign three-year ''compacts'' with the United States and demonstrate their progress.
 Charles R. Snyder, the assistant secretary of state for Africa, said the account could in effect triple the amount of American aid to Africa.
 Steven Radelet, a former Treasury official who works at the nonprofit Center for Global Development, said the aid could provide help for the efforts of reformers and could help prevent countries from backsliding into corrupt or negligent practices.
 ''These countries still face huge obstacles,'' Mr. Radelet said. ''They're still far from perfect. They're at risk; some of them could fall back.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Warns New York State On Student Loan Program

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7 

 BODY:
The federal Education Department has cautioned New York that an effort to force public universities to steer students away from direct federal loans and toward loans administered through banks would violate federal law.
 The effort appeared in an obscure amendment to Gov. George E. Pataki's 2004-2005 budget, offered in January. It required CUNY and SUNY campuses to sign agreements aimed at increasing their use of loans handled by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation as a condition of receiving $25.6 million in aid. 
 ''I call it extortion,'' said Eileen K. O'Leary, chairwoman of the National Direct Student Loan Coalition and director of financial aid at Stonehill College, in North Easton, Mass. ''If the universities don't use H.E.S.C., they will not get funds to run their financial aid offices. How are they supposed to function?''
 The federal government offers higher education loans through two major programs, the Direct Loan program and the Family Federal Education Loan program, also known as guaranteed loans. It spends $13 billion on the direct loan program, in which the federal government provides loans to students through universities, and about $39 billion on the guaranteed loan program, which offers guarantees for loans made by banks.
 While the direct loan program is more efficient and less expensive for taxpayers and students, many states favor the guaranteed program because state agencies that oversee the programs receive commissions for originating loans, for preventing students from defaulting, and for collecting overdue debt.
 According to President Bush's 2005 budget, it costs taxpayers 69 cents to lend $100 through the direct loan program, against $10.51 to lend a student the same amount under the guaranteed loan program. That is because under the direct loan program, the government borrows money at advantageous rates, and collects interest when the loans are due. Origination fees cover the administrative costs of universities that handle the loans.
 But under the more expensive program, banks lend money to students at a capped rate, with the federal government covering the difference between the capped and market interest rates. The federal government also reimburses banks for loans that go into default. Those loans also have a larger origination fee.
 CUNY's financial aid chief, George Chin, estimated that the guaranteed loans would cost CUNY students $2 million, and SUNY students $5 million, in additional commissions and fees to lenders. 
 The effort in New York is being closely watched by other states. The Pataki administration plan essentially offers participating universities a share of the profits the Higher Education Services Corporation collects for running the student aid program. In a time of tight state revenue, the arrangement would offer public university systems a way to supplement their budgets without raising taxes. But federal officials said that on its face, the arrangement appears to be against the law.
 The warning to New York was revealed in a letter on Wednesday from Education Secretary Rod Paige to Senators John Edwards of North Carolina and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York. The two senators, both Democrats, alerted federal officials to the proposal in the New York budget.
 The letter noted that Sally Stroup, the assistant secretary for post-secondary education, had reminded the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation that federal law would be violated if it ''offers funds to an institution in order to secure applicants for loans made under the Federal Family Education Loan program.''
 ''We're hoping that we headed it off,'' Ms. Stroup said in an interview on Thursday. She said she offered to have her department's lawyers review New York's proposed changes, but had so far received no documentation. 
 Critics of Mr. Pataki's proposal branded it a ''giveaway'' to the loan guaranty industry, particularly painful at a time when the state budget is also proposing withholding a third of money available to students under the Tuition Assistance Program until they graduate.
 ''It makes no sense to me and it hurts students and their families,'' said Miriam Kramer, coordinator of higher education at the New York Public Interest Research Group. The group called the amendment ''a short-term fiscal gain for the state at the long-term expense of students, consumers and the public.'' 
 Despite the federal warning, it was far from clear that state officials planned to abandon the effort.
 Michael Marr, a spokesman for the New York State Budget Office, said the budget amendment was not aimed at coercing campuses, but sought only ''to encourage a dialogue between SUNY, CUNY, and H.E.S.C., and it's already begun to do that.''

HEADLINE: Big Gap Found in Taxation Of Wages and Investments

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7 

 BODY:
Americans are being taxed more than twice as heavily on earnings from work as they are on investment income, even though more than half of all investment income goes to the wealthiest 5 percent of taxpayers, a new study has estimated.
 The study, which applied the most current tax laws to a database of 186,000 tax returns, found that federal income taxes on wages and other earnings average about 10.7 percent and that payroll taxes for Medicare and Social Security take another 12.7 percent. By contrast, federal taxes on investment income average about 9.6 percent.
 The study was produced by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal nonprofit research organization that has criticized tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy. Extrapolating from data supplied by the Internal Revenue Service, the study estimated that 43 percent of all investment income goes to the wealthiest 1 percent of households and 60 percent goes to the top 5 percent. 
 ''The huge disparity in taxation between earnings and investment income should shock average American taxpayers,'' said Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice. Tax experts said the calculations conformed with their own sense of the current tax code. The centerpiece of President Bush's last big tax package was a provision that halved taxes on stock dividends and reduced the top tax rate on capital gains to 15 percent, from 20 percent.
 Mr. Bush is proposing to exclude a huge share of investment profits from all taxation, by letting people contribute thousands of dollars a year in new retirement accounts and ''lifetime savings accounts,'' with tax-free earnings. 
 ''Conservatives and people like me would argue that the proper tax rate on investment income ought to be zero,'' said Chris Edwards, a tax analyst at the Cato Institute, a research group in Washington that advocates deep tax cuts. ''The whole paradigm on the right is to move away from taxing investment income and just tax income when it is consumed.''
 Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics and law at the University of California, Berkeley and an informal adviser to Senator John Kerry, said Congress had steadily made the tax code more favorable to investors over many years.
 ''Certainly, recent policy changes have been tilted in favor of investors,'' Mr. Auerbach said. ''But there has often been a struggle between giving people incentives to save and trying to have fairness.''
 The tax rate on investment profits is already an issue in the presidential election campaign. Mr. Kerry has vowed to eliminate last year's tax cut on stock dividends for the wealthiest taxpayers. President Bush has placed a priority on making the dividend tax cut permanent.
 Some of Mr. Bush's economic advisers would like to go much further, essentially scrapping taxes on investment income and replacing it with a broad consumption tax.
 The sweeping tax overhaul of 1986, which drastically lowered top tax rates for the wealthy but also wiped out scores of tax breaks, changed the tax rates for stock market profits and most other investment income so that they were taxed at the same rate as earnings from wages and salaries.
 But within a few years, Congress began passing measures that gradually reintroduced the tax preference for investment income. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush and Congress agreed to raise the top tax rate on personal income to 31 percent from 28 percent, but the top rate on long-term capital gains remained at 28 percent. President Bill Clinton later pushed through another increase in the top bracket for income taxes, to 39.6 percent, but Congress left the top rate on capital gains at 28 percent.
 In 1997, Congress widened the margin again by reducing the top rate on capital gains to 20 percent. Tax accountants began figuring out ways for wealthy clients to shelter their income. Existing laws continued to let people shelter investment income in tax-advantaged retirement accounts, college savings plans and tax-free municipal bonds.
 Mr. McIntyre said President Bush's tax cuts widened the preference for investors, reducing taxes on investment income by 22 percent while reducing taxes on ordinary earnings by 9 percent. By his calculations, the average tax rate on ordinary earnings was 2.1 times that on investment income when Mr. Bush became president and became 2.5 times after last year's tax cuts.
 If investment income were taxed exactly as earnings from work, Mr. McIntyre concluded, government tax revenues would increase by about $338 billion this year. Ninety-five percent of taxpayers would keep about two-thirds of their recent tax cuts, he estimated, while the average tax rate on the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers would rise to 33 percent, from 22 percent.

HEADLINE: Bush Focuses on Good Jobs News As the Bad News on Iraq Looms

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LA CROSSE, Wis., May 7 

 BODY:
President Bush carried the burden of the Iraqi prisoner abuse case on a campaign swing through Iowa and Wisconsin on Friday, but he used new job-creation figures to leaven his acknowledgment of national shame with a dose of economic optimism.
 As he campaigned by bus through two states that he lost in 2000 but is making a concerted push to win this time around, Mr. Bush used the news that the economy had created 288,000 jobs in April, the eighth-straight month of gains, to bolster his case that his tax cuts are helping bring about a return to prosperity. 
 ''I can't tell you how optimistic I am about the economy,'' Mr. Bush told an audience in Prairie du Chien, Wis. 
 But images of American military personnel abusing Iraqi prisoners, and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's testimony on Friday that there are more such pictures, loomed over his campaign stops.
 ''The abhorrent pictures on our TV screens have stained our honor,'' Mr. Bush said in Dubuque, Iowa.
 In Prairie du Chien, Mr. Bush pledged to ensure that those responsible for the abuse would be held accountable through a process that would be open for the world to see.
 ''The truth will be known,'' Mr. Bush said. ''In societies run by tyrants, you never find out the truth. This country honors every individual. We honor human rights and human dignity, and the example we set for the world will confirm that.''
 Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Bush did not watch Mr. Rumsfeld's testimony.
 But with the White House now very much on the defensive over foreign policy, Mr. Bush and his Democratic rival, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, both now find their strategies being reshaped by events.
 For months, Democrats saw the loss of jobs since Mr. Bush took office as the issue with the best chance of propelling Mr. Kerry to victory. But the economy now seems to be generating jobs at a substantial pace, potentially making the issue one that favors Mr. Bush. 
 At the same time, strategists in both parties said, the furor over the abuse of the Iraqi prisoners provides Mr. Kerry with a chance to draw a more distinct line between his approach to Iraq and Mr. Bush's.
 But the president still defended the invasion of Iraq. And he repeated a line from his stump speech that took on new overtones given the revelations of abuse in Iraq. ''Because our coalition acted,'' he said, ''Saddam's torture chambers are closed.''
 The president's campaign strategists have long believed that Mr. Bush could pull Iowa and Wisconsin into the Republican column, reversing narrow losses there in 2000. They said the area along the Mississippi River in both states was critical to that effort because it was culturally conservative and doing reasonably well economically.
 ''I like to be in hunting-fishing country,'' Mr. Bush said at a warehouse in Prairie du Chien.
 Underscoring his intention to fight for every vote in the area, Mr. Bush got out among the voters to a degree unusual for him. He stopped by a dairy farm in Hazel, Wis., for a quick tour, pulled into Lancaster, Wis., for a rally on the town square and walked into a custard shop along the road for a vanilla cone.

LENGTH: 710 words

HEADLINE: Contractors Return to Iraq, But Numbers Are Still Down

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

 BODY:
Contractors involved in the rebuilding of Iraq have begun returning to the country, but their numbers are still down by about a third from what they were before violence intensified in early April, American officials said Friday.
 Of the hundreds of Westerners under contract to rebuild $3.3 billion in power plants, sewage treatment plants and other facilities as well as local governmental institutions, just over 50 percent are now on the job compared with immediately before the violence flared, an American government official in Baghdad said.
 But Portia Palmer, a spokeswoman for the United States Agency for International Development, said some of the reduction was a result of projects coming to an end and workers rotating out of the country for scheduled rest. A reduction across the board of about a third was probably a result of the security situation, she said. 
 ''Seventy percent of the expatriate staff continues to work in Iraq,'' she said, ''and as the security situation continues to normalize, those expatriates who are mission-critical to our work are returning to work throughout the country.''
 In late April, government officials and private companies reported that two major contractors, General Electric and Siemens, had suspended most of their operations in Iraq, slowing some projects by as much as a month. But Tom Wheelock, director of infrastructure programs for the agency, said Friday that ''G. E. is back in country,'' and that he hoped Siemens would be operating at close to full strength as early as next week.
 Mr. Wheelock said that returning contractors had generally put in place new security measures to cope with the continuing dangers in Iraq. A G. E. spokesman, Gary Sheffer, declined to discuss directly the number of employees that the company now has in the country, citing security concerns. But he said the company ''is committed to meeting our customers' requirements in Iraq and continuing to be a part of the reconstruction.'' 
 Jack Bergen, a Siemens spokesman, said that the insurgency did affect certain projects, but that ''over all we are on schedule, and we are committed to make sure that we stay on schedule.'' 
 Another major rebuilding contractor, Bechtel, pulled a significant number of engineers and other workers out of Iraq in the last few weeks, Mr. Wheelock said. But he added that the insurgency had a much larger impact on contractors like RTI International, which is charged with rebuilding civil institutions.
 He said that unlike infrastructure work, where employees can often retreat to a secure base camp, contractors like RTI operate among the Iraqi population and are continually exposed to dangers.
 ''I just wouldn't want to leave the impression that these people are not coming back because they're afraid,'' Mr. Wheelock said. ''The fact is that they're exposed, and they're the ones with the most risk.''
 Valerie A. Kazanjian, a spokeswoman for Bechtel, said the company had continually moved employees in and out of Iraq for a variety of reasons, including the security situation. 
 ''Our work in Iraq continues,'' Ms. Kazanjian wrote in an e-mail message. ''We are working on approximately 50 projects, and our overall timetable has not been impacted.''
 As for RTI, compared with other companies, ''it does have a somewhat higher percentage of staff members who have been temporarily relocated outside Iraq,'' wrote Patrick Gibbons, a spokesman, in an e-mail message.
 Still, he wrote, the company estimates that 2,000 Iraqis continue to work for RTI on projects involving local governance. ''We have a plan to resume operations in the near future in areas where the security situation allows us to carry out our work safely,'' Mr. Gibbons wrote.
 A spokesman for the program management office of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, Capt. Bruce A. Cole of the Navy, said that of its major projects, ''We've not seen any noticeable impact on the number of Western workers at the five projects that have been our major projects at this point.''
 The office has so far awarded $1.93 billion for 68 projects, Captain Cole said, employing roughly 3,000 Iraqis on six of the major projects where actual construction work has begun.

HEADLINE: Shedding Populist Tone, Kerry Starts Move to Middle

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: PHOENIX, May 7 

 BODY:
He has dropped the red-meat riff on ''Benedict Arnold C.E.O.'s.'' He is talking up tax cuts for corporations, playing up his deficit-cutting credentials and taking on teachers over pay-for-performance.
 And on Friday, John Kerry came to the centrist Democratic Leadership Council here sounding little like the outraged, populist scourge of special interests and big business who fended off challenges from his left in the Democratic primaries.
 ''I believe, as I know you do, that the private sector is the engine of economic growth,'' Mr. Kerry told the group, which helped form many of Bill Clinton's policies on the economy, welfare and trade. ''I don't pretend that it's the government that does it all. I refuse to lead a party that loves jobs but hates the people that create them.'' 
 As he makes the transition from a primary contender to a general-election candidate, Mr. Kerry has been steadily, if subtly, tinkering with his message. He has dropped some of his more heated notes of outrage and added cooler ones about economic opportunity, empowerment, and shared responsibility, the cornerstones of Mr. Clinton's, and the council's, brand of progressivism.
 His trajectory is typical of presidential candidates, who play to their party's base in the primaries before striking out for the political center in the fall. Mr. Kerry, after all, had to contend with Howard Dean's antiwar message and then overcome John Edwards's populist appeal on trade. Now, by contrast, he is reaching out to independents and voters he calls ''non-Bush Republicans.''
 ''Howard Dean was the angry candidate, and he probably pulled some of the other candidates in that direction, but voters didn't go in that direction,'' Al From, the founder of the D.L.C., said in an interview. ''In a general election, the candidate with the most hopeful message is going to win it. Most people in the U.S. want to be rich, they want to get ahead, and that's why an opportunity-oriented message works.''
 In that vein, Mr. Kerry has been calling himself an ''entrepreneurial Democrat'' and notably assured an audience of donors three weeks ago that he did not want to soak the rich: ''I am not a redistributionist Democrat,'' he said. ''Fear not.''
 He also lifted an idea from the council itself two weeks ago, adopting its call last December for a ''contract with the middle class.''
 Mr. Kerry's path so far, though, has been more a matter of shifting emphasis than of sharp movement: His aides argue that his hunt to the middle ground really is a return to his comfort zone. And in his speech here, he noted some of the ways in which he has challenged Democratic orthodoxy in the past.
 Mr. Kerry said he voted for welfare overhaul ''when our party was divided'' over it, imposing ''tough work requirements and time limits,'' and that he pressed to legislate big money out of politics when ''both parties and this administration dragged their feet.''
 He also talked of how, ignoring the urging of many Democratic strategists, he is moving beyond the party's home turf of domestic policy and taking on President Bush over the military, terrorism, national defense and patriotism itself.
 ''For 30 years since Vietnam, the other party has tried to frighten voters into thinking that only Republicans care about national security,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''They attacked us so often that some in our party would rather try to change the subject to the economy than show our strength on national security.''
 By way of example, Mr. Kerry brushed off Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's apology earlier on Friday to attack Mr. Bush over the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners by their American captors. ''The chain of command goes all the way to the Oval Office,'' he said. ''Harry Truman did not say 'The buck stops at the Pentagon.' ''
 He added that the nation needed not just a new defense secretary, but a new president, ''one who is strong enough to take responsibility and, when necessary, correct course.''
 Mr. Kerry also sharply rebuked Mr. Bush's foreign policy as a whole, saying that America's military strength may be at a peak but that its moral authority is at a nadir.
 ''America wasn't put here to dominate the world,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''We have a higher calling: to lead it.''
 The Bush campaign concedes neither the national-security terrain nor the idea that Mr. Kerry is or ever was a centrist, let alone a deficit hawk. On Friday it arranged for Senator Zell Miller, the Georgia Democrat who is supporting Mr. Bush, to assert that Mr. Kerry was an extreme, out-of-touch liberal who had proposed $1.9 trillion in new spending. ''Kerry's spending can only be paid for with higher taxes on all Americans and would derail the economic recovery sparked by President Bush's pro-growth policies,'' Mr. Miller said in a statement.
 Mr. Kerry, for his part, told the D.L.C. that he would deliver the bipartisanship that he said Mr. Bush had forgotten. ''If you want to be a reformer with results, you have to be a uniter, not a divider,'' he said, poking at two of the president's 2000 campaign slogans.
 Perhaps because he has not taken any giant steps to the right, Mr. Kerry's centrism still feels somewhat tentative, though it pops up in his new wave of ads, with references to his work with Senator John McCain, a Republican, and to a vote in 1985 when he ''broke with his own party to support a balanced budget.''
 Mr. Kerry's latest break with Democratic dogma is his call for a ''new bargain'' with teachers, a $30 billion plan to steer new teachers to areas where they are needed in exchange for speedier ways to remove bad teachers and a system to reward excellent teachers with more pay.
 The bargain is not exactly onerous for teachers' unions, however, and both major teachers' unions responded by praising Mr. Kerry. Pay-for-performance incentives would be accompanied by across-the-board raises, and there would be more money for mentoring and professional development that the unions want.
 But more examples are coming, Mr. Kerry hinted: Next week he will start selling his health care program in earnest. ''My plan will actually lower the cost of health care, and it does it in a market-oriented, incentive-based way,'' he said, using words meant to warm the hearts of New Democrats everywhere. ''It will bring businesses to the table, not alienate them.''
 Mr. From said Mr. Kerry's appeal to the middle on pocketbook issues could be decisive. ''Democrats are going to come out for John Kerry, he doesn't need to worry about that,'' Mr. From said. ''He needs to make sure that the voters who make the difference between a 45 percent candidate and a 51 percent candidate can be persuaded.
 ''Some of them may vote because of resentment, but a lot of them are just trying to get ahead,'' he added. ''They're working more and more in the knowledge economy, they're more affluent, they're educated, and they respond more to the politics of aspiration than of grievance.''

HEADLINE: Here We Go Again

BYLINE: By AVI SALZMAN

 BODY:
FOR at least one repair shop, the state's decision to suspend emissions testing last month was essentially meaningless. At Colony Ford in Meriden, the testing program had become such a burden to customers and employees that the manager stopped taking appointments in March.
 ''The main reason we got into this was to help customers and bring in new business,'' said Bob Bochet, general manager at Colony Ford. ''It turned out we were upsetting more people than we were helping.''
 For better or worse, service stations are at the center of the testing controversy. They have invested thousands of dollars in testing equipment, turned over part of their stations to the program and hired more people to conduct the tests. With the program suspended, they have had to lay off some of those employees and are losing money because one of their repair bays is sitting unused. Now, service station owners and managers, who have been described variously as victims, culprits and innocent bystanders in the controversy, want their voices heard. 
 At shops like Colony Ford, the protest is quiet. But other station owners have been more outspoken, demanding to speak with the governor and legislators and talking to lawyers about a class-action lawsuit.
 The state suspended testing on April 22 for up to 90 days after legislators received a preliminary audit report detailing numerous concerns about the testing, which is run by Agbar Technologies of Chicago.
 The report documented various problems with Agbar's program, including fuzzy pictures on the videos monitoring the tests, delays in connecting to the online test site and technological loopholes that allow for fraud.
 Some cars built after 1996, for instance, were tested initially by hooking into the car's built-in computer system. After the cars failed and drivers paid for repairs, shops would retest the cars using a less stringent tailpipe test. This can be a legitimate procedure: sometimes the car isn't ready for the computer test and a different test must be done. But it also opens the door to fraud. If shop owners fail a car using a tougher test, and then use an easier version, it is difficult to determine whether the car passed because of the repairs or because of the easier test. Were the repairs even necessary?
 The preliminary audit found that on 35 percent of the tests on the cars surveyed built after 1996, technicians had switched to an easier test after failing cars on the more stringent computer test. Some of those, the auditors noted, ''appear questionable.''
 The auditors, Sierra Research and Gordon-Darby Systems, also commented that this provides an ''easy method to improperly pass vehicles.''
 Richard W. Joy, a partner in Sierra Research, would not comment on the audit until it is completed. They hoped to have it finished by the end of this week, but it could take longer, he said. 
 After the audit report was released, lawmakers moved quickly to suspend testing and chided Agbar for the flaws described in the report. The company soon struck back, filing suit against the state. Some station owners, like Colony Ford, agreed with the state's decision, despite the financial hardships it produced for the company.
 Mr. Bochet said he realized from the beginning of the program that it would be problematic. First the tests were delayed. Then, on the first day of testing, the program malfunctioned. Throughout the next few months, the computer regularly gave Mr. Bochet's technicians fits, often freezing and malfunctioning while customers waited and complained to his employees. And even though Agbar and the state would work quickly to bring the system back online, Mr. Bochet said he eventually had enough. He planned to try to opt out of the testing before it starts up again.
 ''We had no confidence in the system,'' he said. ''My people were getting beat up.''
 Mr. Bochet estimated that he had spent $8,000 to $10,000 on the program for signs, a television monitor, cameras and an alarm system, among other items.
 Other station owners said they thought the system, initially beset by a few technical problems, was just starting to work well and shouldn't have been shut down. Lawmakers should have contacted them before acting to suspend testing, the owners said.
 Many garages feel left out of the discussions going on in Hartford, said Michael Turner, president of Portland Automotive and a member of a council of service station owners who advise the state about the emissions program. Mr. Turner said he had fielded dozens of calls from shops since the testing was suspended. 
 ''At night, my ear aches from the phone,'' he said.
 Without a doubt, he said, this is a major financial hardship for stations. Between 300 and 900 service station employees were laid off because of the testing suspension, he estimated. Station owners will consequently pay more for unemployment insurance, he said. Garage bays filled with dynamometers and other testing equipment also can't be used for other services.
 ''Everyone has failed to talk to us about this, yet we're at the front line,'' Mr. Turner said.
 Immediately after the testing suspension, the council presented the Department of Motor Vehicles with a list of resolutions, which began with a simple statement: ''The program is not broken.'' 
 The owners want compensation for the money they have lost because of the suspension and ask to be consulted before future decisions about the program. They have also threatened a work stoppage and a class action lawsuit.
 ''We remained in limbo far too long to continue to sit idly by while the politicos played with our livelihoods,'' the council wrote.
 Mr. Turner said the contract the garage owners have with Agbar precludes a lawsuit, instead sending any dispute to arbitration. But lawyers have contacted station owners to discuss the possibility of filing suit, he said.
 Mr. Turner said last week that the council has since reconsidered its stance and is recommending that the garages work with Agbar to get the program back on line. Lawyers, he added, ''will just muddy the waters.''
 But the blame, according to some, travels in more than one direction.
 To at least one lawmaker, the garages are at fault for some of the problems detected in the audit. The system may have loopholes, but those loopholes only become problematic when they're exploited.
 State Senator Biagio Ciotto, a Democrat who is cochairman of the state's Transportation Committee, said the test-givers deserve blame.
 ''They're a part of the problem,'' he said, referring to reports of fraud. ''I'm not saying every dealer. But the dealerships have a responsibility. They should be policing their own.''
 Many garage owners dispute Mr. Ciotto's comments and attributed the crackdown by lawmakers to election-year bluster.
 ''The legislators are the ones doing this,'' said David Bouchard, the president of Bouchard Automotive in North Haven. ''We've got legislators who want to get re-voted into their positions.''
 Mr. Turner said the advisory council had offered to police wayward garages if presented with evidence of malfeasance, but were turned down. Garage owners, as much as anyone else, want the cheaters out of the program, he said.
 ''We have no room for anybody who's not doing it 100 percent,'' he said.
 The D.M.V. and the attorney general's office are investigating fraud at garages. Two garages, one in New London and one in Greenwich, have been kicked out of the program on allegations of fraud. More could follow.
 ''We're continuing to receive complaints, and they involve allegations of fraud, deceptive practices and similar very significant wrongdoing,'' said Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.
 Around the time of the suspension, Agbar sent hundreds of enforcement letters to testing stations throughout Connecticut, citing them for everything from failure to undergo iris scans before tests to switching testing methods on cars, Mr. Turner said. This was not business as usual, he said; it was ''something they chose to do after they realized their contract was in jeopardy.''
 The letters were ''a last minute attempt to show compliance,'' he said.
 Christopher Stock, executive vice president of Agbar, would not comment on the timing of the enforcement letters or other aspects of the testing program. Agbar released a statement around the time of the suspension warning people not to make decisions about the testing based solely on preliminary information.
 Lawmakers have agreed to wait for the final audit before they make any decisions about the status of Agbar's contract. After revelations in March that Agbar had unfairly failed thousands of vehicles because of a technical glitch, some lawmakers said the company had only one more chance to prove itself.
 The state could face penalties if it ends the program without finding another way to reduce air pollution. Hundreds of millions of dollars in federal highway funds would be put in jeopardy if the state stopped testing. Mr. Ciotto said he believed the state will get a waiver from the federal Environmental Protection Agency if it decided to cut ties with Agbar and end the program so that it doesn't incur penalties.
 Dave Conroy, the manager of air quality planning at the E.P.A.'s New England headquarters, said he expected that the agency would give the state leeway if it needed to end the testing program. But the state would have to quickly show that it was making progress toward cleaning the air, through a new auto testing program or another clean-air program.
 Massachusetts, for instance, incurred sanctions in the late 1990's for delays in beginning its emission testing program, Mr. Conroy said.
 ''If the state can show that we can still meet our air quality goals with a monitoring suspension, that's something that the E.P.A. can look at and determine what sort of action we need to take,'' he said. ''If they say it will take two years to get a new contractor on board, they'd have difficulty showing they're under the caps. The timing is critical.''

HEADLINE: Spider-Man's Major League Lesson

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
WHAT was the big deal? Spider-Man has been on base before.
 He married his redheaded sweetheart, Mary Jane Watson, in a public ceremony at home plate at Shea Stadium on June 5, 1987. This was a seminal event for Peter Parker, Spider-Man's alter ego, who had experienced his fair share of heartbreak, romantic and otherwise, from the time of his creation in the 1960's.
 ''To that point, superheroes didn't seem to have personal problems or even personal lives,'' Stan Lee, creator of Spider-Man and other Marvel Comics legends, said by telephone from Santa Monica, Calif. ''I said, why not do one who was like an average teenager, believable and empathetic, complex and human?'' 
 So the uncle who had reared Parker in Forest Hills, N.Y., was murdered by a thief whom the fledgling superhero might have captured but didn't. His first girlfriend died when she ventured too close to one of Spider-Man's tussles. In college, Parker struggled to pay the rent, participated in demonstrations against the Vietnam War and became entangled in a three-part series in which his best friend was addicted to drugs.
 By a strange quirk of promotional fate, the night of the Spider-Man wedding also marked the end of Dwight Gooden's two-month separation from the Mets after treatment for substance abuse. More than 51,000 fans cheered Gooden, as he took the mound against Pittsburgh, ignoring the advice of Dick Young, the renowned and reactionary columnist who had advised them in The New York Post to stand up and boo.
 However partisan, the unfiltered message was that the world of superheroes, real or imagined, must ultimately be viewed as complicated, flawed, much more our reflection than our fantasy.
 Which brings me back to a recent morning when the 10-year-old opened the newspaper and wondered what the heck his friendly neighborhood Spider-Man was doing on the front page of the sports section. I told him about the marketing agreement to pitch the Columbia Pictures ''Spider-Man 2'' release by festooning major league bases for a weekend next month, adding that objections had quickly been voiced.
 When he asked why, I said, ''Because people think it makes the game too much about money and takes away from its tradition and purity.'' And he said, innocently, not sarcastically, ''What purity?''
 The beauty of being young, we are reminded, is that you don't have to live in the past or romanticize it with selective memory.
 In the wake of the decision not to decorate or desecrate the bases, Commissioner Bud Selig is web-spinning the line about the ''higher standard'' baseball is held to, as if it has ever actually met that elusive standard. As if baseball wasn't an enterprise purely commercial and often crass long before our other charitable causes disguised as professional sports ventures.
 Listen, I resent ballpark gouging and other assaults on the senses and pocketbook as much as the next customer. But as to what constitutes excess, why are reflexive condemnations of new marketing devices always attributed to modern economics, accompanied by outcries of paradise lost? Why were the huge signs of yore considered part of the ballpark's inherent charm? Why do we recoil at all current sports broadcast hawking but fondly remember Marty Glickman's trademark basketball call, ''Good, like Nedick's''?
 The standards of approval, especially for baseball, can be arbitrary to the point of absurdity. George Steinbrenner targets 200 Yankee Stadium seats for premium service? The man is evil. The very rich Red Sox erect a pricey section over the Green Monster to squeeze every last dollar out of Fenway Park? Bravo, tasteful. Not for nothing, but whatever happened to that grand old tradition of hitting one into the screen?
 It's easy to lambaste baseball -- a sport that can't promote anything without tripping on a figurative dugout step -- but the rule of marketing is the more we buy, the more they'll sell. Once again, baseball is not our fantasy. It's our reflection. Even a 10-year-old should be able to make the connection between a culture that worships the bloated, gas-sucking vehicle and its national pastime superheroes who stand accused of improving their standard body equipment through the use of performance-enhancing fuel.
 We could all use a lesson in comic book accountability from Peter Parker, who has commanded the attention and respect of the young for more than four decades.
 ''He still has that sense of reality about him,'' said Dan Buckley, publisher of Marvel Comics. ''He still makes mistakes. So, of course, does Superman, but he can fix them while Peter lives with the consequences, with his guilt.''
 Sometimes guilt is wrongly assigned. Baseball did nothing so ghastly in this episode, which Stan Lee would caption: ''A storm in a teacup.'' Baseball tried to marginally profit by playing to children through a colorful comic book character. America spoke out, swiftly and decisively. The bases have been spared. They will remain as white as the players were back when tradition was honored, in the so-called good, old days.

HEADLINE: War and Abuse Do Little Harm To U.S. Brands

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Claudia Deutsch, in New York; Wayne Arnold, in Singapore; and Todd Zaun, in Tokyo, contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 8 

 BODY:
When American troops moved into Iraq last year, European executives at the Ford Motor Company braced for an adverse consumer reaction.
 ''Our sales and image and market share are things we monitor extremely closely,'' said Niel Golightly, a Ford spokesman in Cologne, Germany. ''So the potential fallout risk from Ford being perceived as a symbol of America's foreign policy is something we're always looking at.''
 But aside from a single incident at a dealership in Italy last year, the company has seen no evidence that widespread anti-Americanism abroad has been aimed at the well-known Ford brand. In Europe, Mr. Golightly said, Ford's market share has remained steady, and sales are expected to improve slightly this quarter. And the business outlook remains upbeat despite recent developments in Iraq, including the revelation of photographs depicting the humiliation of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers. 
 For a variety of reasons, American companies that sell globally say that they have so far experienced little if any disruption from discontent over the war in Iraq. For the most part, consumers around the world seem as likely to be influenced by economic conditions as by politics. And, in a display of the growing sophistication in marketing big American brands in global markets, many people see products originating from the United States as firmly rooted in their own home nations.
 Even Muslims in the Middle East and Southeast Asia do not seem to translate their anger into a boycott of American products. For example, as Hidayat bin Ismail, 19, emerged Friday from midday prayers at the Sultan Mosque in Singapore, he acknowledged that he was still patronizing places like McDonald's and KFC even after seeing the pictures of American soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners.
 ''When Americans do these things, I don't think all Americans are bad,'' he said. ''And if one Muslim is bad, it doesn't mean all Muslims are bad either.''
 Still, while there are few signs that goods and services clearly identified with the United States are being shunned overseas, that has not prevented American companies from worrying that their products might eventually become a bigger target for dissatisfaction with the Bush administration's conduct in Iraq. 
 ''We're more concerned at the moment with higher taxes than with anti-Americanism,'' said Fred Irwin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce here in Frankfurt. ''That said, there's always a cloud over industry if political issues are left unattended. You have to remain vigilant about reminding people that politics is different from business.''
 That message sometimes falls on deaf ears. When Heiko Muller sought a way to display his opposition to the United States occupation of Iraq, he decided there was only one way to show he meant business. He canceled his orders with Americans.
 As an owner of Riese und Muller, a bicycle manufacturer near here, Mr. Muller responded last year to the invasion of Iraq by canceling orders to American suppliers for brakes and gears worth nearly $400,000. 
 ''The only thing we could do as a company was to hit the Americans where it hurt, in their pocketbook,'' Mr. Muller said. ''Everything that is happening in Iraq tells me our decision was justified.'' 
 Some places are more prone to outbursts. In Argentina, Quebracho, a small nationalist organization, has temporarily taken over a few branches operated by some American banks. Quebracho members demonstrated in March on the first anniversary of the invasion of Iraq; a Citibank branch in downtown Buenos Aires was vandalized in the protest.
 In Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, Remy Sjahdeini, a prominent lawyer in Jakarta, expressed surprise that there had been no response to what he called the ''disgusting'' behavior toward Iraqi prisoners. He said the public, particularly the politically vocal student population, was preoccupied with the nation's election campaign. 
 Companies that have been operating internationally for decades seem relatively immune to anti-American attitudes, in part perhaps because they avoid being perceived as particularly American. 
 At many longtime multinational companies, executives say they always try to give their products, marketing and image the unique flavor of the locality where they operate. Other companies try to blend in by maintaining a geographically generic image, so they are not associated with any one country or culture. 
 Eastman Kodak is a prime example of the first approach. Kodak's sales in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, a region it treats as one entity for reporting purposes, have been rising lately, gaining 14 percent in the first quarter of this year over the corresponding quarter in 2003. 
 ''I'm not aware of any effect on our business from current attitudes towards America,'' said Gerard Muechner, a Kodak spokesman. 
 Kodak attributes the marked lack of hostility to the pains it has taken to cater to local tastes and sensibilities. Its self-service kiosks in the United States are generally tall and boxy; in China, they are much smaller and shaped almost like arched parabolas, a shape that fits more easily into Chinese stores, and is more aesthetically pleasing to the Chinese eye.
 Even McDonald's, one of the most vivid symbols of the United States abroad, has sought to emphasize how locally integrated it has become. McDonald's, one of the largest private-sector employers in Brazil, is sometimes the target of taunts in left-wing demonstrations on Avenida Paulista, one of Sao Paulo's main streets, but it is also common to see demonstrators eating at McDonald's after the rallies. 
 Such feelings about McDonald's were echoed in Asia and Europe. ''We've been in Japan more than 30 years and all of our employees are Japanese,'' said Tatsuyuki Kanari, a McDonald's Japan spokesman. 
 Similarly, Ricarda Ruecker, a spokeswoman for McDonald's Germany in Munich, noted, ''Two-thirds of our stores are owned and operated by German entrepreneurs so we try to remind people that hurting McDonald's is like hurting fellow citizens in Germany.'' 
 For the most part, boycotts announced against American products last year have fizzled out.
 When the United States was preparing to invade Iraq last year, the Muslim Consumer Association of Malaysia called for a boycott of Coca-Cola, and there was a flurry of news media reports on the sudden popularity of local brands of cola.
 But Marimuthu Nadason, secretary general of the Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations, said that boycott was ignored by most of the public. The latest news from Iraq had done little to diminish Malaysian's taste for American imports. ''Anyone can call for a boycott,'' he said, ''but it won't work.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Slip on Worries Over Inflation and Rates

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Despite evidence that the economic recovery is gaining momentum, concern over inflation and rising interest rates weighed on stocks, and all three major market gauges fell for the week.
 The Labor Department reported on Friday that American companies added 288,000 workers in April, which was more than many economists had expected. 
This data provided additional support for those investors who are convinced that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates quickly to head off inflation.
 As a result, many stocks deemed interest-rate sensitive came under pressure. These included financial service companies like Citigroup and companies dependent on home building like Pulte Homes and Home Depot. One big exception was Charter One Financial, which rose 3.4 percent for the week on news of an acquisition offer by Royal Bank of Scotland Group.
 For the week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.6 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,098.70. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 108.23 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,117.34. The Nasdaq composite declined by 2.19 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,917.96. Also, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.78 from 4.51 percent. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Cursed By Oil

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I visited the Japanese cellphone company DoCoMo in Tokyo 10 days ago. A robot made by Honda gave me part of the tour, even bowing in perfect Japanese fashion. My visit there coincided with yet another suicide bomb attack against U.S. forces in Iraq. I could not help thinking: Why are the Japanese making robots into humans, while Muslim suicide squads are making humans into robots?
 The answer has to do in part with the interaction between culture and natural resources. Countries such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China have relatively few natural resources like oil. As a result, in the modern age, their first instinct is to look inward, assess their weaknesses, try to learn as much as they can from foreigners and then beat them at their own game. In order to beat the Westerners, they have even set aside many of their historical animosities so they can invest in each other's countries and get all the benefits of free trade. 
 The Arab world, alas, has been cursed with oil. For decades, too many Arab countries have opted to drill a sand dune for economic growth rather than drilling their own people -- men and women -- in order to tap their energy, creativity, intellect and entrepreneurship. Arab countries barely trade with one another, and unlike Korea and Japan, rarely invent or patent anything. But rather than looking inward, assessing their development deficits, absorbing the best in modern knowledge that their money can buy and then trying to beat the West at its own game, the Arab world in too many cases has cut itself off, blamed the enduring Palestine conflict or colonialism for delaying reform, or found dignity in Pyrrhic victories like Falluja.
 To be sure, there are exceptions. Jordan, Qatar, Bahrain, Dubai, Morocco and Tunisia are all engaged in real experiments with modernization, but the bigger states are really lost. A week ago we were treated again to absurd Saudi allegations that ''Zionists'' were behind the latest bombing in Saudi Arabia, because, said Saudi officials, ''Zionists'' clearly benefit from these acts. Someone ought to tell the Saudis this: Don't flatter yourselves. The only interest Israelis have in Saudi Arabia is flying over it to get to India and China -- countries that actually trade and manufacture things other than hatred of ''infidels.''
 The Bush team has made a mess in Iraq, but the pathologies of the Arab world have also contributed -- and the sheer delight that some Arab media take in seeing Iraq go up in flames is evidence of that. It's time for the Arab world to grow up -- to stop dancing on burning American jeeps and claiming that this is some victory for Islam.
 One thing about countries like Singapore, Korea, Taiwan and Japan, they may not have deserts but they sure know the difference between the mirage and the oasis -- between victories that come from educating your population to innovate and ''victories'' that come from a one-night stand by suicidal maniacs like 9/11.
 As I said, the Bush team has made a mess in Iraq. And I know that Abu Ghraib will be a lasting stain on the Pentagon leadership. But here's what else I know from visiting Iraq: There were a million acts of kindness, generosity and good will also extended by individual U.S. soldiers this past year -- acts motivated purely by a desire to give Iraqis the best chance they've ever had at decent government and a better future. There are plenty of Iraqis and Arabs who know that.
 Yes, we Americans need to look in a mirror and ask why we've become so radioactive. But the Arabs need to look in a mirror too. ''They are using our mistakes to avoid their own necessity to change, reform and modernize,'' says the Mideast expert Stephen P. Cohen.
 A senior Iraqi politician told me that he recently received a group of visiting Iranian journalists in his home. As they were leaving, he said, two young Iranian women in the group whispered to him: ''Succeed for our sake.'' Those Iranian women knew that if Iraqis could actually produce a decent, democratizing government it would pressure their own regime to start changing -- which is why the Iranian, Syrian and Saudi regimes are all rooting for us to fail.
 But you know what? Despite everything, we still have a chance to produce a decent outcome in Iraq, if we get our eye back on the ball. Of course, if we do fail, that will be our tragedy. But for the Arabs, it will be a huge lost opportunity -- one that will only postpone their future another decade. Too bad so few of them have the courage to stand up and say that. I guess it must be another one of those ''Zionist'' plots.

HEADLINE: Atlantic City Seeks New Image: Las Vegas's

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, May 6 

 BODY:
Atlantic City turns 150 this summer, and it's busy working up its next act.
 It sold cool ocean breezes by day and bawdy entertainment at night back when cities on the East Coast had tight morals and no air-conditioning.
 Then it sold gambling, when the only other legal gambling was some 2,000 miles away in Nevada.
 And now, with gambling almost everywhere, and even more on the way, the Atlantic City casinos and the New Jersey state government are spending close to $1 billion to remake the city into a glossy shopping, entertainment and -- yes -- gambling attraction, with Las Vegas as its model for a destination resort. 
 ''We are going to make ourselves into the Queen City of the Atlantic again,'' said Curtis J. Bashaw, executive director of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, which collects a 1.25 percent tax on casino revenue and puts it back into economic development projects in the city and elsewhere in the state.
 The urgency is clear in the city's books: except for the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa, which opened in July, the city's casino revenue is barely growing, as more and more gambling outlets open in a tightening ring around the shore. Delaware and West Virginia now have casinos; the two giant Indian casinos in Connecticut are attracting New Yorkers, and more may be on the way; Pennsylvania wants to install slot machines at horse tracks, including in Philadelphia, which is practically in Atlantic City's backyard. And Gov. George E. Pataki wants to open three half-billion-dollar Indian resort casinos in the Catskills, 30 miles closer to the heart of Manhattan than Atlantic City, which is 130 miles away.
 According to an analysis by Harrah's 2003 Profile of the American Casino Gambler, more of the metropolitan Washington's 700,000 casino gamblers go to Delaware or West Virginia -- places that did not have legal gambling 10 years ago -- than come here. Baltimore and Philadelphia are sending a growing share of its gamblers someplace else. And even though the New York City metropolitan region's 5 million regular gamblers still favor Atlantic City, 13 percent go to Connecticut, and more will head for the Catskills when the opportunity comes.
 There is also a sense here, although no one says it out loud, that this town is not attracting enough of the right kind of people, which is to say people with time and money -- the kind who fly to Las Vegas for a week of gambling, dining and shopping. 
 In fact, Atlantic City's businesses have complained about ''shoobies,'' a derogatory reference to day trippers that dates back to an era when they carried their lunches in shoe boxes. The sense here is that the city has to keep people here for longer stays.
 ''Atlantic City had the monopoly on gaming regionally, and that's being eroded,'' Mr. Bashaw said. ''The casinos now understand that the next chapter for Atlantic City is to move past the day trippers that have been their bread and butter and go back to the roots of this town. We will wean ourselves from being the image of a day-trip destination to being a hot spot again.''
 Although Atlantic City's 12 casinos take in about the same $4.5 billion a year in gambling that the 22 big hotels along the Vegas Strip do, they make only $300 million on nongambling attractions like shopping, dining and personal care spas. ''And I think even that $300 million is exaggerated,'' said Dennis C. Gomes, head of the Tropicana Casino and Resort in Atlantic City and president for resort operations at the Aztar Corporation, which owns the Tropicana here and the Tropicana in Las Vegas. 
 The Las Vegas hotels make much more on nongambling operations, $9.5 billion last year, according to Frank Streshley of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, although that figure includes revenue from a 23rd casino.
 No wonder, then, that the buzzword around here is ''nongaming revenue.'' The Sands announced on Thursday that it had started planning for a hotel expansion, with more shopping and entertainment space. Caesars and Gordon Group Holdings are spending $150 million to gut the old Ocean One pier, which was, until recently, a dingy warren of cheap shops and restaurants across the Boardwalk from Caesars. They plan to put in a high-end shopping and dining attraction, with Gucci already signed as a tenant, and Polo, Tiffany and Chanel among the others in lease negotiations, Mr. Bashaw said.
 ''Basically we're moving 57th and Madison Avenue to Atlantic City,'' said Sheldon Gordon, chairman of Gordon Group Holdings. ''People told me the public wouldn't shop where they gamble,'' Mr. Gordon said from his Connecticut office. ''They said I was going to lose my shirt, and I had to bet the ranch on the Forum.'' The project in Atlantic City will be the Pier at Caesars, and its motto, ''If you liked the desert, you'll love the ocean.''
 At the same time, Harrah's Atlantic City recently announced a new hotel and shopping tower project; Resorts Atlantic City is scheduled to open its new $125 million, 27-story hotel tower later this summer and is in discussions over more expansion; and Mr. Gomes's Tropicana will open its new shopping, dining and spa addition, designed to recall pre-Castro Havana and called The Quarter, this fall.
 Las Vegas is not the only model Atlantic City's casinos have for inspiration. They are also watching with awe and some jealousy the way the $1.1 billion Borgata is drawing the big spenders away from them. Since it opened in July, Borgata has cut so heavily into the market that most of the casinos are barely even, year to year, on their win, or the amount players lost. 
 And Borgata's success is due in large part to its nongambling attractions, including bigger and more expensive hotel rooms, fancy restaurants, and, most particularly, the Spa Tocare, which has an eight-week waiting list for weekend appointments for $225 Napa Valley grape-seed body scrubs and $150 facials.
 ''You can't get in there,'' said Eugene Christiansen, a principal in Christiansen Capital Advisors, a major casino financial consulting group. ''We have a presence in the casino market and I can tell you, we get calls more often than I would like from California and everywhere else from people asking us if we can help them into the spa at Borgata.''
 Mr. Christiansen said Borgata was generating a quarter of its revenue from outside the casino floor, twice the rate for the other casinos.
 ''This market is starved for nongaming facilities,'' he said. ''I can't read the numbers any other way.''

HEADLINE: Those Strangers on a Train, Nine Years Later

 BODY:
''BEFORE SUNRISE,'' Richard Linklater's charming 1995 comedy starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, ended with a promise: the two characters, Jesse and Celine, would meet in Vienna six months later to continue the romance that began with a chance meeting on a train. Only a modest success at the time of its release, the film has become a dorm-room classic (much like Mr. Linklater's first two films, ''Slacker'' and ''Dazed and Confused'') with its portrait of reluctant adults torn between the cynicism of the day and the romance of their youth. Now Mr. Linklater, Ms. Delpy and Mr. Hawke have collaborated on ''Before Sunset,'' which picks up the story nine years later when Jesse and Celine meet at a Paris bookstore where Jesse is promoting his first novel, based on the night they spent together. The three share screenwriting credit on the film, which is dialogue heavy and packed with stirring monologues and grown-up revelations. In March, ''Before Sunset'' played at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Mr. Linklater's hometown. He joined Ms. Delpy and Mr. Hawke to talk with Sarah Hepola about their collaboration.

SARAH HEPOLA -- This is the kind of project that people talk about doing a lot. When did you decide to actually do it?
 It's just so rare that a sequel doesn't come out in the next year or two after the first one. But the first one wasn't a big success or anything. So there was no economic motivation.

RICHARD LINKLATER -- It seemed over time to get more successful. It was made for $2.7 million, and it made over $20 million.

HEPOLA -- It's a film I still see on lists of top-10 romantic films.

LINKLATER -- It's one of those that kind of sneaks up. It's funny how films have their economic life in that window when they come out. Our film was weird. There wasn't a lot of music in it. It wasn't MTV-style. It had nothing to do with the pop culture moment. There were no references to anything. It was just two people.

HEPOLA -- Why did it take so many years to return to Jesse and Celine?

LINKLATER -- It took us that long to come up with the right idea. And as more time went by, it changed how we could write it. You know, the original idea of the sequel was to do it six months later. Well, nine years went by and we didn't make the six-months-later version, so we had to come up with a new version of what happened.

HEPOLA -- There's a scene in the movie where Jesse is sort of pressed by journalists and fans about how his story turned out. Was that an experience that the three of you had after ''Before Sunrise''?

JULIE DELPY -- I think, yeah.

HAWKE -- Everybody did. That was the question.

LINKLATER -- It was the question.

DELPY -- ''What happens to them?''

HEPOLA -- And how did you respond to that?

LINKLATER -- I responded to it the same way he does in the movie. I always said that the movie was a litmus test for how you view romance. Some people would go: ''It's so clear. They will never get back together.'' People were so sure. Based on their own ----

DELPY -- Their romantic history.

LINKLATER -- History, yeah. So I just kind of thought it was -- I always thought they did get back together. So I always thought they would.

HEPOLA -- What did you two think?

DELPY -- I thought they would.

HAWKE -- I always thought they would. [To Delpy] I knew you would come back.

HEPOLA -- So among the decisions that you needed to make when doing this sequel was to decide if they were going to have returned.

DELPY -- It was clear they didn't meet again six months later.

HAWKE -- But it had to be not like they didn't try.

LINKLATER -- We all liked the idea that fate kind of kept them apart. It's so dumb to make it where you have to meet each other one day, because what if something happened that day?

HAWKE -- There was a design flaw in their plan. Due to their romanticism they left no backups.

LINKLATER -- What's funny about ''Before Sunrise'' is that you couldn't make that film now. Because there really would be ----

DELPY -- E-mail now. They would exchange e-mails.

LINKLATER -- It's unfathomable that they wouldn't instant message each other.

DELPY -- I was always thinking, what would stop her from going back? It would only be something really serious, like the death of someone really close to her. The death of her grandmother . . .

HEPOLA -- So you sat down in L.A. and hammered out an outline.

LINKLATER -- We weren't starting from a blank page. We had been tossing around ideas for years. But the first thing was coming up with the idea of it being in real time.

HEPOLA -- What were your initial notions about what had happened to your characters? Julie, you said you thought she might have been a cosmologist.

DELPY -- Yeah, at first. Cosmologist I thought was interesting because I love science. And you have to be passionate to do that. After a while I got more and more involved with friends of mine that were activists. And I was like, O.K., she's going to have to be an activist, because it's going to be so easy for me to write this -- I can just take from people I spend all day with every day of my life.

HEPOLA -- [To Hawke] And of course your character has written books.

HAWKE -- Yeah. That idea spawned out of Rick coming to a reading of mine.

LINKLATER -- Yeah. I introduced you at a reading here. It seemed like a good kickoff. Such a fun way for them to meet again.

HAWKE -- It's kind of a romantic notion, too.

LINKLATER -- Yeah. That you would write something about somebody.

HAWKE -- And that would be a way to conjure them back in your life.

LINKLATER -- You know, the very first movie was made -- I mean, my acorn of an idea way back then was, I met this woman in Philadelphia. And we spent a night walking around. And it was great. And I was thinking, ''This could be a movie.'' Filmmaker's curse. I'm walking around going, ''If I could just capture this feeling I'm having right now,'' instead of actually having that feeling. But I always thought maybe she would show up at a ''Before Sunrise'' screening or something. She never did. But I always expected, ''Oh, hi, I'm Amy. Remember me?'' It would be so weird.

HEPOLA -- So getting back to the three days that you spent writing. If you could just tell me about how that happened. You just sit around talking?

HAWKE -- We just goof off a lot. We play music and we talk. We talk about life. And we ----

LINKLATER -- You show up with ideas. You go, O.K., it's going to happen in real time.

HAWKE -- ---- digress into environmental and political issues.

LINKLATER -- O.K., great, it's going to start in a bookstore. What happens then?
DELPY -- What they're doing. Why they didn't show up [for their reunion].

LINKLATER -- There were all the specifics of why and what, but then there was what we just called the emotional trajectory. This is the part where they're getting to know one another again.

HAWKE -- Yeah, you can't have too serious a conversation when you first meet. You have to have more of a flirty dialogue. O.K. Then you're going to talk about politics or something that isn't personal, but ----

LINKLATER -- But you're expressing who you are.

HAWKE -- Yeah, basically trying to seduce each other with how interesting their ideas are, but without coming on to each other.

DELPY -- It's flirting without flirting.

HAWKE -- And then you're going to have to take it to the next level, where you actually talk about something personal.

DELPY -- Kidding around about sex.

HAWKE -- Yeah, that's right, then the flirtation turns into sexual dialogue. Then you've got to dig even deeper and say something really personal. And then you can make love.

LINKLATER -- What happened is, we could start setting up this basic outline. And then we would just talk. And then we would leave it for six months.

HAWKE -- Julie was writing volumes. And I was writing monologues for my character. And Rick was assembling all this stuff and writing a bunch of stuff himself.

LINKLATER -- It was a first draft, we could say. Then we got together in Paris.

HAWKE -- It was enough to get the money together for the movie.

HEPOLA -- [To Hawke] At one point your character says that people don't change. But there are certain things that did change about these two. In some ways, they've switched roles.

DELPY -- She was the romantic, the one who wanted more of a relationship.

HAWKE -- In the first one, yeah. He's more cynical in the first one, yeah.

DELPY -- I think it's because she was so romantic in the first film, she probably got hurt maybe more than he had.

HAWKE -- And because he was so cynical, he's now looking for meaning. That whole thing about that idea of people changing or not changing is kind of interesting. I don't think they were that different. It's like when a baby is born -- I just noticed this with my own daughter. You look at a picture of a kid when they're 9 months old and you look at a picture of them when they're 7 or something. And you say it looks like her. But when they're 9 months old, you don't know what are the parts of them that are going to be consistent and which are going to go away. It always looks like the same person. But you can't identify which ones are the center. You know? People do change and they don't change.

DELPY -- People get tougher and this and that. But I always think, like I say in the film, reading a journal from when you're a kid, what you are deep inside, the way you sense things, the way you sense the outside world and the way you analyze it, will always stay the same.

HEPOLA -- I'm curious what you think when you see yourself in the earlier film.

HAWKE -- It was surprising. You see these cuts of the first movie and you're like, ''Wow.'' Because you feel like the same person, you know? But you look at it and you go, ''I was really a kid, man.''

LINKLATER -- You guys were 23?

HAWKE -- Twenty-three years old.

DELPY -- Yeah, we've changed. I don't mind. I don't mind changing. I don't mind getting older.

HEPOLA -- In the film, Celine says that the book stirs up a lot of emotions for her. Does watching the first film stir up emotions for all three of you?

DELPY -- Yeah, it did.

LINKLATER -- I'm behind the camera, so there's no real record of me. Yeah, I mean sure, nine years older, nine years, you know. Life goes on.

DELPY -- Wiser.

LINKLATER -- Wiser, more naive.

DELPY -- Happier, I think.

LINKLATER -- More resolved about life or something.

DELPY -- Happier.


ETHAN HAWKE -- It was about a year after. We were all in L.A. We had a breakfast or something. It was in the air pretty early.

HEADLINE: Seeing One Tunnel Too Many

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
MARK HUDAK is an insurance defense lawyer from Uniondale who travels to Lower Manhattan at least three times a week for court appearances.
 Like many commuters, he has tested different railroad and subway combinations to try to shave as many minutes as possible from his travel time. His current favored option takes about 70 minutes and involves changing trains at Jamaica and switching to a subway at the Long Island Rail Road's Atlantic/Flatbush terminal in Brooklyn.
 Even though the last leg of his morning journey is the shortest, he said, ''waiting for the subway is when I consider my work day beginning, because it's the toughest part of the trip. The rest is more relaxed and predictable.'' 
 So, like other commuters destined for Lower Manhattan who were interviewed last week at the Mineola train station, Mr. Hudak said he welcomed a plan proposed by Governor Pataki on Wednesday that would finally create a one-seat ride from Lower Manhattan to Kennedy Airport and the Jamaica terminal of the Long Island Rail Road.
 ''Anything that takes us anywhere near downtown without having to switch to a subway would make perfect sense,'' Mr. Hudak said. He added, though, that he would reserve final judgment until he determined how much time and money he would save from the proposed train link.
 Mr. Pataki proposed a $6 billion plan to build a new tunnel under the East River that would link Lower Manhattan to Kennedy Airport and Long Island. He said the new rail link could cut 15 minutes from a Long Islander's commute to downtown Manhattan and could handle up to 100,000 passengers a day. 
 ''Long Islanders as well as Queens and Brooklyn commuters will experience a more direct and more comfortable trip to Lower Manhattan,'' Mr. Pataki said. He said the new link would reduce congestion on subways that carry Long Island riders from Penn Station or the Atlantic Terminal and would also strengthen the competitiveness of the airport by giving air travelers a 36-minute connection from Kennedy to Manhattan.
 The plan would allow riders to get to Lower Manhattan from the airport and the Jamaica railroad terminal in Queens in a newly designed hybrid vehicle that would travel on the tracks of the AirTrain and altered tracks of the Long Island Rail Road. The new train would travel from the airport, through Jamaica and Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn and then through the new tunnel into Manhattan.
 The proposal is also supported by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, but perhaps the loudest and most persistent lobbyists for the new connection have been downtown business leaders, who feel that Lower Manhattan has for too long been at a competitive disadvantage to Midtown because it lacks one-seat access to the suburbs.
 But there has been no corresponding clamor for the rail link from Long Islanders. Indeed, business leaders, transit advocates and planning experts have questioned the need for the project, particularly when limited transportation dollars are needed for other projects they deem more pressing, particularly the East Side Access plan to connect the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal.
 Transit advocates said last week that they were skeptical of the estimate that the downtown link would cut a commute by 15 minutes, and noted that only those Long Islanders who are headed to the World Trade Center area, where the train would stop, would actually achieve those savings. Others who work farther downtown or uptown would still have to walk or take a subway to get to their jobs, reducing any time savings.
 ''The downtown link is not the highest priority for Long Island, from our perspective,'' said Mitchell H. Pally, the vice president for government affairs at the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business group. ''We're not opposed to it, but there are more important projects that we want to make sure are implemented and finished.''
 Beverly Dolinsky, executive director of the Long Island Rail Road Commuter's Council, agreed. ''We don't support downtown access because it's very, very expensive and the case has not been made that enough people would use it and we're dealing with scarce dollars,'' she said. The Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit agency that focuses on 31 counties in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, estimated that only 5,000 to 8,000 riders might use the new link during peak hours, based on current ridership figures. The association did its analysis prior to the governor's announcement, which relied on recommendations made in a joint study done by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the city Economic Development Corporation.
 ''In terms of cost benefit and the number of riders it would benefit, it just doesn't make sense,'' Ms. Dolinsky said. ''You're going to spend $6 billion for 5,000 riders at rush hour?'' Estimates for the proposed $17 billion Second Avenue subway anticipate 220,000 riders on its first day.
 Mr. Pataki said last week that the Port Authority had already committed $560 million for the downtown rail link and that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation would also kick in some funding. There also is an estimated $2.8 billion left from the $21 billion federal relief package designated for Lower Manhattan after Sept. 11 that could be tapped.
 But opponents of the downtown link fear that the governor ultimately will also have to seek federal transportation dollars, and the downtown link will then come in direct competition with other Long Island transportation projects, particularly given the governor's timetable for the new tunnel. Mr. Pataki said he expected to begin the formal environmental review process for the downtown rail link this summer. He said he hoped to see construction begin in 2006 and have service begin in 2013.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer said he supports the idea of a rail link to downtown, but only if the federal relief package for Lower Manhattan can cover the bulk of its cost. ''I think this is a good idea for downtown and for Long Island, but we should not use transit bill money to build it,'' he said. ''That money should go to East Side Access and other transportation projects.''
 Mr. Pally said that other Long Island railroad projects that should have higher priority include the East Side Access project, which is scheduled for completion in 2012, and a third track on the railroad's Main Line, which would allow a significant expansion of service between Bellerose and Hicksville and is supposed to be completed in 2016. Even longer-range projects like transportation alternatives in the Nassau Hub, the expansion of Route 347 on the North Shore of Suffolk County and the building of a new freight tunnel under New York Harbor, which would reduce truck traffic on Long Island, should take precedence, he added.
 ''All these projects would impact more people and provide additional options for Long Islanders,'' Mr. Pally said. ''With the limited amount of state and federal funding that's out there, these other projects should definitely take priority.''
 Gene Russianoff, staff attorney of the New York Public Interest Research Group Straphangers Campaign, said the M.T.A. and the federal government would be hard-pressed to come up with additional funding to help pay the $6 billion price tag for the downtown rail link. ''How do you do that while still progressing the Second Avenue subway and East Side Access, which in our view are the region's top priorities?'' he asked. ''The M.T.A. already has big capital needs to fix and maintain the existing system and is already challenged to find resources for new projects.''
 Jon Orcutt, an associate director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a nonprofit transit advocacy group, said he was pleased that the governor last week expressed a clear preference for a new tunnel over proposals to use existing subway tunnels. ''That takes away the political problem of having to battle subway riders and disrupting their service,'' he said. ''But then it just becomes another one of these big-ticket projects in search of funding.''
 He and other transit advocates warned that while planning for East Side Access is complete, the $6.3 billion needed to finish the project has not yet been secured. ''The Long Island Rail Road's entire network strategy for the 21st century revolves around it,'' Mr. Orcutt said. ''And it's already unclear how they're going to pay for it.''
 Planning for the East Side Access project began about 30 years ago. A two-level tunnel connecting Manhattan to Queens at 63rd Street was completed in 1989, but it only extends to Second Avenue in Manhattan and does not connect to existing rail lines in Queens. The subway system has been using the upper level of the tunnel for the last decade, but the lower level was intended for the Long Island Rail Road and has never been used.
 John McCarthy, a spokesman for the M.T.A., said work to finally connect the empty tunnel to the railroad began last winter, including the building of a rail yard in Long Island City and the opening of a hole in Sunnyside to eventually complete the tunnel connection. The project involves building 3.5 more miles of tunnel and a new station that would go beneath the existing Grand Central concourse. The M.T.A. so far has committed $1.5 billion to the project and M.T.A. officials hope to have the federal government foot half of the total $6.3 billion cost.
 The Regional Plan Association has long been an advocate for East Side Access, because some 60,000 Long Island commuters would save up to 22 minutes in travel time each way once Long Island Rail Road trains can stop at Grand Central. ''It would strengthen the economy of Long Island by making it a much more attractive place to live for commuters who work in the city,'' said Jeffrey Zupan, a transportation expert with the association.
 But the group has been more circumspect about the downtown rail link because it would end at the World Trade Center transportation center, and does not offer other stops in Lower Manhattan. The group has also recommended that any new tunnel be connected to the proposed Second Avenue subway, which then could be extended into Brooklyn. ''The tunnel then would have a huge value for people in Brooklyn who now have very limited options for getting into the East Side of Manhattan,'' Mr. Zupan said. ''The only way for a new tunnel to make sense is to connect it to the rest of the system.''
 Last week, Mr. Pataki stressed that while the proposed downtown link would end at the World Trade Center Transportation Center, it eventually could be extended to the Second Avenue subway or other existing subway lines. He and other proponents for the new tunnel said they did not believe it would compete for federal dollars with East Side Access or other projects.
 ''East Side Access is moving ahead as it should,'' said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. ''And the downtown rail link is a project that complements and supports East Side Access because it will strengthen the Long Island labor market and the Long Island economy's connection to the New York City region.''
 Mr. Weisbrod played down estimates for ridership on the new link that are based on current commuter statistics. ''This is a different kind of transportation project and you have to view this more as an economic development project,'' he said.
 The estimated 5,000 Long Island commuters who now come into Lower Manhattan during each peak travel hour ''are hardy souls who make a very, very difficult commute to Lower Manhattan,'' Mr. Weisbrod said. New Jersey residents, on the other hand, have a much easier trip and as a result make up 25 percent of the downtown workforce, he added.
 ''Long Island ridership will increase dramatically once the opportunity for a much easier commute is available,'' he said. ''That's why we have to view this project not just from the viewpoint of how it serves existing riders, but as a way of creating opportunity for the region as a whole.''

HEADLINE: In New York, Midas Fever Rises

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY was positively flush on Wednesday. In the late morning, 1,250 women tripped their stiletto-hobbled way over the paving stones at Fifth Avenue and 105th Street for the 22nd annual Women's Committee lunch to benefit the Central Park Conservancy. The lunch raised a near-record $2.3 million, thanks in part to generous donations from Wall Street companies. 
 Later that day, after a spring shower, potential buyers darted into Sotheby's to compete for Picasso's ''Boy With a Pipe (The Young Apprentice).'' Before the auction there had been speculation that the painting would be the first to break the magic $100 million mark, and by the end of the evening, it had: the successful bidder paid $104.1 million, the highest price ever for a painting at auction. 
 Earlier in the week at Nobu, the expensive-looking women inside were rivaled only by the two voluptuous $357,000 Mercedes-Benz Maybach sedans idling out front. (A restaurant employee said that they most likely belonged to Jay-Z and Steven Stoute, a producer, who frequent Nobu.) 
 After three years of recession, which the city only recently shook off, telltale signs are appearing all over New York that the days of excess might be creeping back. From restaurants crowded once again with investment bankers content to spend $1,200 on a bottle of 2001 Domaine Leroy Chambertin to the $1 million price tag on the average Manhattan apartment, New Yorkers no longer seem to be watching their wallets. 
 The primary explanation is that Wall Street securities companies hauled in $16.8 billion in profits last year, the highest since 2000. And with those profits came about $10 billion in bonuses, money that is now sloshing through the local marketplace, economists say. It is being spent on everything from $600 Sally Hershberger haircuts to $3,500 tickets to the Costume Institute gala at the Metropolitan Museum two weeks ago. 
 ''Whichever way the winds of the finance industry blows, so too blows the rest of the New York City economy,'' said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research, an independent equity research firm. 
 Observers of New York spending habits point to an end of an era when people were suppressing their urge to spend lavishly -- either because of a weak economy or post-9/11 austerity.
 Diana Biederman, the public relations manager at the ''21'' Club -- where sales are up 14 percent from last quarter, according to a report released last week by Orient-Express Hotels, the restaurant's parent company -- said customers are spending more on wine and are having more private parties after the relentlessly gloomy winter. ''It was a long, cold winter, and people are finally coming out,'' she said. ''So they're drinking. And we like that.'' 
 In terms of vanity, New York has scaled a kind of Mount Olympus of personal extravagance. At Sally Hershberger Downtown, which opened on 14th Street in September, patrons clamor to be put on the owner's waiting list for haircuts from the same scissors that minister to Meg Ryan and Renee Zellweger. 
 ''Sally's wait list can range anywhere from four weeks to 12 weeks and beyond,'' said Lee Schwartz, the salon manager. And even though salon etiquette does not require that the owner of a salon receive a tip, clients often do tip Ms. Hershberger on top of her $600 fee, Mr. Schwartz said -- up to 20 percent ''and beyond.'' He spoke the word ''beyond'' with a buoyant little lilt to the second syllable that suggested ''way beyond, like so far you would have no idea.'' 
 But there is a nagging sensation to some that this blip of exuberance is seriously irrational. Drew Nieporent, an owner of Nobu, said he was bewildered by the kind of financial enthusiasm he has seen, most markedly in the restaurant business. He pointed to a flotilla of new Japanese restaurants, a group that includes Megu in TriBeCa, a 13,000-square-foot culinary temple with a bronze bell and an ice-sculpture Buddha, and Masa in the Time Warner Center, where dinner starts at $300. Across the fourth floor, Thomas Keller's reopened Per Se charges $17 for a vodka cocktail. 
 ''I am startled by the number of restaurants that have opened this year, with these seemingly endless budgets,'' Mr. Nieporent said. ''And I know the rents are high. So it sort of defies the logic I've always brought to how I operate my own businesses. I guess the good news is that there must be enough customers to subsidize all these new openings.''
 Mr. Nieporent, for one, said that he was skeptical of the current mood. After all, he said, it doesn't seem that most people are any richer. 
 ''At least it doesn't seem that way in the circles I roll around in,'' he said. 
 Outside Wall Street's charmed circle, many industries are not booming and are feeling only modest effects from the recession's end. Broadway is up. Hotel occupancy rates are up. But advertising has not returned to the publishing industry, and New York's unemployment rate, 7.9 percent in March, still lags behind the nation. 
 David Adler, the chief executive of BiZBash Media, a firm that tracks event spending in New York, said that part of what people perceive to be extravagance is just the sheen of effective promotion. 
 ''We live in an age of marketing, where events and goods can be marketed and targeted in such a creative way that they give the appearance of this luxury economy,'' he said. ''Magnify that by the fact that you are on the world stage in New York, and it gets out of proportion.'' 
 H. Stern, the jeweler, is a case in point: next week, it will introduce a line of limited-edition gold Havaiana flip-flops. The most expensive pair, made with 1,532 tiny gold feathers accented with diamonds, costs $17,000. Poor relations will have to satisfy themselves with the white flip-flops ($3,200) or the brown ones ($2,100). 
 Most shoppers strolling past the H. Stern store on Fifth Avenue will simply marvel at the fact that it sells Brazilian beach sandals that cost as much as a car. Only those who read the fine print will realize that there is only one pair of the $17,000 model for sale, and fewer than a combined 10 for the other two. 
 Andrea Hansen, marketing director for H. Stern North America, said anyone can buy a pair of Havaianas for about $40 in Brazil. ''But we wanted to make something very special,'' she said, adding that if the demand for the $17,000 model exceeds the supply, ''they can be special-ordered.'' 
 The problem does not lie in the promotion of gold sandals, said Robert H. Frank, a Cornell economics professor and author. In an economy where the rich are getting richer and leaving the rest of Americans behind, he said, there is a growing pressure on the members of each rung of the economic ladder to emulate those a rung above. ''If the big player spends $100 million for a painting, then it becomes a cycle,'' he said. ''The guy below him then feels he has to announce that he has arrived by spending $80 million on a painting.''
 Mr. Adler said he had two thoughts about why New Yorkers seem to be indulging once again in conspicuous consumption, both those who can afford to and those who merely want to appear so. 
 ''The Apprentice,'' he said. ''And Donald Trump. It's like, 'Hey, look, the gloves are off.' It's O.K. to say, 'I'm nouveau and I'm proud.' Does nouveau last? Of course not. That's why it's called nouveau.''

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

DATELINE: PASSAIC 

 BODY:
IT was 1989 when Bobby Bollettino stood in front of the J.L. Prescott Company, where he was a line operator in the bleach department, and wondered about his future now that the plant was closing and the operation was shifting to Illinois.
 About 295 employees were losing their jobs at the plant, which manufactured household cleaning products, along with 150 more at a sister plant in Lincoln Park. As Mr. Bollettino, the president of Local 284 of the United Textile Workers of America, studied the weathered brick buildings where he had worked for 21 years, he sensed his life was coming apart. 
 ''The first thing in my mind,'' he said at the time, ''was how do I survive now, because I always took for granted my paycheck -- every Thursday, it would be there -- my hospitalization, my benefits.'' 
 Today Mr. Bollettino, a 56-year-old clerk/messenger for Passaic County social services, is again standing in front of J.L. Prescott. He keeps repeating the same mild expletive as he takes in the scene. The two-story red-brick office building and the attached cinder-block structure that runs along Eighth Street to the Passaic River looks much the same, except it is home now to a jobber that buys and sells textiles. 
 But next door, the five-story building where he once made bleach is half demolished. Fifteen-foot-high piles of smashed wood and huge chunks of concrete sit scattered over a sprawling foundation where railroad cars once delivered caustic and trucks pulled away from loading docks filled with detergent and other cleaning products. The Prescott company was family owned for 118 years, but in 1988 it was acquired in a leveraged buyout by Narragansett Capital Inc. of Providence, R.I., which eventually closed the plant.
 He takes one last look around and says, ''This was half my life here.''
 The two tableaus -- set 15 years apart -- are emblematic of what has come of America's industrial revolution, and the upheaval in the lives of workers like Mr. Bollettino, who saw jobs that paid decent wages flee to other states or overseas. Yet for all the churning, a thriving service industry has kept the New Jersey economy robust compared with other states. 
 Just over two months ago, a similar scene played out when about 800 Ford employees were let go as the giant automaker closed its plant in Edison after 56 years.
 Some of the employees have been transferred to other Ford plants; the older ones are retiring; and others who opted for dismissal will receive their salaries through 2007 provided they show up every day for some sort of community service. The younger workers like Jay Shaw, a 33-year-old millwright apprentice, are looking for other kinds of work, in his case as a police officer. 
 Since J.L. Prescott closed its doors in July 1989, New Jersey has lost more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs, a reflection of a nationwide decline in manufacturing. 
 To stem the decline and deflect criticism, President Bush recently named a manufacturing czar , in part to counter Democrats who keep hammering away that since he came into office in 2001, 2.8 million jobs have been lost. The administration even went so far as to suggest that jobs in the fast-food industry be reclassified as manufacturing, a notion that Senator Jon S. Corzine described as ''mind-boggling.''
 In 1943, in the early stages of World War II, manufacturing was the driving force of the state's economy, accounting for 55 percent of the jobs, compared with 41 percent nationally, according to a study released in January by the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers.
 Today, manufacturing contributes only 9 percent to the state's employment, the report said, while nationally the figure is 11 percent. 
 It was in 1988, a year before Prescott closed, that New Jersey reached a significant turning point. For the first time, the state's share of manufacturing jobs, at 18.1 percent, fell below the nation's, which was 18.3 percent. 
 The service industry was changing the state from one that produced goods to one that consumed them. It was a stunning turn. After all, an argument can be made that New Jersey is the cradle of American industry. The first national manufactury was envisioned by Alexander Hamilton for the Great Falls of the Passaic, and the result was Paterson: the Silk City, the home of the Colt revolver, builder of locomotives, and the former home of Wright Aeronautical, which churned out airplane engines for the war effort in the 1940's. 
 Over those years, images were burned into the subliminal landscape: the multi-storied silk and textile mills of Passaic County; the refineries in the Bosch-like setting of the Turnpike; the sprawling automobile plants in Mahwah, Edgewater, Edison, and Linden (the only automobile plant still operating for now). 
 Trenton Makes, the World Takes.
 Once, as the saying went, what was good for General Motors was good for the country. Today, as America has switched to a more service-oriented economy, Wal-Mart is the number one employer and has been criticized for low wages even while being praised for low prices. 
 David K. Shipler, the author of ''The Working Poor: Invisible in America'' (Alfred A. Knopf, $25) says that when people lose a good-paying manufacturing job, they lose more than a salary. 
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Shipler explained that although people with relatively low skills earned a minimum wage, $7 or $8 an hour, ''insufficient to support a family,'' those jobs opened the ''the possibility of upward mobility.''
 ''During a person's lifetime,'' he said, ''a lot of manufacturing jobs were in effect apprenticeships which enabled people to start at the bottom and to be trained again and again by the company so as to move up through the ranks.''
 But in recent years, Mr. Shipler said, ''that possibility of upward movement has been cut off with the lack of manufacturing jobs. The lower wage jobs now are in the service industry that have very few pathways up.''
 For Mr. Bollettino, the loss of his job at Prescott meant years simply trying to catch up. His wife's salary as a part-time sales person at Channel, a home supply store, did not include benefits and he would soon lose his. They had a son in high school and another in middle school to worry about. 
 Too proud to settle for unemployment, he looked for any job he could get. For the first few years, he was night janitor, making half of the $11 an hour plus overtime, that he earned at Prescott. After working all night, he then operated a cleaning service during the day. He was its only employee. 
 After several years, Mr. Bollettino said, he was fortunate enough to get the county job, which provides him with hospitalization and retirement benefits. 
 ''I'm working for the county in July 11 years, and I'm finally caught up to where I was at Prescott,'' he said.
 The closing at the Ford plant will surely be equally distressing to its former employees, since they were among the highest-paid factory workers in the country. As Joe Renna, who worked in plant services there for 38 years and was earning $25 an hour, put it, ''They call us the royalty of the blue collars.''
 In June 1966, Mr. Renna was just out of Middletown High School, married and a new father, when he walked into the Ford plant and asked for a job. 
 ''They said, 'You want to start tonight,' he recalled. ''I says, 'Oh man!' I wasn't ready for that.'' 
 He had also filed applications at Owens Illinois, Fedders, Revlon and Johnson & Johnson, and the day after he started at Ford he received calls from all the companies. ''In five minutes, you could get a job any place,'' he said. ''See if you can do that now.'' 
 James W. Hughes, dean of the Bloustein School and, with Professor Joseph J. Seneca, an author of the report on the loss of jobs, said those who grew up in the period of manufacturing's primacy thought it would always be ''a stable part of their world.''
 ''But in reality, the economy is constantly moving and changing,'' he said, ''destroying old jobs and creating new jobs. What we had in the 1940's no longer exists.''
 In a year of typical growth, Dean Hughes added, there is a net gain of about 5,000 jobs a month in New Jersey, the result of 50,000 new jobs being created and 45,000 being lost.
 In the 1950's, manufacturing in the state got an additional boost from the Korean War and then the conflict in Vietnam, Dean Hughes said, but started a pattern of hemorrhaging in the 1970's as a booming Sunbelt -- historically a non-union section of the country with lower wages -- began attracting businesses, and international competition became stronger.
 ''For 20 years after World War II, the United States had no serious economic competitors,'' he said. ''Lacking that competition, management became undisciplined.''
 He went on: ''When the period of international competition opened up, New Jersey in particular had a number of facilities that were old and relatively unproductive,'' much of it ''dirty manufacturing'' that prompted environmental regulations.
 From 1990 to 2002, every type of manufacturing showed a double-digit rate of decline, with the exception of pharmaceuticals and health care products, even though the nation was experiencing its longest economic expansion and New Jersey its second longest.
 The areas of manufacturing that showed ''traumatic employment contractions, according to the report, ''were communications equipment, a 71.8 percent loss in jobs; apparel, off 60.4 percent; electrical equipment, appliances and components, down 48.5 percent; machinery, a 46.7 percent decline; computers and electronics products, off 43. 6 percent; and basic chemical manufacturing, down 42.2 percent.
 ''Huge gains in productivity, excess capacity worldwide, cost disadvantages in New Jersey, and continued pressure to reduce labor costs in order to remain competitive all combined to drive manufacturing employment relentlessly downward,'' the report said. 
 Conversely, while manufacturing jobs declined, the state in the 1980's gained 677,100 service jobs, created in part by a boom in office construction along New Jersey's transportation corridors, a soaring stock market that spilled over from Wall Street to the New Jersey side of the Hudson River and a relocation of headquarters by American and foreign companies to the state. 
 By 1990, the office boom made the 11 counties in the northern and central part of the state the fifth-largest metropolitan office market in the country; and by 2000, service jobs accounted for 69.7 percent of the state's total of 4 million jobs.
 Nationally, the loss of jobs has plagued the Bush administration, and remarks earlier this year by N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors, praising the dispersal of jobs to foreign countries did not help. Mr. Mankiw said it was ''just a new way of doing international trade'' and ''a good thing'' that would help American workers get better jobs. 
 But there was another way to look at the phenomenon. A study made public last December by the National Association of Manufacturers comparing American industry with foreign competition said labor costs in this country were generally 22 percent higher because of taxes, health and pension benefits and other imposed expenses like pollution control. 
 Whatever the merits of outsourcing, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, has said that if elected he will review all trade agreements and scale back on incentives that encourage companies to move jobs overseas. 
 For his part, Representative William J. Pascrell Jr., a Democrat from Paterson and a former mayor there, has opposed the trade policies of the Clinton and Bush administrations on the ground that they did not take into account the effect on American workers.
 ''It's costing Americans jobs, puts downward pressure on us in wages and working conditions, and it erodes the ability of the government to protect public health and the environment,'' Mr. Pascrell said. ''And I really believe it contributes to political and economic instability.'' 
 In December, concern over nationwide unemployment seemed to ease somewhat with the release of a survey by the Institute of Supply Management indicating that manufacturing had risen to its highest level in 20 years after three years of layoffs. A new survey, made public this month, showed that factories were hiring more workers than at any time since 1987.
 But despite a nationwide increase of 308,000 jobs in March -- the largest one-month rise since April 2000, according to the federal Labor Department -- manufacturing remained flat. Still, some economists saw this as a positive sign after a decline of 43 consecutive months. 
 By comparison, New Jersey's economy has performed fairly well, according to Governor McGreevey. Speaking at a meeting on the workforce at Rutgers last month, he said the state had added 54,200 jobs last year, making New Jersey fourth in the nation in job growth. He further noted that general employment was at its highest level since December 2000, with 4,012,500 jobs. 
 Nonetheless, New Jersey continues to lose manufacturing jobs: 9,000 from March 2003 to March 2004, in part because of the layoffs at Ford, even as the state added 12,900 new jobs in other areas of the economy, according to the state Department of Labor. Of the 4 million jobs in the state, manufacturing now accounts for only 344,800 of them.
 ''We have made the transition from manufacturing-based jobs to research-based knowledge jobs better than most,'' Mr. McGreevey said. 
 To meet the needs of business and the demands of global competition, he said he has called for an overhaul of the state's workforce development program by merging 27 job-training programs -- now run by three separate state agencies -- under the Labor Department, which is to be renamed the Department of Labor and Workforce Development this summer. 
 In addition, Mr. McGreevey has proposed streamlining the process for manufacturers through tax credits to modernize plants and equipment and remain competitive. 
 For now, the state's labor commissioner Albert G. Kroll, says that the decline in manufacturing has slowed. A study released by the department last month showed that over the last five years New Jersey -- compared with seven other large industrial states, including New York and Pennsylvania -- had the smallest decline in manufacturing jobs and from 2002 to 2003 lost fewer manufacturing jobs than the nation as a whole. Worker productivity, which allows manufacturers to stay competitive, was 6.4 percent higher than the national level. 
 ''The real battle is not just to stem the decline but prevent it,'' Mr. Kroll said in a telephone interview. But the goal, he added, is to ''see if we can attract some companies back into New Jersey or expand.'' 
 The state has been giving matching funds to small businesses to improve the skills of workers, he said. So far the administration has spent $44 million to train 80,000 workers at more than 350 companies, with 40 percent of the funds going toward manufacturers, he said.
 But as welcome as these measures are, state policy toward business has come under criticism. A report by the national Council on State Taxation released by the State Chamber of Commerce said that New Jersey ranked sixth among states for the highest state and local business tax burden. 
 The report found that state and local taxes on business rose 15.6 percent from 2000 to 2003 as compared with taxes on individuals, which rose by 5.9 percent. 
 And a survey by the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, an employer association of 21,500 member companies, said the high cost of doing business in the state was a factor in manufacturing's decline. 
 ''The issues that were most cited were taxes, both business taxes in New Jersey, which are the most unfair in the country, and soaring health costs and high property taxes,'' said Philip Kirschner, the association's president. 
 Both Mr. Kirschner and Joan Verplanck, president of the State Chamber of Commerce, criticized the continued suspension by the administration of a deduction that allows businesses to write off losses.
 In addition, Ms. Verplanck said that unlike other states, there is no single agency in New Jersey for speedy resolution of relocation and expansion problems. 
 ''There are places in the South where you can go to a central economic development agency and they can tell you property that fits the profile you're looking for and in most cases it's been pre-approved,'' Ms. Verplanck said. ''So you can start construction within two weeks whereas in New Jersey it's 18 months to two years.''
 Responding to the criticism, Mr. Kroll said, ''If their studies say New Jersey is the worst place to be, then how do you explain how New Jersey is leading the Northeast in job growth?'' 
 Moreover, the Rutgers report by DeanHughes and Dr. Seneca noted that despite the loss of manufacturing jobs, the transformation to a service economy has had its benefits as well. For instance, New Jersey's per capita income rose from 16 percent higher than that of the nation in 1980 to 28 percent higher in 2002.
 ''One thing this suggests is that we're not worse off going through this transformation as a whole,'' said Dean Hughes, although ''those caught in the transformation have been hurt.''
 He could have been speaking for the 800 workers at the Ford plant in Edison, a million-square-foot assembly facility on Route 1 that since 1948 produced 6.9 million cars and trucks beginning with the Lincoln and ending with the Ranger. It had won high performance awards up to the end, but in January 2002, Ford announced that the plant would be shut as part of a retrenchment plan -- along with plants in Ohio, Michigan, Missouri and Ontario -- costing a total of 35,000 workers their jobs. 
 Six-hundred people had already been laid off by its final day, Feb. 26, when the last two Rangers came off the assembly line and were raffled off to employees. Several days earlier, Ford announced in Detroit that it planned to build a second car manufacturing plant in Eastern China.
 ''It's disheartening,'' Jim Shaw, president of Local 980 of the United Auto Workers of America, said of the Edison closing. ''I still think it's a bad decision but I have no bitterness toward Ford.''
 For the 57-year old Mr. Shaw -- who started on the assembly line in 1965 installing light switches -- and many others, the plant provided a chance for a better life not only for them but their children, who followed them at the plant. Three of Mr. Shaw's sons were employees there. 
 Joe Renna, who is 56, was looking forward to retirement, but in the ensuing months he found that he was bored. Financially he is set, he says, and he has been working on his boat, a 25-foot Chris Craft, and enjoying the time he spends with his 5-year-old grandson.
 Still, he said: ''I didn't know how my feelings were going to be. I know I'm not the only one going through it. I get a ton of calls from guys I worked with. I get at least 10 calls a day. We all talk about the same thing: 'how do you feel?'''
 ''It's like you're useless,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Letting One's Sister Live in a Co-op

 BODY:

Q. My younger daughter owns shares to a one-bedroom co-op in Yonkers. She moved from the co-op to a different neighborhood, but uses the co-op as a place to do her freelance writing. My older daughter needs a place to live for a few months, and using her sister's apartment seemed an ideal solution. But the daughter who owns the apartment was told that if she does not live there, whether her sister lives there or not, the board could evict her, take her shares and sell them. Can the board do that? . . . Carmella Cammarota, Mount Vernon, N.Y.

A. Kenneth Jacobs, a Yonkers co-op lawyer who also has offices in Manhattan, said that whether the owner's sister can live in the apartment alone depends on the specific language in the co-op's proprietary lease. Most leases, he said, provide that the apartment can be occupied by the shareholder and members of the shareholder's family. The courts are split, however, as to whether that provision requires that they live in the apartment at the same time.
 So, he said, the older sister's living in the apartment alone might be considered a violation, depending on a court's interpretation of the lease. 
 Another question is whether the owner of the apartment can be evicted and lose her apartment for not living there herself. 
 ''I can't imagine a board taking that position,'' Mr. Jacobs said, adding that while a co-op may prohibit a shareholder from subleasing an empty apartment, it cannot force the shareholder to sleep there herself.

Insuring a Home For Full Value

Q. I was told that if your home is insured for less than full value, and you sustain a partial loss, the insurance pays only a portion of the loss. For example, if your home's replacement value is $400,000, and you are insured for just $200,000, the insurance will pay only half the value of the loss. Is this correct? . . . Jack Coughlin, Manalapan, N.J.

A. ''This is an important question that a homeowner should clarify with his insurance agent,'' said Michael Spain, the owner of the Spain Agency, an insurance agency in Mahopac, N.Y. Mr. Spain said that the type of insurance referred to by the letter writer is known as co-insurance. And while most homeowners' insurance policies do not contain a co-insurance provision, some do.
 He explained that when a co-insurance clause is included, the homeowner is agreeing to insure the home for no less than a specified percentage of its replacement cost. If the coverage is less than the percentage required at the time a loss is incurred, the homeowner does not receive the full value of the loss. 
 So, Mr. Spain said, if a homeowner is required to insure his home for at least 80 percent of its replacement cost, a $200,000 home would need at least $160,000 in coverage. If the homeowner has at least that amount of coverage, and experiences a $40,000 loss, the policy would cover the entire loss, less any deductible. 
 But, Mr. Spain said, if the homeowner carries only $120,000 in coverage -- 75 percent of the amount required -- he would be compensated for only $30,000, or 75 percent of his loss, less any deductible. 
 Mr. Spain noted that just because a homeowner initially insures the home for the required amount does not guarantee that the coverage will be sufficient at the time of a loss.
 If the replacement cost in the example increased to $400,000, and the homeowner never increased his original $160,000 in coverage, he will be underinsured by $160,000 -- or 50 percent of the now-required $320,000 -- and will receive only 50 percent of any loss, less any deductible.
 He noted that while most carriers automatically increase coverage to account for inflation, it is up to the homeowner to do so to account for additions or improvements.

HEADLINE: Dominican Republic Avoids Haiti Spillover

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: PUNTA CANA, Dominican Republic 

 BODY:
THE sea breezes were rustling the palm trees here as waiters bustled through the hotels with plates piled high with lobster and shrimp. But at the Garber Travel Agency's office in Worcester, Mass., many of the American tourists planning trips to this popular resort town weren't asking about the weather or the food. Their biggest concern was Haiti.
 The Dominican Republic and Haiti share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, and as scenes of civil unrest in Haiti flashed across television screens in February and early March, the phones started ringing at travel companies here and in the United States as jittery American travelers started asking, Is the Dominican Republic safe? 
 It was enough to make some travel agents fear that tourism to the Dominican Republic, which has become increasingly popular among Americans, could be affected. ''We had people calling every week and I was a little bit worried,'' said Jodi Porter, manager of the Garber office in Worcester.
 But so far, the Dominican Republic has been untouched by the rebellion that led the Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide to resign and fly into exile on Feb. 29 (Mr. Aristide says he was kidnapped and forced from power by the United States, a charge Washington denies). None of Ms. Porter's clients canceled or postponed their vacations. 
 ''The two countries are worlds apart,'' said Timothy Mullen, a senior vice president for Apple Vacations, which sends 52 charter flights a week from the United States to the Dominican Republic. Haiti and the Dominican Republic have had strained relations for centuries. Between 1822 and 1844, Haiti occupied the entire island until Juan Pablo Duarte, the hero of Dominican independence, drove the Haitians out and established the Dominican Republic. It now occupies the eastern two-thirds of the island.
 Even today, the State Department says, the countries lack extensive relations. During Haiti's recent period of unrest, Dominican authorities sent troops to the border and briefly closed it to Haitian travelers; the borders are once again open, according to Hugo Guiliani Cury, the Dominican Republic's ambassador to the United States. 
 State Department officials have accused the Dominican Republic of condoning discrimination and abuse of Haitians who come to the Dominican Republic seeking work. Local humanitarian groups estimate that about a million Haitians live here. 
 But while Haiti struggles, the Dominican Republic has become increasingly popular with tourists. In 2002, the Dominican Republic was the most popular Caribbean destination for American residents, surpassing Jamaica and the Bahamas, according to the Office of Travel and Tourism Industries, a branch of the Commerce Department. 
 The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, which has more recent figures, says the number of American visitors here surged to 865,942 in 2003 from 530,352 in 1999. Europe still sends the majority of overseas visitors -- 1.3 million in 2003 -- with Germany, France and Spain leading the pack.
 Some Americans coming here are Dominican Republic natives, but travel agents say they are seeing increased numbers visiting solely for tourism. Dominican officials hope that growth will continue as more tourists discover their sandy white beaches, turquoise waters, relatively inexpensive prices and Hispanic flair.
 Michelle Jaquez, of the Dominican Republic Tourism Office in New York, said, ''We have a lot of all-inclusive resorts, and a lot of people now are looking for that.''
 The State Department is still advising Americans to avoid travel to Haiti, saying in its most recent warning that security there remains ''dangerous and unpredictable'' despite the presence of 2,000 American troops and 1,500 from France, Canada and Chile. 
 In late April, the State Department said Haiti's problems have not directly affected tourist destinations here. It noted, however, that the Dominican Republic is in an economic downturn and not without its own troubles. It warns Americans to avoid protests, demonstrations and general strikes because these ''have the potential to turn violent.'' This year, more than 3,900 Dominicans have been intercepted at sea by the Coast Guard trying to get to America.
 Though not nearly as economically depressed as Haiti, the Dominican Republic still struggles at times to provide services that American travelers typically expect. At the airport in Santo Domingo, the lights flickered on and off one recent weekend and cable TV service can be erratic. 
 But many visitors are delighted by the capital's colonial architecture, the goats that skitter through the countryside and the all-inclusive resorts here. 
 Channing Phillips, chief of staff at the United States Attorney's office in Washington, said he couldn't help thinking about Haiti as he planned a five-day vacation for three couples at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach resort near here in March. But after checking with the State Department, he said: ''We realized it would not be an issue at all. I would definitely go back.''

HEADLINE: It's Very Fancy on Old Delancey Street, You Know

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
EVER since Manhattan became Manhattan, it seems, the island has been viewed as a roost for the rich. In the mid-19th century, Walt Whitman compared Manhattan with Brooklyn, then a suburb of New York City: ''Men of moderate means may find homes at a moderate rent, whereas in New York City there is no median between a palatial mansion and a dilapidated hovel.''
 As Manhattan has been hit by successive waves of economic change, the battle for its psyche has been constant, as have laments over the loss of its artistic soul. While Manhattan has always been the nation's commercial center, it has also been arguably the best place for artists or musicians or writers to make their name. 
 So it is not surprising that there have been Whitman-like sighs over news that the average price of an apartment on much of the island has cracked $1 million, and that average housing prices below 96th Street on the East Side and below 112th Street on the West Side have jumped 36 percent since 2000. 
 If artists can't afford that fifth-floor walkup, critics say, Manhattan (or at least that part defined in the real estate survey) may be losing the ambitious, creative individuals that make it a dynamic place to live. 
 ''Why pay $1 million if the very people that make the city what it is, in part, aren't going to be there anymore?'' asked Jerold S. Kayden, professor of urban planning and design at Harvard University.
 It's a long-heard lament, but there is no doubt that Manhattan is becoming an island of the more privileged. According to figures from the Census Bureau, the median income in Manhattan jumped 12 percent to $47,030 from 1990 to 2000, at a time when median incomes in all other boroughs fell by as much as 4 percent.
 Over 30 years, the change has been more startling. In 1970, 50 percent of Manhattan households made from $4,050 to $12,900 annually. By 2000, those making the same amount in inflation-adjusted terms represented only 34 percent of Manhattan households, with a greater proportion earning much higher incomes, according to Andrew Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College. ''The middle class is being squeezed out,'' he said.
 Undoubtedly, the high prices -- $2,000 a month for a one-bedroom apartment in a so-so neighborhood -- are a hurdle for anyone trying to move in. Neighborhoods like the Lower East Side or Hell's Kitchen, which once drew starving artists, now offer luxury condos to bankers and lawyers who are themselves priced out of the Upper West Side or Greenwich Village.
 But if artists move to other boroughs or to New Jersey, as they have for years, is that so terrible? Workers who commute to Manhattan are unlikely to feel much sympathy for downtown types who bemoan their lot in life. Ellen Stewart, the founder and artistic director of the La MaMa Experimental Theater Club in the East Village, said that the commutes of performers who have moved to New Jersey are cutting into rehearsal time. 
 ''When you have to catch a bus and a train and another bus in order to come to rehearsals it affects the quality of our work,'' she said. If they lived in Manhattan, they could rehearse five days a week, she said, instead of the two days a week they often deal with now. (Tell that to the Wall Street secretary who commutes daily from the north Bronx.)
 In fact, Manhattan's rising housing prices are an indicator of health, argued Kenneth T. Jackson, the president of the New-York Historical Society. Housing prices are high, he said, precisely because the well-off still clamor to live here.
 ''People who have options to live anywhere they want to live are choosing to live in the city,'' he said. ''That's the opposite of Detroit, where the people who have money choose not to live downtown.'' Cities like Detroit have been hammered by the flight of the wealthy to the suburbs, and local governments are now desperate to attract younger, more affluent residents back to the city.
 And in fairness, people of less-than-luxurious means still live in Manhattan in rent-regulated housing. Rental apartments are about 65 percent of all housing in Manhattan, and of that, nearly 54 percent were rent-stabilized or rent-controlled in 2002, according to the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey. But because the city is permitting landlords to remove apartments slowly from rent regulation, those who move here now are having to pay much higher market rents.
 Still, for those who can't afford Manhattan, there is the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island -- not to mention parts of Manhattan that are still relatively affordable, like Harlem, Inwood and Washington Heights.
 Kurt Andersen, the novelist and journalist, moved to the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn nearly 15 years ago. He said that Manhattan's loss is the other boroughs' gain. ''If rich people are basically filling up Manhattan, New York is a big place,'' he said. ''If the next concentric circle of neighborhoods aren't on that island, or below 96th Street on that island, I don't think that's so bad.''
 Indeed, Cobble Hill in Brooklyn now has live theater; Fort Greene in Brooklyn now houses the Mark Morris Dance Group. 
 And New Yorkers have ways of surmounting seemingly impossible real estate prices. Becky Smith, who opened Bellwether, a gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, five years ago, said she will be moving both the gallery and herself to Manhattan come June, in part to get closer to the collectors who live and visit there. 
 ''The fact that I own a gallery and it's succeeded and I'm able to move on and take on this new rent is crazy,'' said Ms. Smith, 37, who exhibits the work of contemporary young artists, many of whom live and work in Williamsburg, and some who have found space in Manhattan. 
 New York, and Manhattan in particular, can exert that siren call, it seems. ''I still find it hard to believe that people who want to be in New York won't find a way to be in New York,'' said Mr. Kayden of Harvard.

HEADLINE: The War's Lost Weekend

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
JUST when you've persuaded yourself yet again that this isn't Vietnam, you are hit by another acid flashback. Last weekend that flashback was to 1969. It was in June 1969 that Life magazine ran its cover story ''The Faces of the American Dead in Vietnam: One Week's Toll,'' the acknowledged prototype for Ted Koppel's photographic roll-call of the American dead in Iraq on ''Nightline.'' It was in November 1969 that a little-known reporter, Seymour Hersh, broke the story of the 1968 massacre at My Lai, the horrific scoop that has now found its match 35 years later in Mr. Hersh's New Yorker revelation of a 53-page Army report detailing ''numerous instances of 'sadistic, blatant and wanton criminal abuses' at Abu Ghraib.'' No doubt some future edition of the Pentagon Papers will explain just why we restored Saddam Hussein's hellhole to its original use, torture rooms included, even as we allowed Baghdad's National Library, a repository of Mesopotamia's glorious pre-Baath history, to be looted and burned. 
 The Vietnam parallels are, as always, not quite exact. We didn't ''withdraw'' for another four years after 1969 and didn't flee Saigon for another two years after that. We're on a faster track this time. News travels at a higher velocity now than it did then and saturates the culture more completely; the stray, silent images from the TV set at the gym or the p.c. on someone else's desk lodge in our brains even when we are trying to tune them out. Last weekend, the first anniversary of the end of the war's ''major combat operations,'' was a Perfect Storm of such inescapable images. The dense 48-hour cloud of bad news marked the beginning of the real, involuntary end of America's major combat operations in Iraq, come hell or June 30.
 The first sign was the uproar over ''Nightline'' from the war's cheerleaders. You have to wonder: if this country is so firm in its support of this war, by what logic would photographs of its selfless soldiers, either their faces or their flag-draped coffins, undermine public opinion? The practical effect of all the clamor was only to increase hunger for ''Nightline'' -- its ratings went up as much as 30 percent -- and ensure that the fallen's faces would be seen on many more channels as well. Those faces then bled into the pictures from Abu Ghraib, which, after their original display on ''60 Minutes II,'' metastasized by the hour on other networks and Web sites: graphic intimations of rape, with Americans cast as the rapists and Iraqis as the victims, that needed no commentary to be understood in any culture. (The word ''reprimand'' -- the punishment we first doled out for these crimes -- may lose something in translation to the Arabic, however.)
 Then there were the pictures of marines retreating from Fallujah and of that city's citizens dancing in the streets to celebrate their victory over the American liberators they were supposed to be welcoming with flowers. And perhaps most bizarre of all, there was the image that negated the war's one unambiguous accomplishment, the toppling of Saddam. Now, less than 13 months after that victory, we could see a man in Republican Guard gear take command in Fallujah. He could have been one of those Saddam doubles we kept hearing about before ''Shock and Awe.'' But instead of toppling this Saddam stand-in we were resurrecting him and returning him to power.
 Through a cruel accident of timing, each of these images was in turn cross-cut with a retread of a golden oldie: President Bush standing under the ''Mission Accomplished'' banner of a year ago. ''I wish the banner was not up there,'' Karl Rove had told a newspaper editorial board in the swing state of Ohio in mid-April. Not ''I wish that we had planned for the dangers of post-Saddam Iraq before recklessly throwing underprepared and underprotected Americans into harm's way.'' No, Mr. Rove has his eye on what's most important: better political image management through better set design. In prewar America, presidential backdrops reading ''Strengthening Medicare'' and ''Strengthening Our Economy'' had worked just fine. If only that one on the U.S.S. Lincoln had said ''Strengthening Iraq,'' everything would be hunky-dory now.
 Not having any positive pictures of its own to counter last weekend's ugly ones, the administration tried gamely to alter the images' meaning through words instead. Little could be done to neutralize the mortal calculus of ''Nightline'' -- though Paul Wolfowitz trivialized the whole idea of a casualty count by publicly underestimating the actual death toll by some 200. But back in Iraq, Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt went for broke. ''This is not a withdrawal, it's not a retreat,'' he said, even as news video showed an American tank literally going in reverse while pulling away from Fallujah. To counter the image of the Saddam clone, the Pentagon initially told reporters that he was not a member of the Republican Guard, even as we saw him strutting about in the familiar olive-green uniform and beret. (Later the truth emerged, and the Saddam clone in question, Jasim Muhammad Saleh, was yanked off-camera.)
 As for Abu Ghraib, a State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said ''I'm not too concerned'' about the fallout of these snapshots on American credibility in the Arab world. Gen. Richard Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, took to three Sunday morning talk shows to say that only ''a handful'' of Americans had engaged in such heinous activities -- even though that low estimate was contradicted by the two-month-old internal Army report uncovered by Mr. Hersh and available to everyone in the world, it seemed, except the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and his civilian counterpart, Donald Rumsfeld. 
 The general blamed the public's grim interpretation of the news from Iraq on ''inaccurate reporting'' that he found nearly everywhere, from CNN to ''the morning papers.'' He and the administration no doubt prefer the hard-hitting journalism over at Fox. ''I end up spending a lot of time watching Fox News,'' Dick Cheney explained last month, ''because they're more accurate in my experience, in those events that I'm personally involved in, than many of the other outlets.''
 It was instructive, then, to see how Fox covered the images of last weekend -- in part by disparaging the idea of showing them at all. Fox's (if not America's) most self-infatuated newsman, the host of ''The O'Reilly Factor,'' worried on air that ''Nightline'' might undermine morale if it tried to ''exploit casualties in a time of war.'' He somehow forgot that just five nights earlier he had used his own show to exploit a casualty, the N.F.L. player Pat Tillman -- a segment, Mr. O'Reilly confided with delight, ''very highly rated by billoreilly.com premium members.'' (Lesson to families who lose sons and daughters in Iraq: if you want them to be exploited on ''The Factor,'' let alone applauded by Web site ''premium members'' who pay its host $49.95 a year, be sure they become celebrities before they enlist.) 
 Soon Mr. O'Reilly was announcing that he was ''not going to use the pictures'' of Abu Ghraib either and suggested that ''60 Minutes II'' should have followed his example. Lest anyone be tempted to take a peek by switching channels, a former Army interrogation instructor, Tony Robinson, showed up on another Fox show, ''Hannity & Colmes,'' to assert that the prison photos did not show torture. ''Frat hazing is worse than this,'' the self-styled expert said. 
 Perhaps no one exemplified the principles of Cheney-favored journalism more eloquently than the Sinclair Broadcast Group, the large station owner (and Republican contributor) that refused to broadcast ''Nightline'' on its ABC outlets. A spokesman, Mark Hyman, explained: ''Someone who died 13 months ago -- why is that news?'' Been there, done that, I guess.
 The administration has been coddled by this kind of coverage since 9/11, until fairly recently, and it didn't all come from Fox and Sinclair. Last Sunday, Michael Getler, the ombudsman at The Washington Post, wrote that ''almost everything we were told before the war, other than that Saddam Hussein is bad, has turned out, so far, not to be the case: the weapons of mass destruction, the imagery of nuclear mushroom clouds, the links between al Qaeda and Hussein, the welcome, the resistance, the costs, the numbers of troops needed.'' He was arguing that, as good as much of the war reportage has been, ''it is prewar coverage that counts the most.''
 If that coverage had been sharper, and more skeptical of administration propaganda, more of the fictions that sent us to war would have been punctured before we signed on. Perhaps a majority of the country would not have been conned into accepting as fact (as it still does, according to an April poll) that Iraq still had weapons of mass destruction and that Saddam was in league with al Qaeda. As fate would have it, last weekend was also when C-Span broadcast live coverage of the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner, many of whose attendees were responsible for the journalistic shortfall described by Mr. Getler. The revelers joined the president in pausing to mourn Michael Kelly and David Bloom, two of the 25 journalists killed so far in the line of duty in Iraq. Then it was back to Washington at its merriest, as the assembled journalists could return to drooling over such fading or faded stars as Ben Affleck, Morgan Fairchild and Wayne Newton.
 That was an image, too -- as ludicrous in its way as those second-rung Playboy bunnies turning up in ''Apocalypse Now'' -- but not as powerful as those from the front lines. Mr. Koppel's salute to the fallen was heartbreaking, no matter what you think about the war; one young soldier could be seen cradling his infant child, others were still wearing the cap and gown of high school and college graduations. The Abu Ghraib images shocked us into remembering that real obscenity is distinct from the revelation of Janet Jackson's right breast, the cynical obsession of some of the Washington politicians also seen partying at the correspondents' dinner.
 As we know from ''Mission Accomplished'' and Colin Powell's aerial reconnaissance shots displayed as evidence to the United Nations, pictures can be made to lie -- easily. But over time credible pictures, because they have a true story to tell, can trump the phonies. Try as politicians might to alter their meaning with spin, eventually there comes a point when the old Marx Brothers gag comes into play: ''Who are you going to believe -- me or your own eyes?'' Last weekend was a time when many, if not most, of us had little choice but to believe our own eyes.

HEADLINE: Shock of the New: The Return of Full Price

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
LOOKING for a pinstriped suit for the office? A frothy dress for the prom? A rep tie or baby clothes? A dandified shirt or an embroidered T-shirt?
 Whatever you wear, you'll probably find that it costs more than last year, because a majority of American merchants, having thrown in the towel in their price wars with discounters, are discovering they can charge more. Unable to beat Wal-Mart for low prices, they have started selling at full price -- forget the 40-percent-off sales -- cleaned up their selling floors and placed more salesclerks in their dressing rooms.
 It doesn't have to do with Chinese workers earning more. It doesn't have much to do with the rising value of the euro against the dollar. It may have something to do with new retro styles, but it may have more to do with color: the shocking pinks and acid greens that made the 60's sing are back, and for many Americans stuck with a closetful of clothes in funereal shades, just about anything would look good after their journey to the heart of darkness. 
 In short, they were ready to buy, and they're buying.
 ''Americans are paying more for their clothes because retailers are charging more -- and finding they can get it,'' said Byron H. Pollitt Jr., the chief financial officer at Gap Inc., the $16-billion-a-year chain.
 Naturally, the improved economy has helped, but it's more than that. ''The truth is, the consumer is charging forward, due to pent-up demand, due to outdated wardrobes,'' said Marshal Cohen, chief researcher analyst for NPD Group, a Long Island market research firm. From Wal-Mart to Bergdorf's, the average price for clothes has risen close to 5 percent since the beginning of the year, NPD reports.
 That may not sound like much, but here's the real increase: the cost of the average trip to the cash register has risen almost 18 percent. ''People are also buying more expensive items,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''Instead of buying some slacks to fill in, they may be buying a suit.''
 The euro really doesn't have much to do with it, Mr. Cohen said. Those $7,000 Hermes handbags and couture items represent ''a very small segment of the pie,'' he said, less than 10 percent.
 And the rich are indeed different -- they have always spent. It was the rest of the population's lack of spending that had sent most retail numbers down and down for the last four or five years.
 It had become a vicious cycle: weaned on cut-rate sales, shoppers -- like the carnivorous plant in ''Little Shop of Horrors'' -- kept saying: ''Feed me. Feed me bargains.'' 
 Where would it end?
 ''They knew it would take courage to start selling at full price,'' Mr. Pollitt recently said of the retailers leading the way. ''They knew the company might see a string of negative sales comparisons,'' he said. ''They had gotten used to putting lots and lots and lots of merchandise on the bargain table.''
 By last fall, many merchants had reached the end of their silken tethers. Lord & Taylor, Marshall Field's and Macy's stopped trying to compete with Target and Wal-Mart and announced ''reinventions.'' This meant better service -- more attentive sales clerks and ''living rooms'' for husbands who would rather sit and read the paper than stand and watch their wives model that 15th sundress.
 Late last year, it seems, the clothing designers also decided it was time for a change. Across Manhattan's runways, the designers unveiled their new looks for spring -- the clothes in the stores right now. Ralph Lauren paraded long drinks of cucumber-cool green silk; Michael Kors offered tangerine trench coats. Derek Lam, a hitherto little-known designer, caught the breeze with a cotton sheath, splashed with red carnations.
 At the same time, a whole panorama of freshly minted lines -- by Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein and Liz Claiborne -- was funneling into the department stores. And middle-income America started buying again. In February and March, sales figures, comparing one store with the same store a year before, rose, on average, 6.8 percent. Department stores had their biggest improvement in seven years. 
 The merchants are also making more on each garment -- a calculation the industry calls margin. And these margins will probably improve further. In anticipation of the lifting of quotas at the end of 2004, the Chinese are building large factories. This, manufacturing analysts say, is likely to result in a flood of goods, which will translate into lower wholesale prices for the American companies.
 Apparel executives like Mr. Pollitt of the Gap are currently trying to decide how they will use that advantage. ''We have three choices,'' he said. ''We can lower our prices, improve our quality or do both, selectively.'' 
 The answer? ''We'll probably lower some prices, and we will also figure out how to give some high-quality touches to some of the more moderately priced items.'' The prices to be lowered might be the basics that can't be jazzed up much: basic T-shirts, basic khakis. But what is now a basic jacket, for example, might receive designer touches: embroidery or better lining or hand-stitching. All for the same price that the plainer jacket is fetching now.
 But what happens if the merchants and designers lose their edge, their sense of style falls off and the negative sales figures start trickling down again? 
 ''Welcome to retailing,'' Mr. Pollitt said.

HEADLINE: Marking History, In Big Letters

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
The rusted steel skeleton of the old Maxwell House sign sits atop one of the buildings in the vacant Hoboken plant, once one of the largest producers of coffee in world. The skeleton, painted blue to blend in with the sky, once held a 75- foot-wide, 182-foot-long sign, a tilted coffee cup dripping two neon drops into the Hudson. The sign, married to the slogan ''Good to the Last Drop,'' stood for more than 50 years, until the plant closed in 1992. All that remains is a last 12-foot-high drop that was donated to the city's historical museum, home these days to pictures from the film ''On the Waterfront,'' set on the city's coastline when it was still an industrial stronghold. 
 The fate of the Maxwell House sign is an emblem of manufacturing decline. Since it was erected, the brawn has been drained from Hoboken's waterfront, following a trend throughout a state that has switched to a service economy from a manufacturing base. But as cities and developers seek to preserve the signs and a piece of the past, signs from that industrial period can be found in old buildings that still stand, or woven into the new buildings and parks that have replaced an old factory here or a warehouse there. 
 Icons like the Colgate clock, the ''Good to the Last Drop'' Maxwell House Coffee billboard or painted signs on the top of factories ''are more than a cheap form of advertising,'' said Paul W. Schopp, who has studied the state's industrial history for 30 years and is considered its unofficial historian. ''These companies wanted to announce to the world who they were and what they made,'' he said, adding that they often ''defined the cities'' they were in. 
 Because these icons are viewed as cultural heritage, many developers are making efforts to preserve them somehow, even when plants are razed. In the case of the Maxwell plant, it is unlikely that the company's icon -- said by a company spokeswoman to have been coined by President Teddy Roosevelt in 1907 on a visit to Nashville, Tenn., the birthplace of the coffee -- will be preserved on such grand scale. 
 But in five years, when a mix of condos, stores and offices move in, the developers will tip their hats to the site's industrial past with an outdoor gallery that highlights important aspects of the site, including its role as the onetime home of the Maxwell plant, said Brian Stolar, one of the developers. 
 Such signs have remained as an offbeat centerpiece to new development on the site. In neighboring Jersey City, the Colgate clock, which people have long set their watches by, still stands in a waterside park. It is one of the last vestiges of the Colgate-Palmolive soap factory complex constructed in 1847 and closed in the late 1980's that has since been replaced by housing and offices. 
 The clock was part of a 200-f00t-long, 40-f00t-high illuminated sign that proclaimed Colgate's Soaps-Perfumes in 20-foot-high letters when it was hoisted atop the factory in 1906 to celebrate the company's centennial. Later a drawing of a toothpaste tube replaced the words Soaps and Perfumes, but that is now gone, too. 
 The clock's shape was inspired by Colgate's octagon laundry soap and in 1924, the original was replaced by the current larger one, considered among the largest single-faced clocks in the world. It measures 55 feet in diameter and has a 25-foot- long minute hand and 20-foot-long hour hand. Colgate hopes to move the clock later this year to a permanent location on the Sussex Street pier, according to Allison Klimerman, a company spokeswoman. 
 The mayor, Glenn D. Cunningham, expresses support for preserving the sign, saying it ''is a historic landmark and part of Jersey City's heritage and should remain somewhere on the old factory site.'' 
 But since it boasts the name of a company no longer in Jersey City, ''I would insist that the city receive some financial benefit,'' the mayor said. Colgate is still in talks with the city over whether it should receive funds for keeping the clock on the waterfront, Ms. Klimerman said.

A Bid to Save an Emblem
 Another sign that has become a source of debate is the big reddish-brown bottle off the Garden State Parkway that seems to be floating in the sky, standing vigil over the shuttered Pabst brewery in Newark.
 The brewery once housed the Hoffman Beverage Company, the soft-drink concern that built the huddle of early 20th-century buildings and around 1930 erected the 60-foot ''root beer'' bottle, its notable flavor, to double as a water tower. In 1945 when the brewery took over the complex, it put its Pabst label on the bottle, which still stands even though the plant closed in the mid-1980's and crumbled into an eyesore.
 Now developers are advancing plans to raze the buildings and turn the site into a mixed-use neighborhood. Pam Goldstein, spokesperson for Mayor Sharpe James, said letters have been flooding City Hall to preserve the bottle. Richard Monteilh, the city administrator, said that the city is looking to save the bottle. ''There is a lot of sentiment to do so,'' he said. ''It could wind up in a small park on the site. The question is how to finance it.''

A Touch of Industry
 Many industrial relics, though, have been seamlessly worked into developments that have replaced factories and plants.
 In Paterson's Great Falls Historic District, the top of No. 16 Spruce Street has white letters, 2 to 3 feet high, march 170 feet across, announcing the Paterson Silk Machinery Exchange. The building, which is now transitional housing, was a 19th-century factory that was home to the exchange from 1928 to 1956, and earlier housed the Rogers Locomotive Works. The exchange reconditioned machines key to the city's textile industry, which at its height comprised 800 silk operations, said Vincent Waraske, Paterson's historian. The names of different machines -- from looms and quillers to winders -- appear over the first-floor windows, and the exchange's phone number is on one side of the building. 
 In Camden, where the water towers shaped like soup cans vanished along with the Campbell Soup plant, another subtle icon endures. But the four, circular stained glass windows of Nipper, the dog listening ''to His Master's Voice'' in an old phonograph, remain in the tower of the so-called Nipper Building on the city's waterfront. The building, birthplace of the Victrola, was recently transformed into a rental apartment building called the Victor by Carl Dranoff of Philadelphia. It is one of the few surviving structures of the RCA Victor complex, which in the early 20th century was considered the recording capital of the nation. 
 While the nine-story tower was built to encase water tanks, the founder of RCA, Eldridge Johnson, crowned it with the now famous trademark image by the English painter Francis Barraud. In 1916, Mr. Johnson had stained glass renditions of it built, each measuring 14.5 feet in diameter, and they are now in their third reincarnation, said Frederick O. Barnum III, author of ''His Master's Voice in America,'' and business development manager at L-3 Communications, RCA's successor company. 
 Astute observers can also spot painted signs in Trenton that say Home Rubber, including a mostly faded one on the side and smokestack of the building, along I-95. The company is a rare survivor of the city's rubber industry, which along with pottery and iron works were the three biggest industries in Trenton during its early 20th century heyday.

Billboards Get an Upgrade
 That manufacturing muscle was the inspiration of the sign proclaiming the slogan, ''Trenton Makes the World Takes,'' which was the brainchild of a local businessman who won a 1910 contest sponsored by the city's Chamber of Commerce. It has lived on first as wooden, then an electric and now a neon sign, said Wendy Nardi, curator of the Trentoniana collection at the city's library. There is talk of a new sign that will retain the old slogan -- a modern sign perhaps with LED lighting. 
 Some signs are reincarnated altogether. Elsewhere in Trenton, a new name was painted recently on the water tower at the former Roebling complex, which manufactured cables for suspension bridges, elevators and trolleys. It now boasts the name, Manex Entertainment, which does special effects for movies and is to open at the old plant by year's end. Paul Schopp, the state historian, said the deindustrialization of cities has taken away smells like roasting coffee or sights like workers flooding streets during a shift change -- that tended to knit together neighborhoods and will never be replaced. Mr. Schopp worries that in 30 or 50 years some of the state's remaining community totems that still touch a soft spot for the past in many people may vanish because ''there will be such a disconnect with the state's industrial heritage.'' And that, he said, would ''be sad, very sad.''

HEADLINE: A Meeting of Cattlemen From Two Cultures on the Mexican Border

BYLINE: By VERLYN KLINKENBORG

 BODY:
In modern, industrialized agriculture, the benign cow sometimes looks like a nightmare creature, a carrier of human fears about E. coli, environmental degradation, mad cow disease and dire concentration in the meatpacking business. But none of this is the cow's fault. And in a few places, the cow is still something more than a warm-blooded economic integer or a plague on the hoof. In those places cattle still anchor a way of life, a grassland culture of great subtlety and beauty. Not long ago, I visited a windswept region in New Mexico and Arizona, along the Mexican border, with representatives from two of those cattle cultures: a coalition of local ranchers and scientists, called the Malpai Borderlands Group, and a group of Masai from Kenya and Tanzania.
 At first, the differences seemed almost overwhelming. The Masai live intimately with their zebu cattle, naming each one, walking them long distances to water and good grazing, and they could not quite believe that the Malpai ranchers gathered and counted their cow-calf pairs only twice a year, at branding and shipping. The wildness of American range cattle amazed the Masai. It seemed just as surprising to the ranchers that Masai women milked their beef cattle, sharing the udder of a lactating cow with its calf, and that a zebu could lower its metabolism in response to drought. 
 Some of the ranchers had been to Kenya a couple of years earlier and knew firsthand what the subsistence living of Masai pastoralists looked like. But this was the first trip to America for the Masai, and they asked penetrating questions. Sitting on the bunkhouse-porch of a 500-square-mile ranch owned by the Animas Foundation, a Masai named Joseph Mioron, from a group ranch near Amboseli in Kenya, asked whether the things he saw around him -- the pickup trucks, the beautifully restored buildings, the vast adobe barn -- were paid for by cattle. he answer, of course, was that they were merely justified by the cattle.
 But beneath the differences -- dusty jeans and silver belt buckles versus traditional red-checked blankets and beaded bracelets -- lay profound similarities. The Malpai ranchers, most of whom ranch on a modest economic scale, banded together a decade ago to collectively manage their delicate ecosystem, which lies at the confluence of several biomes. With state and federal agencies, they planned a fire regime that allows natural fires to burn themselves out instead of being suppressed. They have turned this harsh region into a laboratory where scientists can study the natural rhythms of grasslands. The ranchers argue, and science has begun to show, that natural fire and appropriate grazing keep the grasslands healthy and open and that cattle are an environmentally valuable presence.
 The same issues confront the Masai but in more extreme forms. Over the past few decades their lands have dwindled to the point where some Masai have begun to feel that the only way to hang onto any land at all is to convert it to private ownership. That would be death to a pastoralist culture, whose villages, easily moved in search of fresh grass, become biological hot spots -- fertile sources of new diversity -- once they've been abandoned. And, as the Masai explained in our front-porch conversations, they and their cattle have coexisted with wildlife for thousands of years. The cattle graze among wildlife and, since the Masai traditionally subsist on the milk, blood and meat of their cows, the cattle form a buffer that protects wildlife from hunting. Only in severe drought have the Masai in the past hunted wildlife, which they call their ''second cattle.'' Like the Malpai ranchers, the Masai have begun to learn that sometimes sound ecological management is not left to the government or outside experts.
 For four days, the cattlemen talked and I listened alongside them. We rode mules up into the Peloncillo Mountains -- the first time the Masai had ever ridden -- and we convened at a barn dance on a Sunday night that brought nearly the whole Malpai community together. There was an acoustic western band and a singer (also the cook) named Kip Calahan, who belted out songs like ''What Cowboy Means'' and ''Al Valle de Animas.'' The Masai performed a traditional dance -- imagine a slow train huffing forward, heads bobbing like puffs of smoke blowing back over the cars -- and darted into the crowd to drag their new friends into the dance. We ate beef, and then the cowgirls taught the Masai to waltz and two-step. The next morning they learned to rope a straw bale with a plastic calf's head on one end.
 Those were the diverting gestures of friendship, but the real bond was formed in the long talks themselves. As with any discussion of serious problems -- in this case subdivision, the threat to a way of life, the pervasive misunderstanding of a culture -- there were moments of sober doubt, when the Masai and the ranchers suddenly seemed wrapped in the fragility of what they were trying to protect. But then it would occur to us that here we were, working together on the problem, trying to understand how communities could teach each other what they know. The knowledge of how to serve these lands, the Malpai and Masai land, belongs to the people who live on them. It was always an encouraging thought.

HEADLINE: When a Job Calls And No One Answers

BYLINE: By DUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
THINK it's tough finding a plumber when you need one? Ask Clinton C. Kershaw, the owner of Mr. Rooter Plumbing in Pleasant Valley, N.Y., about 90 miles north of New York City. His business, fixing toilets for $90 or septic systems for $7,000, is doing so well that its 15 plumbers are having a hard time keeping up with the work. 
 Mr. Kershaw is having a difficult time, too, hiring plumbers. The company has placed ads in The Poughkeepsie Journal and in The Journal News. It has offered $30 an hour with benefits, but to no avail. Mr. Kershaw said he had to forgo around $2 million worth of work last year because he didn't have enough plumbers. 
 So he looked abroad. His company found nine plumbers in South Africa and one in Venezuela, then started applying for temporary work visas for them.
 Mr. Kershaw isn't the only employer with staffing problems. More than 1.5 million jobs may have been lost across the economy over the last three years, but the job market is not slack for everyone. Last year, American businesses filed requests with the Labor Department for authorization to bring over foreign workers for seasonal jobs as varied as hotel maid, tractor-trailer driver, mail clerk, welder and baker.
 The technology boom in the late 1990's focused attention on employers importing specialized, highly skilled laborers under a visa program known as H-1B. But for the last several years, employers have also been trying to hire foreign seasonal workers of no particular skill under another visa program, called H-2B, that requires the employers to show only that they cannot find local people to do the jobs.
 The employees range from $7-an-hour Mexican workers pitching tents for traveling circuses to Japanese roe sorters, who can earn up to $7,000 a month at processing plants in Alaska. The ''season'' varies from a few summer months, say, for workers at resorts and camps, to the February-to-November period that is busiest for plumbers in the Northeast. 
 Demand is growing. In early March, the Department of Homeland Security announced that this year's limit of 66,000 H-2B visas had been reached early, prompting employers to call upon friends in Congress, from both sides of the aisle, to help. It was the first time since the seasonal visa program began 14 years ago that the annual limit had been reached.
 At least three bills to relax the limit were submitted in the House and Senate by the end of March. But their chances for passage this year are not good. Despite strong bipartisan support, opposition by a few senators is keeping legislation from coming to a floor vote, frustrating employers like Mr. Kershaw. Not everyone buys employers' arguments that they can't find local workers to fill jobs. Critics say they simply want to reduce labor costs by importing foreign workers. 
 ''Every single employer in the world would like to claim there is a labor shortage,'' said George J. Borjas, a professor of economics and social policy at Harvard who has written extensively about the drawbacks of illegal immigration. 
 Mr. Borjas argued that while it might take more than $30 an hour to find qualified plumbers, eventually, at some wage, workers in the United States would show up.
 Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington research group that favors greater restrictions on immigration, conceded that employers like Mr. Kershaw might have difficulty adjusting in the absence of foreign workers. But Mr. Krikorian added that there were other possible solutions. 
 ''Maybe go to Pittsburgh rather than Johannesburg, or go into the high schools and try to grow your own plumbers,'' he said.
 But others say that businesses face a legitimate need.
 ''I used to be ideologically, pragmatically, morally opposed to guest worker programs, but I have changed my mind,'' said Muzaffar A. Chishti, a senior analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a research and advocacy group in Washington. ''There are large pockets of the labor market where it is now agreed by most people that American workers are unavailable, unwilling or untrained to do the job.'' 
 Unemployed Americans are usually looking for permanent jobs, with benefits, so they often shun seasonal work. And while employers agree that workers could eventually be found if the pay were high enough, some businesses might not be viable if they paid such wages.
 Moreover, labor shortages in some areas and sectors can appear even in a dismal national job market. Unemployment in the four New York counties in which Mr. Rooter does business -- Dutchess, Putnam, Rockland and Westchester -- now averages 4.4 percent -- well under the national average of 5.6 percent. 
 DEMAND for plumbing and air-conditioning contractor workers has been growing for more than two years. Mr. Kershaw bemoans how few people train to be plumbers. He adds that high housing costs in Pleasant Valley tend to scare plumbers away from the area.
 And his company's situation shows how limiting access to foreign workers can hurt American jobs, too. Frustrated by inaction in Congress, Mr. Kershaw abandoned his quest to bring in the plumbers from abroad. Instead, he fired the support staff that he had hired in anticipation of the expanded business. ''I've let go of two, and I'll probably let go of two more,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Freedom Path, by Way of Peekskill

BYLINE: By SUSAN HODARA

 BODY:
THE photographer Betsy Braun Lane has been spending little time behind her camera lately. Instead, she has been searching local libraries and historical archives for records and other sources verifying what until now has been predominantly oral history.
 It is all part of her effort to create an exhibition of photographs exploring the history of the Underground Railroad in Peekskill, for which she received the 2004 Arts Alive Artist Grant from the Westchester Arts Council/New York State Council on the Arts.
 What she is unearthing -- not only about the Underground Railroad but about African-Americans in Peekskill in the 1700's and 1800's -- is reshaping her conception of the photographic work that will follow, in an exhibition scheduled to open in October entitled ''Choosing Freedom: Following the Spirit of the Underground Railroad.'' 
 Ms. Braun Lane, 57, began working in photography 10 years ago after a circuitous journey that started with the study of painting and a college degree in history, followed by careers as a middle school history teacher, a substance-abuse counselor and an actress and model. Since 2002, her photography has been exhibited in 18 solo, group and juried shows throughout the area. 
 A Westchester resident for 25 years, Ms. Braun Lane, who was raised in New Jersey and is the mother of two grown daughters, lives in a 230-year-old farmhouse in Ossining with her husband, Whitney Lane, a studio photographer. She spoke recently about photography and the research she is doing for her coming show. 

Q. What elements of photography captivate you?

A. I'm in love with available light and fascinated by the passage of time. I'm not a photojournalist, nor do I manipulate my subjects. Instead, I try to capture the spirit of a place by finding the moment and shooting what has been left behind.

Q. Discuss your attraction to contemporary ruins.

A. As an historian, I have an interest in archaeology and architecture as tangible remnants of our past. I am also fascinated by what ruins represent about our intentions. Ruins occur because something happens to our process; our purposes come to an end, but the buildings still stand. But the courses of nature don't stop. Eventually the elements take over, and what remains is what has become of that initial purpose.

Q. What led to this project?

A. I followed newspaper articles about the Museum of the Underground Railroad project in Peekskill. The former mayor, Fran Gibbs, introduced me to its founders, Waymond Brothers and his wife, LaFern Joseph. They have led tours of Underground Railroad sites in Peekskill for several years, in association with the National Parks Service. I became fascinated by this piece of unexplored history.
 I am also a descendant of the Mandevilles, who settled in Peekskill before the Revolutionary War and operated the Mandeville Tavern there. 
 In 2002 I shot a series of photographs of the abandoned Anaconda Wire and Cable Company factory in Hastings-on-Hudson that I called ''Reflecting Reality.'' I imagined that same aesthetic informing a photographic series of Underground Railroad sites; I thought I'd be going into old spaces and uncovering the story of that period. In fact, while the locations have been accurately identified, often the structures there have been destroyed or reconstructed. 
 My objective, then, was to relate the present Peekskill population to families of the past, but when I began researching, there was a lack of specific documentation about the Underground Railroad and the people who supported it. 

Q. What are you uncovering in your research?

A. The Underground Railroad was a network of ''conductors'' -- church people, freemen, abolitionists -- who helped slaves escape to Canada before and during the Civil War. Part of its route ran through the Peekskill area. I started my research to find these places, but to do that, I had to know the people, and I discovered a dearth of knowledge about them. There is a valid oral history, and there are passing references in old newspapers and deeds, but there is no written history specifically concerning the origination and development of the African-American population here.
 Nor have I found church records, marriage certificates or pictures of church functions or community celebrations. So not only am I verifying the existence of the Underground Railroad in Peekskill, but I also am exploring the community during that time. 
 It's the information that's missing that's so compelling. And it is to be celebrated. The Underground Railroad was the first cooperative multicultural effort in our new country. It existed solely for a humanitarian purpose and conflicted directly with the laws and economic stability of many of these communities. My goal is the reconciliation of the information I uncover with the segments of the community it concerns -- to let these ''lost voices'' be heard. 

Q. How has the concept for your exhibition evolved as a result of your research?

A. I've had to open up my hand. I don't want to visualize yet what I'll be shooting; the work will be subject to how I conceptualize the findings of my research. Information is so hidden, under so many layers. I want viewers to experience the density I've confronted.

Q. How will your efforts benefit the local community?

A. There is a movement in Peekskill using the arts to stimulate the community, and I'm part of that. But unless an historical backdrop exists, that's only the icing on the cupcake. There has been an African-American community in Peekskill since the 1600's, and they have never had the chance to tell their story. My grant and the trust of the community are allowing me to create a fuller understanding of their history.

HEADLINE: Back Home, in Westchester

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER

 BODY:
CHARLIE MAYONE fondly remembers his childhood in Westchester County. As a boy, he recalls, he and his brother biked from Larchmont to the Croton Reservoir to fish, and later he proposed there to the woman who would become his wife, Jen. 
 Both were born and raised in the county, and it's where they chose to start their family. Then they left, first for Wilton, Conn., as their family grew and later to attractive retirement areas in Florida and then Maine.
 Now, having turned 74, they are coming back home, joining a tide of former Westchester residents who went away but are now returning in their old age. The reasons are many: the tug of home, relatives nearby, medical and other care in the New York region that is unrivaled almost anywhere. Also making it attractive is the fact that New York has one of the most expansive Medicaid programs in the country, reimbursing for services not covered in other states. 
 The returnees, many of them less healthy than the Mayones, are further stressing a system that is already struggling to meet the needs of an ever-growing number of the elderly requiring housing, transportation and other services that will help them remain independent in their later years.
 The Mayones are exchanging their home on three and a half acres in Cape Elizabeth, Me., for the security of a one-floor condominium in Somers, with family close by. Both are now healthy, but as they age they realize that in the future their health needs will require services like transportation, structured activities and medical care. While the warm memories and having a son and daughter-in-law nearby in Stamford were important factors in their decision, good care was also important, and especially the condos' proximity to My Second Home, an intergenerational day care center, which is only minutes away. 
 The Mayones are not alone in returning to Westchester for their later years. And this influx of returnees typically includes many of the frail elderly, who can no longer make it on their own, said Mae Carpenter, who heads the county's Department of Senior Programs and Services, and they may need extensive services, or may even have to go into a nursing home. 
 There are no firm numbers on the size of this migration of older people back into Westchester. Dr. John N. Migliaccio, president of the American Institute of Financial Gerontology in White Plains, said the phenomenon of reverse migration, which can be found here and across the country, has many implications. This is particularly true in Westchester, where nearly 14 percent of the population is already 65 or older, and where that slice of the population is expected to grow by 30 percent by 2020. In addition, the fastest growing segment of the county's population is made up of those 85 and older. 
 ''The people who are coming back are basically taking their money to Florida and bringing frailty and need for services back to New York,'' Dr. Migliaccio said. ''There's where the relative impact is.'' 
 The elderly population in Westchester is one of the fastest growing in the country. 
 ''Already the demand for services is astronomical,'' Ms. Carpenter said. Beyond that, the challenges to both the returning elderly and the system that serves them are not small. Real estate prices are high and ever rising. There is a constant need in the county for homes for those with low to moderate incomes, and many of the elderly have just such incomes. Transportation shortages and financing that does not keep pace with services needed by the elderly all combine to make a difficult task exasperating for those providing services. 
 In addition, Ms. Carpenter said, older people who might not have needed the county's assistance in the past are starting to require assistance. For example, she said, the downturn in the economy and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, left some adult children without jobs, making them unable to help their parents financially. Many elderly people had their savings devastated by the stock market debacle a few years ago, she added.
 ''You've got people out in their 80's looking for jobs,'' she said.
 While there are few statistics for Westchester, anecdotally, those who know the situations say returnees are often most noticeable around holidays.
 ''Children go visit their parents, become concerned about their frailty and start looking for places where they can be relocated,'' Ms. Carpenter said.
 Ms. Carpenter said her agency received about 114,000 requests for services last year, quadruple the number of requests in 1998. More than 17,000 people, 10 times the number five years ago, signed up for programs including exercise and medication management, she said.
 Doris Schear, the director of senior housing assistance at Westchester Residential Opportunities, a nonprofit agency working to increase housing for minorities, the elderly, those with psychiatric disabilities, and low- and moderate-income residents, said her group receives many calls from people who are trying to bring their parents to Westchester. Often the parents are in their 80's and in need of at least basic assistance if they are to live on their own while others may need more supervised care or even need to go into a nursing home.
 HOUSING is almost always the biggest concern for those returning. Already Westchester has more than 37,000 elderly households in which the income level is less than that needed to afford median rent.
 For those returning from retirement in places like Florida and Arizona, finding an apartment they can afford can be difficult in an already tight market, and for those who may have owned a home, it may be impossible to buy something comparable here. 
 Although Matilde Cathy Agar, the program coordinator of geriatric outreach for Family Services of Westchester, may be wired into the elderly community as part of her job, she was astounded by what she found two years ago when she tried to relocate an aged aunt who had been living on Long Island with relatives. She found waiting lists of up to 10 years for federally subsidized senior housing on Long Island, and so she began making calls in Westchester where the waiting lists had closed when waits reached five to six years.
 ''I thought it would be challenging to find housing, but it was beyond that,'' Ms. Agar said. ''It was shocking how little was out there.'' 
 Her aunt, Catherine Tomasulo, 88, has an annual income of about $10,000 a year and a plethora of medical needs.
 Ms. Agar was able to find the medical services her aunt needed and talked her into going to My Second Home two days a week for activities, but the housing remained daunting. She said the one-bedroom apartments she found averaged about $1,000 a month, more than her Aunt Katie's entire income. While Ms. Agar was trying to solve the problem, she found out that a construction site she drove by daily was going to be senior housing where residents would be chosen by lottery. Her aunt applied to live at the complex, Wynwood Oaks in Yorktown, and was chosen.
 It has changed her life. Mrs. Tomasulo had become depressed living in a one-room apartment with her nephew. There was nowhere for her to go during the day, no one even to talk with.
 In her new building, she has a spacious one-bedroom apartment, which she keeps immaculate. She likes to cook, and when she needs groceries she can walk down the street to a store. She pays $400 a month, excluding utilities. 
 ''I felt I was living again,'' she said. ''I was by myself and I knew I could do what I want when I want.'' Ms. Carpenter estimated that for the older person living independently in Florida, housing may have cost $300 a month, while here that will often run $1,000 a month at a minimum at market rates.
 ''If we could have all the affordable senior housing we needed indexed to income, many of our problems would be alleviated,'' Ms. Carpenter said.
 Westchester has about 60 federally subsidized apartment buildings throughout the county, most of them in the cities, providing homes for low- and moderate-income elderly, but the waiting lists at those places, which typically have space for about 100 residents, were closed when they reached five or six years.
 While it would be expected that retirees who moved to Florida would be middle class and above and not looking for subsidized housing, whether they can find something on the market within their means is another question. In addition, a common factor prompting the return of an older person may be the death of a spouse, which can result in a serious loss of income.
 The median sales price for a single family house reached $545,500 in Westchester last year and has gone up again this year, according to P. Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. The median price of a condo reached $322,500 last year and a cooperative, $130,000. In contrast, in 1993, the median sales price of a house in Westchester was $280,000 while the median price of a condo was $160,000.
 Skyrocketing real estate prices have made Ed and Fran Visconti, who raised their family in Eastchester and then moved to Florida in 1987, all the more pleased with their decision to return to the county in 1998. Problematic health and a desire to be near family drove their decision.
 ''In the beginning our children came for all the holidays,'' Mrs. Visconti, 72, said. ''The first five years were fantastic down there, like a vacation.'' 
 But ultimately she missed New York. When the couple returned, they bought a $66,000 one-bedroom co-op and they have become active at a nearby senior center in Eastchester where they both do volunteer work as well as participating.
 At 78, Mr. Visconti said he would like to get his sister, who stayed in Florida, back up here. But the price difference between when he came back and now is making that difficult. 
 ''She keeps saying, 'find me a place like yours,''' Mrs. Visconti said. ''I say, 'You must be kidding.'''
 There are several options for housing in the county. There is plenty of assisted living, programs that provide services like light housekeeping and meals, for those who can afford the price tag of about $30,000 annually and up. Second, many elderly people choose a less expensive apartment and try to patch together services. Third, the elderly with ample money can choose living arrangements that offer what the industry calls a ''continuum of care,'' allowing them to stay in one place as they age or become feeble, offering higher-level services and medical care as needed.
 For now, the Mayones, moving back from Maine, are both healthy. Yet the availability of adult day care like what they found at My Second Home is important. ''It offers teaching programs and interaction with children,'' Mr. Mayone said of the center. ''We looked for a similar program in Connecticut and there's nothing like My Second Home.'' 
 Cathy Mayone, their daughter-in-law, noted that while her in-laws were still self-sufficient, the program will offer a variety of services and activities as they age and require more assistance to get around. Lois Pellegrino, the director of My Second Home, compliments the county for creatingits caregiver resource centers which provide a range of information to the elderly and their families, but says finding services in the northern part of the county, which is more affordable, is very difficult.
 TRANSPORTATION to get her clients to and from the center is expensive and can be problematic for the elderly, whether it is a matter of forgetfulness or simply difficulty getting from their home to a van or cab.
 ''They get to people's homes and they're sleeping,'' she said, providing an example. ''Or somebody has a memory issue and they're not dressed and need assistance.'' 
 While providing services to an ever growing number of the elderly is high on the agenda of social service providers, there is also concern about any increase in demands to the Medicaid program, which covers long-term care for some elderly, and which is escalating rapidly in its cost.
 Just this year the county raised its property taxes 19 percent in large part because of the climbing costs of Medicaid. New York is one of only two states in the country that requires counties to pick up part of the cost of the program and New York has a particularly rich offering of services it covers.
 Ms. Carpenter noted that New York pays more for Medicaid than Texas and California combined, with about 7 to 8 percent of what is being spent in the county going to home and nursing home care. ''It makes it very difficult for counties to want to provide affordable housing if it means they also have to pay the health care costs,'' she said.
 Counties across the state are currently pushing the state to lessen their responsibility for the program. In the meantime, Westchester, with its inordinately large population of the elderly, struggles to cope.
 Still, Ms. Carpenter is quick to note, that those returning are more than welcome.
 ''They were here. They paid their taxes and they moved to cheaper places to live where their dollars go further,'' she said. '' When they become older or frailer they want to be back around their children and friends. It's simply a reality that should be anticipated and planned for.''
 The county has opened nine caregiver resource centers throughout the county, which provide support to aging relatives, but Ms. Carpenter noted there is still no dedicated funds for social adult day services, which can help older people who try to stay in their home rather than being placed in more expensive assisted living centers or nursing homes.
 The county has expanded in-home services for people who do not need supervision with medication, and many groups provide meals to the elderly who are house-bound or day programs for those who can get out. Such costs are paid by the county in addition to Medicaid. 
 The Viscontis go regularly to the Eastchester Senior Citizen Nutrition Program at Lake Isle. Mrs. Visconti helps count the money from the lunch program twice a week and her husband delivers meals to shut-ins.
 Mrs. Visconti said she was worried when she first pressed her husband about coming back to Westchester because moving to Florida after retirement had been his dream.
 But, she said, he couldn't be happier. As for her, she said, there was never any doubt about where she ultimately belonged.
 Never one to mince words, she said, ''I wanted to die in New York.''

Lives That Touch in Shared Space
 FOR five years after her husband became ill, Retta Harper lived with him in a nursing home. It was a sheltered life, in which the nursing home basically cared for her, too.
 When he died, though, she had to leave the nursing home in Purdys, in northern Westchester. But for where? 
 ''The nursing home took every penny we had,'' said Mrs. Harper, who will turn 89 at the end of this month. 
 The couple had no children and living with other relatives was not an option in her mind. Social workers were adamant that she not be on her own, but on her income -- limited to Social Security and a modest pension -- it was questionable whether she could even find a suitable apartment.
 After nearly six months of searching, during which she was allowed to stay in the nursing home, social workers found Mrs. Harper a place to live with A-HOME, a nonprofit group in northern Westchester working to create low-income housing for the elderly as well as single-parent families and people with mental disabilities. The group, which was founded in 1985 and receives support from a coalition of 26 civic organizations and religious groups, buys up large old houses, rehabilitates them and then creates shared housing. Each resident gets a room, but the kitchen, living room and dining room are communal.
 ''They can live together, they look after each other, they can or not share meals together,'' said Joan Arnold, one of the founders.
 The rents are affordable, about 30 percent of the resident's income, and for those in need of services there are either caseworkers or volunteers to help out.
 For Mrs. Harper, who lives in a carriage house the group rehabilitated in Thornwood, that has meant that as health issues have arisen she has had the help to get the services she needs. A nurse visits twice a week and, on a more personal note, as a Roman Catholic, she gets house calls from a nun and a priest.
 The arrangement sounds ideal, but the group can only do so much. It takes about three years once a property is acquired to get it up and operating. In addition, A-Home is limited to an extent by zoning. In some communities, only two unrelated individuals can live in a home, while others allow more. A-HOME serves only about 75 people, 40 of them elderly.
 No other group in the county does quite what A-HOME does on the scale that it does, providing housing and also relying on volunteers to provide services like errand-running and even curtain-making, said Doris Schear, director of senior housing assistance for Westchester Residential Opportunities, a nonprofit group committed to expanding low- and moderate-income housing options. Other groups in the county recycle old buildings into housing, and some also provide services in senior buildings, mostly on a smaller scale, but A-HOME is ''unique and exemplary,'' she said. 
 ''When they say 'A Home,' they mean it,'' she said. ''It's like a little cooperative.''
 A-HOME, which has a waiting list of about a year, is looking to expand beyond the eight houses it has for the elderly, but amid the current housing boom in Westchester County, it is running into increasing competition for the type of big house it likes to convert.
 While A-Home has seen some examples of older people returning after retiring to other places, most of its residents are local people who never left. Beyond that, Ms. Arnold said, a disturbing trend has emerged in recent years: more elderly people are being referred from homeless shelters.
 Mrs. Harper, who has been with A-Home for seven years, said she has no intention of returning to a nursing home.
 ''I wouldn't go back,'' she said. ''I'm too old. They'll have to carry me out of here in a box.'' BARBARA WHITAKER

HEADLINE: On Fast Forward, With a Full Nest

BYLINE: By AMY RACKEAR. 
Amy Rackear, an adoption social worker, lives in South Salem.

 BODY:
EVERY weekday morning at 11:35, I wave goodbye to the driver of the school bus and her most special passenger, my daughter, Tamar, as she takes her to kindergarten. ''Have a good afternoon,'' I say to both. ''See you soon.'' Four hours later she will return. ''How was your day?'' I'll ask then, thinking, ''Short, too short,'' while I listen to Tamar's breathless account. 
 I was unemployed when Ari, my oldest, entered school, but my days and nights were full. I returned to the workplace a year later. 
 I am an adoption social worker, responsible for assessing those who seek parenthood through this particular journey. Now, during Tamar's brief absence, I am upstairs in my home office, fingers flying across the keyboard writing an evaluation. 
 My clients live throughout the greater New York metropolitan area and well beyond. To meet them and see their homes, these houses and apartments with an empty room or a study envisioned as a nursery, I have driven as far east as Island Park and north of Albany. 
 Months or sometimes years later, my mind goes with them when they travel to meet their children and finally, bring them home. Some will stay within our borders and others will go to countries like Russia, China, Guatemala, Ethiopia and Kazakhstan. Most governments mandate a follow-up visit after the family's homecoming to determine how all members are adjusting. 
 On one such recent visit, a beaming mother brought her new son into the living room where I sat. ''This is Amy,'' she said to the baby, cradled peacefully in arms that had ached for so long just to hold him. ''She's your fairy godmother.'' It is joyful work. 
 Our days seem to be programmed on fast forward, and I stretch each one well into the next morning. Work deadlines must be met, but my children's needs must not be sacrificed. Years ago, when my son and I were at the kitchen table, a work-related call interrupted our conversation. He said sadly, ''Mom, you spend more time helping people have children than you do with your own.'' It was his perception and, too often, our poignant reality. 
 As my children grow older and their schedules change, I adjust my routine, accordingly. When Tamar was in full-time preschool, I did my field work and wrote reports during the day.
 This year, so I can spend time with her before and after school, I see clients in the evening and on weekends, when my husband is home with the children. On nights when I have no appointments, I am usually writing a report left unfinished at 3:35 on that or another afternoon. 
 My seventh grader's needs are qualitatively different from those of the boy he was only yesterday. With a cellphone in his backpack, Ari might call to tell me about a change in after-school plans, or even to relay a test score. He may have a question or concern. I want to be on the other end of that particular call. 
 One Thursday, I knew that the phone would ring and that it would be Ari. ''Mom, did you finish your report?'' he asked. ''Can you come to my lacrosse game?'' Again, I have to tell him no. The human stork, as he calls me, must continue to work. The next afternoon a tearful Tamar runs from the bus into my arms. ''It's Zane's birthday party,'' she said, sobbing. ''Now, right now, Mommy!'' My certainty that she was invited is matched by zero recall. I reach the parent of another kindergartner. I find out that yes, it's at a gym, and that she would be happy to drive Tamar there. 
 I wipe my daughter's eyes, hastily wrap a present bought for emergencies, and create a card. When the mother arrives to pick up Tamar, we are ready. ''You work so hard,'' she says, trying to both comfort me and ease my guilt. ''It's understandable.'' 
 Several times a month, prospective parents sit across from me. More often than not, both work. ''What will you do about child care?'' I routinely ask. They have anticipated the question, and cite the Family and Medical Leave Act, supportive supervisors, reduced hours when work resumes and, sometimes, the chance to work from home.
 I make my notes while I wonder if my daughter's soccer team is winning, if my son completed his homework, and who will be awake when I return home.

HEADLINE: Made, Not Necessarily Grown, in Connecticut

BYLINE: By HARLAN J. LEVY

 BODY:
THE State Legislature, in a move that all but acknowledges that Connecticut's wine industry can't consistently grow enough grapes to sustain itself under existing laws, voted late last month to reduce by half the amount of home-grown grapes that must make up the wine produced by the state's vineyards.
 On April 27, the Legislature voted to reduce the home-grown requirement to 25 percent from 51 percent beginning on Oct. 1. After that, some of the state's wines will be allowed to import more grapes from such places as California, Long Island and upstate New York.
 ''We had to do it,'' said State Representative Leonard C. Greene, a Republican of Beacon Falls who sponsored the bill, which was awaiting the governor's signature late last week. ''The commissioner of the Department of Consumer Protection contacted me and explained that a lot of the farm wineries were not meeting the 51 percent standard, so he thought that in order to preserve the Connecticut Wine Trail and tourism in Connecticut we should help them out. Because of the climate and the amount they are producing they could not keep up with that 51 percent standard.'' 
 Without this change, Edwin R. Rodriguez, the consumer protection commissioner, said his agency would have had to revoke or suspend most of the wineries' licenses. He said that a survey taken during an ongoing investigation by the Liquor Control Commission of the wineries found that almost all of them failed to meet the 51 percent requirement. That meant they faced losing their annual retail sales permits.
 ''To me, that's a detriment to the Connecticut economy, and they do play a critical role in bringing tourism to the state,'' he said.
 Indeed, the State Division of Tourism logs significant numbers of people visiting the wine trail section of its Web site. ''The wine trail brochure is one of the most popular at the state Welcome Centers,'' said Edward Dombroskas, the division director. ''The wineries are a very important element of the tourism product.''
 Jonathan Edwards, the founder of Jonathan Edwards Winery in North Stonington and president of the Connecticut Vineyard and Winery Association, said about 5,000 to 6,000 visitors tour his winery from June 1 to mid-November, the high season for Connecticut's 18 wineries. These tourists account for 80 percent to 85 percent of the Edwards winery's retail sales and a similar portion for its competitors. Losing those customers would be devastating, he said.
 ''Just about every winery on the wine trail is heavily dependent on retail sales at the winery, so if you can't make retail sales, you're pretty well out of business,'' he said.
 The investigation, sparked after Sherman Haight, owner of Haight Vineyard in Litchfield, acknowledged last year that some of his wines were made mostly from Chilean grape concentrate, found that because of the climate and inevitable weather problems, the wineries can only produce 20 to 30 percent of the grapes they need. For example, Mr. Edwards said that this past winter's cold spell might have killed 25 percent of last season's grapes. ''We have no other alternatives,'' Mr. Edwards said about last month's legislation. ''They really want a vibrant industry, so they're following the lead of other states that don't restrict the percentage of grapes.''
 There's a simple supply problem, said Eugene Spaziani, president of the local chapter of the national wine society Amenti del Vino and a critic and wine judge who has monitored Connecticut wines since 1985. ''There are just not enough grape growers in Connecticut to satisfy the needs of the Connecticut wineries,'' he said.
 The new law mandates that at least 25 percent of the grapes a winery uses a year must be home-grown. That doesn't mean every bottle must contain at least the 25 percent; the law just affects a winery's total output.
 Winery owners said that lowering the percentage is not an effort to prop up failing enterprises. Rather, it's an honest reflection of vineyard economics.
 Planting grapes is expensive, and it requires three to five years for them to mature, said Gary Crump, co-owner and winemaker of Priam Vineyards of Colchester and vice president of the winery association. ''It takes $15,000 to $30,000 an acre,'' he said, and finding capital is tough, because commercial lenders won't wait for repayment until after the mature fruit is harvested.
 Lowering the restriction will lead to more home-grown grapes, not less, said Steven Vollweiler, owner of Sharpe Hill Vineyard of Pomfret. ''By allowing us to make more wine, we can be more profitable and we can reinvest in our own vineyards and make them larger, but you need the revenue to grow,'' he said.
 Mr. Edwards said many other states don't have grape quotas.
 ''We're not just competing with Connecticut wineries; we're competing with California, New York, Australia, Chile, France, and New Zealand,'' he said. ''Why should Connecticut impose stricter regulations on me?''
 Growth at the expense of consumers is the main concern of Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.
 ''I'm sympathetic to the need to permit the potential use of out-of-state grapes, but the consumer should be accurately and completely informed,'' Mr. Blumenthal said. ''If the wine contains only 25 percent Connecticut grapes, consumers have a right to know.''
 However, the revised law does not require the label to say the percentage of Connecticut grapes used.
 ''It was kind of late to put it in,'' Mr. Greene said. ''That's something we probably have to look at next year.''
 More labeling is not needed, winery owners said, because federal labeling laws are adequate. When a label has the word ''Connecticut'' before a type of wine, 75 percent of that wine must come from Connecticut grapes. Also, the name of a vineyard can be used on a wine label only if 95 percent of that wine comes from that vineyard's grapes. These requirements do not change under the new home-grown standard.
 But to Robert Chaplin, a wine critic and columnist who has tasted all of the state wines over the last 15 years, it is ''imperative'' to tell consumers where the grapes come from, he said.
 ''I understand that if there's inclement weather, the vineyards should have the option to buy other grapes, but it's got to be labeled as such,'' he said. ''What's the problem with doing that unless you're trying to hide something?''
 Additional information may be needed on labels, Mr. Blumenthal said, but common sense should prevail. ''I have no desire to be the state's wine czar, so we'll simply review complaints that are presented,'' he said.
 Obtaining grapes from outside Connecticut will not reduce quality, Mr. Spaziani said, predicting that Long Island will be a major source.
 ''Long Island is a wine jewel,'' he said. ''They're growing tremendous grapes, and the red grapes they can get from California are superior to the ones we can grow here because of weather conditions.''
 Over all, Connecticut wines have an excellent reputation, according to the two wine critics. ''The quality is astounding, especially the whites and even the reds,'' Mr. Chaplin said. The top vineyards are making world-class wines, he said. ''Chamard, Hopkins, Stonington, Sharpe Hill, Priam -- they make remarkable wines.''
 Not all Connecticut wines are medal-winners, Mr. Spaziani said, ''but they're holding their own, in some cases, with wines from all over the world, and they're all judged blind. That's amazing.''
 The marketplace will judge, Mr. Crump said. ''The quality of the wine speaks for itself.''

HEADLINE: Lower Manhattan, On the Rise

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY. 
RANDY KENNEDY reports on cultural news for The Times.

 BODY:
THE key word in Lower Manhattan right now -- emblazoned on expensive banners and posters hanging at what seems to be every street corner -- is ''renew.''
 It has been more than two and half years since the Sept. 11 attacks. And in that time the landscape of destruction has been given over so completely to rebuilding that you could be forgiven for considering the whole island south of Canal Street to be one vast hard-hat zone, relieved by the occasional patch of unjackhammered pavement.
 So when I played the tourist in my own city in the first days of spring, I decided to use this theme of rebuilding to my advantage. Yes, it will be years before the major projects around the World Trade Center site are finished and neighborhoods feel whole again, but I wanted to discover the things that are already beginning to emerge, in a sense, from the scaffolding -- the brand-new, the relatively new or at least the recently renewed, beckoning people back downtown. I found that even in a city defined by the quantity of its novelty, Lower Manhattan is spilling over with places that have that unmistakable new-car smell. 
 Of course, the economic effects of the attacks haven't vanished completely. The Regent Wall Street, one of the area's most elegant hotels and one that served as a kind of canteen for rescue workers in 2001, closed in January after its owners said they could no longer withstand their losses. There are still fewer restaurants in the area than there were in September 2001, though the numbers are rising again. The Screening Room, for example, a restaurant and movie theater that had been operating for seven years on Varick Street near Canal Street, closed last fall after months of losses, but Robert De Niro and the other founders of the TriBeCa Film Festival are using it for screenings. 
 I started my tour by spending a recent Sunday at a place that is a case in point of the shiny possibilities of the new Lower Manhattan: the Millenium Hilton Hotel. The collapse of the World Trade Center towers shattered more than 100 windows in the dark-glass-sheathed hotel, which was right across Church Street. 
 The hotel finally reopened last spring, and staying in it recently felt like getting to test-market a new toy. The lobby's polished honey-toned wood, sleek couches and elongated tube-shaped chandeliers give it somewhat of a boutique-hotel feel, but on a grander scale, and that feeling continues up into the rooms, all of which present a nice surprise: a 42-inch plasma TV screen in the wall.
 In many Manhattan-scaled hotel rooms, the sheer size of such a television would feel like an Orwellian intrusion. But because the Millenium's rooms have large windows with great views of sky and city, the television just seems like an extra view, with a remote control. (In the nearby Ritz-Carlton in Battery Park City, the area's other luxury hotel, the harbor-view rooms come with a more low-tech viewing device: a telescope, for close-ups of the Statue of Liberty. The Best Western Seaport Inn on Peck Slip also has rooms with fantastic Brooklyn Bridge views, at a much cheaper rate.)
 My corner room at the Millenium -- for which I paid an early spring discount rate of $179, one of the best deals in the city -- was on the 52nd floor, with one window looking out over the harbor and Liberty Island and the other giving me a long view up the East River, with the crenellated Woolworth Building in the foreground and the Brooklyn Bridge shimmering in the distance. In a corner of the harbor-view window, I could also see the gargantuan World Trade Center site, laced with ramps and train tracks and the steel skeleton of the new 7 World Trade Center tower beginning to rise.
 Not to overstate the case, but there is really nothing quite like watching ''The Sopranos'' on a ridiculously huge plasma television with the lights turned low while nighttime New York City sparkles like diamonds outside your windows. Aside from the fact that my room was a little too close to the elevator shaft, which frequently emitted a drone like something out of ''Star Trek,'' it was a dream hotel experience.
 As hotel restaurants go, the Millenium's -- called Church & Dey, for the hotel's intersection -- is fine, but with TriBeCa just up the street, it's a better idea to walk north.
 One night my wife, Janet, and I tried Azafran, a Spanish restaurant on Warren Street serving the cuisine of San Sebastian, the Basque seaside spot that is less a town than a temple of food worship. We stayed there a couple of years ago, and while Azafran only rarely approached the real thing, it was enough to bring back great memories -- with marinated anchovies, chorizo and very tasty shrimp skewered with dates.
 You could also get a very good pizza or bowl of pasta at Bread Tribeca on Church Street, which opened last year. Befitting its once-industrial neighborhood, the restaurant is a pale, stripped-down, airy place, with the kitchen in full view and wine barrels hanging behind the bar.
 Near the bar hung yet another huge flat-screen television with the sound off. The night I stopped in for a drink Charles Laughton's ''Night of the Hunter'' was playing, the spooky 1955 black-and-white movie starring Robert Mitchum as a murderous preacher. The effect was quite strange, something like an animated ''American Gothic.'' 
 By then, instead of new and eager, I needed a dose of old and tenacious. So I headed to Walker's, at North Moore and Varick Streets, which has been a bar of one sort or another since 1877 and which, even after 11 on Sunday night, was packed with a young crowd. The bartender's two-tone gray and jet-black hairdo was almost entertaining enough to make you forget that the owner of the hairdo was ignoring you. Of course, being ignored at a place as beer-stained as Walker's is a New York birthright. It gave me new hope for the neighborhood.
 The next weekend, I returned, and set out to get a view of Lower Manhattan from a different perspective.
 I considered the Skyscraper Museum, which opened April 2 in a beautiful new permanent space in Battery Park City. But you don't even have to go the museum to see some of its work: It has helped create an installation around two edges of the World Trade Center site -- on Church and Liberty Streets -- that recounts the history of Lower Manhattan, tells the story of the Trade Center and explains the rebuilding effort.
 I also thought about another place-appropriate museum, the Museum of American Financial History near Wall Street. Among the exhibits is a working hand-operated intaglio press (or spider) of the kind used in the late 1800's and early 1900's to print bank notes and other financial documents.
 But it was a sunny day after a long, dark winter. And so I went to the South Street Seaport, where I joined a small crowd waiting to board a brand-new tour boat, the Zephyr, operated by Circle Line Harbor Cruises, part of the same company that operates the hugely popular ferries to Liberty Island. The Statue of Liberty, which has been closed to tourists since the Sept. 11 attacks, is scheduled to reopen sometime in July, though the crown will remain closed; Liberty Island itself is open to tourists.
 The Zephyr is 143 feet long, all smoky glass and polished hull. It can accommodate up to 600 passengers and, unlike many of the tour boats that ply the harbor, it hums along quietly atop four water-jets. Inside, it definitely still has that new-car -- or in this case new catamaran -- smell. There are comfortable turquoise-blue seats, tiny drink tables and (here they come again) flat-panel televisions. Hanging near the mahogany bar and the orchids in vases that decorated the main deck, they successfully created a P. Diddy private-yacht atmosphere.
 ''When we first started running tours, we had to put out a sandwich board saying, 'Open to the Public,' because people just assumed it was a private boat,'' said Capt. Russell Bostock, the director of operations for the cruise company.
 Its tours run up the East River to the Williamsburg Bridge, where the Empire State Building makes its appearance. Then the boat turns around, hits speeds of over 30 miles an hour heading out into the harbor, skims near Liberty Island and docks again at the Seaport. This month, the company will also run a faster boat called the Shark out of Pier 16. ''People get wet, the stereo's blaring away and sometimes the pilot dresses up like a pirate,'' said Captain Bostock, describing the tours. ''You know, fun stuff.''
 I had had enough fun by that point to build up an appetite, so I once again wandered a bit off the topic and almost out of the geographical boundary by walking through Chinatown to a small, crowded restaurant near the entrance to the Manhattan Bridge called Great New York Noodletown. The flowering chives and soft-shell crabs there are incredible. But with a chill in the air, I went for something more substantial, a congee, or porridge, with frog's legs (not my everyday lunch, but sometimes frog hits the spot) followed by a clay-pot lamb casserole with bean-curd skin and a Tsingtao beer.
 I ended the day by bisecting Lower Manhattan, cutting back across Chinatown and TriBeCa and wending my way alongside ground zero. The site continues to attract a huge weekend crowd, some of whom buy tickets for the PATH train so they can walk into the temporary, open-air station, descend 70 feet to the platforms, and look at the Trade Center foundation from inside the so-called bathtub wall, an awesome sight.
 But I was there to revisit the Winter Garden in the World Financial Center, which I had not seen since Sept. 7, 2001, when I was there to conduct an interview.
 The 10-story atrium, which was heavily damaged in the attack, reopened in 2002, looked just as I'd remembered it, though polished up a bit. It's a wonder anyone can get to it -- the entrance to the Vesey Street pedestrian bridge over West Street was so crowded with vendors selling fake designer watches and other trinkets it felt like a souk.
 But the Winter Garden itself felt like an oasis, full of light and people, and outside near it there was another garden, this one with newly blossomed daffodils and an inviting expanse of green grass next to the North Cove Yacht Harbor.
 As the sun started to climb down the sky, I lay down on the grass and overheard a group of friends debating endlessly whether to eat in TriBeCa or Chinatown or maybe catch a ferry to Brooklyn to find something cool there.
 They finally decided to stay in Lower Manhattan and try to find someplace new. I wanted to tell them it was not going to be hard at all.

 BODY:

To the Editor: As the largest distributor of European rail passes in North America, we would like to expand upon the information about European rail passes versus the low-cost air carriers that appeared in ''The New World of Cut-Rate Fares,'' by Katherine Zoepf (April 4).
 Although the best known, the Eurailpass is not the only rail pass available and is a poor point of comparison for travelers going between a very limited number of destinations in Europe. There are economical rail passes for one, two or three countries or more -- a rail pass for just about any itinerary and any budget. An American quoted in the article complained about a $500 Europass (Europasses were discontinued in 2002) and how she did all her traveling by night on the trains -- which would lead readers to believe this is the general case for rail-pass buyers. The truth is there are many far less expensive rail passes available and traveling by night is not required.
 Certainly when only making one round trip between Point A and B, a cut-rate air carrier will be less costly than a rail pass -- but so is a point-to-point rail ticket. Eurostar now offers plenty of $90 round trips between London and Brussels with free connection to Bruges or elsewhere in Belgium. The rail ticket also eliminates the expense and hassle of a trip to and from the airports at either end since train stations are usually in the city center. A rail pass offers the flexibility to explore an area and to change your itinerary without having to check for local specials -- and without paying extra.
 Incidentally, readers cannot follow Ms. Zoepf's specific example because the Ryanair flight she wrote about, Stansted-Ostend, was discontinued Jan. 14, which Ryanair announced in December.

HEADLINE: The Other Side Of the Trade Deficit

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Tale of the Toaster, or How Trade Deficits Are Good'' (Everybody's Business, April 25), which suggested that trade deficits and the sale of government securities to foreign countries have a positive effect on the United States economy:
 I am troubled by glossing over the long-term dangers of our nation's seemingly perennial (but by no means necessary) trade deficit. Supplying consumers through lower-cost imports is a benefit of free trade itself, not trade deficits, and preaching the virtues of having a foreign buying pool for Treasury securities is akin to saying that alcoholics benefit society by providing a customer base for liquor stores.

HEADLINE: Changing All The Rules

 BODY:
 Bruce Barcott (April 4) claims to have conducted ''extensive interviews with those involved'' in the reform of the Clean Air Act's new source review (N.S.R.) program. But Barcott couldn't find us or dozens of other knowledgeable sources that could have challenged the jaundiced view of N.S.R. presented by the disgruntled former enforcement officers he chose to interview. He couldn't even be bothered to return our phone call. 
 It shows.
 First, an inflexible approach to N.S.R. is counterproductive, if the goal is actually reducing emissions and not just perpetuating litigation. Experts from major research universities, think-tanks, labor unions and minority organizations -- as well as state officials and representatives of 20 different industries -- have concluded that an N.S.R. program that discourages maintenance activities reduces energy efficiency and actually increases emissions! 
 Even the cover is highly misleading. It's a close-up photo of the top of a stack with a backlit white plume. Large type over the photo says, ''Up in Smoke.'' The plume is actually steam from the scrubber system that removes up to 98 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions. Ironically, plants without scrubbers emit hundreds of thousands of tons more SO2 but look less dramatic in photos and video. ''Up in Steam'' just isn't as catchy, we suppose.
 Barcott implies that industry was aware it could be violating N.S.R. prior to the lawsuits filed in 1999. Wrong. The Clinton administration's E.P.A. itself wrote in 1997 that ''few, if any, changes typically made to existing steam generating units would be expected'' to trigger N.S.R. A recent federal court ruling says that the ''E.P.A. may have spoken out of both sides of its mouth''; there is no reason to believe that the E.P.A. properly placed industry on notice of the agency's view of the law. The government and environmentalists actually concluded that case was unwinnable just a few weeks ago.
 Utilities have made billions of dollars in investments in pollution control in recent years, substantially improving environmental performance. Federal and state law have established an effective regulatory framework quite independent of N.S.R. 
 The E.P.A. reports that since 1970, total emissions of the six major air pollutants fell 48 percent. These air-quality improvements occurred even as the economy grew by 164 percent and energy consumption by 42 percent. 
 While improvements can always be made, the news is pretty good. But you'd never know it to read Barcott's one-sided article.

SECTION: Section 1; Column 3; National Desk; Pg. 16; CAMPAIGN 2004: BOSTON CONVENTION

LENGTH: 1449 words

HEADLINE: Both Parties Wear Smiles for Democrats' Convention Site

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
The capital of this northeastern, union-heavy state may not seem the best locale for the Democratic Party to nominate Senator John Kerry, a hometown hero. After all, if Mr. Kerry were a preacher, Massachusetts would be his choir.
 At the same time, there is no better backdrop for Republicans hoping to cast Mr. Kerry as an out-of-touch Ted Kennedy liberal than a coronation focusing the nation's attention on a state that is expected to be the first allowing gay marriages.
 What's more, grumbling can already be heard in the choir loft -- police officers without contracts are threatening to picket outside the convention and residents are worried about commuter chaos all around it. 
 So, all things being equal, the Democratic Party might have gotten a little lift if its presidential nominating convention in July were being held elsewhere, in some battleground state like Ohio or Pennsylvania, said Rod O'Connor, chief executive of the Democratic National Convention Committee. But, he said, for the mass of voters across the country, the selection of a convention site has little meaning compared with the message that comes out of the event.
 ''Besides, Cleveland didn't bid this time,'' Mr. O'Connor said. ''Miami did, New York did and Detroit did. And we decided to come here.''
 It will be months before it is known whether that choice -- made long before it became clear that Mr. Kerry would be the nominee -- was a wise one for Democrats, but there is no shortage of opinions in the meantime.
 ''I think having the convention in Boston is a terrible decision,'' said Edward I. Koch, the former New York mayor. It would have been much better to have the gathering in New York, he said, tapping into the party's populous heart and refusing to cede Sept. 11 symbolism to the Republicans, who will have their convention in New York starting in late August.
 In defending the selection, some Democrats insist that Boston's image as America's birthplace will ring enough patriotic bells to drown out any Republican mischief.
 ''Boston is the home of the first public school, the first public library and the birthplace of freedom in this country,'' Mr. O'Connor said. ''Those are excellent backdrops to talk about education, to talk about personal freedom.''
 But already, Republicans are trying to link Mr. Kerry with his home state through the Boston Fog Report, a series of e-mail statements sent en masse by the Bush campaign to journalists and Republicans to paint Mr. Kerry as obscuring the record and flip-flopping on issues, as well as being a Massachusetts liberal.
 Ed Gillespie, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said, ''The fact that they are having their convention in Boston does help reinforce that, especially if voters who watch the convention come away with a perception of a Democratic Party that is going back to its traditional liberal roots.''
 And then there is the gay marriage issue, which Republican leaders believe will cause many independents to support President Bush.
 Massachusetts has been at the center of the controversy since the state's highest court ruled that same-sex marriage would become legal on May 17. Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, and the Democratic-controlled legislature both support a ban on gay marriage, but thousands of reporters will descend on Boston to cover the convention long before the Constitution can be amended.
 In a theory more hopeful for Democrats, advanced by Boston boosters, far from being a liability, holding the convention here will be a boon for Mr. Kerry. Having a hometown candidate will energize the convention, Mr. O'Connor said, and that enthusiasm will be apparent on television.
 ''I can remember my mother making me stay up when John Kennedy won the nomination in 1960,'' said City Councilor Maureen E. Feeney, a Democrat who is the Council's convention liaison. ''I can remember us running out and dancing in the streets. I guess part of the enthusiasm that people in Boston are feeling is that for them, like me, there is that little girl who is saying, hey, it could happen again.''
 For all the discussion, local officials and campaign scholars play down the importance of the convention's location in the outcome of the election.
 ''Oh, I don't think the site of the convention means a lot,'' said Thomas M. Menino, Boston's three-term Democratic mayor who, along with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, spearheaded the drive to have the convention here. ''The important thing is, What's the message? It's not so much about the convention itself, it's about the message that comes out of the convention about what the party stands for.''
 Then there is the message the world could get about Boston. The city, in contract negotiations with its public workers, is locked in increasingly contentious talks with the union representing 1,400 police officers. The union, forbidden to strike, is threatening to picket outside the convention, being held in the Fleet Center, turning the event into one grand platform for airing its grievances.
 [When the city announced rules in early May for convention week protests, police union officials and civil libertarians called them an attempt to silence dissent.]
 Mr. O'Connor said Democrats were optimistic that the labor troubles would be resolved before the opening gavel on July 26. Mayor Menino, sounding a more cautious note, would say only that he expected to have concluded most of the negotiations by then.
 But Thomas J. Nee, president of the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association, warned that police unions from around the country had agreed to send uniformed officers to join in the picketing if the dispute was not over by then.
 ''We will be out in the street, there is no doubt about that,'' Mr. Nee said. 
 While police pickets are a possibility, commuter headaches are a certainty.
 Security concerns will force the temporary closing of portions of I-93, a downtown artery running along one side of the Fleet Center, tying up traffic throughout the region. And because one of the city's main commuter rail links, North Station, lies just beneath the spot where Mr. Kerry will accept the nomination it also will be closed, adding to commuters' woes.
 ''For the players, the inside people, this is all very exciting, an incredible opportunity,'' said Ms. Feeney, the councilwoman. ''But to the average citizen trying to get to work every day, it's a somewhat different story.''
 Some 35,000 people are expected to attend the July 26-29 event, including 5,000 delegates and alternates and 15,000 members of the news media.
 A study by the Boston Redevelopment Authority's Office of Budget Management concluded that the four-day event will add $154.2 million to the regional economy. But another study, by the Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University, found that the economy will suffer a net loss of more than $12 million after factoring in costs from the transportation inconveniences and the loss of other summer events, like the United States Olympic gymnastic trials, which was moved after the city was selected for the convention.
 But the impact on the city will go well beyond any balance sheet, convention and city officials say. With a new convention center about to open across town from the Fleet Center, Boston officials hope to use the Democratic event as one vast promotion. 
 ''It is a great opportunity for a city to showcase itself,'' Mr. O'Connor said.
 Indeed, the opening-night parties -- normally held at the hotels where the delegations are housed -- will be scattered throughout the city's neighborhoods, in places like a bakery, a brewery, a bathhouse and historic homes, museums and parks, said Julie Burns, executive director of Boston 2004, the host committee.
 Perhaps it is best that not all attention will be on the convention itself, because the image there is not entirely the one the city had hoped. The razing of a decrepit, elevated rail line is behind schedule, so conventioneers will have to pass beneath the rotting hulk to get inside the Fleet Center.
 For all the problems and promise of the Boston convention, the perils it poses for Democrats may pale compared to those that Republicans face in New York, a campaign expert says.
 ''If you've got unions protesting outside the Boston convention while Democrats who are pro-union are inside, trying to dance around it, that's a bit of a nightmare,'' said Norman J. Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ''And it could all come a cropper on the gay marriage issue, if there are gay marriages being performed outside during the convention. But actually, the downside risk is greater for the Republicans in New York if issues are raised about exploiting 9/11.''

HEADLINE: Fighting the Falls To Rope in Tourists

BYLINE: By JANON FISHER

DATELINE: Paterson 

 BODY:
YOU can't fool nature.
 Just ask William DiPillo, operator of the Great Falls hydroelectric plant in Paterson.
 Two weeks ago, Mr. DiPillo planned to divert 1.2 billion gallons of water from the Passaic River through the 90-year-old power plant, drying up the Great Falls, a waterfall second in size only to Niagara on the East Coast. 
 Mr. DiPillo's effort was part of a clean-up intended to make the Great Falls a more attractive candidate for national park status. Once the power of the falls was used to drive industry -- now local politicians are hoping it is enough to drive a tourist economy. ''What we're trying to do now is to make the Great Falls a destination and therefore downtown Paterson a destination and the hinterlands around there a destination,'' said Rep. William Pascrell Jr., who sponsored the Congressional bill seeking national park status. 
 But first, there is the small matter of refuse management. The Great Falls is bounded by parkland, and sits at a bend in the Passaic River, where 72 miles of river fall over a 77 foot drop. In that journey the river picks up everything from dead trees to tires.
 Although ridding the area of the debris it invariably collects is not among the formal criteria that the National Park Service weighs in its year-long study of the site, it could not hurt. 
 At the same time, officials are pinning their hopes on the site's history. Alexander Hamilton chose the Great Falls as the site for America's first industrial city in 1791. He organized the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures, which bought the land to build factories and mills so that the United States could liberate itself from its reliance on manufactured goods from England.
 ''Hamilton knew the spot well,'' Ron Chernow wrote in his biography on Hamilton. ''One day during the Revolution he, Washington, and Lafayette had picnicked by the falls enjoying a 'modest repast' of cold ham, tongue and biscuits in a sylvan setting that momentarily banished thoughts of war.''
 While the Great Falls is still an impressive natural wonder, the city of Paterson -- with its crumbling factories and urban woes -- evokes thoughts of war, not of banishing them. To combat that, the city has embarked on a campaign to rehabilitate mills and factories in the area. Officials see the bid for park status working in tandem with historic rehabilitation. 
 ''Heritage tourism is the hook that brings people back to our historic cities,'' said David Soo, executive director of the Paterson Friends of the Great Falls, a group pushing for national park status.
 Mr. DiPillo was eager to do his part. But the clean-up did not happen exactly the way he had planned. 
 As the plant operator learned, you can't stop a flow of 1600 cubic feet of water per second with the twist of a spigot.
 After an inch and a half of rain fell in the area, with the plant diverting as much water as it could, water rose 20 inches. The falls were raging cascades.
 ''As much as we think we can control things, we have to deal with a little humility,'' said Mr. DiPillo, who acts as a caretaker, operator, educator and all-around ambassador at the plant.
 As such, he has become uncannily familiar with its detritus. 
 ''You can always tell what sport is in season by the type of balls you see floating in the river,'' said Mr. DiPillo, who has found an athletic store's supply of sports balls. A voodoo doll that he found in the fish bypass landed him a profile article in Weird NJ, a magazine that covers Garden State oddities. 
 So with the debris building up, Mr. DiPillo decided that he would plan to shut down the falls on April 30 for his annual Arbor Day clean-up. Every year he invites local children to spend a day planting trees and cleaning the shores around falls. And shutting the falls down, would allow him to call in a clean up crew to remove blockages and repair the 163-year-old dam above the falls. 
 But nature continued to chafe against the will of men: last week it rained again.
 With two of the three turbines operating at capacity, diverting 1275 cubic feet of water per second away from the falls (the third turbine is not operating because of a crack in its 8 foot 6 inch intake pipe), the fish bypass siphoning off another 10 cubic feet per second, the falls had slowed but still provided enough mist to make a rainbow.
 Still, crews were able to remove some logs, trash and debris from the banks and a few low spots that had been created by diverting the water. And they plan to be back this summer during the drier months. 
 For now, Mr. DiPillo and nature appear to be reaching an accord.
