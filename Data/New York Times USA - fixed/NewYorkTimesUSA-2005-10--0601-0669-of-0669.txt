HEADLINE: Big Rise in Profit Places Oil Giants On the Defensive

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and SIMON ROMERO; Heather Timmons contributed reporting from London for this article.

 BODY:
A sudden interruption in oil supplies sent prices and profits skyrocketing, prompting Exxon's chief executive to call a news conference right after his company announced that it had chalked up record earnings. 
 ''I am not embarrassed,'' he said. ''This is no windfall.''
That was January 1974, a few months after Arab oil producers cut back on supplies and imposed their short-lived embargo on exports to the United States. Oil executives, including J. K. Jamieson, Exxon's chief executive at the time, were put on the defensive, forced to justify their soaring profits while the nation was facing its first energy crisis. 
 Three decades later, their successors are again facing contentions that oil companies are making too much money and have failed to expand production. [Page C1.] 
 Politicians and other critics are asking why the industry allowed its refining capacity to tighten. 
 Exxon Mobil, the world's largest oil company, said yesterday that its third-quarter net income jumped 75 percent, to $9.92 billion. Its profit in the first nine months of this year -- $25.42 billion -- already equals its full-year earnings for 2004. This year's sales, which topped $100 billion in the last quarter, are expected to exceed those of Wal-Mart.
 Another oil giant, Royal Dutch Shell, reported a 68 percent jump in profits yesterday, to $9.03 billion. Chevron is expected to post a profit of more than $4 billion today.
 This year is shaping up as an exceptionally lucrative one for the oil industry, thanks to strong global demand, tight supplies and high prices for oil and natural gas. While the idea that the Bush administration was considering imposing a windfall profits tax was knocked down yesterday by officials, longstanding resentments against Big Oil are resurfacing and could end up imposing some additional burdens on the industry. 
 The sense that government should step in to curb the phenomenal wealth and power often enjoyed by oil companies goes back to Exxon Mobil's corporate ancestor from the late 19th century, the Rockefeller oil trust known as Standard Oil.
 Today, Republicans and Democrats alike, aware of the politically sensitive issue of high energy prices, are putting increasing pressure on the oil and gas industry to return some of its profits. The ideas include forcing the industry to invest in more refining capacity, to increase inventories to cushion energy shocks, or to provide money directly to the government program that helps low-income people pay heating bills.
 Simmering resentment of the oil industry has heated up as gas lines reappeared in some cities this summer and gas prices rose above $3 a gallon, a record even when adjusted for inflation. Gasoline prices, already well above what Americans are accustomed to, spiked after two Gulf Coast hurricanes curbed domestic production and briefly pushed oil prices above $70 a barrel.
 This winter, Americans can expect to pay much more for heating their homes than they did last year.
 Senator Bill Frist, the Republican leader, said yesterday that executives of major oil companies will be summoned to Capitol Hill to testify about high energy prices. Some of Mr. Frist's language harked back to the 1970's and early 1980's when cries of price gouging at gasoline pumps were common. 
 ''If there are those who abuse the free enterprise system to advantage themselves and their businesses at the expense of all Americans,'' he said, ''they ought to be exposed, and they ought to be ashamed.''
 Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, was even more heated: ''Big Oil behemoths are making out like bandits, while the average American family is getting killed by high gas prices, and soon-to-be-record heating oil prices.''
 This week, J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois and the speaker of the House, called on companies to build or expand refineries in the United States and explain when a pipeline deal will be reached to bring oil and natural gas from Alaska. 
 Oil companies, however, bristle at suggestions they should be taxed more. The last time a windfall tax was imposed on the industry, intended to punish it by capturing additional revenue beyond the taxes collected through the normal corporate income tax, was the period 1980 to 1988.
 Oil executives, echoing arguments heard in boardrooms around the world, say their business is highly volatile, with alternating periods of high and low prices. Only seven years ago, oil was at $10 a barrel.
 ''What happens when we don't have a year like this one?'' asked Red Cavaney, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main lobbying group. 
 The lure of higher margins from the refining business -- rather than Mr. Hastert's encouragements -- prompted one Houston energy concern, Marathon Oil, to announce plans to expand its refinery in Garyville, La. The company expects to increase production there to 425,000 barrels a day by 2009 from 245,000 barrels a day currently.
 Exxon was forced to defend its record of investing in refining capacity. The company said it had increased capacity at its existing refineries by 2 percent a year over the last decade, bringing in an additional 400,000 barrels a day through successive expansions.
 For the full year, Exxon plans to invest about $18 billion for both exploration and refining, a 21 percent gain from last year. 
 ''You have to look over a longer term,'' Henry Hubble, Exxon Mobil's vice president for investor relations, said in a conference call with analysts yesterday. ''If you're trying to encourage supply growth, it seems odd to put in disincentives. You've got to let the market work.''
 For the last quarter, the company said its capital investments totaled $4.4 billion, up 22 percent from the quarter last year. 
 But in a sign that oil companies are making more money than they can plow back into their business, Exxon returned $6.8 billion to shareholders either by buying back shares or paying dividends. 
 In an interview on Fox News 10 days ago, Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's chief executive, sought to quell some of the criticism. ''Profit is not a dirty word,'' he said. ''And it's absolutely required in our industry to have an adequate level of profit to be able to continue to invest.''
 Later in the program, when asked whether Exxon's profits were ''obscene,'' he said: ''No, I don't think they're obscene. I don't think they're obscene at all.''
 On Tuesday, the chief executive of BP, Lord John Browne, also tried to dismiss the issue of higher taxes. BP reported that its third-quarter profit rose 34 percent, to $6.46 billion. 
 When asked how much pressure he was feeling about a windfall tax, Lord Browne quickly replied, ''None.'' He said higher prices would have a cooling effect on demand, which would lower prices, and make a windfall tax unnecessary. 
 But not everyone is persuaded by the argument that higher taxes would stunt investments and curb future production. 
 ''The industry says a windfall profit tax would limit investments,'' said Philip K. Verleger, a consultant and a former senior adviser on energy policy at the Treasury Department. ''That's wrong.'' 
 ''You can come up with a tax that would not impact investments but might in fact stimulate them,'' Mr. Verleger added. ''You allow the industry to recoup its investments and make a good return. Then you look at incremental revenue and tax that.''
 Because of the hurricanes, Exxon said that its average oil and natural gas production fell 4.7 percent in the quarter. The company produced 2.45 million barrels of oil a day. Natural gas production fell9 percent, to 7.7 million cubic feet per day. But Exxon said its production in the quarter would still have dropped 1 percent, excluding the effect of the hurricanes.
 Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, yesterday called on eight of the largest American energy concerns, including Citgo Petroleum, which is controlled by the government of Venezuela, to contribute 10 percent of their profits to heating-aid programs this winter. 
 But Samuel W. Bodman, the energy secretary, said he was against any effort to impose taxes on the oil industry as a way of assisting poor families with energy costs. He said the Bush administration was considering requiring the industry to keep emergency stockpiles of gasoline and other refined products to guard against supply disruptions. 
 This year's backlash may be reminiscent of what the industry went through during the oil shocks of the 1970's. But oil companies, subject to price controls throughout much of the decade, seem better able to fend off their critics today.
 ''Our public image,'' Mr. Jamieson, the Exxon chief executive in 1974, said then, ''is at a low ebb.''

HEADLINE: Inside Wal-Mart, a Larger Debate

 BODY:
After a peek behind the curtain at Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, one thing is certain: the company is listening to its critics. Predictably, management's responses are about window dressing as much as substantive change, but there is still a lot we can learn from them. 
 The week began with a series of unusual announcements from Wal-Mart: it called on Congress to raise the minimum wage and announced that it would expand health care access for hourly workers and improve its environmental record. But the wary applause has died down. An article in The Times on Wednesday described an internal memo sent to the company's board about plans to hold down the cost of benefits.
The 26-page memo (now available on the Times Web site at nytimes.com/opinion) is required reading for all legislators, business people and advocates for change in the country's health and retirement systems. Prepared by the company's executive vice president for benefits with the help of McKinsey & Company for the Wal-Mart board, this memo injects much-needed honesty into the national debate over health care and retirement. 
 At times it can make for difficult reading. It confirms that 46 percent of the children of Wal-Mart's employees are uninsured or on Medicaid. In their drive for a healthier and therefore cheaper work force, the drafters recommend adding physical activity, like rounding up shopping carts, for all employees, simply to discourage the weak and the sick from seeking jobs there. But it can also be surprisingly forward-thinking. The internal analysis raises the prospect of increasing discounts on healthy foods to cut down on obesity among workers and putting health clinics into stores.
 The changes in the Wal-Mart health plan announced on Monday would allow an employee to see a doctor three times a year for a $20 co-payment per visit and to receive three generic prescription drugs for $10 each before hitting the high deductibles that many employees cannot afford. While that may be cold comfort for those with chronic or serious illnesses, it could help encourage checkups and preventive care. We cannot blindly throw out the good along with the bad as we sift through the retailer's dirty laundry.
 As a publicly traded company, Wal-Mart has no incentive to spend additional money on employee benefits. Investors have hammered its share price over the last year because of rising costs. Wal-Mart's approach is a symptom of economic forces: cold, logical conclusions based on the set of rules society has given the company to play by. Wal-Mart is a mirror image of the health care triage affecting all Americans. It isn't pretty, but we have to look.

HEADLINE: What If The Fed Chief Speaks Plainly?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
ON substance, Ben S. Bernanke may not be much of a change from Alan Greenspan, the man he will succeed in running the Federal Reserve Board. But in style, he may prove to be light-years away.
 It is not just that Mr. Bernanke has been outspoken in calling for greater transparency from the Fed, arguing that markets will perform better if they know what the Fed is doing. It is that he says things plainly even when discussing highly technical issues.
Consider his contention that the Fed should not try to fight stock market bubbles by raising interest rates. He has argued that such a move would probably not do much to slow speculation but could hurt the entire economy. 
 ''One might as well try to perform brain surgery with a sledgehammer,'' he said.
 Or consider his attempt in 2002 to reassure skittish markets that Japanese-style deflation was not a risk in the United States. ''The U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press,'' he said, ''that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wants at essentially no cost.'' A determined government, he said, can always generate inflation.
 At the time, the speech was stunning. Everyone knew central bankers could print money, but it was not something they bragged about.
 All this is a far cry from Mr. Greenspan, who rarely produced a sentence that could be quoted in full without baffling the uninformed.
 Perhaps the most famous exception to that merely confirmed it. ''I guess I should warn you,'' he said in a 1988 speech, early in his tenure as Fed chairman, ''if I turn out to be particularly clear, you've probably misunderstood what I said.''
 In Congressional testimony, Mr. Greenspan was artful at deflecting questions he deemed stupid without making that opinion clear. Will Mr. Bernanke be more transparent, and will legislators resent him for it?
 Mr. Greenspan's power and prestige probably peaked in the late 1990's. That was symbolized by the 1999 Time magazine cover that proclaimed ''The Committee to Save the World,'' with him as chairman, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence H. Summers, as lesser members.
 Now the financial power of the United States, and thus of the Fed, is reduced, a trend that Mr. Bernanke has been a leader in analyzing. Given who owns the dollars, if a similar committee were needed now, it would not be an all-American one, and probably would have to include someone from China.
 For Mr. Bernanke to be a successful Fed chairman, he may have to widen his view of what the Fed can do. He is an expert on monetary policy, but there is more to it than that.
 Mr. Greenspan's words could sway markets and politicians, even if the Fed did not act. Those who think the Fed should have acted before the bubble burst note that during the later stages of the technology bubble, Mr. Greenspan said not a word to temper speculative fervor. Instead, he gave speeches that accepted as reasonable the rosy forecasts of tech stock analysts. Different words might have helped.
 He also resisted suggestions that the Fed use its statutory authority to restrict how much investors can borrow to buy stocks, saying that financial innovations had made it easy to get around such rules. But the symbolic power might have helped.
 In arguing in the past that the Fed should not use monetary policy to deal with asset bubbles, Mr. Bernanke did not even acknowledge the possible power of persuasion. Will he shy away from discussing, as Mr. Greenspan did last month, the ''apparent froth in housing markets?''
 Let us hope not. Particularly at a time when the financial power of the United States is not what it was, Mr. Bernanke may need to take a broader view of the tools a Fed chairman has at his disposal.

HEADLINE: Losses Increase At Martha Stewart

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia said yesterday that its third-quarter loss widened from a year ago, as charges associated with its prime-time TV show offset a solid rebound in advertising revenue in its publishing division. 
 Shares of Martha Stewart Living, the New York-based multimedia company, tumbled $3.23, or 15.2 percent, to close at $17.97.
For the three months ended Sept. 30, Martha Stewart Living lost $26.07 million, or 51 cents a share, compared with a loss of $14.97 million, or 30 cents a share, in the period a year ago.
 The results included a noncash charge of $10.8 million, or 21 cents a share, related to the debut of ''The Apprentice: Martha Stewart,'' a reality show in which the company has no economic interest, but which provides brand visibility.
 Total revenue rose 5.7 percent, to $40.85 million, from $38.65 million in the period a year ago, helped by robust advertising revenue for its flagship Martha Stewart Living magazine.
 Despite the recent lift from advertising revenue, Martha Stewart Living has turned in a mixed performance as it tries to put the legal woes of its founder behind it. 
 Revenue in the publishing division rose 24 percent, to $27.6 million, from $22.2 million a year ago. The revenue growth was driven by higher ad revenue in Martha Stewart Living and Everyday Food.
 Advertising pages in Martha Stewart Living increased 48 percent in the quarter, ahead of its projections for 35 percent growth. Everyday Food had 21 percent more ad pages.

Broadway

'ABSURD PERSON SINGULAR' An uninspired revival of Alan Ayckbourn's classic farce of marital misery and Christmas cheerlessness, directed by John Tillinger. The largely merely serviceable cast includes Paxton Whithead, Mireille Enos and the wonderful Deborah Rush, who sidesteps the usual cliches of playing drunk in splendid comic style (2:30). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley).

'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car.

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'IN MY LIFE' Joseph Brooks's whimsical musical about heaven and earth works grotesquely hard to disguise its conventional heart. Mostly, it's like drowning in a singing sea of syrup (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY' Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests that Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Broadway

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'BEOWULF' Bob Flanagan's luminous puppets of lizards and fish are wonderful, but they are relatively tangential to a so-called rock opera that is not sure whether it wants to be a children's show or ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' and fails at both. Humans who are less animate than the puppets try to sing their way through an uninspired enactment of this great epic (1:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Anne Midgette)

'CYCLING PAST THE MATTERHORN' A grating comedy-drama by Deborah Grimberg about the fractious relationship between a mother and daughter. Shirley Knight plays Esther, a needy, needling woman who discovers that she's going blind just as her daughter leaves the nest. Carrie Preston is her needy, self-absorbed daughter (1:35). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200.(Isherwood)

'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)

'EINSTEIN'S GIFT' Vern Thiessen's potentially moving play about two German-Jewish Nobel winners -- the physicist Albert Einstein and the chemist Fritz Haber -- their differing conceptions of science's role and the martial use to which their work is put, is marred by unnecessary ''Odd Couple'' exchanges and a miscast Haber, but benefits from good performances by Shawn Elliott as Einstein and Melissa Friedman as Haber's wife (2:00). Acorn Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)

'FIVE COURSE LOVE' This musical is merely pleasantly fluffy, and sometimes offensive, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100.(Neil Genzlinger)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'INDIA AWAITING' The charismatic Maulik Pancholy is an Indian-born Wall Street trader torn between his love for an American woman and his lingering ties to home (2:00). Samuel Beckett Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Miriam Horn)

'IN THE AIR' Historical melodrama about the 1918 flu epidemic is like a soft-focus film on the Lifetime channel (2:15). Theater 315, 315 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)

'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)

'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)

* 'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' This movingly acted revival of Charles Fuller's Pulitzer-Prize winning drama from 1981, directed by Jo Bonney and featuring Taye Diggs, uses the clean-lined conventions of murder mysteries to elicit unsettlingly blurred shades of racism, resentment and self-hatred (1:55). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley).

'THIRD' Heidi is having hot flashes. In this thoughtful, seriously imbalanced comedy, Wendy Wasserstein takes her archetypal heroine (most famously embodied in 1988 in ''The Heidi Chronicles'') into the fog of menopausal, existential uncertainty. The wonderful but miscast Dianne Weist plays a feminist college professor forced to reconsider everything she stands for. Though Daniel Sullivan's staging is too easy--+going to build tension, the play exhales a poignant air of autumnal rue (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Off Broadway

'ASHLEY MONTANA GOES ASHORE IN THE CAICOS, OR: WHAT AM I DOING HERE?' A revue of satiric songs and sketches by Roger Rosenblatt that seeks to comment on the state of the national psyche. It's not good, apparently, but what's new? A bright cast keeps things lively, but Mr. Rosenblatt's targets are mostly moldy (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101 (Isherwood)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)

'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein. (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'4.48 PSYCHOSE' The French screen siren Isabelle Huppert gives an extraordinarily economical, admirably concentrated performance in Sarah Kane's dark, thrumming ode to negation. But Claude Regy's clinical production doesn't manage to chase away the ghost in the machine: the text's resistance to taking effective theatrical shape (1:45). Part of the Next Wave Festival. Performed in French with abridged English titles. Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)

* 'IN THE CONTINUUM' A spirited, smart and powerful portrait of two black women whose lives are suddenly upended by an H.I.V. diagnosis. Written by and starring Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter, who both possess the strong presence and confident technique to bring out the subtle force and potent flavoring in their writing (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)

'SAINT OEDIPUS' Combines actors and puppets with Greek and Christian myth to create a fierce, virtuosic theater piece (1:10). The Wierszalin Theater of Poland at La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, closing Sunday. (Jefferson)

* 'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an entirely Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100, closing Sunday. (Zinoman)

'LA TEMPESTAD' - It's an interesting experiment and a pretty interesting play, even without the experiment: the idea is to transplant the characters and some of the themes from ''The Tempest'' to a setting and story far removed from Shakespeare's tale and see what happens. Larry Loebell, the author, chooses the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, and Prospero's main demon is the American military, which uses it for aerial target practice (2:15). Resonance Ensemble, at the Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101, closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

* 'AFTER INNOCENCE' (No rating, 95 minutes) Calm, deliberate and devastating, Jessica Sanders's documentary ''After Innocence'' examines the cases of seven men wrongly convicted of murder and rape and exonerated years later by DNA evidence. It confirms many of your worst fears about the weaknesses of the American criminal justice system.(Stephen Holden)

* 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)

* 'DOMINO' (R, 113 minutes) A lollapalooza of delectable cheap thrills from Tony Scott about the real life and nasty-girl times of a privileged London brat turned South Central bounty hunter named Domino Harvey. (Manohla Dargis)

'DOOM' (R, 95 minutes) In this formulaic, claustrophobic shoot-'em-up, based on a video game, soldiers quell a mutant uprising on Mars. Dwayne Johnson, otherwise known as the Rock, is the trigger-happy troop leader, while Rosamund Pike is the forensic archaeologist, who, like the audience, is trapped in a loud, hellish enclosure. (Ned Martel)

'DREAMER: INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY' (PG, 105 minutes) Pure, schmaltzy formula -- an injured racehorse, a down-on-his-luck trainer, his angelically cute daughter -- but just try to resist it.( Scott)

'ELIZABETHTOWN' (PG-13, 121 minutes) A well-intentioned mess from Cameron Crowe, in which a young man (the weightless Orlando Bloom) loses his job and his father and finds true love (the hard-working Kirsten Dunst) -- all in the course of a very short week and a very long two hours. (Scott)

'EMMANUEL'S GIFT' (G, 80 minutes) The inspirational story of Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah, a disabled young man from Ghana, West Africa, whose mission is to improve the lives of others like himself. But beneath the weight of Oprah Winfrey's pushy narration and a succession of overly posed images, ''Emmanuel's Gift'' becomes a powerful story of political change that is almost smothered by contrivance. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'THE FOG' (PG-13, 100 minutes) This occasionally scary remake is about a dense, mysterious fog that hides vengeful spirits with a century-old grudge against an Oregon seaside town. At least there's a good-looking young cast, led by Tom Welling of ''Smallville'' and Maggie Grace of ''Lost.'' (Anita Gates)

* 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott)

* 'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)

* 'A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE' (R, 97 minutes) A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills about a seemingly average American family almost undone by cataclysmic violence, David Cronenberg's latest mindblower is the feel-good, feel-bad movie of the year. With Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all excellent. (Dargis)

* 'IN HER SHOES' (PG-13, 130 minutes) In his newest film, Curtis Hanson wrests a richly textured story of love from a seemingly unlikely source, Jennifer Weiner's breezy, best-selling fiction about two sisters -- played by Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette -- engaged in an epic battle of the heart, a fight waged mostly against each other and their own best interests. (Dargis)

'INNOCENT VOICES' (R, 120 minutes, in Spanish) Alternately powerful and mawkish, ''Innocent Voices'' remembers the civil war in El Salvador in the 1980's through the eyes of an 11-year-old boy from a rural village who faces forcible conscription into the army. (Holden)

'KISS KISS, BANG BANG' (R, 103 minutes) Clever and dumb at the same time, this hectic pastiche of L.A. noir conventions offers opportunities for Robert Downey, Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan to have a good time with hard-boiled dialogue, and the audience to have a few laughs watching them. The picture's self-conscious manipulations of tone and chronology might have seemed fresh and witty 10 years ago, but probably not even then. (Scott)

'MAGNIFICENT DESOLATION: WALKING ON THE MOON 3D' (No rating, 40 minutes) Tom Hanks narrates this Imax film that tries to give moviegoers the virtual experience of being on the lunar surface. At times it comes close. (Gates)

'MIRRORMASK' (PG, 101 minutes) This British film, directed by Dave McKean from a screenplay by Neil Gaiman, blends live action with computer-generated animation by the Jim Henson Company into a provocative, murky surrealism. The story follows the Freudian nightmare of a 15-year-old girl whose parents work in the circus; it's strictly for cultists. (Holden)

* 'NINE LIVES' (R, 115 minutes) The director Rodrigo Garcia's suite of fleeting but intense moments in the lives of nine women is an extraordinarily rich and satisfying film, the cinematic equivalent of a collection of Chekhov short stories. The brilliant cast includes Sissy Spacek, Robin Wright Penn, Holly Hunter and Amy Brenneman. (Holden)

'NORTH COUNTRY' (R, 123 minutes) A wobbly fiction about a real pioneering sex-discrimination case, ''North Country'' is an unabashed vehicle for its modestly de-glammed star, Charlize Theron, but it's also a star vehicle with heart -- an old-fashioned liberal weepie about truth and justice. (Dargis)

* 'THE PRIZE WINNER OF DEFIANCE, OHIO' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Julianne Moore is radiant as Evelyn Ryan, the real-life 1950's Ohio housewife and mother of 10 who kept her family afloat on her winnings from television jingle contests. Jane Anderson wrote and directed this tribute in a wonderfully zany, off-center style. (Holden)

'THE PROTOCOLS OF ZION' (No rating, 93 minutes) Marc Levin's ''Protocols of Zion,'' a documentary about a century-old forgery purporting to reveal a Jewish master plan to rule the world, makes its case expertly and powerfully. The film even has laughs (which is no small feat), but the cumulative effect of its message is enormous sadness that hate is so strong and so resistant to reason.(Gates)

'ROLL BOUNCE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A drowsy comedy from Malcolm D. Lee about a handful of kids grooving and roller skating in the summer of 1978, ''Roll Bounce'' has heart and good vibes but little else to recommend it. (Dargis)

'ROOMS FOR TOURISTS' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Five young women, who've never met, find themselves stranded in the desolate outskirts of Buenos Aires for a night after missing their connecting train. They accept a local man's offer of room and board, and promptly find themselves hunted by masked psychos through the narrow hallways of his old, dark house. A creepy, no-budget film shot on black-and-white video and full of sinister atmosphere.(Laura Kern)

'THE ROOST' (No rating, 80 minutes) A minimalist horror movie with more ambition than resources, ''The Roost'' treads a well-worn path as four friends (Karl Jacob, Sean Reid, and real-life siblings Will and Vanessa Horneff) are stranded at an isolated farmhouse filled with vampire bats and angry zombies. Though the premise is rough, and the acting rougher, the movie proceeds with such youthful enthusiasm that its rawness is more charming than annoying. (Catsoulis)

'SEPARATE LIES' (R, 87 minutes) A hit-and-run accident near the country house of an imperious British lawyer (magnificently played by Tom Wilkinson) leads him into an ethical labyrinth that tests his moral mettle as well as that of his wife (Emily Watson) and her lover (Rupert Everett). (Holden)

'SERENITY' (PG-13, 119 minutes) It probably isn't fair to Joss Whedon's ''Serenity'' to say that this unassuming science-fiction adventure is superior in almost every respect to George Lucas's aggressively more ambitious ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith.'' But who cares about fair when there is fun to be had? Scene for scene, ''Serenity'' is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas's recent screen entertainments. (Dargis)

* 'SHOPGIRL' (R, 107 minutes) This delicate, deceptively simple film, taken from Steve Martin's novella, spins perfect romance out of loneliness, compromise and the possibility of heartbreak. As a young retail clerk adrift in Los Angeles, Claire Danes gives a flawless performance, and Mr. Martin and Jason Schwartzman, as the very different men competing for her affection, bring gallantry, farce and sweetness to this funny, sad, insightful movie. (Scott)

* 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' (R, 88 minutes) Mining his own childhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself. Superbly written and acted, especially by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels as a pair of divorcing writers. (Scott)

'STAY' (R, 98 minutes) The director Marc Forster, whose previous films include ''Finding Neverland,'' takes a maximalist approach to this mysterioso story about a psychiatrist and a suicidal patient dislocated by time, space and lots of crazily raked angles. (Dargis)

'THREE EXTREMES' (R, 125 minutes, in Japanese, Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese) This trilogy provides a sampler of short horror films from high-profile Asian directors: China's Fruit Chan, South Korea's Park Chan-Wook, and Japan's Takashi Miike. ''Three Extremes'' may seem tame to jaded fans of what's been termed ''New Asian Horror,'' but it serves as a fine introduction to the genre for those who are curious but squeamish. (Dana Stevens)

'THREE OF HEARTS: A POSTMODERN FAMILY' (No rating, 98 minutes) Susan Kaplan and David Friedson's documentary about a menage a trois in contemporary New York could have been inane and smirky. But thanks to a development 13 years into Sam, Samantha and Steven's relationship, it becomes thought-provoking. (Gates)

'TWO FOR THE MONEY' (R, 122 minutes) A turgid male weepie in which Matthew McConaughey plays a former college quarterback turned sports-betting guru under the loud tutelage of Al Pacino's odds-making kingpin. (Dargis)

'USHPIZIN' (PG-13, 91 minutes, in Hebrew) In this groundbreaking collaboration between secular and Orthodox Israelis, two roustabouts barge into the home of a Hasid and his wife and make comic trouble. (Holden)

'EL VACILON: THE MOVIE' (R, 90 minutes, in Spanish) Luis Jimenez and Moonshadow, hosts of the wildly popular morning show on La Mega radio (WSKQ-FM), play themselves making a movie about their lives and their listeners' sexual adventures. The result is 90 minutes of over-the-top gross-out humor. (Gates)

* 'WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott)

'WHERE the TRUTH LIES' (No rating, 107 minutes) Atom Egoyan's drama about a fictional comedy team from the 1950's features an overly knotty murder mystery, a mess of blondes and two fine performances from Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth. (Dargis)

FILM SERIES

CHILDREN IN THE 20TH CENTURY (Through Nov. 22) Symphony Space Thalia Film's international program of films focusing on problems that affect children continues with two films. ''Landscape in the Mist'' (1989) is Theo Angelopoulos's award-winning film about two Greek children traveling alone to Germany to find their father.

This weekend's features are ''Ace in the Hole'' (1951), starring Kirk Douglas as a reporter involved in a media circus; ''The Fortune Cookie'' (1966), Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau in their first film together, about an insurance scam; and ''Buddy, Buddy'' (1981), Wilder's last film, which also starred Lemmon and Matthau. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

JOAN BAEZ, RICHARD THOMPSON (Tonight) The clips of Joan Baez in her folkie heyday, projecting a voice both haunting and hopeful, and her wistful but wised-up present-day interviews lent warmth to Martin Scorsese's recent Bob Dylan documentary. Richard Thompson's gruff voice and angular rock guitar are still sardonically forceful, and his rueful folk forays remain moving, making him the perfect choice to compose the soundtrack to Werner Herzog's character study ''Grizzly Man.'' 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722; $17 to $60. (Laura Sinagra)

BLACK DICE, THE DOUBLE (Tonight) The experimental band Black Dice expands its palette of sharp noise to include ominous glitch electronics, warped meta-blues and churning tribal bursts. The Double uses all the tools at its lo-fi disposal in service of arty pop undercut with burbles, dark surges and twinges. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, (212) 777-6800; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)

JAMES BLUNT (Wednesday and Thursday) With a Rod Stewart vocal tone that can also flip into transporting falsetto, this British artist writes songs in the ethereal but angsty Elliot Smith vein, only with more forceful alt-pop production. His song ''No Bravery'' is an antiwar lament that clings. 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15 (both shows sold out). (Sinagra)

THE COUP, LIFESAVAS (Tomorrow) The funky, political Coup took flak in 2001 for a pre-9/11 album cover featuring exploding twin towers. But the group's main man, Boots Riley, has lost none of the oppositional fervor. The Portland, Ore., hip-hop duo Lifesavas shares the righteous bent of others on the Bay Area label Quannum Records. 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, Chinatown, (212) 941-8100; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)

SHERYL CROW (Sunday and Monday) Though her latest material goes heavy on the strings in an attempt to play up her romantic side, she still traffics in comforting cliches that are more gutsy classic rock than croon-pop. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $50 to $100. (Sinagra)

DIOS (MALOS) (Wednesday) This laid-back quintet from Hawthorne, Calif., plays shaggy indie-rock marked by questing vocals, dream-pop harmonies and a kind of acoustic-electronic psychedelia that conjures a couch daydream rather than a desert drive. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $9 in advance, $10 at the door. (Sinagra)

DRESDEN DOLLS (Tonight) Combining bash and chatter with Weimar-style cabaret, this Boston duo, the singer and pianist Amanda Palmer and the drummer Brian Viglione, plays feisty call-and-response punk.

AL GREEN (Thursday) Soul oldies meet gospel testifying in Al Green's highly unpredictable performances. He sings, he preaches, he dances, he tosses roses to the ladies. He jumps in and out of songs and teases the crowd with his timing and his whims. Sometimes he makes songs like ''Let's Stay Together'' sound like aching, immediate pleas; sometimes the audience ends up singing more than he does. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street; (212) 997-4144, $175, SRO tickets $100.(Jon Pareles)

NANCI GRIFFITH AND THE BLUE MOON ORCHESTRA/THE CRICKETS/ELIZABETh COOK (Wednesday) Nanci Griffith comes from the school of Texas songwriting that finds little epiphanies amid small-town lives and loves. She has a tendency to sugarcoat her character studies with her little-girl voice, but she'll get some Texas rockabilly grit from the band sharing the bill: the Crickets, Buddy Holly's band. The concert also features Elizabeth Cook, a country singer with a full-fledged streak of honky-tonk. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, $35 to $65. (Pareles)

HANSON (Wednesday) As they've grown up, the squeaky-clean brothers responsible for the exuberant late-90's hit ''Mmm-bop'' have attempted blues-pop and songwriting without much pop success. The middle brother, Taylor, with his pop-star looks and breathy, urgently breaking tenor, remains the draw. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171, $35. (Sinagra)

SHARON JONES AND THE DAP KINGS (Monday) Determined to bring back 1960's soul, the Daptone label put together a house band, the Dap-Kings, and found itself a church-rooted singer from Augusta, Ga., Sharon Jones, who finds the flirtation and heartache in songs by the Dap Kings' bassist, Bosco Mann. 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $14 in advance, $16 at the door.

THE MOUNTAIN GOATS (Tomorrow and Monday) John Darnielle, the singer-songwriter who records as the Mountain Goats, just released ''The Sunset Tree'' (4AD), one of the best albums of his career: a semi-autobiographical disc full of extraordinarily vivid little story-songs. Monday with Grizzly Bear. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $14 (sold out). Monday at 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $14. (Kelefa Sanneh)

This week's acts include Leningrad, VIA Romen, Kinos Hronos, Slavic Soul Party and the Bulgarian wedding musicians Ivo Papasov and Yuri Yunakov . Several locations; check www.nygypsyfest.com for schedule. Most shows are $10 to $15. (Sinagra)

OPETH (Thursday) This Swedish death-metal band has moved though progressive and even acoustic phases.

(Sinagra)

VIRGINIA RODRIGUES (Tomorrow and Sunday) With her otherworldly voice, Virginia Rodrigues conjures a timeless, mystical Brazil, where nature meets spirit and the songs of Afro-Brazilian deities share the ethereality of Gregorian chants. 8 and 10 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; $20 at the bar, $30 at the table. (Pareles)

The second part of the program features father and daughter on sitar. Isaac Stern Auditorium, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $26 to $90. (Sinagra)

SLIPKNOT (Sunday, Monday and Tuesday) Lest anyone think life in the Midwest is all scrapbooking and apple pie, these self-styled Iowa miscreants put on a violent professional-wrestling-like show, spewing odes to teenage toxicity and violent boredom through holes in grotesque masks. 7:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $41. (Sinagra)

GIANMARIA TESTA (Tuesday) Gianmaria Testa, a part-time train stationmaster in Italy, writes terse, cozy songs suffused with romance and mystery.

THRICE (Tuesday) This quartet plays a brainy version of emo-rock that looks to the Cure and Fugazi as influences.

VERUCA SALT (Tuesday) One of 90's alt-rock's most popular female-led bands, Veruca Salt had a huge hit with ''Seether,'' a melodic punk-pop chugger. Long separated from the group's co-founder, Nina Gordon, Louise Post is still slamming away at the power chords. 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, Chinatown, (212) 941-8100; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)

GWEN STEFANI, BLACK EYED PEAS (Tuesday) Ms. Stefani, the tomboy-Barbie-doll lead singer of the pop-ska band No Doubt, was always destined for savvier collaborators.

With their saucy pop-hop, the Black Eyed Peas play cultural ambassadors to the hip-hop deprived. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, (212) 465-6741; $39.50 to $75. (Sinagra)

RUFUS WAINWRIGHT AND BAND (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Wainwright's piano-driven torch songs grapple with his musical birthright and cosmopolitan decadence. His brand of healing can be a scalding process, but he can be funny as well. In ''Gay Messiah'' he claims to reject any savior mantle, preferring instead to play a cheeky John the Baptist. Tuesday with the power-poppers OK GO, Wednesday with the smart singer-songwriter Regina Spektor, 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; $35 to $40. (Sinagra)

KANYE WEST, KEYSHIA COLE, FANTASIA (Wednesday and Thursday) Kanye West made his name as a producer of tracks marked by sped-up vocal-soul samples. As a rapper, he artfully balances his considerable arrogance, guilt and thoughtfulness. That Mr. West's gift for the sad, slightly paranoid hook has only increased is evident in the current single, ''Gold Digger,'' which loops an arresting snip of Jamie Foxx shredding in Ray Charles mode. A protegee of Mr. West, Keyshia Cole wrings raw pathos from radio R & B fare. The ''American Idol'' darling Fantasia is also on the bill. 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, (212) 465-6741; $49.50 to $65. (Sinagra)

'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tonight and Sunday) The New York City Opera's production of this Rossini classic is an efficient, attractive frame for the composer's florid score, and the company has a generally strong cast, with Hugh Russell as Figaro, Jennifer Rivera as Rosina and John Tessier as the Count. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $16 to $120. (Allan Kozinn)

* 'LA CENERENTOLA' (Tonight) Olga Borodina's mezzo-soprano is slightly dark for the title role in Rossini's Cinderella story, but she has the clarity and agility to bring this virtuosic, richly ornamental music to life. Kenneth Tarver joins the cast as the Prince in this performance. The other singers in this comic-book production by Cesare Lievi include Simone Alberghini as Dandini and Simone Alaimo as Don Magnifico. 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $36 to $205. (Kozinn)

'COSI FAN TUTTE' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) This is the ultimate ensemble opera, and the Met's revival of its sunny and simple 1996 production is an impressive ensemble effort from a young, attractive and gifted cast. The soprano Barbara Frittoli and the mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena are endearing as the sisters whose devotion to their fiances proves so ephemeral. Also winning are the fine lyric tenor Matthew Polenzani and the robust baritone Mariusz Kwiecien. James Levine conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $220. (Anthony Tommasini)

'LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR' (Monday and Thursday) Nicolas Joel's production of Donizetti's most popular opera seemed pointlessly opulent, murky and confusing when it was first presented by the Metropolitan Opera in 1998. The company has cleared away some of the clutter since then, and the production returns with new stage direction from Zoe Pappas. The cast, which looks to be strong, stars Elizabeth Futral as the mentally fragile Lucia. . 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Tommasini)

* 'THE MINES OF SULPHUR' (Wednesday) Contemporary opera has always been New York City Opera's soul, if not necessarily its bread and butter. Its latest adventure is this gripping horror tale with an emotionally searing 12-tone score by Sir Richard Rodney Bennett, in a suitably dark staging, directed by David Schweizer. The superb cast includes Jessie Raven, Mark Duffin, Caroline Worra and Timothy Nolen. 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $16 to $120. (Kozinn)

'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' (Wednesday) Jonathan Miller's 1998 production, now directed by Robin Guarino, has the virtue of letting Mozart's music and Da Ponte's libretto work their magic unhindered. The cast includes Lisa Milne as Susanna, Luca Pisaroni as Figaro, Hei-Kyung Hong as the Countess, and Joyce DiDonato as Cherubino and Peter Mattei as the Count. The conductor Mark Wigglesworth makes his house debut. 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $65 to $110. (Kozinn)

'THE ORPHAN SINGER' (Today) Drawn from a book by Emily Arnold McCully and adapted for the stage by Barbara Zinn Krieger, this multimedia musical, aimed at young audiences, explores Vivaldi's time as a music teacher at a girls orphanage in Venice. The production uses an all-female chamber ensemble and, as the promotional materials put it rather vaguely, a ''Broadway-quality cast.'' American Opera Projects is a co-sponsor. 11:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m., Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church, 85 South Oxford Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 398-4024; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Tommasini)

'TOSCA' (Tomorrow) This Puccini favorite has its final performance of the City Opera season. Carla Thelen Hanson makes a fine, darkly shaded Tosca, and Todd Thomas is a bold, swaggering Scarpia. On opening night, Jorge Antonio Pita sounded underpowered and somewhat strained as Cavaradossi. John Demain conducts. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $16 to $120. (Jeremy Eichler)

'TURANDOT' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) New York City Opera brings back its old and oft-updated production, with the soprano Lori Phillips reprising the role of Puccini's Chinese princess.

VLADIMIR FELTSMAN (Sunday) When he arrived from the Soviet Union in 1987, this pianist proclaimed that he was at least as interested in the European Classical repertory as in blockbusters from the Russian tradition. He bolsters his case here with two Beethoven sonatas, Nos. 8 (''Pathetique'') and 31, and Mussorgsky's monumental ''Pictures at an Exhibition.'' 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $26 to $89. (James R. Oestreich)

KALICHSTEIN-LAREDO-ROBINSON TRIO (Tuesday and Wednesday) Long the resident chamber ensemble at the 92nd Street Y, this warm-hued group offers Shostakovich's two piano trios, as well as Mozart's Trio in B flat (K. 502) and Part's quirky ''Mozart-Adagio,'' based on the slow movement from Mozart's Piano Sonata in F (K. 280). 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Kozinn)

ROBERT LEVIN (Thursday) Equally nimble as a pianist and as a musicologist, Robert Levin is the host of ''Mozart Explored,'' a series of concerts with commentary. He is joined by the Mendelssohn String Quartet and others. 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35. (Eichler)

MANDELRING QUARTET (Sunday) This young German string quartet has won several European chamber music prizes and runs its own festival but is not yet well-known here. The intimate concert room at the Frick is a great place to discover these worthy performers. They can be heard there playing works by Schubert, Shostakovich and Beethoven. 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700; sold out, but returned tickets may be available. (Kozinn)

MIRO QUARTET (Tonight) Targeting hipness on the one hand, demonstrating a high degree of classical polish on the other, this fine string quartet celebrates its 10th anniversary with a program of composers with hearing problems: Beethoven, Smetana and Brent Michael Davids (''Tinnitus Quartet''). 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $42. (Midgette)

IVAN MORAVEC (Monday) This venerable pianist plays Janacek and Debussy but mostly Chopin. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $23 to $79. (Holland)

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday) Announce the beloved violinist Itzhak Perlman playing and conducting Mozart, Schubert and Tchaikovsky, and you quickly sell out your house. Beginning Thursday, Gidon Kremer offers arguably more for the head and less for the heart: he is featured in Schnittke's Concerto Grosso No. 5, with Mikko Franck conducting; the Shostakovich Fifth and Beethoven's ''Leonore'' Overture No. 3 are also on the program. Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. This weekend's concerts are sold out; $26 to $94 on Thursday. (Midgette)

NEW YORK VIRTUOSO SINGERS (Sunday) This estimable chamber chorus champions contemporary music and, true to its name, performs it with virtuosity. The singers present works by winners of its first annual composition competition, among them Devlyn Case, Joelle Wallach, David McMullin and Stephen Miles. There will also be works by two well-established American composers, George Perle and Augusta Read Thomas. Harold Rosenbaum conducts. 3 p.m., Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, at 73rd Street, (914) 763-3453; $15 suggested donation. (Tommasini)

ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Monday) Having found a new conductorless playmate, the orchestra performs for the first time with chorus. The estimable Kent Tritle, the innovative and tireless music director at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Park Avenue, is also the founding artistic and music director of the Bach Choir of New York, which joins the orchestra in Bach's Cantatas Nos. 48, 78 and 147 in the Met's Medieval Sculpture Hall. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $60. (Oestreich)

* REBEL (Wednesday) Two natural horn players, Wilhelm Bruns and Sebastien Salm, join this ensemble of Baroque specialists for works by Bach and Telemann, including some that draw on, or at least obliquely refer to, hunting calls. Included are Bach's First and Fifth ''Brandenburg'' Concertos and the Sinfonia from Cantata No. 174, as well as a Concerto Grosso and an Overture by Telemann. 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $35; $21 for students. (Kozinn)

ANDRAS SCHIFF (Tuesday) This estimable musician of the keyboard will divide his evening between Haydn and Beethoven. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $56. (Holland)

DANCE AT THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday) The first of two programs this week at the Factory features Ursula Eagly's new ''Nobody Try to Be a Hero,'' inspired by the Moscow theater hostage crisis, and Rebecca Davis's ''The Birds are here, I hear them'' , inspired by chemical compounds, classical Japanese poetry and concepts of time and memory. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m. In the second program, the Lower Lights Collective will present ''Drawn,'' a series of simultaneous pieces taking place through the space that revolves around household objects and old, thrown-away wooden furniture. Thursday at 8 p.m. The Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 482-7069; $15; pay-what-you-will for Queens residents on Thursday. (Dunning)

Golden Dragon Acrobats (Sunday) Contortions, swordplay, balancing acts; if done well, Chinese acrobatics can mesmerize.

Post campus of Long Island University, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100, tillescenter.org; $15 to $25. (La Rocco)

Marie-Christine Giordano Dance Company (Thursday through Nov. 5) ''Nurtured or Neutered?'' Perhaps we'll find out when the Swiss dancer and choreographer Marie-Christine Giordano presents a premiere of this work for five dancers at the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center.

Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100 or www.bam.org; $20 to $60. (Rockwell)

JOYCE S. LIM AND PAZ TANJUAQUIO/TOPAZ Arts (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Lim's new ''splitting the night sky'' was inspired by her travels and research throughout Southeast and East Asia.

(Dunning)

Jodi Melnick and Scott Heron (Tonight and tomorrow) What do Ms. Melnick's ''Wanderlust, Kentucky'' and Mr. Heron's ''Flossing and Other Dances'' have in common? Not much, it seems, but they're both solos by Bessie-winning performers, so why not premiere them together? 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $20. (La Rocco)

Art

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

 Museums

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)

* THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are now on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show -- two compact rooms of compact pictures, each picture a main event -- will figure on any short list of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)

GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Faberge. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Roberta Smith)

* JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Glueck).

* JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and, by the way, what is a Jew, anyway? They are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, they have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride, to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in the rural community of Postville, Iowa. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)

* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS,' through Dec. 31. Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well-known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. Frankly, the whole show, even including the bad drawings, is unforgettable. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street. (212) 535-7710. (Michael Kimmelman)

EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272. (Cotter)

MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video-and-photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500. (Ken Johnson)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,' through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700. (Glueck)

* WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was, in fact, one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Glueck)

Galleries: Uptown

'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections' This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits and drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200, through Feb. 20. (Johnson)

'Yinka Shonibare Selects: Works from the Permanent Collection' A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection, and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. Smithsonian's Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8300, through May 7. (Johnson)

'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE' Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a master of fine arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sleek sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the space age and the global consumerist economy. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, through Jan. 15. (Johnson)

Galleries: 57th Street

'Harry Kramer' The spirit of Abstract Expressionism lives on in the work of an artist who has been exhibiting in New York regularly since 1970. But Mr. Kramer's lusciously colored compositions of slashing gestures and planes of thick paint are more seductive than confrontational. Ameringer Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 445-0051, through Nov. 5. (Johnson)

'Organic New York' This rewarding exhibition recalls an American trend of the 1940's that was eclipsed by Abstract Expressionism but has been brought back to life by many younger painters of today: surrealistic, biomorphic abstraction. It is loaded with swirling, symbolically charged paintings and sculptures by William Baziotes, Lee Krasner, Richard Pousette Dart, Mark Rothko and 15 others. Michael Rosenfeld, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082, through Nov. 5. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

Tim Bavington Modes of the 1960's, like spray-painted stripes and geometrically shaped canvases, are revived in attractive, multipaneled abstractions but with a contemporary conceptual twist. Mr. Bavington bases his compositional decisions on an obscure system by which he translates passages of old rock music from the aural to the visual. Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, (212) 645-1701, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)

Stephen Bush, 'Penetrol' This Australian painter presents partly abstract pictures of rustic cabins in alpine settings. Made in thick, viscous, partly brushed and partly poured enamel and oil paints in hallucinatory hues of hot pink, red and green, they suggest a kind of sentimental romance escalated into a gorgeous but frightening psychotic delusion. Goff + Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212) 675-0461, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)

'Contemporary Obscurists' Works by contemporary artists who use the camera obscura in variously inventive ways include Vera Lutter's huge negative image of an abandoned factory interior; Shi Guorui's ghostly, panoramic view of Shanghai; and Abelardo Morell's magical photographs of bedrooms with upside-down views of the city projected onto their interior walls. Alan Klotz, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 741-4764, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)

Chris Doyle, 'Flight Power Love Tower' A startling, semi-abstract sculpture of a giant, illuminated flying eagle made of slender lengths of wood and long fluorescent lights fills the front exhibition space. One of the amusing stop-action videos in the back shows the artist flying through his studio. Jessica Murray, 150 Eleventh Avenue, near 22nd Street, (212) 633-9606, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)

Franklin Evans, 'freakout' If you like Mr. Evans's densely worked neo-psychedelic mural in the Drawing Center's current emerging artists show, you will appreciate the ink-and-watercolor drawings on view here. Crammed with richly colored geometric patterns, abstracted landscapes and figures, they are both trippy and intimately sensuous. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)

ROY LICHTENSTEIN: 'CONVERSATIONS WITH SURREALISM' In its swank, newly opened downtown outpost, a blue-chip uptown gallery is showing eight examples of this famous Pop artist's indelibly cartoonized, also swank borrowings from Surrealism. Mitchell Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, through Nov. 12. (Smith).

Other Galleries

* Andre KertEsz From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's, to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through Nov. 27. (Johnson)

'Landscape: Myth and Memory' Miniature ruins built of tiny bricks on rocky landscapes made of clay by Charles Simmonds; large, faux-antique photographs of Egyptian pyramids by Lynn Davis; an enormous, crusty book by Anselm Kiefer open to the photographic image of ancient architectural remains; and archetypal circles painted and photographed by Richard Long all add up to a nicely choreographed collective fantasy about primordial civilizations. Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, through Nov. 23. (Johnson)

* 'NINE CONTEMPORARY SCULPTORS: FELLOWS OF THE SAINT-GAUDENS MEMORIAL' A lively link between past and present is the Fellowship of the Saint-Gaudens Memorial, a foundation set up in 1977 to honor the great 19th-century American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Each year the foundation has chosen a contemporary American sculptor to receive a cash award ($10,000) and the opportunity for an eight-week summer show at the Saint-Gaudens estate in Cornish, N.H. This smartly selected exhibition presents representative work by nine award winners, ranging from a huge cube by Tara Donovan, made entirely of toothpicks (2003), to a mini-city sprawled on a vast tabletop, whose buildings of solid graphite were wrought by Alex McFarlane (1983). Saint-Gaudens's own work appears in it, too; surprisingly, it doesn't seem all that far out of context. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212) 713-2885, through Dec. 2. (Glueck)

* 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS AT THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY' Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069, through Feb. 12. (Smith).

Zhou Xiaohu The best works in an unfocused presentation of efforts in various media by this versatile Chinese artist are the haunting, darkly comical Claymation videos depicting scenes like the trial of Saddam Hussein, a political assassination and the collapse of the World Trade Center towers. Ethan Cohen, 18 Jay Street, near Hudson Street, TriBeCa, (212) 625-1250, through Nov. 12.(Johnson)

Last Chance

HEADLINE: Trenton Candidates Struggle on Property Tax Issue

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEZIN JONES

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
One candidate has argued that the last time New Jersey's property tax system could be considered effective was probably during the Revolutionary War.
 The other has cited those taxes -- the highest, per person, in the nation -- as a major reason why For Sale signs are sprouting up around the state like so many reeds in the Meadowlands.
But for all their shared complaints over the heavy load of property taxes in New Jersey, Senator Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic nominee for governor, and his Republican opponent, Douglas R. Forrester, have each offered property tax relief plans that are striking both in their similarities and in their failure to address systemic problems.
 Driven by polls that show property tax reform is the most important issue to the state's voters, both Mr. Corzine and Mr. Forrester have made ambitious relief plans the centerpiece of their policy platforms. Mr. Corzine has advocated more relief through the state's tax rebate program and Mr. Forrester has proposed outright cuts in the property tax. 
 Concerns about cost aside, both plans would seem to be able to provide taxpayers with temporary relief. But each falls short of representing a true overhaul of the system. And neither can truly be said to constitute reform because they do not address the issue of helping local governments cover the costs of running municipal services.
 Without that, experts say, neither will result in the kind of change needed to bring lasting results.
 ''My sense is that neither represents a truly comprehensive solution to the problem,'' said Dr. Henry A. Coleman, director of the Center for Government Services at Rutgers University. 
 Critics of the state's property tax system say one way that could be achieved is by instituting another tax whose proceeds would go directly to local governments, which could in turn reduce the property tax burden.
 But because of the political ramifications of even suggesting another tax, it is doubtful that either candidate or the Legislature will do so. Mr. Forrester has even promised that he will not institute new taxes if elected; Mr. Corzine, who made the Revolutionary War analogy, has said that he supports the idea of a statewide convention to explore new solutions to the property tax riddle.
 There are also questions about the cost of each man's proposal, particularly Mr. Forrester's plan. Critics say that his cost estimates do not take into account the rate at which property taxes have been increasing around the state.
 That candidates for governor even feel compelled to address the property tax issue is testimony to the public's fury over it. Property taxes are largely a local issue, imposed, collected and spent by localities that in New Jersey are famous for their adherence to ''home rule.'' The state has little if any role.
 But the state does prevent New Jersey's 566 municipalities from imposing sales taxes or other taxes on residents to pay for essential services, like schools, police and fire, denying them an alternative source of raising revenue that local governments in 33 other states have. 
 ''In New Jersey, we rely heavily on local government, and local government relies heavily on property taxes,'' said Dr. Coleman, who is also vice chairman of the New Jersey Coalition for the Public Good, a group that advocates property tax reform. ''It's not too great a leap to say that's how we got here.''
 The ''here'' he refers to is the highest property tax bills per person in the nation.
 According to figures compiled by the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit research group, the average tax bill nationwide was $971 per person in 2002. In New Jersey, it was nearly twice that or $1,872. Connecticut, at $1,733, was the second highest; New York, at $1,402, was the fourth.
 New Jersey property taxes, which are based on location and value of the home, include county, local and school district taxes.
 Bringing about systemic change in New Jersey has proved especially difficult. Because there is no statewide control over property taxes and, as a result, no way to cut them, state legislators have over the past three decades used rebate checks to soothe taxpayers by focusing on specific groups, like those near retirement age, and by offering across-the-board relief. 
 Senator Corzine's proposal is an extension of the rebate program, but he calls for a 10 percent refund each year for the next four years.
 Mr. Forrester, however, calls for a 10 percent annual tax cut covering the next three years for all property taxpayers, with the state filling in the difference to local tax coffers. Mr. Forrester is also proposing an amendment to the state's Constitution to codify the cuts, similar to California's well-known Proposition 13.
 Both men propose paying for their plans largely by streamlining parts of the state's budget by, for example, consolidating some of the state's purchasing operations and prescription drug buying plans. Mr. Corzine also calculates that a large part of the gap could be filled by new tax income through economic growth.
 The most striking difference between the plans is their cost. Senator Corzine has said that he expects his plan to cost about $7.67 billion. Mr. Forrester has been vague about the total cost of his program. He has said that he expects his plan to cost $1.4 billion in the first year, $2.1 billion in the second year and $3.2 billion by year three when it is fully in effect.
 Critics of the plan, though, put the total cost at $15.4 billion when extended to the four-year period covered by Mr. Corzine's proposal.
 Critics say Mr. Forrester has not provided enough specifics about how to pay for his proposal. 
 ''It does not say where the money is coming from,'' said William E. Schluter, a former Republican state senator. ''What programs is he going to cut to get that money? It's not enough to say that you're going to get that money from boondoggles and cutting waste and fraud.''
 Questions about how to pay for the plans has led to some intense and often humorous speculation. ''Well, I guess you could free all the prisoners in the state,'' joked Richard C. Leone, a state treasurer under former Democratic Gov. Richard J. Hughes.
 Mr. Leone, president of the Century Foundation, a nonpartisan public policy research group, also questioned the financing for Mr. Forrester's plan and wondered whether Mr. Corzine's proposals relied too heavily on bringing more jobs to the state. But, he said, Mr. Corzine's plan ''costs less so it's more feasible.''
 Questions about cost aside, neither candidate has been particularly successful at winning over voters with their plans. A New York Times poll conducted earlier this month found that just over a third of all voters supported each candidate's plan.
 Interestingly, about the same number of voters responded that they believed taxes would go up if either were elected.
 ''I'm not convinced that either one of them has the answer,'' said Kevin Lee Allen. He has called for his town, Montclair, to secede from Essex County, which has the highest property taxes in the state, some of which also supports cash-poor Essex County. Montclair's average annual tax bill is about $12,000, more than double the statewide average of about $5,500. ''Both of them seem like they're sleight of hand,'' he said of the competing plans. ''They're going to take money out of one pocket and put it in another pocket.''
 Still, others who are close to issues of property tax reform in New Jersey are simply grateful for the attention the subject is getting.
 William G. Dressel, executive director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities, said: ''Here is the chance of a lifetime with regard to the property tax issue. Something has got to happen.''

HEADLINE: Building on Afghanistan's Elections

 BODY:
Afghanistan is demonstrating that even one of the world's poorest and least secure countries can conduct credible elections. Last fall, Hamid Karzai became the country's first democratically elected president. Now he has been joined by an elected parliament, in many ways an even more difficult feat because district campaigns had to be waged in even the least secure areas. 
 The nearly complete voting results, announced last weekend, show a mixed picture. A large number of seats were captured by some of the country's most fearsome warlords or their followers, including four former Taliban commanders, several notorious Islamist mujahedeen leaders and a number of drug lords. Another sizable chunk went to religious fundamentalists. Taken together, these groups will constitute almost half of the new parliament, although most candidates ran as individuals, not as part of national party slates, and there is no reason to think that these diverse elements will promote a common policy agenda.
But many voters also looked to a different, more hopeful kind of future. Women did remarkably well as candidates, winning 68 of the parliament's 249 seats. And the men who were elected include significant numbers of political independents and educated professionals.
 Of course, holding elections is only one component of successful nation-building. At least as important is the challenge of reviving the war-shattered economy and generating enough development to reduce desperate poverty, resettle returning refugees and provide the alternative jobs that will lure people away from private militias or opium farms. Afghanistan cannot afford to do these things itself. But relatively modest amounts of additional American assistance could go a long way. 
 The less than $1 billion that the Bush administration is seeking for Afghan civil development next year is too little to accomplish even the most urgently needed tasks. That amount should be more than doubled, and increased still further as more of the country becomes secure and open to agriculture and rural development. Most of the additional aid needs to go into constructing an adequate rural road network, providing electric power to the 94 percent of Afghans still without it and giving farmers the seasonal credit, technical assistance and market outlets needed to break the economic grip of the opium traffickers and to promote alternative crops and livelihoods. Some should also be directed into strengthening local government. 
 Americans can be proud of their role in helping to drive the tyrannical and hateful Taliban from power and giving Afghans the chance to make a new democratic start. But those gains are fragile. An additional $1 billion to $2 billion a year, invested wisely, could substantially reinforce the initial progress.

HEADLINE: 100-M.P.H. Winds Crumple Sugar Cane, a Staple of Florida Economy 

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER and ABBY GOODNOUGH; Joseph B. Treaster reported from South Bay for this article and Abby Goodnough from Miami.

DATELINE: SOUTH BAY, Fla., Oct. 27 

 BODY:
The green fields of sugar cane stretched to the horizon here on the southern edge of Lake Okeechobee. Normally the stalks rise ramrod straight, like battalions of soldiers in orderly ranks.
 But after being beaten for hours by winds of more than 100 miles an hour from Hurricane Wilma, the columns of cane bent forward in defeat on Thursday, some nearly flat against the rich black soil of the Everglades, others tangled and twisted in sad bunches.
 ''This is going to have a huge economic impact, not only on growers, but on workers living paycheck to paycheck,'' said Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida, as he visited the emergency operations center in nearby Clewiston and a shelter for storm victims. 
 Sugar cane is one of the most important crops in the state, and agriculture vies with tourism as the main engine in Florida's economy, which is valued at $50 billion annually. 
 The losses in the region are going to run into the tens of millions if not billions of dollars, government officials and business people said. They will be among the most severe consequences of a hurricane that swept the southern portion of Florida on Monday and left the state in logistical knots days later.
 More than two million homes and businesses were without electricity on Thursday, down from the peak of nearly four million. After getting off to a rough start, the distribution of basic supplies like ice, water and emergency meals was more organized. But vast lines for gasoline could still be seen in the three largest counties in the state, Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach. 
 Government officials said that restoring power to gas stations was a top priority now that most hospitals had electricity. Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, the arrival point for most of the region's fuel, reopened to tankers on Thursday, and four pulled in. But fewer trucks than usual took the gas out to service stations because many stations remained closed. 
 Steve Gordon, a diesel mechanic born in Jamaica, said he waited in line for gas in Fort Lauderdale for four and a half hours early Thursday. ''I only got five gallons; that was the limit,'' Mr. Gordon said. So after driving to a livestock farm here on the edge of Lake Okeechobee to buy a goat to serve after his nephew's funeral, he headed for a gas station. Only a few were open, but the lines were much shorter, and Mr. Gordon hoped to fill his tank. 
 President Bush visited the region in the afternoon, surveying the damage from a helicopter and stopping by a Baptist church in Pompano Beach that was feeding storm victims. Joined by his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, the president tried to pacify the angry legions lacking electricity, potable water and gas.
 ''Things don't happen instantly, but they are happening,'' President Bush said. ''People are getting fed. Soon more and more houses will have electricity. Their lives will get back to normal.''
 In South Bay, population 4,500, and nearby Clewiston, population 15,000, some hardware and grocery stores opened Thursday and several filling stations were selling gas. During the night, the first government food supplies reached Clewiston. On Thursday morning, more than 100 cars lined up for water, ice and boxes of chicken stew and barbecued beef.
 Lolita Williams, 42, inched toward the food and water in a tan Pontiac with three other women and two small children. ''I'm hungry till my head hurts,'' Ms. Williams said.
 The area, heavily populated by migrant workers from Mexico, Jamaica and Haiti, is already one of the poorest in the state. Most fieldworkers have lost nearly a week's pay.
 Nestor Betancos, who drives sugar cane workers to their fields in a bus, said his bosses had told him, ''We ain't going to be able to work for two weeks to two months.''
 ''The cane is all lying down,'' he said. ''And the mills have been damaged, too.''
 In addition to sugar, oranges, ornamental plants and vegetables like lettuce, peppers and corn are grown in this area. Many of the vegetables are sold in New York. 
 On Thursday afternoon, Bobby Tony Smith, the city manager of South Bay, paused in a sport utility vehicle west of town as a soldier with an M-16 rifle and three town employees distributed water and food to homes along a main road. Looking out at the damaged cane fields, Mr. Smith said he could not say how many millions of dollars the losses would be. But, he said, ''The windshield view suggests mass devastation to the crops.'' 
 Rick Henderson, the president of Henderson's Sani Service Systems, which provides portable toilets for fieldworkers, said, ''The farmers lost probably 80 percent of their crop.'' 
 ''I imagine this is going to kill our business,'' said Mr. Henderson, who has lived in the area all his life. ''When the farmers get hit, it has a domino effect on the whole area.''

Cuba Accepts U.S. Aid
 WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 (Reuters) -- Cuba, the longtime American foe whose own offer of help was snubbed by Washington after Hurricane Katrina, has for the first time ''in memory'' accepted American disaster aid, the State Department said Thursday. A State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said a three-member American assessment team was on standby to go to Cuba to see what was needed after flooding from the storm.

HEADLINE: Bernanke And The Bubble

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
By Bush administration standards, the choice of Ben Bernanke to succeed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve was just weird.
 For one thing, Mr. Bernanke is actually an expert in monetary policy, as opposed to, say, Arabian horses.
Beyond that, Mr. Bernanke's partisanship, if it exists, is so low-key that his co-author on a textbook didn't know he was a registered Republican. The academic work on which his professional reputation rests is apolitical. Moreover, that work is all about how the Fed can influence demand -- there's not a hint in his work of support for the right-wing supply-side doctrine. 
 Nor is he a laissez-faire purist who believes that government governs best when it governs least. On the contrary, he's a policy activist who advocates aggressive government moves to jump-start stalled economies. 
 For example, a few years back Mr. Bernanke called on Japan to show ''Rooseveltian resolve'' in fighting its long slump. He even supported a proposal by yours truly that the Bank of Japan try to get Japan's economy moving by, among other things, announcing its intention to push inflation up to 3 or 4 percent per year.
 Last but not least, Mr. Bernanke has no personal ties to the Bush family. It's hard to imagine him doing something indictable to support his masters. It's even hard to imagine him doing what Mr. Greenspan did: throwing his prestige as Fed chairman behind irresponsible tax cuts.
 All of this raises a frightening prospect. Has President Bush been so damaged by scandals and public disapproval that he has no choice but to appoint qualified, principled people to important positions?
 O.K., seriously, many economists and investors feared that Mr. Bush would try to place a highly partisan figure in charge of the Fed. And even before the revelations surfaced about cronyism at FEMA and elsewhere, there was widespread concern that Mr. Bush would try to select a John Snow type -- a businessman whose only qualification is loyalty -- to run monetary policy. The naming of Mr. Bernanke was a sign of Mr. Bush's weakness, and it brought a collective sigh of relief.
 Obviously I'm pleased, too. Full disclosure: Mr. Bernanke was chairman of the Princeton economics department before moving to Washington, and he made the job offer that brought me to Princeton.
 So should we all feel confident about the economic future, assuming that Mr. Bernanke is confirmed? Alas, no.
 This isn't a comment on Mr. Bernanke's qualifications, although there is one talent, important in a Fed chairman, that Mr. Bernanke has yet to demonstrate (though he may have it). Mr. Greenspan, for all his flaws, has repeatedly shown his ability to divine from fragmentary and sometimes contradictory data which way the economic wind is blowing. As an academic, Mr. Bernanke never had the occasion to make that kind of judgment. We'll just have to see whether he can develop an economic weather sense on the job.
 No, my main concern is that the economy may well face a day of reckoning soon after Mr. Bernanke takes office. And while he is surely the best politically possible man for the job (all the other candidates I would have been happy with are independents or Democrats), coping with that day of reckoning without some nasty shocks may be beyond anyone's talents. 
 The fact is that the U.S. economy's growth over the past few years has depended on two unsustainable trends: a huge surge in house prices and a vast inflow of funds from Asia. Sooner or later, both trends will end, possibly abruptly.
 It's true that Mr. Bernanke has given speeches suggesting both that a ''global savings glut'' will continue to provide the United States with lots of capital inflows, and that housing prices don't reflect a bubble. Well, soothing words are expected from a Fed chairman. He must know that he may be wrong.
 If he is, the U.S. economy will find itself in need of the ''Rooseveltian resolve'' Mr. Bernanke advocated for Japan. We can safely predict that Mr. Bernanke will show that resolve. In fact, Bill Gross of the giant bond fund Pimco has already predicted that next year Mr. Bernanke will start cutting interest rates.
 But that may not be enough. When all is said and done, the Fed controls only one thing: the short-term interest rate. And it will be a long time before we have competent, public-spirited people controlling taxes, spending and other instruments of economic policy.

PERSON: Richard Errett Smalley 

HEADLINE: Richard E. Smalley, 62, Dies; Chemistry Nobel Winner

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Richard E. Smalley, the Rice University chemistry professor who shared a Nobel Prize for discovering a new spherical form of carbon and championed the potential of nanotechnology to create a more sustainable economy, died Friday at 62 at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
 The cause was leukemia, a spokesman for Rice said. 
 Dr. Smalley, a short, trim man with a fringe of beard and a wry sense of humor, used his renown as a platform to evangelize for increased investment in educating a new generation of scientists and engineers. He also spoke ceaselessly to conferences and business executives about how nanotechnology with its rapidly expanding capacity to reshape materials at the molecular level could transform the economy and address both environmental and energy challenges.
 ''He's like a rock star in technology circles,'' said Robert Gower, chief executive and co-founder with Dr. Smalley of Carbon Nanotechnologies, a company set up to commercialize Dr. Smalley's discoveries, in a 2003 interview.
 Dr. Smalley's scientific breakthrough, which was shared with Harold W. Kroto of the University of Sussex in England and Robert F. Curl Jr., a colleague at Rice, stemmed from Dr. Kroto's efforts to understand the composition of carbon-rich stars. Dr. Kroto arrived at Dr. Smalley's laboratory at Rice in 1985 to set up experiments vaporizing graphite with lasers. 
 As the scientists analyzed the results, they encountered a large number of exceptionally stable carbon molecules with 60 atoms. They puzzled over the shape until Dr. Smalley, building models in his kitchen out of paper, figured out that the atoms must be arranged as a soccer ball-like mix of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. Because the shape reminded him of the geodesic dome invented by Buckminster Fuller, he called the molecule a ''buckminsterfullerene.'' 
 The novel molecule, the most spherical ever discovered, was nicknamed the buckyball. The appearance of a new form of carbon in a world that had only known graphite and diamond thrilled chemists and ignited a worldwide race to understand its traits. The fullerene family eventually grew to embrace cylindrical tubes known as carbon nanotubes and numerous variants.
 Depending on their structure, the fullerenes exhibit a variety of eye-opening electrical, chemical and strength characteristics. Buckyballs, in particular, fascinated materials scientists for their lubricating potential -- being round they were ideally formed to slide past other materials -- and the possibility that they could serve as cages for storing or transporting other chemicals. 
 In time, the nanotubes, which were discovered by researchers at NEC in Japan in 1991, emerged as the more promising form of fullerene for most commercial applications. But many researchers date the dawn of modern nanotechnology to the excitement ignited by the buckyballs, for which Drs. Kroto, Curl and Smalley shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
 Nanotechnology derives its name from the nanometer, which is a billionth of a meter and the size of a small molecule. Researchers have discovered that not just carbon but numerous other materials have novel and potentially valuable traits when formed with dimensions of under 100 nanometers. 
 Dr. Smalley was as excited by the commercial potential of nanotechnology as the science. In 2000, he helped -found Carbon Nanotechnologies and became its chairman.
 He also became an outspoken advocate for the National Nanotechnology Initiative, a government-financed research program founded under President Bill Clinton and expanded into a multibillion-dollar investment under President Bush.
 Dr. Smalley was particularly interested in the possibility that carbon nanotubes could one day be woven into long transmission wires that would be far lighter, stronger and more efficient than today's electrical grid. He also saw nanotechnology as the key to producing solar and other renewable energy sources that could replace fossil fuels.
 ''You are about to be in the center of the world,'' he told scientists at the National Renewable Energy Laboratories in Golden, Colo., in a lecture in 2003 outlining the population and resource pressures the world would face as fossil-fuel reserves declined and energy demands rose. ''Clean water is a great example of something that depends on energy. And if you solve the water problem, you solve the food problem.'' 
 Richard Errett Smalley was born on June 6, 1943, in Akron, Ohio, the son of Frank D. Smalley Jr. and Esther Rhoades. He was the fourth and youngest child in the family, which soon moved to Kansas City, Mo. He was an indifferent student until he found himself competing in a chemistry class with his sister Linda shortly after the launching of Sputnik focused the nation's attention on science. 
 ''Before that, I went to bed at night praying for a thermonuclear war so I wouldn't have to turn in my homework,'' Dr. Smalley said in 2003.
 He entered Hope College in Holland, Mich., but transferred to the University of Michigan after two years to complete his undergraduate work. After four years as a research chemist for Shell Oil, he entered Princeton, where he earned a Ph.D. for pioneering work developing high-speed laser systems to study the behavior of individual molecules. 
 After three years of postdoctoral research at the University of Chicago, he moved to Rice in 1976. Although he was mainly known as a chemist, he was given the additional position of professor of physics in 1990.
 Dr. Smalley is survived by his fourth wife, the former Deborah Sheffield; a son, Chad, of Houston, from his first marriage to the former Judith G. Sampieri; another son, Preston, of Houston, from his third marriage, to the former JoNell M. Chauvin; a brother, Clayton; two sisters, Linda and Mary Jill; two stepdaughters, Eva and Allison; and one grandchild.
 Dr. Smalley liked to call Preston his true Nobel Prize because he believed the child was conceived in Stockholm when he received his prize.

HEADLINE: China Allows Yuan To Pass Key Point 

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
Beijing authorities permitted China's currency to inch past a psychologically important benchmark in trading on Friday, but the move only underlined their reluctance to tolerate anything more than very gradual currency appreciation against the dollar. 
 The yuan crept up to 8.084 to the dollar on Friday, for a total increase of just 0.32 percent over the 14 weeks since China revalued its currency on July 21. The move was crucial because at the time of the revaluation, Chinese authorities said they would not permit the yuan to rise or fall more than 0.3 percent against the dollar in a single day.
The pace is so slow that, like the 2.1 percent revaluation in July, it has satisfied few critics. Many want to see an appreciation of 15 percent to 40 percent, given the large, widening American trade deficit with China. 
 ''Neither movement is going to have any appreciable effect on the relative prices of U.S. and Chinese goods,'' said Alan Tonelson, a research fellow at the United States Business and Industry Council.
 The move Friday may have been linked to remarks from Chinese officials hinting at greater appreciation in the yuan. 
 Economists and currency strategists said the decision to let the yuan finally breach 0.3 percent proved that China was not using the daily trading limit as a long-term limit on the yuan.

HEADLINE: Delta to Close Song, Its Low-Fare Airline

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
Wave buh-bye to Song, the low-fare airline.
 Delta Air Lines said yesterday that it would discontinue Song, which it started two years ago to battle low-fare competition to leisure markets in Florida and California.
The airline, which featured lime-green planes, apple martinis and flight attendant uniforms designed by Kate Spade, will be folded into Delta's domestic operations starting next May, Delta said in a statement from its Atlanta headquarters. 
 The move comes six weeks after Delta filed for bankruptcy protection, and 31 months after Song made its first flights in April 2003.
 Delta's chief executive, Gerald Grinstein, who came on board in 2004 and whose skepticism over the Song concept once led him to joke that the airline should have been called Swan Song, said yesterday that he regretted the quip but not the experiment. 
 ''It was a great learning experience,'' Mr. Grinstein said in an interview yesterday, ''and it gave us the chance to test ideas and to bring them over.''
 He went on: ''We want to apply not only the specific pieces, but the style in the approach, the creativity and the innovation'' to the rest of Delta. 
 To do that, Delta said it planned to turn Song's 48 Boeing 757 planes, which offer one class of service, into two-class airplanes, with first-class and coach seats. The planes will initially be flown on its transcontinental routes, starting next fall. 
 Delta also said it would convert another 50 planes to two-class service within the next two years.
 Song becomes the latest failure in a long string of airlines-within-an-airline, founded by big carriers to compete with the likes of Southwest, JetBlue and AirTran, which have stolen passengers in the last 15 years by offering consistently low fares. 
 In fact, Delta had tried to compete in Florida with an airline called Delta Express, which was founded in 1996 and faded away a few years later. With Song gone, the only separate low-fare brand run by a major airline will be Ted, operated by United. 
 ''Song wasn't a ticket to disaster,'' Mr. Grinstein said yesterday, ''but the track record is not good'' for airlines-within-an-airline. While Delta could test the idea again in the future, ''with our economic situation, we just couldn't continue it,'' he said of Song.
 For Delta, Song was a counterattack on JetBlue, which began flights from New York to Florida in 2000, siphoning off passengers on what had been one of Delta's most lucrative markets. Delta fought back, but JetBlue boasts sharply lower costs than Delta, which is striving to slice labor rates under bankruptcy.
 Despite its splashy approach, Song's financial success was always questionable. Mr. Grinstein and other Delta executives declined to say yesterday whether the airline was ever profitable.
 But James M. Whitehurst, Delta's chief operating officer, said the cost of running the main Delta brand and Song was ''very expensive.'' 
 Paul G. Matsen, Delta's chief marketing officer, added that the airline had to be careful not to overlap the operations of Delta and Song, especially in cities like New York and Los Angeles, which both airlines served.
 And with the former Song planes being outfitted with 26 first-class seats, Delta can potentially make more money than it did on Song flights. 
 Those first-class seats also mean that business travelers and other well-heeled passengers can book premium service from overseas to their ultimate destination in the United States, instead of dealing with one-class service on part of their flight.
 Mr. Grinstein said Song's president, Joanne Smith, had been named Delta's vice president for consumer marketing, effective immediately.
 Ms. Smith said yesterday that she ''absolutely'' would bring some trendy aspects of Song to Delta flights -- those features have included drinks designed by the celebrity bar owner Rande Gerber and snacks from Dylan's Candy Bar in Manhattan.
 Ultimately, Ms. Smith said her goal was to use Song's teachings to make Delta more contemporary -- what she called ''a current classic.''

HEADLINE: With That Longer Life Expectancy Expect a Life of Working Longer 

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
MAKE the old people work longer. 
 That, in a nutshell, is the strategy increasingly being chosen by industrialized countries as they confront a future where people live longer -- and thus collect more retirement checks -- but where there are fewer young workers to help finance those checks.
 ''Longer workinglives must be encouraged,'' said Bruno Tobback, the Belgian pension minister, at the conclusion of a meeting of employment ministers from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development this month in Brussels. 
 ''If nothing is done,'' Mr. Tobback added, by 2050 there will be only one active worker for every retiree in many European countries, ''putting pensions and national prosperity at risk.''
 Only 43 percent of Italians in their late 50's are in the labor force, and that figure is below 20 percent for those in their early 60's. The Germans and French are much more likely to work through their 50's, but unlikely to stay employed in their 60's.
 And people live longer. In 1970, the average French male worker could expect to collect a pension for nearly 11 years. Now the figure is 21 years. Italy has passed legislation to gradually increase the retirement age, but it will not take full effect until after 2030, and the O.E.C.D. says longer life expectancy may mean the change will produce no savings.
 There are major differences among countries. Asians tend to work the longest, which may be crucial in the future, because the estimate is that by 2050 more than a third of the population of Japan and South Korea will be over 65. Americans work longer than most Europeans and do not face as severe a burden from a population growing older.
 Figuring out why some people work in later years and others do not can be complex, reflecting relative wealth and national laws that may or may not bar age discrimination and that may penalize workers who want to keep working past retirement age. The generosity of retirement, disability and unemployment plans also plays a role, and efforts have been made to tighten those plans.
 In some countries, the O.E.C.D. said, laws aimed at preserving jobs have contributed to older workers' losing their positions, because employers who could not fire younger workers could force older ones to retire. In practice, that led some older workers to take lesser-paying jobs, sometimes with the same company. Workers aged 60 to 64 in Japan and South Korea make about two-thirds as much as workers aged 45 to 49. Workers in Europe are less likely to stay employed in their 60's, but those who keep jobs seem to be better paid than younger workers.
 Official unemployment rates for elderly workers tend to be fairly low, as many are officially out of the labor force, deemed to be retired or disabled. But in many countries those who are counted as unemployed seldom find jobs. In France, Germany and Italy, more than 60 percent of the unemployed aged 60 to 64 have been out of work more than a year. Some of that may reflect systems that make it easy to collect benefits without looking for work, and European countries have begun to change those laws.
 No doubt many younger workers would be quite happy to retire in their 50's, as their parents have done in some countries. But the fiscal realities facing governments are putting powerful pressures on them to change the system and keep those people working.

HEADLINE: Economic Growth Accelerated in 3rd Quarter

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The economy grew at a faster pace in the third quarter, the government reported yesterday, as stronger consumer and government spending helped offset the effects of two devastating hurricanes and soaring energy prices.
 The nation's gross domestic product rose at an annual pace of 3.8 percent from July to September, up from 3.3 percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said.
Economists had expected a 3.6 percent growth rate, according to a survey by Bloomberg News, in part because they thought Hurricanes Katrina and Rita would take a greater toll than they appear to have. 
 ''This shows tremendous economic resilience, the fact that we can get a 3.8 percent growth rate with the issues that unfolded in the latter stages of the quarter,'' said Michael Strauss, chief economist at Commonfund, which manages money for colleges and nonprofit institutions. 
 The stock market rallied after the report: the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 19.51 points, or 1.65 percent, to 1,198.41.
 This strong growth is expected to give Federal Reserve policy makers yet another reason to raise their benchmark short-term interest rate, now at 3.75 percent, when they meet Tuesday.
 The first estimate of quarterly G.D.P. is based on incomplete data and it is revised as more information is collected; the government will release a more comprehensive estimate on Nov. 30.
 Personal consumption was up 3.9 percent and contributed 2.73 percentage points of the growth rate. Auto purchases contributed 0.62 percentage points, and furniture and household equipment purchases added 0.35 points.
 John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary, called the economy's performance ''truly outstanding'' and claimed credit for the Bush administration. ''There can be no doubt that the American economy is an adaptive and resilient marvel, and one that has benefited greatly from good fiscal policies,'' he said in a statement. ''The strong and steady G.D.P. growth we've been experiencing is the result of lower tax rates, sound monetary policy set by the Federal Reserve and the economy's underlying fundamentals.''
 But critics noted that the administration's economic record was not universally rosy.
 Growth in personal disposable income slowed to 2.8 percent from 4.9 percent. Adjusted for inflation, disposable income fell 0.9 percent after increasing 1.5 percent in the second quarter. Some of the decline was attributable to lost rental and business income on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico after Katrina and Rita lashed the region. The personal saving rate fell to minus 1.1 percent, from 0.1 percent.
 In another report released yesterday, the Labor Department said that the employment cost index, which is composed of wages, salaries and benefits, rose 0.8 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter. Adjusted for inflation, however, the index was down 1.5 percent from September 2004, with the wages and salary portion dropping 2.3 percent.
 ''With stagnant hourly wages, the only way for working families to get ahead is by working more hours,'' Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, wrote in a note, adding that that is ''certainly not the path to improving living standards that we'd expect in an economy posting strong productivity gains.''
 The University of Michigan reported yesterday that its consumer confidence index fell to 74.2 this month from 76.9 in September, which was sharply down from August. An earlier reading of the index showed confidence falling to 75.4 in October.
 Inflation measured by prices for domestic purchases rose 4 percent, up from 3.3 percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported. Excluding food and energy, prices climbed 2.2 percent from 2.1 percent.
 Retail gasoline prices soared past $3 a gallon after the hurricanes in September and appear to have sapped consumer spending a bit that month, economists said. And heating bills are expected to be 30 percent to 48 percent higher this winter than last year.
 ''The negative impact associated with the energy shock will be more evident in the fourth quarter even though it hit in September,'' said David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley.
 Mr. Greenlaw said recent surveys showed that manufacturing and other business activity had picked up and could make up for some of the slower consumer demand expected in the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: Battle Erupts Over Plan To Take Bar For Ball Field 

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
The rear of the building that houses the Golden Cicada Tavern here is hard up against the end line and the goal post of the St. Peter's Preparatory School practice football field. So when the school sought to expand its field in 1999 to meet state regulations and the city agreed to help, the building was included in a redevelopment plan that called for it to be seized by the city through the power of eminent domain.
 With that action Jersey City ignited a two-front legal battle that will begin to unfold in state court next week. The plan -- to add seven yards to the field -- has raised questions about whether the seizure of private property to benefit another private interest is in the public interest. And because the beneficiary would be a parochial school, the case has also raised the question of whether a religious institution would be benefiting unconstitutionally from government action financed by tax dollars. 
 For the tavern owner, Cheng Tan, the experience has been an education in the ins and outs of the laws of eminent domain and redevelopment. He said that he had long planned to redevelop the corner parcel now occupied by his one-story brick bar, which includes a rear apartment, where he lives, and two garages.
 ''I think they knew I was going to redevelop it, and so they did this,'' said Mr. Tan, who went to court to challenge the city's effort to condemn his property and pay him $550,000 for it. The case is scheduled to be heard in Superior Court in Hudson County next Friday. 
 For some in the city, including the Rev. James Keenan, the president of St. Peter's Preparatory School, the case is an example of a person facing condemnation trying to force up the price. ''I think most would agree that he is trying to get a higher price,'' Father Keenan said.
 Last June the United States Supreme Court upheld the city transfer of homes in New London, Conn., to a private developer for what the city considered economic development in the public interest. Generally, transfers facilitated by public agencies from one private entity to another were frowned on, the court said, unless the public interest was firmly established. Economic development, the justices said, was a compelling enough public purpose in that case.
 The ruling set off indignation among property rights advocates and led to movements to amend eminent domain laws in other states, including New Jersey. Legislation that would limit some local powers of eminent domain, increase compensation for owners of condemned properties and increase the number of public hearings required to complete a redevelopment plan are now pending in Trenton. Both candidates for governor have promised to appoint a commission to study the state's eminent domain laws.
 Edward Barocas, the director of the New Jersey office of the American Civil Liberties Union, which with the Rutgers Constitutional Litigation Clinic is representing Mr. Tan, said that he would argue next week in court that the taking of Mr. Tan's tavern specifically to benefit another private owner was not in the public interest and therefore ran afoul of last summer's high court ruling.
 ''We will argue that they did this in their redevelopment plan to specifically benefit St. Peter's Prep and that was the first improper use of government authority,'' said Mr. Barocas. ''But it was all the more illegal to give the property to a religious institution because it violates the U.S. Constitution, which protects us from the use of taxpayer money to aid a particular religious institution.''

HEADLINE: One Giant's Struggle Is Corporate America's, Too

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
Back in the spring, amid relentless criticism that Wal-Mart Stores was failing to provide affordable health care to employees, executives at the company decided to take a detailed look at its benefits. 
 Wal-Mart knew its health costs were spiraling upward out of control, said M. Susan Chambers, the senior executive who led the initiative, but it was surprised to discover that its critics had a point. Almost half of the children of employees were covered only by government social-service programs like Medicaid or had no insurance at all.
An internal memo to the Wal-Mart board by Ms. Chambers and her colleagues, which became public this week, candidly assessed this finding and proposed steps the company might take to address it -- or at least blunt some of the criticisms it had been encountering. 
 While Ms. Chambers was quick to emphasize in an interview that Wal-Mart was not the only company with employees who use Medicaid, she said she was startled to find out just how reliant working people have become on government health programs. ''It certainly did bring out for me the magnitude of the national problem,'' she said. 
 As the nation's largest employer, Wal-Mart cannot help but be entangled in the increasingly contentious debate over how best to provide health care to working Americans. Many of the company's 1.3 million employees are drawn from the most vulnerable part of the national labor pool: people who can find only low-paying jobs, who frequently cannot afford health coverage and who have no ability to absorb the kind of bank-breaking inflation in medical costs the country has experienced since the late 1990's. 
 For various social and economic reasons -- including limited access to preventive medical care -- low-income workers and their families often have the greatest health care needs, with the least ability to meet them. The Wal-Mart quandary involves a fundamental national issue: Who, if anyone, should provide care to the bulk of Americans. 
 ''Whose responsibility is this?'' said Carolyn Watts, a health professor at the University of Washington. ''Is it the government's responsibility or the employer's?'' 
 As health care costs continue to soar well above the general rate of inflation, Professor Watts says the United States can no longer rely on employers to provide widespread coverage and needs to grapple with that new reality. ''It's a very different social contract than we have had,'' she said. 
 The controversy over Wal-Mart's benefits may mask what some experts see as an unraveling of the employer-based system of health coverage. ''These are indications of the gaps in the health care system that are exposed by Wal-Mart,'' said Len Nichols, a health economist at the New America Foundation, an independent public policy group in Washington. ''You can't blame Wal-Mart.''
 The Chambers memo offers an unusually frank and, at times, disturbing glimpse into Wal-Mart's struggle to achieve what are seemingly contradictory goals: to contain health care costs and to appease its critics. Even as Wal-Mart's health care bill, now $1.5 billion, has climbed 19 percent a year since 2002, it is insuring fewer than half of its employees.
 While the memo outlines a series of fairly simple steps to expand coverage -- at an additional cost of some $300 million a year by 2011 -- it also recommends a wide-ranging set of initiatives to control costs, including one controversial proposal aimed at recruiting what the memo describes as ''a healthier, more productive work force.''
 Perhaps the most unflattering element is the statistic that nearly half of the children of Wal-Mart employees are uninsured or on Medicaid, the federal and state insurance program for the poor. For the nation's overall labor force, that portion is one-third, according to Wal-Mart. 
 But Wal-Mart is not alone in teetering on a tightrope between protecting profits and doing right by employees, a balancing act that is occurring throughout corporate America. Those facing similar situations include General Motors, which has long been seen as the gold standard for health benefits but is now scaling back. Another is Starbucks, which cited the cost of its widely admired health benefits last year when it raised prices. And while Wal-Mart's discounter rival, Costco Wholesale, has taken a strikingly more generous approach to health care, it has come at the cost of rebukes from Wall Street.
 ''The underlying problem is the problem of affordability of health care in the United States,'' said Helen Darling, the president of the National Business Group on Health, a coalition of companies. Wal-Mart's critics, who include some state officials, say companies like it are shirking their duty and asking the taxpayers to pay the cost of their workers' care.
 In Maryland this year, legislators passed a bill aimed at large employers like Wal-Mart that would force them to insure more of their employees. After intense lobbying by Wal-Mart and other opponents, Maryland's governor vetoed the bill. A similar proposal was narrowly defeated by California voters last year. 
 What the Wal-Mart memo does make clear is that the company's health care costs are increasing at a faster rate than its revenues, and they threaten to engulf an increasing share of future profits. Many companies are reducing their own exposure by shifting an increasing share of the costs onto employees, asking them to pay more in premiums or to foot more of the bill at every doctor visit.
 But Wal-Mart -- and many other companies with similar work forces -- does not have that luxury. Nearly 40 percent of its employees already spend an average of 16 percent or more of their pay on health care -- a level about four times the national average.
 The Wal-Mart work force reflects a growing fear of many employers that the people who work for them are increasingly at risk for health problems. Many of Wal-Mart's employees are obese, the company says, and a result is rapidly rising numbers of cases of diabetes or heart disease. The prevalence of these diseases among Wal-Mart employees is increasing much faster than the national average, it says.
 ''The low-income population generally is not as healthy and does not engage as much in preventive care,'' said Diane Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. A risk that a company like Wal-Mart faces, especially when it competes with smaller retailers that offer no insurance at all, Ms. Rowland said, is attracting too many workers who want the job primarily for the health coverage. 
 Among the starkest -- critics would say Darwinian -- solutions the Wal-Mart memo explores is the idea of not hiring as many people who have health problems or risks. The memo suggests that the company could require all jobs to include some component of physical activity, like making cashiers gather shopping carts. It also recommends redesigning and expanding benefits to appeal to a different type of worker, someone more interested in buying a home, say, than in getting health insurance. 
 ''These moves would also dissuade unhealthy people from coming to work at Wal-Mart,'' the memo said. The company also says a push toward more part-time workers -- many of whom would either not be eligible for, or could not afford, whatever new health plan Wal-Mart might devise -- will also lead to fewer people's needing coverage.
 Lawyers and consultants said the company could run afoul of laws that prevent companies from discriminating against older workers or those with health issues. 
 A federal jury this year found that Wal-Mart was guilty of discriminating against an employee with cerebral palsy by reassigning him to a job where he had to collect garbage and shopping carts. The jury awarded him $7.5 million, although the amount was reduced to about $2.8 million, said the employee's lawyer, Douglas H. Wigdor. The company is currently operating under a consent decree by federal regulators because of similar behavior toward other employees, Mr. Wigdor said.
 Ms. Chambers said the memo did not reflect any intention of discouraging people with medical problems from joining Wal-Mart but, rather, a concern about the lifestyle choices and health of its employees. She said the steps were meant to encourage people to be more active. ''Does that mean we are not going to hire unhealthy people?'' she said. ''No.'' 
 The other initiatives represent a smattering of programs already embraced by other companies, like disease-management programs in which people with a specific illness are helped to take better care of themselves. Another step would be urging employees to go to doctors that provide good care at a reasonable cost. 
 Policy analysts say such measures offer no quick cure for the country's ills or anything that has a hint of real reform. One recommendation even harks back to the days of company doctors by suggesting that Wal-Mart consider expanding the customer health clinics available at a few of its stores to provide care for employees. 
 The company has already opened four of these customer clinics, which it said appeared to be a popular alternative for people who are uninsured and must pay out of pocket. Prices are clearly marked, and the company says the clinics are an affordable way for people to check out minor ailments like a sore throat or to have their blood sugar checked. 
 Most striking, perhaps, is that the many initiatives outlined by the memo would seem to accomplish so little financially -- bringing down projected health costs from 2.3 percent of sales to something closer to 2 percent. Embracing even the most far-reaching suggestions, like recruiting healthier workers, might drive overall benefit costs to a level only a shade under 2 percent.
 ''As clever and strategic as it is,'' said Mr. Nichols, the economist, Wal-Mart's strategy ''is not a solution to our long-term problem.'' 
 But Ms. Chambers said Wal-Mart realized that the current initiatives being discussed by corporate America only scratched the surface and that the company wanted to be part of any national dialogue about health care. ''I feel,'' she said, ''like we're dealing with symptoms -- not causes.''

HEADLINE: At End of Erratic Week, the Biggest Rally Since April 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks rallied sharply yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 172 points on better-than-expected gross domestic product growth last quarter despite the disruptions caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The major gauges finished an erratic week higher.
 The upswing in economic activity for the third quarter soothed a market anxious for signs of the economy's health amid fears of a downturn. The gross domestic product figure also overshadowed a drop in consumer confidence and a weak forecast from Chevron. 
 ''It basically drove home the point that the economy was healthy before the hurricanes and indeed may have remained healthy afterward as well,'' said Doug Porter, a senior economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns, who noted gains in spending and business investment among increases in nearly every gross domestic product component in the Commerce Department's report.
 The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 172.82 points, or 1.7 percent, to 10,402.77, its biggest one-day gain since April 21. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 19.51 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,198.41, and the Nasdaq composite index climbed 26.07 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,089.88.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gained 11.30 points, or 1.8 percent, to 635.33. 
 Wall Street closed out a week of volatile trading as investors juggled mixed earnings reports and renewed worries on interest rates after the nomination of the top White House economist, Ben S. Bernanke, as the next Federal Reserve chairman.
 Mr. Bernanke, who would succeed Alan Greenspan in January if approved, is largely expected to keep to the Fed's strategy of clamping down on inflation by slowly lifting interest rates and curbing demand. But with oil and gas prices now retreating from record levels, many fear the Fed may go overboard and send the economy sliding.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrials added 1.84 percent, the S.& P. 500 rose 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq finished 0.37 percent higher.
 All three are down so far this year. The Dow Jones industrials is 3.53 percent lower in 2005, the S.& P. 500 has declined 1.1 percent and the Nasdaq has lost 3.9 percent.
 The Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 composite index -- a free-float weighted index that measures 5,000 United States-based companies -- ended the week at 11,947.36, up 154.79 points from last week. A year ago, the index was 11,049.24.
 The positive gross domestic product report gave investors a brighter economic picture. The Commerce Department said the economy grew 3.8 percent in the third quarter, besting economists' forecast for a 3.6 percent gain and the 3.3 percent advance for the April-June period.
 That growth helped the market look past weakening consumer confidence after the University of Michigan reported its consumer sentiment index for October sank 1.2 points, to 74.2; most forecasts had put the number at 76.
 Mike Viracola, managing director at Adams Harkness, also attributed this week's volatility to stock-specific moves as traders used earnings data as catalysts to increase returns before the end of the year.
 ''I don't think investors are getting that much from the individual earnings reports'' that would cause them to switch gears in their long-term positions, he said.
 Chevron's earnings grew 12 percent last quarter, but the company estimated it lost more than $600 million from the hurricanes and other storms. The company also warned the storm effects will have an even larger impact on fourth-quarter results. Chevron nonetheless rose 88 cents, to $57.38.
 Microsoft said late Thursday that quarterly profit climbed 24 percent on stronger demand for software that runs PC's and corporate servers, but video-game sales declined and the company issued a slightly weaker full-year earnings forecast. Still, Microsoft added 68 cents, to $25.53.
 Bristol-Myers Squibb reported 27 percent profit growth last quarter, largely from selling its United States and Canadian nonprescription medicines business. But shares fell 53 cents, to $21.14, after the company said its adjusted earnings missed Wall Street targets and it lowered its full-year outlook.
 As part of its bankruptcy reorganization, Delta Air Lines announced plans to close its discount carrier Song, which was created to compete with low-cost rivals like JetBlue Airways and AirTran Airways. The news lifted JetBlue 76 cents, to $18.05, and AirTran Holdings added 19 cents, to $14.40.
 Oil traded in a narrow range amid concerns that the recovering Gulf Coast operations will struggle with heating oil demand as winter approaches. A barrel of light crude rose 13 cents, to settle at $61.22.
 Bonds declined as stocks rose yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note fell 4/32, to a price of 97 17/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.56 percent from 4.55 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: New Offer By Europe On Trade Is Assailed 

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY and EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Dan Bilefsky of The International Herald Tribune reported from Brussels for this article and Edmund L. Andrews from Washington. Graham Bowley of The International Herald Tribune contributed reporting from Brussels.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
The European Union on Friday made what it called its most sweeping offer yet to cut its agricultural tariffs in an effort to prevent the collapse of global trade talks.
 But the proposal came under immediate attack from all directions: from the United States and Brazil for being inadequate and from France for going too far.
 With only seven weeks left before a crucial meeting of trade ministers in the so-called Doha round of global trade talks in Hong Kong, the impasse over agriculture threatened to sink a much broader global deal to open markets in services, pharmaceuticals and manufacturing. 
 The agriculture negotiations are crucial because large developing countries have insisted that they will not talk about issues like services unless the United States and Europe agree to open their farm markets.
 This month, the United States proposed that wealthy nations sharply reduce their farm tariffs -- by 55 percent for the lowest tariffs and 90 percent for the highest.
 On Friday, after weeks of stalling, Europe's chief trade negotiator responded with what he called his ''bottom line.'' 
 Peter Mandelson, the European Commission's trade negotiator, said Europe was prepared to cut the bloc's highest farm tariffs by 60 percent and reduce the average farm tariff by nearly half, to 12 percent from about 23 percent.
 ''Europe's farmers, like any others, cannot be expected to see their livelihoods negotiated out from under them,'' he wrote in an op-ed article for The International Herald Tribune. ''Our proposals are at the limit of what is socially tolerable in Europe and we will go no further.'' 
 But American officials icily dismissed the proposal, saying it fell short of both their previous demands and those put forward by large developing nations like Brazil and India. 
 ''Over all, we are disappointed,'' Rob Portman, the United States trade representative, said in a conference call from Geneva. ''It is a modest step in the right direction, but it is inadequate to meet the goals of Doha.'' 
 Brazilian leaders, who have been leading the charge for greater access to the farm markets of wealthy nations, were similarly cool.
 ''What's on the table today, taking into account all aspects, isn't sufficient,'' Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister, said at a news conference in Brasilia. ''There's a lot more work to do.''
 To be sure, negotiators on both sides are playing brinksmanship. ''I am not going to accept that this is really Europe's bottom line,'' said one American trade negotiator, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks.
 Mr. Mandelson, for his part, dared his counterparts to walk out. 
 ''If our trading partners don't accept the seriousness of our proposals, then the question is if they really want to relaunch global trade talks,'' he said.
 But Mr. Mandelson was also under fire from French leaders, who had already warned him not to exceed his negotiating authority and had vowed to protect France's politically powerful farmers.
 Jacques Chirac, the French president, warned on Thursday that he would veto any final deal that endangered Europe's current farm subsidy and tariff regime.
 On Friday, French officials sharply dissented from Mr. Mandelson's proposal, even though he is supposed to represent all 25 nations in the European Union.
 ''We have doubts about this offer,'' said Nicolas de la Grandville, spokesman for the French representation to the European Union. ''We are making our views known now to avoid having to use our veto during the endgame later.''
 Mr. Mandelson's latest offer went much further than Europe's previous proposal, which would have trimmed farm tariffs by an average of 24.5 percent.
 But American officials said the offer was less than it seemed, noting that European officials wanted to shield 8 percent of agricultural product lines as ''sensitive.'' The United States has proposed that only 1 percent of product lines be deemed sensitive.
 In Washington, but also in many other parts of the world, lawmakers and trade experts expressed growing pessimism about reaching a big agreement. 
 ''If this is the best offer the European Union can make, then it looks like the Doha round might be stalled,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. ''There is still time, but not much.''
 Claude E. Barfield, a trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington, said it might already be too late to expect a broad agreement at the coming talks.
 ''Ultimately, I just do not see a large result coming out of Hong Kong,'' Mr. Barfield said. ''I think you really are heading for a minimal result.''
 Sergio Marchi, a former Canadian trade minister who has also led the World Trade Organization's General Council, said the European Union's take-it-or-leave-it approach risked alienating its trading partners.
 ''If developing countries get the sense the E.U. won't improve on this, then what's in it for them to continue talking?'' Mr. Marchi said.
 Brazilian officials said the European Union was giving too little and asking too much.
 Among other things, they said, the European Union had failed to adequately reduce tariffs on products like beef, sugar and pork, which make up a big chunk of American and Brazilian agricultural exports.
 Mr. Mandelson acknowledged that he had pushed his own negotiation authority from the European Union to the outer limits and that he still had to win over the French.
 ''Of course, France has sensitivities,'' he said. ''That doesn't negate France's wider commitment, and I certainly look forward to being able to demonstrate convincingly to France that what we're doing is negotiating in Europe's, and that includes France's, best interests.''
 France could veto a deal, because all 25 countries in the European Union need to agree on an offer before it can formally be made. 
 But other European countries are dubious as well. 
 Irish leaders have expressed concern that Mr. Mandelson made too many concessions early on. And Italy and Greece have supported France on farm issues.

HEADLINE: Big News From Those Who Make Policies and Profits 

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
BIG institutions, public and private, made news this week, starting with President Bush nominating a successor to Alan Greenspan to run the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the world's largest economy. The world's biggest retailer promised several changes to blunt criticism of the way it treats its employees and the environment. Several of the world's biggest oil companies reported huge profits amid the recent spike in prices for oil and for gasoline and other refined products.

THE BANKERS' BANKER -- To generally favorable reviews, Mr. Bush nominated one of his chief economic advisers, the former Princeton professor Ben S. Bernanke, to succeed Mr. Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve. The Senate will be asked to confirm the choice before Mr. Greenspan retires in January.
 Mr. Bernanke, who briefly served as a Fed governor before becoming chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, promised to continue the anti-inflation policies of Mr. Greenspan, but not his Delphic style of guiding monetary policy. Instead, Mr. Bernanke has advocated a more open approach based on explicit rules, including the somewhat controversial idea of setting a specific inflation target. 
The tone of his tenure will become apparent at the end of March, when he will lead his first meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the body that sets short-term interest rates. His goal will be to bring down inflation, now at its highest rate in more than a decade, without causing too much damage to the economy or the stock market.
 Economists who know Mr. Bernanke said they believed he would avoid offering unsolicited advice to the president. But he may find it hard to avoid talking about the deficit, which could affect the value of the dollar, interest rates -- and Mr. Bernanke's reputation.

A GIANT STIRS -- Seeking to blunt criticism of its low wages and spotty health care plan, Wal-Mart said it would offer its 1.33 million American employees health insurance with monthly premiums as low as $11. Insurance specialists said such premiums might be attractive, but noted that some full-time Wal-Mart workers earned less than $18,000 a year and could still face deductibles and co-payments of $2,500 a year or more.
 Days after Wal-Mart announced its new health plan, The New York Times reported that an internal memo sent to Wal-Mart's board said managers could hold down spending on health care by hiring more part-time workers and discouraging unhealthy job applicants. It also noted that workers with more experience earn more than new workers but are no more productive.
 Wal-Mart's chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., meanwhile, called for a rise in the federal minimum wage. Analysts said the move also appeared meant to parry criticism of Wal-Mart's pay, which is 25 to 30 percent below the union wages paid by competitors.
 Wal-Mart is scheduled to release its third-quarter earnings on Nov. 14. When it posted quarterly earnings in August, Wal-Mart reported its slowest profit growth in four years and warned that the third quarter would fall below analysts' estimates.

GUSHER -- Major oil companies reaped a windfall last quarter as crude oil prices soared to a record $70 a barrel and refining profit margins climbed after a pair of powerful hurricanes blew through the Gulf of Mexico and disrupted oil and gas production.
 Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, recorded a $9.92 billion third-quarter profit-- the largest quarterly profit ever posted by an American company -- on record sales of $100 billion. Shell, the British-Dutch company that is No. 2 in the world, posted a $9 billion profit for the quarter.
 Chevron, the second-biggest oil company in America, said it earned $3.6 billion in the quarter, 12 percent more than last year, on revenue of $54.5 billion. It said the hurricanes disrupted operations and shaved $600 million from its profit. ConocoPhillips, the No. 3 oil company, said its profit surged 89 percent in the quarter.
 ConocoPhillips said its refinery in Lake Charles, La., should return to normal operation next week, while its refinery in Belle Chase, La., will partly reopen in December and return to full operation early next year.

BREAKING UP -- Having spent a decade building a disparate collection of businesses into an $18 billion conglomerate called Cendant, the investor Henry R. Silverman conceded that investors never warmed to the idea and said he would split Cendant into four discrete companies.
 The Century 21, Coldwell Banker and ERA real estate chains will be in one. Online travel services, including Cheaptickets and Orbitz, will be in another. Super8, Days Inn, Ramada, Travelodge and other lodging chains will be in a third. Avis and Budget will be bundled into a vehicle rental company.
 Mr. Silverman said he would run the travel distribution company after the breakup and would address criticism of his pay over the years by not taking a salary.

WARNING SIGNS -- Falling prices and flat sales for existing homes last month provided further evidence that the housing boom was starting to cool. The number of new homes sold rose 2.1 percent last month after having tumbled 11.6 percent in August, but the rise was less than many economists had expected and the median sales price declined 5.4 percent.
 That news came as another report said that consumer confidence fell this month amid higher energy costs and concern about a softening job market. Despite that concern, the number of people making their first unemployment insurance claims last month, 328,000, was below what economists had forecast.
 Statistics on income and spending are scheduled to be released next week and may provide more information on where the economy is headed.

SPANISH ACQUISITION -- Banco Santander Central Hispano, a fast-growing Spanish bank, offered $2.4 billion for about 20 percent of Sovereign Bancorp of Philadelphia, with an option to buy the rest of the bank after 2008.
 Sovereign said it would use the cash to help it buy the Independence Community Bank of Brooklyn for $3.6 billion, to complete a branch network from Massachusetts to Maryland.
 The deals did little to assuage Sovereign investors who have been agitating for change in management. These shareholders, led by the San Diego asset management firm Relational Investors, said they would oppose the acquisition.

HEADLINE: An Influential Bush Insider Who Is Used to Challenges

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT; Richard W. Stevenson contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
Among the capital's power elite, I. Lewis Libby Jr. has studiously avoided the limelight in adopting the low-keyed, tight-lipped demeanor of his boss, Vice President Dick Cheney. 
 So cautious is Mr. Libby, a lawyer trained at Columbia University, that he counseled other staff members not to take notes or speak to reporters, two former aides said Friday. But he met periodically with journalists and regularly jotted notes that he kept in a three-ring binder, giving himself the option of tearing out stuff he did not want to keep.
These exceptions to his own meticulous rules of discretion may ultimately come back to haunt Mr. Libby, who resigned Friday after being formally accused of repeatedly lying and obstructing justice during an inquiry into the unmasking of a Central Intelligence Agency officer. 
 In the White House constellation of advisers, Mr. Libby, 55, was not just any aide. Known by the nickname Scooter, he had the exalted position of being a full member of President Bush's inner circle. In fact, he exercised more influence than senior vice-presidential aides in previous administrations, holding three pivotal jobs at once: assistant to the president, chief of staff to the vice president and Mr. Cheney's national security adviser. 
 ''Scooter is Dick Cheney's Dick Cheney,'' said Cesar V. Conda, Mr. Cheney's former top economic policy aide. 
 Indeed, working for Mr. Cheney on and off over the past 15 years, Mr. Libby knows his boss's views and intentions well enough to start pursuing priorities before being asked. Mr. Libby quietly submitted his letter of resignation on Friday before the special counsel, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, held a news conference to announce the indictments that put Mr. Libby at the center of the leak investigation. 
 In a statement, Mr. Cheney expressed ''deep regret'' at Mr. Libby's resignation, and paid tribute to his longtime adviser and confidant: ''Scooter Libby is one of the most capable and talented individuals I have ever known. He has given many years of his life to public service and has served our nation tirelessly and with great distinction.'' 
 Mr. Libby said he believed he would be found innocent of the charges against him. ''I am confident that at the end of this process I will be completely and totally exonerated,'' he said in a statement issued by his lawyer, Joseph A. Tate. 
 Mary Matalin, a longtime political adviser to Mr. Cheney who spoke to Mr. Libby on Friday, said: ''He is relentlessly even-keeled and is going to do what he's going to do. He's the furthest thing from a whiner.''
 Finding a successor to Mr. Libby will not be easy for Mr. Cheney, who has relied on his aide's behind-the-scenes advice on issues including the budget, the Iraqi insurgency and Mr. Bush's choice to be new chairman of the Federal Reserve. But Mr. Libby's main passions have been national security issues -- he was a principal architect of the war with Iraq -- and counseling and protecting his boss. 
 ''When I find a time when I disagree with Dick Cheney, I say to myself, 'Why am I wrong?' '' Mr. Libby said in an interview in 2001.
 On Friday, Republican aides said the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Libby was David S. Addington, Mr. Cheney's counsel. Others include Neil Patel, a longtime Libby deputy; Eric Edelman, a former Cheney aide who is a senior Pentagon official. 
 ''They have been in recent weeks delegating lots of responsibility to other members of the senior staff,'' Mr. Conda said. ''They've been preparing for it. '' 
 Mr. Libby's departure virtually ensures that more power will end up in the hands of Mr. Cheney's closest advisers, his wife, Lynne, and his daughter Elizabeth, aides said. 
 Despite his pedigree as one of the administration's most hawkish advisers on national security issues, Mr. Libby is hard to pigeonhole among Washington insiders. He is married to Harriet Grant, one of the senior Democratic lawyers to interview Anita F. Hill in the Senate hearings on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas. 
 He is an avid mountain-biker and played in a regular weekend touch-football game until he broke his foot recently and ended up on crutches. 
 Mr. Libby's nickname derives from the day his father watched him crawling in his crib and joked, ''He's a scooter!'' The moniker stuck, and Mr. Libby has joked that it ensured that people he had just met would never forget his name and would not take him too seriously. 
 A consummate backroom player in Washington, Mr. Libby has for five years overseen a powerful staff that includes a mini-National Security Council and domestic policy team, to support Mr. Cheney's formidable role in shaping the Bush agenda and brokering it on Capitol Hill. It was a job that culminated more than two decades in and out of government. 
 A son of an investment banker, Mr. Libby attended prep school at Andover, then Yale University and Columbia Law School. Eventually, his former political science professor at Yale offered him a job at the State Department. That professor was Paul D. Wolfowitz, formerly deputy defense secretary and now president of the World Bank. 
 At the State Department, Mr. Libby worked on matters concerning Asia, a lifelong interest. After leaving government, he rejoined Mr. Wolfowitz at the Pentagon in 1989 when Mr. Cheney was secretary of defense. In 1998, Mr. Libby was legal adviser to the bipartisan House panel on Chinese espionage. 
 Mr. Libby, a protege of Leonard Garment, President Richard M. Nixon's lawyer, is no stranger to legal and diplomatic challenges. While in private practice between stints in government, he represented clients including Fiat, NBC and United Parcel Service. When he left private practice, he was billing $535 an hour. 
 But his most celebrated client was Marc Rich, the billionaire fugitive commodities trader and tax evader to whom President Bill Clinton later granted a pardon. Mr. Libby represented Mr. Rich on and off for 15 years, earning $2 million in fees, but he was not involved in the pardon.

NIGHT DRAWS NEAR
 Iraq's People in the Shadow 
 of America's War.
 By Anthony Shadid.
 424 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $26.
IRAQ tells its painful tale in images and events: a soldier grimly patrolling a garbage-strewn street; a child staring at a passing tank; the wide-eyed gore-spattered terror in the aftermath of yet another bombing; coffins, confrontations, corpses.
 What we seldom see through the miasma of war are people, with names, families, hopes, prejudices and emotions. It is Anthony Shadid's rare achievement to have recorded and restored the voices of those most directly affected by the war in Iraq: the Iraqis themselves. 
 ''Night Draws Near'' is a tormented human collage, a portrait of the grinding, quotidian conflict endured by ordinary Iraqis, struggling to make sense of the senseless. Here are the mother trying to find work and feed her children in a crumbling slum, the sculptor watching his once beautiful city fall apart, the terrorist, the street sweeper, the schoolgirl scribbling her fears nightly in a tatty diary. 
 An Arab-American, born in Oklahoma of Lebanese descent, Shadid is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who has reported for The Washington Post from Iraq since the war began. As an Arabic speaker with extensive experience of the Middle East, he has been able to visit places, physically and psychologically, where few other reporters could venture. He converses equally easily with the Texas private and the Islamic insurgent, crossing the divide between Sunni, Shiite and American, to extract the individual stories that give human contour to the chaos. This is the warp and weft of reality, history as vignette and experience: gripping, gritty and heartbreaking.
 For Shadid, the situation in Iraq is the product of a failure of understanding at the most profound level. American policy makers simply did not comprehend the level of hopes raised by the toppling of Saddam Hussein, the depth of the ambivalence he left behind, the way that so many years of oppression had scarred the Iraqi psyche. Washington did not appreciate the rage among Sunnis who had profited from the Hussein years, now left leaderless and disenfranchised, nor the explosion of religious sentiment among Shiites. ''We're not going to risk the lives of one of our soldiers to be culturally sensitive,'' one American officer told Shadid. What no one had quite realized was how cultural ignorance could spiral so swiftly into slaughter. 
 ''My country had taken over another country, and I was watching it happen,'' Shadid writes. ''The United States now controlled Iraq's destiny; we would now decide its fate. And we understood remarkably little about it.'' 
 The Iraqis were equally baffled. The Americans who came as liberators remained as occupiers. They promised democracy and peace, yet they could not stop the looting, or even, at the most basic level, ensure that the electricity worked in Baghdad. ''Stuff happens. Freedom's untidy,'' declared the defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, as armed gangs claimed the streets. Shadid shows that this untidy, unexpected ''stuff'' transformed perceptions among Iraqis. At first cautiously welcomed, the United States Army became ''first, a callous overseer in a looted capital, then an insensitive occupier in a Muslim land, and now . . . a provocative presence whose visibility only deepened the strife.'' Iraqis and Americans came together with impossibly high expectations. These collided, and then exploded.
 In Shadid's telling, the simplicity of official American thinking, intoxicated by its own optimistic rhetoric, contrasts with the raw shock, emotional complexity and confusion of Iraqis, summed up by the Arabic word ghamidh, meaning mysterious, unclear and gloomy. Inside the Green Zone, the security oasis of four and a half square miles protected by concrete and wire, educated Americans imagined Iraq's future; outside, in the Red Zone, the rest of Iraq, the present was being forged by bomb, bullet and sermon. 
 It is from the gloom of the Red Zone that Shadid extracts resonant lives. The Sunni father who kills his own son, an informer, in obedience to the medieval rites of tribal revenge. The terrified Iraqi policeman, feeling he has deserted his own people to work for the occupiers, expecting death on every street corner. Perhaps the most moving testaments are those of Amal, the adolescent diarist, whose thoughts slowly evolve from naive Hussein propaganda, to uncertain elation, to blank despair: ''Oh God, why does this agony surround us?''
 Shiites -- able to celebrate their rites openly for the first time in a generation, only to see their holy places attacked by suicide bombers and the celebrants murdered in droves -- echo that cry. ''Why won't they leave us in peace?'' a young, horror-struck pilgrim asks Shadid after a suicide bomb explodes at the Karbala shrine in March 2004, killing dozens. 
 Who are ''they''? Again, the answer is veiled in ghamidh, but Shadid leaves no doubt that the ferocious disillusionment among Sunnis, the Shiite uprising, the foreign Islamists who have poured into Iraq since the fall of Hussein reciting Qaeda slogans have all taken sustenance from the groundswell of fury at the continued presence of troops among this proud people. ''Most of the insurgents shared a religious ideology that, in message and appeal, was a direct consequence of an occupation that was envisaged as the means of bringing democracy to Iraq.'' Freedom brought by the invasion has aggravated the very fundamentalism the West most fears. 
 The economic and ideological wasteland left by Hussein provided fertile ground for breeding both fanaticism and resentment. American officials are frustrated that Iraqis have not done more to embrace change, but years of oppression have created a dependency culture of the most acute sort. Baathist rule did not encourage self-sufficiency, resourcefulness or originality; after decades of submission, many Iraqis had forgotten how to act independently. The Islamic clergy filled the vacuum, but moral confusion reigned. Some who had loathed Hussein found themselves looking back with warped nostalgia to the days of the dictator. Long after the fallen president was dragged from his hole, inspected for fleas and bundled into captivity, his specter still haunts the skewed Iraqi imagination, and always will: ''Maybe he will come back'' Iraqis worry. 
 On March 10, 2003, George W. Bush announced that the lives of Iraqis would ''dramatically improve.'' The president's promise is remembered today as a betrayal. Amal, confiding to her diary, demands: ''Please, tell us, when are we going to live a life of security and stability? . . . They talk about democracy. Where is democracy?''
 Many Americans still cannot understand why Iraqis are ungrateful. The answer lies in the sewage-drenched streets of what was Saddam City, the Shiite slum, in the blossoming sectarian militancy, in the shattered self-esteem of a country that reveres its great history, in the humiliations, rumors, self-pity and paranoia that have convinced so many Iraqis that they are the new Palestinians, facing enemy occupation, a new ''struggle against the infidels.''
 Shadid offers no solutions. He is a reporter, not a politician. He looks over this bleak landscape of lengthening shadows to depict a place in desperate limbo, neither liberated, as Washington had hoped, nor occupied, as so many Iraqis and much of the Arab world believe. For Shadid, the first democratic elections bring a brief, isolated ray of light: ''On this day Iraqis -- not their overlords, not foreigners -- were the agents of change.'' But he has spent too long watching the lights flicker on and off in this city to predict sunshine and hope. There is typically grainy honesty in his admission that he, too, remains bewildered by this place draped in ghamidh. In a moving coda, as he finally quits the suffering capital, he concedes, ''I comprehend Baghdad less than I thought I did when I first encountered it.''
 If America's leaders, on entering Iraq, had displayed just a fraction of the humility that Shadid admits on leaving it, then there might have been no need for this brave book.

HEADLINE: The Anti-Debt Crusader

BYLINE: By Ginia Bellafante. 
Ginia Bellafante is a reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
One afternoon not long ago, Dave Ramsey received a call on his Nashville-based radio show from a young man named Jerry in Texas who was about to be married. ''The problem I'm having is, well, first of all, I've been married before, and she's never been married before,'' Jerry began rather tentatively, ''so, you know, the wedding is a little bit bigger than I expected.'' Ramsey laughed sympathetically. Jerry continued: ''I have about five or six thousand dollars in credit-card debt now. She has about the same. And when she comes up with things like, well, you know, the limo is going to be this amount . . . I really don't have an option other than to put them on my credit card. So when I ask her, well, where is this money going to come from, I feel like my character is being assassinated, like I'm not being supportive, I don't want the marriage, I'm not going along with it.'' 
At this point, Ramsey cut in: ''You've got someone who is being financially irresponsible and expects you to do something just because they showed up. I mean, what are you going to do 30 years into this marriage?'' Jerry remained silent. Ramsey went on: ''You guys need premarital counseling in the worst way to determine if this marriage should go forward, and if it should go forward, you will pay cash for the wedding, not put it on your credit card, and we -- she and you -- will work to put together a budget. 
 ''Jerry,'' Ramsey concluded, ''do not marry this girl unless you get some premarital counseling. Period.''
 Well before the new bankruptcy law that went into effect on Oct. 17 made it harder for most Americans to wipe out credit-card debt, Ramsey was waging a one-man crusade against leveraged spending. At 45, he has worked for more than a decade promoting his vision of personal growth through fiscal restraint. ''The Dave Ramsey Show'' is broadcast for three hours each weekday on more than 260 radio stations, attracting some two million listeners a week, mostly from the Southeast and the Midwest. Ramsey rejects debt in nearly every form (credit cards, auto loans, 30-year mortgages, home-equity loans), advising followers to pay for every single purchase (oatmeal, bath towels, dishwashers, even a split-level) with cash. He reserves one day a week for callers to join him in screaming the words ''I'm debt free!'' 
 By the standards of the average caller, Jerry was doing pretty well. Many of Ramsey's callers have amassed an average of $50,000 in credit-card debt, on salaries well below that figure. More than nine million people have filed for personal bankruptcy since 2000, but, as Ramsey is fond of saying, ''my calling isn't the macro, it's the micro -- it's Joe and Suzy.'' To help Joe and Suzy, Ramsey has written three best sellers, including his most recent, ''The Total Money Makeover.'' He is also the architect of a multistep debt-recovery and savings program called Financial Peace University, a 13-week videotaped course offered through churches and corporations and on 95 military bases. In addition, Ramsey has devised a version of the program for young people -- Financial Peace for the Next Generation -- which is now taught in 600 public and parochial schools. As an evangelical Christian, he insists that his followers make regular donations to churches or other charitable organizations. When I asked Ramsey about the wisdom of preaching philanthropy to those not yet back on their feet, he replied: ''One way to bust the pity party is to be a giver. Giving breaks loose the whining child inside you.'' Such is Ramsey's influence in certain parts of the country that a classified ad in an Odessa, Tex., newspaper, announcing the sale of a Dodge Caravan ended with the words ''Dave Ramsey said sell.''
 The son of a builder, Ramsey grew up in Antioch, Tenn., and then worked his way through the University of Tennessee in the early 1980's. By age 26, he had become a real-estate investor. His $4 million portfolio of properties was financed on various short-term loans, all of which came up for renewal at the same time. Ramsey, whose spending extended to Jaguars and exotic trips, was forced into bankruptcy. He and his wife, Sharon, whom he met in college, began saving, driving a borrowed car and doing without air-conditioning during sweltering Southern summers. It took them six years to pay off the $500,000 they owed the I.R.S. and friends they had borrowed from, and then, in 1991, Ramsey started a two-man company, the Lampo Group, to counsel people on financial matters. A year later, he began dispensing advice on WWTN radio in Nashville, initially free because the station, too, had fallen into bankruptcy. Today, Ramsey and his family live in Brentwood, a prosperous suburb of Nashville, but he and his wife still drive used cars and clip coupons. They have a dog named Heaven.
 In the spring and the fall, Ramsey travels around the country to conduct six-hour seminars in more than a dozen of his biggest radio markets, attracting audiences of up to 8,000. Last year, his fall tour began in late August at the Petersen Events Center at the University of Pittsburgh. As he sat in a lounge, a few hours before he was to take the stage, he talked about the perils of borrowing money to pursue an education. ''I really do get more hate mail on this issue than anything else,'' Ramsey told me. ''Can you get a better tool set with a Wharton M.B.A. than a degree from Tennessee State? Yes, you can. But it's the application of the knowledge that is paramount. The location -- where you went to school -- is not. One of the calls that drives me the craziest is from the person who says, 'I'm $80,000 in debt because I got a master's in sociology.' There is an intrinsic value to a good education that you cannot quantify, yes, but I'm dealing with the guy who can't pay the light bill on Friday.'' 
 Shortly after noon, Ramsey took the stage, to roaring applause. By the end of the day, he had wrapped himself in chains, taken poultry shears to a stack of credit cards, charted how much money you would have at 60 if you saved a few hundred dollars a month today, quoted liberally from movies and proverbs and abused Shopping Barbie, which is packaged with a cash register that rings ''Credit Approved.'' Ramsey delivers not only his own personal story at some length during these seminars but also those of his callers. A favorite involves a young man who wanted to rid himself of $6,000 in credit-card debt but worked only 20 hours a week. ''I told him, 'I want you to be delivering pizza, working a construction job and delivering papers at 3 a.m.,''' Ramsey recounted. '''You do all that, and you'll be out of debt and taking your parents on a cruise for Christmas, because you live with them, don't you?''' 
 Ramsey likes to draw contrasts between what he views as the productive habits of the entrepreneurial class and the slothful proclivities of those in the lower rungs. ''The average millionaire can't tell you who got voted off the island,'' Ramsey told his transfixed audience. The average millionaire, he said, reads two nonfiction books a month. 
 Adopting the Ramsey financial plan means tackling debts from smallest to largest and saving for three to six months of emergency expenses. The final steps are opening Roth I.R.A.'s and paying off home mortgages. But the key is the creation of a strict household budget organized around a set of envelopes in which cash is distributed for regular necessities. If you borrow from the gas envelope to pay for six pizzas, you have to take thebus. 
 Implicit in Ramsey's teachings is the notion that debt is a moral weakness, a failure to embrace Protestant values of industry and restraint. To a degree, Ramsey is resurrecting an idea that until the 1950's remained central to American life: owing money was sinful. A popular story about a young girl named Lizzie, written by Irving Bacheller in 1911, depicted how vain and mindless spending manages to erode the moral fiber of an entire town. Yet as Daniel Bell argued in his classic 1976 text, ''The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism,'' America's postwar transition from an economy of production to one of consumption depended on families living beyond their means. The language of ''installment selling'' carefully avoided the word ''debt,'' thus removing any moral taint from the notion of borrowing. 
 Even so, 30 or 40 years ago, Ramsey's proselytizing would have found few adherents not just because shame about borrowing money was still built into the social fabric but also because borrowing money wasn't quite so easy to do. Before the 1980's, credit in America was dispensed sparingly, but in 1978 a Supreme Court ruling in Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corporation paved the way for banks to export interest rates beyond state borders. This meant that a lending institution in South Dakota could now grant loans at 24 percent to someone living in New York or in one of the many other states where the ceiling on interest rates was far lower. At the same time, banks began aggressively developing their consumer-product divisions, making high-limit cards available to those of moderate means. For anyone with a marginal credit rating who might miss just one or two payments, interest rates can quickly reach 30 percent.
 It is when railing against credit-card companies that Ramsey, a self-described social conservative, sounds most like a liberal. Ramsey is as likely to attack the tactics of marketers as he is an individual's failure to resist them. When bankruptcy legislation, deemed by Democrats to be creditor friendly, first came up for debate in Congress two years ago, Ramsey lambasted Republicans for supporting it, calling it ''the Visa Reform Act.'' Though he is opposed to bankruptcy filing, Ramsey faults the new law for doing little to help consumers develop more prudent habits. 
 His populism has brought him fans from across the political spectrum, but Ramsey is not without his share of fierce critics. For Robert D. Manning, a professor of finance at Rochester Institute of Technology and the author of ''Credit Card Nation,'' Ramsey overlooks the new category of debtor created by the exploding lending industry. Ramsey discourages his followers not only from filing for bankruptcy but also from availing themselves of debt-settlement and consolidation packages, some of which allow for satisfying debt at 20 to 40 cents on the dollar, arguing that these packages cure the symptom not the disease. Manning points out that such compromises are, for many people, the only hope of restoring stability. 
 Manning also takes issue, as do many others, with Ramsey's position on mortgages. In Ramsey's schema, only a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is acceptable. ''I'm under no delusions that I'm going to get people to put 100 percent down on a house,'' Ramsey told me. ''But the financial industry has made us all feel brain-dead if we don't have mortgages.'' In his Financial Peace video seminars, he encourages students to save as much money as possible for down payments on their homes -- 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent. This leaves him open to the charge that his ideas are financially unsophisticated, because, as economists and money managers agree, homeownership has historically been the most common access to building wealth in America. And mortgages have the obvious advantage of reducing your tax load. But Ramsey would say that he is not against homeownership but showy aspiration and that most of us would benefit from buying homes within our means rather than above them.
 Perhaps the biggest question surrounding Ramsey is the extent to which incautious spending can be blamed for bankruptcy. ''Ramsey is absolutely right that consumer debt should not be the norm,'' says Deborah Thorne, a sociologist at Ohio University who served as a researcher on the Consumer Bankruptcy Project. But, she says, the project looked at 1,250 people who had filed for bankruptcy, and job loss or a decline in work hours was the No. 1 cause. Medical problems ranked second. Only 4.5 percent named credit-card debt as the sole reason for filing. 
 Ramsey argues that his philosophy is more than a defense against financial ruin. Stringent saving is, in his estimation, a proactive plan. ''If I were to have a grand mission, it would be to have people prosper,'' he said, ''it would be for the regular guy to get ahead.''

HEADLINE: Cutting 'Sweeney Todd' to the Bone

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
''I GOT blood on my cello!'' 
 Overhearing that exclamation one night backstage at the Eugene O'Neill Theater, Stephen Sondheim, Broadway's master manipulator of words, was struck by its oddity.
''Do you realize,'' he said to the young woman with the soiled strings, ''that you just crafted a sentence that has probably never before been heard in the course of human history?''
 It may not be the last time that phrase, or some similar declaration, is heard in the wings of the Eugene O'Neill, where a radical new production of Mr. Sondheim's radical old musical ''Sweeney Todd'' opens on Thursday. 
 In John Doyle's staging of this lusty tale of vengeance, the actors onstage do double duty as the orchestra. The slicing of throats and the baking of human flesh into meat pies take place alongside rather more peculiar sights. It's not every day that you see a reigning Broadway diva, Patti LuPone, swaddled in a tight black miniskirt, huffing and puffing away at a tuba onstage, suggesting a tarty home-economics teacher who joined the marching band. 
 ''Sweeney Todd,'' with its sumptuous score by Mr. Sondheim and scabrous book by Hugh Wheeler, is by now a familiar commodity to lovers of musical theater. Since its Broadway premiere in 1979 in Harold Prince's celebrated production, it has made its bloodthirsty way across the stages of theaters, concert halls and opera houses the world over, in productions numbering in the hundreds. But Mr. Doyle's staging dares to make it unfamiliar again by providing an unusually prominent role for a performer that doesn't find much employment on Broadway these days: the audience's imagination.
 His minimalist aesthetic, which dispenses with changes of scenery, elaborate Victorian costumes and literal depictions of much of the action, works by symbol and suggestion to unfold the story of a vengeful barber, here played by Michael Cerveris, and his enterprising partner in crime, the cheerfully amoral Mrs. Lovett, played by Ms. LuPone.
 The results scared the pants off Mr. Sondheim when he caught an earlier version of Mr. Doyle's production in London, where it transferred after its premiere at the Watermill Theater in Newbury, England. And scaring the pants off Stephen Sondheim is one of the surest ways to win him over.
 ''When I first wrote this thing all I wanted to do was write a horror story, a Grand Guignol piece,'' he recalled recently, settling in the Eugene O'Neill auditorium with Mr. Doyle. ''Of all the productions I've seen, this is the one that comes closest to Grand Guignol, closest to what I originally wanted to do. I characterize all the major productions I've seen in terms of a single adjective. Hal's was epic. Declan Donnellan's production was exactly the reverse, it was very intimate. John's, for me, is the most intense.''
 Coming from an acknowledged master of the postwar musical, who celebrated his 75th birthday this year, this kind of praise might give a director a bit of a fright, particularly one making his Broadway debut. But Mr. Doyle, a newcomer to the New York stage at the ripe age of 52, seems gratified but hardly ruffled to hear Mr. Sondheim's assessment. Perhaps it's because he's not one of the flavors-of-the-season regularly imported from London to steer the choice revival assignments on Broadway -- David Leveaux, Matthew Warchus or Sam Mendes, to name three. He's a relatively uncelebrated workhorse who has toiled for most of his career in England's regional theaters, where he developed his novel method of reducing the staff of musical productions.
 Cynics who might see this revival as a boon for frugal producers will not be surprised to learn that necessity did indeed mother Mr. Doyle's invention.
 ''It was originally an economic choice,'' Mr. Doyle confessed. ''I was running a small people's theater called the Everyman in Liverpool and I wanted to do 'Candide.' We didn't have the resources for an orchestra as well as a full cast, so I found just about the only people in the U.K. who could both perform it and play it.'' 
 Since that first production, back in 1992, which he recalls as more akin to a concert staging, with the actors occasionally leaping up from behind their music stands to act out scenes, Mr. Doyle has refined and developed his style. In taking shows apart and putting them back together under the ingenuity-inspiring constraints of his particular working method, he's managed to renew classic works of theater, ranging from Mr. Sondheim's ''Into the Woods'' to Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Gondoliers,'' by knitting more closely together musical values and narrative shape. Mr. Doyle will apply it to another of Mr. Sondheim's musicals, ''Company,'' at the Cincinnati Playhouse next spring.
 Though he admitted he was ''gobsmacked'' by the prospect of remounting ''Sweeney Todd'' for Broadway, any anxieties were put to rest when Mr. Sondheim shared his enthusiasm for the project. ''Broadway is a long way from where this production began,'' Mr. Doyle said. ''But I was determined not to make it bigger and broader for Broadway, and Stephen was just as adamant about this. We wanted to do the same piece of work. Make it clearer and stronger, perhaps, but essentially I never wanted it to change.''
 Mr. Sondheim and his representatives did have some concerns when they learned that Mr. Doyle had cut the score at the Watermill. But a video of the production put fears of a wholesale massacre to rest. In the end Mr. Sondheim, who asked only that a few cuts be restored for the Broadway run, has been an eager participant in the tinkering and rethinking that has necessarily taken place.
 In London Mrs. Lovett played the trumpet; here she plays the tuba. (Ms. LuPone, who has starred in concert productions of ''Sweeney,'' was discovered to have played the tuba in an all-girl marching band in high school. Picture it!) So the trumpet needed to be reassigned, for starters. Perhaps the hardest chore was retaining the many flavors in Mr. Sondheim's score with an orchestra of just 10 players, especially since 2 or 3 of them must sing, act or help with props and costumes at any given moment. (The original Broadway production had an orchestra of 27.) 
 ''Because different instruments are now played by different characters, the staging has had to change quite a bit,'' Mr. Doyle said. ''In a way that was good because it forced us to go back to square one and start again. People may wonder why a character performs a particular action. It's because to lose the musical voicing provided by another actor who might perform it would be detrimental to the orchestration. It's a jigsaw puzzle.''
 As it happens, Mr. Sondheim is known for his mathematical prowess and his love of puzzles, and the Rubik's Cube of staging challenges proposed by Mr. Doyle's production may in part explain the excitement he exudes in discussing them. He has regularly attended previews and offered small suggestions on how to clarify a bit of staging.
 ''This score is moderately complex in terms of harmony,'' Mr. Sondheim said. ''It's not just chordal harmony. If you take out a given line in the instrumentation you've lost the harmony. It makes it extremely difficult. Most scores you could take out a line and have the essential harmony still there. Not in this one.''
 ''And the underscoring needed to be reconceived because John's scene changes are different,'' he added. ''I wrote music to cover much more complicated changes of scene and longer scenes. And I always write underscoring very meticulously to cover the precise amount of dialogue, so when dialogue was cut or changed, Sarah and John had to put in musical effects.''
 Mr. Sondheim is referring to Sarah Travis, Mr. Doyle's close collaborator on the project, who stepped up to the daunting task of reducing and re-orchestrating one of the most celebrated scores in musical theater history. Mr. Sondheim has high praise both for the technical proficiency of her work and the unexpected new glints of theatrical coloring it brings to his shivery score.
 ''I think what she's done is absolutely brilliant,'' he said. ''Jonathan Tunick's original orchestrations may be the best ever heard on Broadway, but this is a whole other matter. The variety of sounds she's gotten out of the instruments and also the practical way in which they allow John to work with the performers onstage is extraordinary. But what got me most about the orchestrations is what they did for the play's atmosphere. These are wonderfully weird textures. The sound of an accordion playing with a violin -- it's very creepy.''
 As Mr. Sondheim indicated, Mr. Prince's concept of the show, which placed the merrily gruesome story inside a morality tale of clashing classes, did not entirely jibe with his original conception. But Mr. Sondheim has a strong affection for that version.
 ''I like spectacle too,'' he said. ''When you have a great story you can tell it in many different ways.''
 ''There are certain things missing in this production -- orchestral climaxes, choral climaxes -- that are simply impossible because of the resources,'' he added. ''And there are nuances lost because of the compression of the narrative required by this method of performing the piece. But what you gain is a swiftness and intensity that draws the audience into this macabre world, and that is created by a unified ensemble working in one tone. Here it's as if the audience is drawn into a tunnel.'' 
 If Mr. Sondheim delights in the skin-crawling, screw-turning concentration of this production, it may be because the staging encourages viewers to let their imaginations play across its stark, haunting images, finding what they seek in the shadows. Richard Frankel, one of the producers, said: ''I found it enormously moving when I saw it in London and thought it illuminated this show I've known and loved for the past 25 years in a startling new way. It's like painting on the walls of a cave in a way, using anything at hand to tell the story.''
 Mr. Frankel may also have been moved by the prospect of engineering what is increasingly a troublesome feat on Broadway: producing a major musical revival that actually turns a profit. The prior Broadway revival, a scaled-down version directed by Susan H. Schulman, was famously nicknamed ''Teeny Todd,'' and some chat room wags have called this one ''Teeny Tiny Todd.'' But the show isn't as economical as it might look from across the footlights. Mr. Frankel said that because the cast members were being paid both as actors and musicians, the cost savings in terms of artistic personnel were not very great. Still, at $3.5 million, the budget is modest by the standards of musicals, with most of the savings deriving from the single set and reduced backstage personnel.
 The original production of ''Sweeney Todd'' lost money, despite eight Tony awards and a healthy run of 557 performances. Risky when it was new -- some audience members fled the theater when Sweeney put his razor to work -- the show remains risky, perhaps especially in Mr. Doyle's unorthodox production.
 ''The imaginative journey, from the audience's point of view, is going to be very different,'' Mr. Doyle said. ''This is not naturalistic theater. It's more poetic than prescriptive. It's playful -- almost told in a way that children would tell the story, using what was available to them.'' But Mr. Frankel remains sanguine that audiences will respond.
 ''I think it works to our advantage that you have to listen hard to this production, not just let it wash over you,'' he said. ''I think it's great that at previews people are leaning forward in their seats hanging on every word. I stand in the back of the theater and am delighted by the silence.''
 Mr. Sondheim has had the same experience. ''When an audience's imagination is engaged they enjoy it even more. It's what makes theater different from the movies. The theater is a poetical medium and the movies are a reportorial medium. That's the fun of the theater.'' He has also been pleasantly struck by the youth of the audiences at previews. ''Patti told me that some kid was overheard the other night comparing this version to his high school production,'' he recalled. '''Hey, they didn't get that moment at all.''' 
 Young audiences. Rapt attention in the balcony. Stimulated imaginations. On Broadway, no less. Now, that's spooky.

BYLINE: By DAVE KEHR

 BODY:
THE omnibus film ''Three Extremes,'' which opened in New York on Friday, consists of three horror stories from three different centers of Asian filmmaking. ''Box,'' from Japan's Takashi Miike, is a dreamlike study of a woman who relives the death of her twin sister as a child; ''Dumplings,'' directed by Fruit Chan of Hong Kong, is a cautionary tale about a wealthy woman who believes she has found the secret of eternal youth in the special dumplings prepared by a tenement witch. 
 But it is ''Cut,'' the final sequence, that lingers in the mind. A successful, handsome, well-liked director (Lee Byung-hun, one of Asia's reigning superstars) returns to his apartment after a hard day's work, and finds a situation straight out of one of his movies: a bitterly resentful bit player (Lim Won-hee), has bound the director's wife to a grand piano with a web of razor-sharp wires. The indignant bit player threatens to pull a wire, and thereby sever one of the woman's fingers every few minutes until the director agrees to strangle the innocent teenage girl kidnapped for the occasion and left tied-up on the couch. 
Now, that's extreme. ''Cut,'' which accounts for 48 of ''Three Extreme's'' 125 minutes, was written and directed by Park Chanwook, 42, a rumpled, thoughtful South Korean filmmaker whose name and work has become synonymous with what has been labeled the Asian Extreme movement. As he demonstrated in his 2003 film ''Oldboy,'' Mr. Park has a vivid imagination that he is not afraid to apply to disturbing material, such as a man devouring a live octopus or the removal of teeth by means of a hammer claw. When his feature ''Lady Vengeance'' was shown recently at the New York Film Festival, A.O. Scott of The Times wrote, ''The question, as always with Mr. Park, is whether he is making high-toned exploitation movies or using the genre to explore serious emotional and ethical issues.''
 ''Basically, I'm throwing out the question 'When is such violence justified?''' Mr. Park said through an interpreter during his recent festival visit. ''To get that question to touch the audience physically and directly -- that's what my goal is. In the experience of watching my film, I don't want the viewer to stop at the mental or the intellectual. I want them to feel my work physically. And because that is one of my goals, the title 'exploitative' will probably follow me around for a while.''
 It's a title that at least a few Western distributors of Asian films and DVD's are happy to exploit in turn. Picking up on the reputations of Mr. Park and some of his colleagues -- including, most notoriously, Mr. Miike, whose work displays little of the formal inventiveness and moral seriousness of Mr. Park's -- one distributor, Tartan Video, has registered Asia Extreme as a trademark and issued a dozen films under that rubric, including ''Oldboy'' and Mr. Park's earlier ''Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance.'' ''Three Extremes'' is being distributed by a specialist in hardcore horror fare, Lions Gate Films, a company that includes ''Audition'' (1999), one of Mr. Miike's most popular/reviled efforts, among its offerings.
 For Mr. Park, the notion that Asia is breeding a new generation of cinematic sadists is simply a marketing ploy. ''If you look at the other two Korean films in the New York Film Festival, they're not extreme in the least,'' said Mr. Park, referring to Im Sangsoo's ''President's Last Bang'' and Hong Sang-soo's ''Tale of Cinema.'' Indeed, the vast majority of Korean films are romantic comedies and sentimental dramas. At the recently concluded Pusan International Film Festival in South Korea, Kim Jee-woon's ''Bittersweet Life'' (which also stars the widely worshipped Mr. Lee) was one of the few films concerned with violence. 
 Still, there's some fire behind this smoke: joining Mr. Park and Mr. Miike on the Asian extreme shelf at the video store are Japanese filmmakers like Shinji Aoyama (''EM -- Embalming''), Takeshi Shimizu (''Ju-On,'' which he remade in English as ''The Grudge''), Shinya Tsukamoto (''Tetsuo, the Ironman'') and (though on a far more accomplished, poetic level) Kiyoshi Kurosawa (''Bright Future''). (Mr. Tsukamoto stars in Mr. Shimizu's new horror film, ''Marebito,'' which is set to open Dec. 9.) There are also the Pang brothers from Thailand (''The Eye'') and many of the so-called Category III (or adults-only) films from Hong Kong, featuring drooling sex killers and hopping vampires. As widely different as these films may be, they all seek a response, as Mr. Park said, beyond ''the mental or the intellectual.'' They are anti-rational, deliberately transgressive works that flaunt their ''forbidden'' imagery as a way of setting themselves apart from mainstream cinema. 
 It's interesting that the Asian extreme movement is largely a phenomenon of the Internet and DVD's. ''Oldboy,'' the most successful theatrical release of the bunch, seems to have topped out at a gross of around $700,000 in the United States, not a bad figure for a foreign-language film these days, but much less than one would expect given all the publicity it received. 
 These films are consumed in the home and discussed on the Internet, on the dozens of sites like filmthreat.com and midnighteye.com that have sprung up to serve the genre. These Asian films are often associated with Western counterparts: the so-called Eurotrash work of filmmakers like Jess Franco of Spain (''Vampyros Lesbos,'' 1971) and Lucio Fulci of Italy (''The Beyond,'' 1981), or the American exploitation films of the 60's and 70's, by directors like Doris Wishman (''Nude on the Moon,'' 1962) or Herschell Gordon Lewis (''Two Thousand Maniacs!,'' 1964). 
 At a certain point, this is a subject that belongs more to sociology than to aesthetics. It probably matters little to the young North American consumers of ''Three Extremes'' that Mr. Park means his embittered extra to be in part a symbol of the North Koreans who have been left out of South Korea's economic boom. For fans, the important thing is that the severed finger imagery is indeed revolting -- and that it provokes revulsion among parents, teachers and the wider range of authority figures that we now call the mainstream media. 
 That which is rejected by the dominant group is embraced by a subculture, and a cult is formed. Thirty years ago, young cinephiles could provoke outrage by supporting, say, the disreputable genre films of Howard Hawks and Alfred Hitchcock over the stolid, respectable Oscar-winning work of directors like Fred Zinnemann and George Stevens; today, it's Hawks and Hitchcock who make up the classical canon, and revolutionaries have to go a bit farther to find their outsider heroes -- all the way to Asia or Italy, or back in time to the heyday of the 42nd Street grind houses. But the underlying impulse remains the same, and it is, I believe, a healthy one: If you want to shake things up, sometimes you have to go to extremes.

HEADLINE: To Save on Gasoline, Look Beyond the E.P.A. Sticker

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY

 BODY:
FILLING up at the gas station these days, drivers may become as lightheaded from the price per gallon as from the fumes. As a result, many Americans are looking to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles or, at the least, to get the best mileage from the cars or trucks they already own. 
 But buying an automobile based on the mileage estimates of the Environmental Protection Agency is tricky, because those figures do not reflect real-world driving conditions. And getting the most out of a tank of gasoline is even trickier when real-world conditions often mean sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic. 
 It is possible to lower fuel bills, first by knowing what to look for while shopping for a vehicle and, later, by adhering to some basic tenets of vehicle operation and maintenance. Of course, you can opt for a hybrid vehicle like the Toyota Prius, which cuts fuel costs by running on an electric motor part of the time. But hybrids cost thousands of dollars more than their conventional gas-powered counterparts -- and even used hybrids are pricey when compared with many new cars, because of long waiting lists at dealers. Moreover, reviews by Consumer Reports and Edmunds.com suggest that the gains in gas mileage may be offset by the higher purchase prices and maintenance and insurance costs, particularly in states that do not offer large tax incentives for hybrids. 
 Whether buyers are considering hybrids or traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, the E.P.A. fuel economy estimates posted on the window sticker and listed on the agency's Web site warrant skepticism. Consumer Reports tested 69 vehicles this year and found that the E.P.A. figures significantly overstated mileage 90 percent of the time.
 ''The E.P.A. test was developed in the 1970's and is not reflective of the way cars are driven today,'' said David Champion, director of vehicle testing at Consumer Reports in East Haddon, Conn. For the highway portion of the E.P.A. test, for example, the vehicle's average speed is 48 miles an hour, with the air-conditioner off and no braking for traffic. But the E.P.A. figures can be used to rank the relative fuel efficiency of various models -- to determine, say, whether a Dodge Neon gets better mileage than a Toyota Echo. 
 ''The vehicles are tested uniformly,'' Mr. Champion said, ''so you are pretty safe using the numbers for basic comparison purposes.'' Mileage will be better if you choose a smaller, four-cylinder engine rather than the more powerful, heavier and thirstier V-6 or V-8 version. And the savings may be even greater if you choose a diesel engine. 
 ''Chemically, diesel fuel contains 10 percent more energy and diesel engines are 30 percent more efficient than regular gas engines,'' said David Greene, a fellow at the National Transportation Research Center, which is affiliated with the Department of Energy and based in Oak Ridge, Tenn. So even if diesel prices spike during the winter or when hurricanes shut down refineries, you are likely to come out ahead.
 The latest diesel engines, like the ones in the Volkswagen Golf TDI and Jetta TDI, don't clatter or spew smoke the way diesel engines did in years past. (New diesel-powered cars are not available in some states, including New York and California, because of emissions regulations.) 
 Vehicles with manual transmissions generally get better fuel economy than those with automatic. An aerodynamic design also improves mileage, but that is hard to discern, said Phillip Reed, co-author of ''Strategies for Smart Car Buyers'' (Edmunds Publications, $14.95) and consumer advice editor at Edmunds.com. ''It may look sexy and fast but might not be,'' he said. ''One of the biggest gains in decreasing drag is if the design has a smooth underside, which you can't really see.'' 
 Any vehicle will get better mileage if tires are kept inflated to the manufacturer's specifications, which are usually printed on the driver's-side door jamb. ''The majority of people are riding around on underinflated tires,'' Mr. Reed said; fuel efficiency is degraded by 2 percent for every pound per square inch below specifications. Mr. Reed recommends buying a digital tire gauge, at $8 to $10, and an electric tire pump, at $45 to $50, to keep tires inflated properly. 
 The manufacturer's recommendations for replacing spark plugs and air filters should be followed faithfully as well. Clogged filters and crusty spark plugs, which prevent gas from burning completely, can reduce mileage by up to 12 percent. Using the recommended grade of motor oil is also important; putting 10W-30 oil into an engine intended for 5W-30, for example, will lower mileage by 1 to 2 percent. 
 Another way to increase mileage is to lighten the load by getting rid of unnecessary stuff in the trunk. An extra 100 pounds reduces fuel efficiency by up to 2 percent. And avoid attaching anything to your car like racks for luggage or bikes; they add weight and create aerodynamic drag. 
 Still, Mr. Greene at the National Transportation Research Center said, ''The biggest determinant of your vehicle's gas mileage is how you drive.'' Aggressive driving that causes you to brake and accelerate often can use up to 33 percent more gas than a more staid style. And speeding can make even the most fuel-efficient engine guzzle gas. The Energy Department says every 5 m.p.h. over 60 cuts gas mileage by 6 percent. 
 Putting your vehicle in higher gear whenever possible, to slow engine speed, saves gas and reduces engine wear. And turn off the engine if the vehicle won't be moving for more than 30 seconds; Mr. Greene says it's a myth that more gas is needed to restart the engine than to let it idle.

HEADLINE: It's 33 Feet Wide, But Enough for a Hotel

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
IT is easy to spend $400 a night to stay at a hotel in Manhattan. It is less easy to find one for under $200. (The most recent average daily room rate was $221.62 for the first six months of the year, according to PKF Consulting.)
 So it would appear that there is a market for a well-located new hotel whose effective daily rate is in the range of $180 to $190. ''These days, that is a relative bargain,'' said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF, which specializes in the hospitality industry. 
With the time apparently right for such a hotel, a Holiday Inn Express opened a month ago on 45th Street just west of Fifth Avenue. Although Holiday Inn Express has hotels in New York's other boroughs and around the region, this is the first in Manhattan. 
 The hotel is opening as demand for hotel rooms in Manhattan is expected to exceed the previous peak in 2000, when 83.2 percent of all rooms were occupied. ''The occupancy rate in Manhattan is 85 percent,'' Mr. Fox said, which effectively means that most hotels are full. ''And room rates in September were up 30 percent over September last year.'' 
 The new hotel, part of the Intercontinental Hotels Group, has no restaurant or meeting rooms, although breakfast is available in the lobby. This concentration on guest rooms is a necessity, given the small site, which measures a little over 33 feet wide and 100 feet deep.
 The result is a 22-story hotel with generally six rooms to a floor. There are 125 guest rooms, including three two-room suites.
 The cost of land makes it difficult to build anything but a luxury hotel in New York, said Verchele W. Mills, Intercontinental's vice president for the Holiday Inn Express brand. But building a hotel with limited services, she said, made construction more reasonable. The hotel is a new building that replaced an office structure.
 Ms. Mills said the company, which franchises its hotels to private owners and operators, was planning other projects in New York, including one on 29th Street in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn. The company has 1,407 Express hotels in the United States and Canada; all but one are owned by franchisees, she said.
 Most Holiday Inn Express hotels are in smaller cities or near highway intersections, she said, but now the company is exploring urban markets because of the demand for hotels in those markets' midprice range. Although the official rate for the 45th Street property is about $250 a night, by the time discounts and negotiated corporate rates are applied, the effective rate will be about $180 a night, Ms. Mills said.
 The new hotel is not the first to capitalize on a relatively small site. ''Smaller hotels in in-fill locations are a major trend in New York,'' Sean Hennessey, a consultant at Lodging Investment Advisors, said. ''The sites are not big enough to have meeting space and a restaurant, but you can still create an effective hotel product.''
 Mr. Hennessey said the Holiday Inn on Gold Street in downtown Manhattan was built on a small, irregular plot of land. ''It's not fancy, but it is right and it has been filled since opening day,'' he said. The posted room rate there is about the same as at the Holiday Inn Express.
 Because smaller midprice hotels in New York are particularly attractive to tourists and others traveling on limited budgets, they can become successful relatively quickly. ''A big, expensive hotel may take two to three years to ramp up to full occupancy,'' Mr. Hennessey said, ''but for one with attractive pricing the ramp-up may be as short as six months.''
 But there is a delicate balance when it comes to a hotel's size, Mr. Fox said. A smaller property may be less costly to build, but it may be difficult to operate profitably because fixed operating costs have to be absorbed by fewer rooms. In number of rooms, Mr. Fox said, the new Holiday Inn Express ''appears to be in the lower range of what is economical to operate.''
 Other Manhattan Hotels in the category where Holiday Inn Express competes, Mr. Hennessey said, include the Hampton Inn Chelsea on West 24th Street, Hotel QT on West 45th Street and the Four Points by Sheraton on West 25th Street. 
 Amy Lewellyn, divisional vice president for operations at the Magna Hospitality Group, which manages the new hotel, also cited Courtyard by Marriott and Wyndham as competing brands. There are four Courtyard and four Hampton Inns in Manhattan; the only Wyndham in New York City is the Wyndham Garden at La Guardia Airport.
 Unlike suburban hotels, which primarily attract travelers pulling off a highway, a city hotel like the new Express is marketed to a wider range of travelers. ''We market to businessmen, government officials, people coming here for the theater,'' she said. 
 Government employees with business in New York often have difficulty finding hotels within their official reimbursement levels, said Shiraz Hassanali, the hotel's general manager. The Express has discounts to help accommodate these travelers. ''We will reach out to foreign tour groups as well,'' said Mr. Hassanali, who previously managed a Holiday Inn Express near Kennedy Airport. ''We want a mix of market segments.''
 The guest rooms, some with views of a masonry wall a foot or so away, are intended for people who do not expect to spend much time in their rooms. They are big enough to hold two double beds or one king-size bed and not much more. Each room has a flat-screen television. Because the building is new, the bathrooms are all modern. 
 Continental breakfast is available in the lobby, which is furnished with tables and chairs. Other amenities include a 24-hour front desk, in-room video checkout and currency exchange. And then there is the location, within walking distance of such attractions as Times Square, Rockefeller Center and the shopping along Fifth Avenue. 
 The hotel opened on Sept. 29, and sold out over the first weekend, Mr. Hassanali said. Its Internet reservation site shows periods in November and December that are fully booked.
 ''We would have liked to have opened in time for Fashion Week, but we will take the holiday season,'' Ms. Lewellyn said.

To the Editor: I was astonished by your choice of Belgrade as the subject of a cover story for the Travel section. 
 Serbia is a country that has been implicated in genocide within the past 10 years. Even after the fall of Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia has offered only the most limited and grudging cooperation to the international prosecution of war criminals, and only in response to threats of economic sanctions. And the country has never conducted any serious public discussion regarding the moral responsibilities of the official and unofficial armed forces that acted in its name during the war.
 Given those circumstances, I must assume that I am not the only reader who was deeply offended to be told just how much fun it was to be partying there.

HEADLINE: Gastronomics

BYLINE: By Matt Lee and Ted Lee

 BODY:
The rise of fuel prices over the last year seems to have had little effect on how much we pay for food. That pint of raspberries imported on a gas-guzzling jet from Argentina? Still five bucks. Nevertheless, the high cost of petroleum has rattled the people in the business of putting food on the nation's table. With prices at the grocery store and in restaurants holding steady, producers and middlemen have been forced to absorb the increase.
In Poolesville, Md., Eric Spates grows No. 2 yellow corn on nearly 300 acres. His tractor and combine burn about 4,000 gallons of diesel fuel every season, which cost him $1 each last year. This year, it's $2.50 a gallon. ''That's a $6,000 hit in my checkbook,'' Spates notes. Add to that the cost of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer made using natural gas, which went from $85 a ton last year to $200 this year.
 And, unfortunately, the price Spates will get for his corn won't rise accordingly. In fact, it is quite low now, hovering around $2 a bushel. (He starts to make money only when it rises above $2.40.) So Spates, 36, is holding on to most of his crop until January, banking on nationwide supplies running low and the price going up. And if it doesn't? 
 ''I try to be a low-cost producer,'' he says. ''I don't spend a lot on machinery, and I try to do all the repairs myself.''
 It's a refrain familiar to any small-boat fisherman, whose fuel represents a little more than 50 percent of maintainance, according to Bob Campbell, the manager of the Yankee Fisherman's Cooperative in Seabrook, N.H. Campbell has been selling diesel for $2.45 a gallon in the middle of October to dispense to the co-op's 52 members, many of whom are resorting to extreme cost-cutting measures. ''A lot of these guys are fishing solo now, which is a dangerous thing to do,'' Campbell says. ''If the price of gas doubles again, you're not going to see the price of fish go the same way -- there's no correlation between them, similar to the farm business. It's just a crazy thing.'' 
 To Ephraim Leibtag, a food-price specialist with the Economic Research Service of the U.S.D.A., it's simple competitive-market economics. ''Increased costs at early levels of production do not necessarily translate fully through the production chain,'' he says. ''People at the lower end of the supply chain will have less market power when there are other options for buyers.'' Dealing in perishables is a zero-sum game, and the seller starts with a disadvantage. ''If the buyer knows the goods are going to spoil,'' Leibtag says, ''it gives them more market power.''
 But Leibtag notes that there might be hope for producers. Consumer prices rose 1.2 percent in September, a sign that energy costs were working through the system. ''At the pump, we see prices rise immediately,'' he says. ''But a grocery store might have contracted for goods months in advance.'' Price increases won't show up until the next contract cycle.
 Fish is clearly being marked up somewhere along the supply chain. Cyril Renaud, the chef and owner of Fleur de Sel, a small Manhattan restaurant, has watched the price of scallops inch forward over the last two years to $10.75 a pound. ''A year ago, I was getting them for $8.25,'' he says. To save money, Renaud prowls the Fulton Fish Market himself instead of paying a purveyor a premium and a fuel surcharge for delivery. ''I can't keep raising prices,'' he says. ''I'm going to hang on as much as I can for as long as I can.''
 He's not the only one. A recent Zagat survey shows that the average cost of a restaurant meal in New York rose only 0.4 percent in the last year. The notion that prices must be held isn't rooted in solidarity with the consumer but in reality: price your entree too high, and you risk that no one will buy it. Those bills piling up in the back office are a powerful motivator to keep pricing aggressively. 
 Stephen Katzman, the president of S. Katzman Produce at the Hunt's Point Produce Market in the Bronx, is in an even graver pinch. Not only does he operate under the threat of being left with rotting cabbages in a competitive marketplace, but if he can't pay the farmer enough to cover his costs, the farmer won't ship the crop at all. His diesel-fuel expense for the refrigerated trailers that the company uses as overflow storage space gobbled $68,545 in the first eight months of 2004; the same period this year cost $199,605 (though a slice of that was due to increased usage, he says). One cost-cutting tactic he's using is to maximize his delivery fleet: he's pressuring his clients to order enough to fill a truck, so a purveyor that took in five partial loads a week might now receive three. 
 Some restaurants are taking these pressures in stride. Joel Patraker, the purchasing manager for the Four Seasons Restaurant, surveys his bills for the day's deliveries. He adds up the various fuel surcharges that his suppliers have tacked on: $16. ''It's imperceptible, really,'' he says. ''If everyone started putting on $3.95, that would be a consideration.'' He's been forced to play the purchasing game with greater acuity. When the price per pound of Canadian bison tenderloin went from $19 to $21, in a blink, no note,'' he looked at bison from the Dakotas being offered for $19.25 per pound, which turned out to be superior in quality as well.
 At Joseph Yavarkovsky Inc., which sells paper goods and packaging to Manhattan delis and restaurants, there is greater alarm. Each delivery from the paper plants in the South brings with it a new fuel surcharge of about $75. And the goods themselves are skyrocketing because of the fuel-intensive nature of their manufacture. ''Anything made of plastic, a petroleum product, is up by 50 to 70 percent,'' says Ira Yavarkovsky, the firm's owner. 
 These days, the only ones not feeling the gas crunch are the restaurateurs who take a literal approach to ''fresh, local food.'' Parker Bosley, the executive chef of Parker's American Bistro in Cleveland, orders exclusively from small farmers, most of whom don't use big diesel-chugging tractors. And their fields are within a two-hour drive of the restaurant's back door -- in many cases, far less. Not a single food purveyor of Bosley's has levied a fuel surcharge or raised prices in the last year.
 ''I'm more than proud of what I do,'' Bosley says. ''I'm chauvinistic and smug. To chefs who learned how to source exotic ingredients instead of learning how to cook well, I say, 'Tough beans, guys.'''

HEADLINE: Top Billing, Again, For the Fed

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
TRADERS run the risk this week of succumbing to information overload. Readings on employment, labor productivity, personal income and spending are on the calendar, as are several indicators of manufacturing. 
 All of them, however, may play supporting roles to the Tuesday meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers on interest rates. A further quarter-point increase, to 4 percent, in the rate that banks charge one another for overnight loans, is almost certain, said Russ Koesterich, senior portfolio manager at Barclays Global Investors in San Francisco.
Another virtual certainty, he said, is that the nomination last week of Ben S. Bernanke to succeed Alan Greenspan as the Fed chairman will not affect the rate decision.
 What is less certain is the wording of the statement accompanying the Fed's announcement. Any change in Fed sentiment is likely to move the stock market.
 Language suggesting ''an end in sight to Fed tightening'' would please the market, Mr. Koesterich said. But he urged investors not to count on it.
 Characterizing recent Fed utterances as ''hawkish,'' he warned that ''there is some risk that the Fed will communicate a heightened fear of inflationary pressure, and that could be bearish for the market.''
 ''It tells you the Fed is not close to being done,'' he added.
 When the Fed has a heightened fear of inflationary pressure, so does Wall Street. Mr. Koesterich said he would read the week's reports for telltale signs of rising prices.
 ''There's a slew of economic statistics, most of them key numbers,'' he said, adding that he would pay particular attention on Tuesday to the gauge of manufacturing activity from the Institute of Supply Management, as well as to the institute's reading on prices paid at factories.
 Mr. Koesterich said he would also focus on the report Thursday on third-quarter productivity. Economists polled by Bloomberg News estimate that it will show a 2.5 percent gain from a year earlier. When it comes to productivity, Mr. Koesterich said, ''the higher, the better,'' because it allows for rising wages without rising consumer prices.
 The higher, the better also counts for the quantity of inflation measures, he said. No single statistic -- for wages or for consumer, producer or raw-materials prices -- tells the whole story. ''It has become harder to capture what's happening with inflation with just one number,'' he explained. ''It's difficult to measure what actual inflation is. It's not like there's one right answer.''

EARNINGS WATCH -- As if investors did not enough to keep them busy on Tuesday, several large companies, including Colgate-Palmolive, Procter & Gamble, UBS and Sun Microsystems, are to announce third-quarter earnings. Among other companies reporting this week will be Kellogg, Occidental Petroleum and Valero Energy on Monday and Time Warner on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Want to Walk on Eggs? Try the Bond Market

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IF you want to know what's up in the bond market, talk to Robert L. Rodriguez. As manager of the FPA New Income fund since 1984, he has never lost money in any calendar year. 
 Today, Mr. Rodriguez says he is shying away from making major bets on bonds because of all the question marks that abound. Among them is the uncertainty over whether interest rates will continue to rise, eroding the value of older, lower-yielding bonds. There is also uncertainty over inflation, which eats into bond returns. And now there are the unknowns surrounding the first transition at the helm of the Federal Reserve Board in nearly two decades.
To be sure, a big question was answered last week when President Bush chose Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, to replace Alan Greenspan as the Fed chairman early next year. But as far as Mr. Rodriguez is concerned, the only uncertainty that's been lifted ''is that we now know the name of the person,'' he said.
 ''We don't know what his policies will be,'' he added. 
 Because Mr. Rodriguez thinks that bonds aren't compensating investors for all the current risks, he is content to have as much as 45 percent of his fixed-income portfolio in cash or cash-equivalent investments. The question for individual investors is, should they follow his lead?
 It's certainly tempting. While the yield on 10-year Treasury notes has risen recently, it's still less than 4.6 percent. Yet inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, shot up 4.7 percent over the 12 months through September. In other words, you're not earning anything on long-term government debt, adjusted for inflation. 
 ''This is the first time since 1980 that we've had a negative yield on U.S. Treasuries,'' says Steven J. Bohlin, managing director of Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, N.M.
 Short-term bank certificates of deposit, meanwhile, are starting to look very attractive. Several one-year C.D.'s are offering interest of more than 4.25 percent, according to Bankrate.com. That's only a smidgen less than what a 10-year Treasury is paying. ''Welcome to the world of a flat yield curve,'' said Marilyn Cohen, president and chief executive of Envision Capital Management of Los Angeles, referring to the fact that yields of long-term bonds aren't much higher than those of short-term securities.
 Yet for most individual investors, moving primarily or entirely to cash presents its own set of risks. 
 For example, in addition to the credit and interest rate risks faced by all bond investors, there is something called reinvestment risk. That's the danger that the economic picture will change several months down the road, causing interest rates to go in the opposite direction.
 In that case, a professional like Mr. Rodriguez may know exactly when he wants to step back into bonds -- but individual investors who don't have time to pay much attention to their portfolios may not. 
 Moreover, interest rates could eventually turn lower. Keep in mind that even though the Fed has been raising short-term rates for more than a year, long-term interest rates are still lower today than they were on March 28.
 The bottom line is clear. ''You don't want to make big bets with fixed income,'' said Ronald W. Roge, a financial planner in Bohemia, N.Y. ''There's just not enough reward for risk-taking in bonds.''
 But investors can take several precautionary steps to tweak their portfolios in the face of what appears to be a rising-rate, rising-inflation environment.
 For starters, if you're deciding what to do with new money, there's nothing wrong with a short-term investment for now, instead of, say, a long-term bond fund. With some of those short-term C.D.'s offering more than 4 percent, and taxable money market funds yielding more than 3 percent, on average, these may be nice alternatives to long-term debt yielding only a sliver more. 
 Now let's turn to your existing bond portfolio. Until recently investors were rewarded for staying at the long end of the curve. Long-term bond funds -- which, according to Morningstar, own debt that matures in around 12 years, on average -- have returned nearly 8 percent, annualized, over the last three years. 
 But as long rates finally started to rise recently, long-term bond funds piled up losses of 1.2 percent in the third quarter. That was more than the 0.5 percent loss suffered by the average intermediate-term bond fund, which invests in debt that matures in seven years, on average, according to Morningstar. The gap in returns isn't surprising, because longer-dated bonds are more vulnerable to principal losses when rates rise. 
 ''The market environment we have now says one should stay short,'' Mr. Bohlin said. For a long-term investor, that may mean selling long-term bond funds and moving the money, at least temporarily, into a short-term or intermediate-term bond fund. 
 If you're willing to time the market a bit, you may consider putting some of that money into a loan-participation fund, sometimes called a floating-rate fund, said Andrew Clark, senior research analyst at Lipper, the fund tracker. These portfolios invest in short-term bank loans with adjustable interest rates. As a result, if market rates rise, these portfolios, unlike traditional bond funds, stand to gain, not lose. Over the last three years, floating-rate funds have returned 7.2 percent a year, on average.
 If you go this route, though, be prepared to monitor your account and market interest rates regularly.
 This is probably also a good time to stick with high-quality debt, Mr. Rodriguez says. Over the last year, his FPA New Income fund has sold most of its holdings in lower-quality, higher-yielding junk bonds, which have stumbled recently as investors have sought stability in this increasingly volatile bond market. 
 There are other moves to consider. Harold R. Evensky, chairman of Evensky & Katz, a wealth management firm based in Coral Gables, Fla., says he recommends putting roughly 20 percent of his clients' fixed-income money into foreign bond funds, because those funds are not likely to move in lock step with domestic bond funds if interest rates rise in the United States.
 Mr. Evensky also recommends some exposure to so-called TIPS bond funds, which invest in Treasury inflation-protected securities. 
 While TIPS funds offer a good hedge against inflation, some money managers worry that they could be vulnerable in a rising-rate environment, because many such funds invest in long-term debt.
 FORTUNATELY, you don't have to hedge inflation within your fixed-income portfolio -- there are many ways to accomplish this goal. Michael J. Cuggino, manager of the Permanent Portfolio, has left his bond holdings alone for the most part, but he uses gold, gold stocks and commodity-related equities to combat inflation.
 Similarly, Mr. Roge seeks to hedge his clients' portfolios against inflation by overweighting natural resources stocks and international stocks on the equity side. 
 ''You can't think of bonds in a vacuum,'' he said. ''You have to think of the overall portfolio.''

HEADLINE: When Children Are Left Behind, The Economy Is, Too

BYLINE: By Hubert B. Herring

 BODY:
Perhaps the nation's mantra should be ''Leave no economy behind.'' Leaving no child behind, after all, is a noble-sounding goal, but it assumes a concern for the child in question that, alas, may not be firmly lodged in every heart across the land. 
 But what if our educational shortcomings could be put in strictly economic terms, instead of being part of a humanitarian debate? What, in short, does it cost the nation when a child drops out of high school? That was the focus of a symposium at Teachers College at Columbia University last week called ''The Social Costs of Inadequate Education,'' part of the college's Campaign for Educational Equity.
The answer is hundreds of billions of dollars. Looking at taxes alone, the researchers calculated that federal and state income tax receipts would be at least $50 billion higher each year if every high school dropout had graduated instead. And billions more are lost, the researchers figure, to added health costs and increased crime. Hubert B. Herring

HEADLINE: Is It Time for a Higher Gas Tax?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 As a born-and-bred New Yorker now living in California, I can state with confidence that only residents of New York City could offer such an obtuse economic remedy for our dependence on foreign oil.
 People who need to drive (those everywhere in America except Manhattan) would adjust in the aggregate to the higher price of gasoline and simply spend less on other consumer items.
 Increasing taxes would simply draw even more money away from other sectors of the economy and deposit it into the hands of oil companies, oil producers and the government that loves them.

HEADLINE: Is It Time for a Higher Gas Tax?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Your arguments for raising the federal gasoline tax to curb ''gas-guzzling behavior'' are persuasive. Americans -- rural, urban and suburban -- will change their transportation habits only when their preferred modes of transit become too economically painful to maintain. 
 Your suggestion that lawmakers consider using gas-tax revenue to buy back S.U.V.'s is incongruous with this reality. When many S.U.V. purchases were made, gasoline and diesel fuel were relatively cheap, but the possibility of significantly higher prices was hardly unpredictable.
Rewarding these drivers by buying back their guzzlers would create little financial incentive for making wise, long-term transit choices. Instead, it would signal that the government is willing to bail out well-to-do consumers for their bad decisions.
 You rightly point out that gas taxes are ''painfully regressive.'' For this reason, any revenues should be spent to help those whose dreams of buying an S.U.V. are eclipsed by a longing for more efficient public transit.

HEADLINE: In the Heart of Queens, a Spray of Edelweiss

BYLINE: By JEFF VANDAM. 
E-mail: streetlevel@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A FEW Sundays ago, Monica Strauss went back to the school on the hill, the school on Kew Gardens Road. It had not changed much in the last 50-odd years: three stories of red brick, with sculptured heads of hooded men peering down at the schoolyard below. The words ''Public School 99'' were still there in concrete above the front doors, though the steps below are now painted yellow for safety.
 It is an ordinary scene, one that passers-by can encounter in countless city neighborhoods. But in the late 40's and early 50's, when Ms. Strauss attended P.S. 99, Kew Gardens was notable as the new home of German and Austrian refugees from the Nazis. Jewish and often highly educated, these transplants brought their culture to New York, and a result was a Little Germany in Queens. German was heard on the street corners, education was highly prized and, as in a European hamlet, no one was a stranger. 
''There's something mystical about the place,'' Robert Lieberman, another P.S. 99 graduate, said of the old neighborhood. ''It's the sense of a real village, where everybody knew everybody. As a child, you had no secrets.''
 It was this special past that had brought Ms. Strauss and more than 50 other P.S. 99 alumni to Kew Gardens on this overcast Sunday, all at Mr. Lieberman's behest. 
 By day, Mr. Lieberman teaches physics at Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y. But six months ago, he wrote an article called ''Kew Gardens Remembered'' for a community Web site, oldkewgardens.com, and the response was overwhelming, with e-mail messages from Kentucky, California, London and China. Apparently, the distinctive place -- with its curving streets and Tudor-style shops -- retained its mystical pull, and so Mr. Lieberman, who is also a film director and a novelist, decided to make a documentary about the old days in the neighborhood. Ms. Strauss, an art historian, agreed to assist. 
 On the gray Sunday, Mr. Lieberman arrived in a black leather jacket and a red scarf, camera crew in tow. Once everyone had gathered at the school, group pictures were taken, and Mr. Lieberman conducted a few interviews. Several members of his own class, of 1954, were there. 
 ''They're all high achievers,'' said Mr. Lieberman, whose father had three doctorates. ''They're all very interesting and they're smart. There was incredible pressure to succeed for all of us.'' 
 For Ms. Strauss, there was another surprise: Ed Feige. When she was a child, she and Mr. Feige lived in the same building, and as she would try to leave the elevator, Mr. Feige would hold the outer door closed -- in effect, the building bully. 
 ''It's one of those childhood nightmares that you never got out of,'' Ms. Strauss said. Of Mr. Feige now, she added, ''He is a very pleasant retired professor of economics.''
 The group then took a local tour, proceeding down Lefferts Boulevard, past Maple Grove Cemetery and the former First Church of Kew Gardens, now the Sung Shin Reformed Church of Kew Gardens. They then walked to the so-called Ponte Vecchio, a bridge on Lefferts that is home to those beloved Tudor-style storefronts, some now clad in aluminum siding. 
 At one point, Ms. Strauss said, the stores were all German: the candy store, the butcher shop. But the alumni found the Taystee Gardens Chinese restaurant, Linda's Organic Kitchen and Market, and Pac-A-Flic Video. Still, one of the old stores remained, a delicatessen, the Homestead Gourmet Shop. Everyone remembered it. 
 After lunch at Austin's Steak and Ale House, the alumni gathered at the home of Renee Levine on 82nd Avenue. People recalled their experiences with anti-Semitism and their teenage rebellion -- the day's most intense experience, as Ms. Strauss put it. One woman said she had declined to tell her parents about anti-Semitism at school to protect their feelings; others spoke of rebelling by marrying non-Jews or even ''an American'' -- anything to blend in, to leave the past behind.
 Mr. Lieberman is shooting more interviews, and he wants to attract more funding to finish the film. And he hopes to get that other famous son of Kew Gardens, Jerry Springer, on film, or at least to name the movie after him. 
 ''Can I use his name in the title?'' Mr. Lieberman asked. ''Or does he have a trademark on the thing?''

HEADLINE: Anatomy of a Deal, New Jersey Style 

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: CAMDEN 

 BODY:
IN a mostly empty courtroom here, a case brought by a small real estate developer that was jilted by a small town drew little attention as it unfolded over the past month. But the evidence reached all the way to Trenton, opening a window on the hugely profitable redevelopment business in New Jersey.
 The view is not pretty. At its center is what one lawyer in the case called ''the ultimate backroom deal.''
 Perhaps the most striking statement in evidence was an e-mail message from a well-connected lawyer to his client, the biggest redevelopment company working in the state: ''How are we doing with the contribution for Gov. McGreevey? Please let me know. It is getting awkward.'' 
 There was more, especially in a trail of e-mail messages obtained by the plaintiffs -- some of them retrieved by court order after they were deleted -- that showed how the redeveloper, Cherokee Investment Partners, won the Pennsauken waterfront. 
 In one exchange, a Cherokee official spoke of cultivating ''relations with the power brokers.'' A clutch of local officials, referred to as ''the boys,'' were portrayed as instruments of George E. Norcross III, the powerful South Jersey Democratic leader. One message to the governor's office reminded that the boys were ''good soldiers'' who depended on him to overrule his environmental commissioner. 
 The trial in Camden, in the case of Vineland Construction Company v. Township of Pennsauken, ended last week after a month of testimony, and the judge in the nonjury case said he expected to issue a decision Dec. 13. 
 The case concerns only the slice of the riverfront that Vineland owns. But the testimony and correspondence touched on the proposed development of Petty's Island, an uninhabited former industrial site, which has become an explosive political issue. And the evidence shed light on the political fraternity that shepherded the deal and gave the Pennsauken waterfront and Petty's Island to Cherokee.
 The Petty's Island plan infuriated environmental advocates, and at first they had an ally in the state's environmental commissioner, Bradley M. Campbell. But Cherokee, a North Carolina company that in the last half-dozen years has also been awarded contracts to clean up and redevelop contaminated sites in the Meadowlands, Camden, Elizabeth and other urban areas, had its own allies in Trenton.
 The company was especially well positioned in the governor's office. Gov. James E. McGreevey's chief counsel, Michael DeCotiis, was the son of the lawyer whose firm represented Cherokee, and the governor's chief of staff, James P. Fox, was registered as a lobbyist for Cherokee before he joined the administration.
 Even in a state jaded by stories about bosses and greased real estate deals, the Pennsauken case provides campaign material for Republicans -- and especially their gubernatorial candidate, Douglas R. Forrester -- protesting about a Democratic culture of corruption. The Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Senator Jon S. Corzine, has already been accused of bowing to Mr. Norcross and other local Democrats intent on developing Petty's Island. 
 Vineland Construction says the township, after supporting its proposal to redevelop its piece of the Pennsauken waterfront, surreptitiously shunted it aside in late 2003 at the behest of Cherokee. Unless the judge rules otherwise, the township may now take Vineland's property by eminent domain and sell it to Cherokee. 
 The lawyer for Vineland, Lloyd D. Levenson, said in his closing statement, ''This was a backroom deal with front room justification.''
 Lawyers for Cherokee and the township say there is nothing wrong with municipal officials sidelining one developer in favor of another, even without a bidding process, and nothing nefarious about lobbying. 
 Whether this deal constituted an abuse of discretion by township officials is for Judge Francis J. Orlando Jr. of the State Superior Court to decide. But Pennsauken's way of doing business -- or Cherokee's -- is a political issue now.
 In the march toward the billion-dollar redevelopment project, the township and Cherokee enlisted a large cast. The e-mail messages in evidence reveal only a few threads in the deal-making process; most were sent by just two people, Louis S. Bezich, the township's economic development consultant, and Eric D. Wisler, a managing partner in the influential law firm DeCotiis, FitzPatrick, Cole & Wisler, which is representing Cherokee.
 But the messages identify the principal helpers, including Mr. Norcross; M. Robert DeCotiis, who is Mr. Wisler's partner, Michael DeCotiis's father, and himself a former chief legal counsel to Gov. James Florio; Joseph Salema, hired by the DeCotiis firm as a consultant and a former chief of staff to Mr. Florio, who pleaded guilty to securities fraud in 1995; and Susan Bass Levin, Mr. McGreevey's commissioner of community affairs and currently the Corzine campaign's chief of operations.
 The township's plan to revitalize Pennsauken's Delaware River waterfront, occupied mainly by aging and abandoned industrial buildings on weedy, polluted expanses, took shape during the state's early wave of urban redevelopment in the late 1990's. 
 Several years later, Vineland Construction drew its own plan to redevelop its property with new housing, while the township acquired some other waterfront land. At about the same time, Cherokee was negotiating to buy Petty's Island from the Citgo Petroleum Corporation, an oil company based in Venezuela. 
 In December 2003, Cherokee was designated the redeveloper of the waterfront in neighboring Camden, which extends to the edge of Vineland Construction's property at the Pennsauken border. Then Cherokee decided to pursue Pennsauken's riverfront. 
 The catch was Petty's Island. The 300-acre tract was to be the showpiece of Cherokee's Delaware River redevelopment, and without it the company said it did not want the Pennsauken deal. 
 But Citgo was no longer interested in selling. Facing liability of millions of dollars for environmental damage on several of its sites in New Jersey, Citgo was now proposing to do its own cleanup of Petty's Island and turn it over to the state as a wildlife preserve and deduct what the state hoped to charge the corporation for environmental damage its operations have caused at sites around New Jersey. 
 Mr. Campbell, the environmental commissioner, was initially receptive.
 Cherokee and the township grew nervous. While township officials maintained at the trial that they did not choose Cherokee as the redeveloper until May 2004, the e-mail correspondence reveals a frenzied effort starting in February to announce the deal, including Petty's Island, and to sign up the governor as a participant. On March 9, James McQueeny, Cherokee's public relations adviser who is the chairman of Winning Strategies and a former colleague of Mr. Fox (known as Jamie), wrote to Mr. Wisler: ''The gov's office called a little while ago offering 'beginning of April.' I said that was absolutely unacceptable. They came back from Jamie with a March 30 1 p.m. date, which I said is still a problem.'' 
 On March 31, having no assurances from the governor, ''the boys'' sent a plea to Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox, as it happens, registered as a lobbyist for Cherokee on ''brownfields redevelopment'' in 2001, when he was at the lobbying firm Winning Strategies Washington, though the firm's federal disclosure forms show that it did no work for the company before Mr. Fox left months later to join the McGreevey administration.
 The message from David Luthman, Pennsauken's municipal attorney, began, ''Jamie: I know you are aware of the Petty's Island story.'' It described local Democratic officials as ''good soldiers'' who ''have provided numerous opportunities for this governor to shine.''
 There is no record of a response from Mr. Fox, who declined to comment publicly on his relationship with Cherokee.
 Also on March 9, Mr. Wisler wrote to Tom Darden, Cherokee's chief executive, to discuss a donation to a local arts group. He added, ''On another front, how are we doing with the contribution for Gov. McGreevey?'' He concluded, ''It is getting awkward.''
 Nothing in the exchange explains the circumstances of Mr. Wisler's request, and Mr. Wisler did not return a call seeking comment. Jeffrey D. Smith, Cherokee's lawyer at the trial and a partner of Mr. Wisler, said the message referred to a commitment made a year earlier. ''That's why it was getting awkward,'' Mr. Smith said, 
 Mr. Wisler also kept trying to assure agitated local officials that the DeCotiis firm and Cherokee were not neglecting them and had kept Mr. Norcross informed. ''We are all being held hostage by the commissioner's actions and inactions,'' Mr. Wisler wrote on April 16.
 Then Cherokee's most influential emissary, the elder Mr. DeCotiis, met with Mr. McGreevey, and Mr. Wisler reported to Pennsauken officials that ''the governor gave assurances that the island would not be turned into a state park'' and that ''he believed Campbell would be cooperative.'' 
 On May 27, the township finally announced the $1 billion Cherokee project. There had been no bidding process -- it is not required by law -- and no public hearings. In September the state rejected Citgo's offer, citing the contamination on Petty's Island and the opposition of local officials. Mr. Campbell said last week that ''the governor made clear that we should not accept a donation that would preclude any development at all.'' 
 In the meantime, from 2001 to 2004, Cherokee and its consultants had contributed almost $1.5 million to the Democratic State Committee. 
 Mr. Levenson, the lawyer for Vineland Construction, said in his closing statement at the trial that ''we know the way Cherokee does business, and the way Pennsauken wants to do business: If you're a good soldier, you ought to get what you need.'' 
 But Mr. Smith told the judge that ''nobody has to make any apologies'' for lobbying or calling in public relations experts. 
 In an interview later, Mr. Smith said: ''There was a lot of innuendo about reaching out to so and so: 'Can we get a meeting next week?' But that's exactly what they should be doing.''
 The township's lawyer, William Tambussi, said of the Pennsauken officials: ''They liked Vineland's proposals. They liked Cherokee's better. They had an absolute right to do that.'' 
 Mr. Tambussi, who also represents Mr. Norcross, has contended that Mr. Norcross, too, has every right to lobby on matters concerning Pennsauken, his hometown. Last week, when asked about Mr. Norcross's role in the deal, Mr. Tambussi said that Mr. Norcross did not write any of the e-mail messages produced in the trial but had merely received copies. ''His involvement is passive, to say the least,'' Mr. Tambussi said. 
 Not all of the e-mail messages involve the McGreevey administration. One was sent to the township administrator and press secretary by Cherokee's public relations firm shortly before a scheduled interview with an editorial writer from The Star-Ledger of Newark. The message cautioned that the journalist ''will be looking to see if 'the fix is in.' ''

HEADLINE: A Sideline Outshines the Main Line

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IN their quest for artistic creativity and commercial profitability, cotton is their canvas, and it suits them to a T. 
 Well, to a T-shirt.
For the last five years, Rebecca and Paul Steinman have been building a business in Brooklyn producing screen-printed T-shirts -- an enterprise that they started, in part, to supply another company that Mr. Steinman was already operating.
 The other company specialized in renting equipment for movie shoots, and Mr. Steinman often had T-shirts made that he handed out to promote that business. He ordered the shirts from companies that embellished items to order. 
 In 2000, Ms. Steinman said recently, she and her husband decided that they knew enough about screen-printing to produce the shirts themselves. Moreover, she said, they decided to start a business that would screen-print T-shirts for other companies that wanted them for distribution as promotional products, gifts or mementos. 
 And as part of their new venture, they would also screen-print their own line of designer T-shirts for sale to the public.
 ''I wanted to satisfy my own creative urge, to put my own work out there,'' said Ms. Steinman, 32, who majored in theater at the University of Michigan with a concentration in costume design. Shortly after they were married in 1999, she began working in her husband's movie equipment rental business, which he had started with a partner in the early 1990's.
 She and Mr. Steinman, 35, called their screen-printing business Quist Industries Ltd. -- a name that might not indicate what the company makes but ''stands for quality, utility, innovation, style and technology,'' Ms. Steinman said. In 2001, Quist's first full year of operation, it had $14,000 in sales, she said. By last year, annual sales were up to $90,000, and she estimated that this year they would be more than $120,000. 
 Despite the rising revenues, though, the business remained in the red until last year, when ''we just about broke even,'' Ms. Steinman said, adding that she expected only a slight profit this year. As with many growing businesses in their early years, the increased revenue has been made possible by increased capital investment and staffing, which, of course, has raised costs.
 The Steinmans hired their first full-time Quist employee, a studio assistant, in January 2004, and they currently have two full-time workers, a printer and a saleswoman. They have bought a $40,000 automatic screen-printing press, with a production capacity of several hundred shirts an hour, replacing the hand press that Ms. Steinman said could produce no more than about 100 shirts an hour.
 In screen-printing, a stencil of an image is produced on a screen of mesh material -- polyester in Quist's case -- that has been stretched over a frame, and a special ink is applied through the stencil to adorn the fabric. Photo-sensitive emulsions, a light table with a high-intensity light, and a dryer with a conveyor belt are also among the materials and machinery in the company's production line in an old industrial building on the waterfront in Red Hook.
 The Steinmans continue to operate the movie equipment rental business, Dragon's Head Productions, at the same location, but they are spending an ever greater portion of their time on Quist. Mr. Steinman said he thought they would phase out Dragon's Head ''somewhere down the road'' to concentrate entirely on the print-screening business.
 These days, about 80 percent of Quist's revenue comes from jobs done under contract for other parties, including companies, nonprofit groups and designers who are putting out their own lines of screen-printed merchandise but contracting with companies like Quist to apply the adornments. T-shirts are still two-thirds of Quist's contract jobs, but now the company also embellishes items like tote bags and baseball hats. It also does embroidery.
 Ms. Steinman said she hopes to increase her company's own line of designer T-shirts, which are sold in small stores, from 20 percent to 50 percent of revenue. ''We've produced about three dozen designs and are now showing about a dozen,'' she said, pointing to a row of shirts that are part of the company's ''urban wildlife series.''
 Among the colorful images is an orange and brown squirrel adorning a gray shirt. (On a pink shirt the squirrel is fuchsia and black.) There is also a pigeon, ''our biggest seller,'' Ms. Steinman said, and a rat, which also does well. And a giant cockroach. ''People love it or can't stand it,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Fusion: Honesty May Be the Best Policy

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
EVERY time a new car comes out, the spin cycle starts. Engineers point to features that no one has offered before. The manufacturer projects rosy sales. Public relations types promise that America is going to love the all-new (fill in carefully focus-group-vetted model name here). 
 But something seemed different this fall at the debut of the 2006 Ford Fusion, a midsize sedan aimed at the vast heart of the car market (along with its similar stablemates, the Mercury Milan and Lincoln Zephyr). 
As expected, Ford promised that the new models would make the company a contender again in the crucial midsize class. But there was a new wrinkle: one by one, Ford functionaries pulled me aside to say, ''I think you are going to like this car.'' 
 They were right. Ordinarily, when it comes to the bland, uninspiring and uniform universe of midsize cars, I'm like Mikey in the old cereal commercial -- I don't like anything. I initially viewed the Fusion as a smaller version of the uninteresting Ford Five Hundred, which landed in the market last year with a thud. But the Fusion quickly convinced me that it has the stuff to make Ford a middleweight contender again.
 As dull, utilitarian and sensible as they tend to be, midsize sedans are big business, with high-volume heavyweights like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry slugging it out each year for the American car-sales crown. Ford was once a contender, too; its soon-to-be-discontinued Taurus was the sales leader in 1992-96. 
 Each of the three new models from Ford is about the same size as the class leaders and uses the same market-tested front-drive configuation -- in this case, a vehicle platform borrowed from the highly regarded Mazda 6. They are also priced to undercut most competitors, with base prices starting at $17,145 for the Fusion, $18,995 for the Milan and $29,660 for the Zephyr.
 The basic Fusion is propelled, somewhat somnambulantly, by an in-line four-cylinder engine displacing 2.3 liters and producing 160 horsepower. In fairness, the four-cylinder Accord offers similar horsepower and the Camry less. Ford's engine is economical, with a highway rating of about 30 m.p.g. It is also eco-friendly, earning a ''partial zero emissions vehicle'' rating in California. PZEV's eliminate evaporative emissions from the fuel system and can run cleaner than a hybrid. 
 The other engine, the 3-liter Duratec V-6, makes more horsepower (221) than either of the Camry V-6's; Honda now has an Accord with 244 horsepower.
 With the V-6, the Fusion offers the segment's only six-speed automatic, and can knock off 0-to-60 m.p.h. runs in 8 seconds. The V-6 is intended to run on regular fuel; Toyota and Honda recommend premium. 
 A full hybrid powertrain is to be offered by the 2008 model year.
 The Fusion's design is not trendy or ground-breaking, as the rounded-off Taurus was when it arrived in the square-cut mid-1980's. Yet it seems to hit a hard-to-define sweet spot in styling, just as enduring models like the 1957 Ford Fairlane once did.
 The highest compliment to the styling might be to say it is well executed, in a simple, straightforward, honest way. ''Even standing still, Fusion conveys a strong sense of direction,'' said Peter Horbury, Ford's executive director of design. In front there is a strong grille with thick bright bars and swept-back headlamps that recall the final version of the Honda Prelude. There is no shortage of exterior brightwork; spoke wheels add a nice finishing touch.
 The model that comes off poorly by comparison is the Ford Five Hundred, a larger, heavier sedan that is dragged around by a 203-horsepower V-6 and an underwhelming continuously variable transmission.
 Compared with the Five Hundred, the Fusion seems much more tightly put together. Its rack-and-pinion steering is a delight; taut and precise, with relatively high effort that gives the car a class-above feel. There is a bit of torque pull that tugs at the steering wheel under heavy and sustained acceleration, but nothing egregious. The car handles with aplomb in everyday conditions.
 Like the exterior styling, the interior benefits from understatement, with clear, logical controls where they belong. The leather seats on my test car were nicely appointed and posture-pedically supportive. In the back is another example of how Ford did an honest job on this vehicle; some automakers play tricks to create rear legroom by downsizing the seat. Ford has not; the cushions are large and nicely proportioned.
 Three eye-pleasing interior color schemes are available, from total black to light ivory, or a mixture. The instrument panel is logical, with well-placed, clearly marked gauges.
 On concrete roadways, the cabin was a bit noisier than I'd like, but otherwise quiet and well insulated. The interior seemed better isolated from the chassis than one might expect, with little vibration or engine whine.
 To me, Ford's one misstep is in the mixed message that its high-performance advertising and promotion send about a meat-and-potatoes car. For instance, the Fusion is Ford's new entry in Nascar, where it will race with a V-8 and rear drive. 
 Ford has also given its blessing to custom versions with multicolor paint, outrageous interiors, lowered suspensions, outsize wheels and low-profile tires, to be displayed this week at the Specialty Equipment Manufacturers' show in Las Vegas.
 Smart styling should help to mitigate some of the more confusing aspects of Ford's campaign. When my test was ending, a bystander noticed the car and ran up, exclaiming, ''Wow, is that a great car or what?'' 

INSIDE TRACK: R.I.P., Five Hundred.

HEADLINE: Sergeant Guzman's War

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MASCIA

 BODY:
THE lanky 15-year-old with the velvety skin flashed a deceptive grin at the man in combat fatigues standing near the curb. ''You ain't no good!'' she shouted at the soldier. ''You stealing these young people!''
 Staff Sgt. Richard Guzman looked up from the crowd of black and Hispanic students clustered near the entrance to the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics, a high school in East Harlem. Sidling over to the girl, he held out his hand. ''Hey,'' he said, his voice a sleepy mix of fine Long Island sand and honey.
''It's nothing against you,'' she replied without extending a hand. ''It's people like you.'' Then she scurried across East 116th Street, another battle lost in the war for New York's youth. But no matter. As far as Sergeant Guzman was concerned, the neighborhood remained ripe with possibilities. ''Everybody's thought about the military,'' he said later as his dark eyes scanned the neighborhood's pedestrian-clogged streets. ''I mean, look at all the people here.'' 
 Sergeant Guzman, 26, is station commander of the Army recruiting unit in the Armed Forces Career Center, known informally as the Harlem Knights recruiting center, on 125th Street and Lenox Avenue. A product of a hardscrabble upbringing in Richmond Hill, Queens, he joined the Army after high school largely to straighten himself out. Today, he presides over a warren of rooms across the street from Bill Clinton's office that is one of the more powerful of the engines that keep an increasingly unpopular war up and running. 
 With a monthly average of five recruits, the Harlem Knights center, which serves both Harlem and East Harlem, is ranked in the top three in its battalion, which includes much of the New York metropolitan region. Since his arrival 10 months ago, Sergeant Guzman has signed up 12 people.
 This is not an easy time to be a military recruiter. Last week, fatalities from the war reached 2,000, and last month a New York Times/CBS News poll showed that the number of Americans who thought that the United States had made the right decision in taking military action against Iraq had fallen to 44 percent.
 Much has been said about the efficacy of plying poor minority neighborhoods for recruits. But several factors make Sergeant Guzman's job easier. 
 Unlike the Marines, Army infantry and Special Forces, which send volunteers straight from boot camp to the front lines, the Harlem Knights Army unit signs potential recruits up for more than 200 noncombat jobs, everything from laundry and textile specialist to flute player to dental specialist. Sergeant Guzman cannot guarantee that his recruits will not go to Iraq; in fact, he acknowledges, about half of them will probably end up there, though not necessarily on the front lines. But the higher a recruit scores on the basic military aptitude test, the more noncombat specialties are available. ''Pulling a trigger is not technically complicated,'' he said.
 Sergeant Guzman also attributes the Army's relative success among the youth of Harlem and East Harlem to the problems that continue to plague those neighborhoods, notably poor schools and dismal job prospects. He has scoped out prospective recruits living in apartments with three people to a room and no bed. 
 ''I can recruit two to three people a month,'' Sergeant Guzman said, ''no matter if it's World War III or a recession.'' 

Smooth Talker
 Sergeant Guzman's skills of persuasion are not limited to sidewalk encounters. The other day, with the soothing, gravelly tones of a late-night disc jockey, he was on the phone, trying to lure an unsure 21-year-old girl into military service. ''I'm gonna keep it real with you, and you gonna keep it real with me,'' he murmured into the receiver. ''I'm setting you up for success. When you actually go to boot camp, you're gonna be well trained.'' 
 Then he tried another tack: ''Imagine your wedding. I can see you in your uniform.'' He laughed a throaty laugh, his lips parted to reveal a full white smile. ''An Army dress? Yeah, a camouflaged wedding dress.'' 
 Later, as the rhymes of Jay-Z poured out of a stereo perched on a bookshelf, Sergeant Guzman tapped away on his laptop, courting the 18-to-24 demographic via e-mail.
 Near the entrance to the office, under a yellow banner that reads ''An Army of One,'' a bulletin board presented photos of 50 young men and women, mostly black and Hispanic, with whom his approach had succeeded. Each photo listed the recruit's name, age, high school or college from which he or she had been recruited, and his or her enlistment bonus. Nearby was a postcard addressed to Sergeant Guzman from a recruit at boot camp. ''Greetings from Henderson, Nevada!'' it read. ''Thank you for helping me enlist in the U.S. Army!'' 
 Though so far only a few of Sergeant Guzman's recruits have been sent to Iraq, each time he receives a letter from the parents of a deployed soldier, he ships ''his'' recruit a care package that contains copies of Jet magazine and Sports Illustrated and homemade tapes of Hot 97 radio broadcasts.
 Sergeant Guzman will not be going to Iraq himself. ''Recruitment is very safe as far as deployment is concerned,'' he said. Nevertheless, he admits: ''Half of me wants to go. The money is ridiculous.''
 While a dental assistant, for example, can net $1,400 a month, a young soldier in combat can net $2,000 to $2,500 a month, tax free. With enlistment bonuses and tuition assistance topping out at $40,000, it pays for Harlem recruits to be An Army of One. 
 It pays for Sergeant Guzman, too. Of $2,496 he receives as a monthly housing allowance, he pays $2,000 to live in a three-bedroom apartment in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and pockets the difference. He travels to work in a government-provided 2005 Dodge Stratus. With his $2,600 monthly income, plus the $425 monthly ''special duty pay'' that recruiters receive, he can indulge in his passion for diamond stud earrings, vintage X-Men comic books and sports jerseys that can cost up to $400 apiece. 
 On the advice of a colonel friend, Sergeant Guzman has begun to invest in the stock market; his portfolio includes G.E., Home Depot and Janus Funds. ''I try to stay diversified,'' he explained.
 Just recently, he bought his first Rolex. It cost $8,000. ''Everything I've ever wanted in life, the Army's provided for me,'' he said, sipping a Capri Sun from its silver pouch. 

In Search of a Calling
 It was a different story for Sergeant Guzman 22 years ago, when his father was gunned down on a street in Richmond Hill ''for being at the wrong place at the wrong time.'' The son, who was 4, suspects there is more to the story, but his mother, Carmen Guzman, a retired cosmetologist, would just say, ''Your daddy's in a better place.''
 An only child, Richard Guzman was 15 and, as he put it, ''hanging out with the wrong crowd'' when a fellow he knew pointed a gun at his face and demanded his Nikes, a trendy pair of Bo Jacksons. ''I kind of had lowlife friends,'' he admitted. 
 That year, 1994, two friends robbed a bodega and killed the cashier. ''I was so close to being involved,'' Sergeant Guzman said. ''I'm very lucky to be alive.'' 
 A couple of years later, with family and friends in the service and certain that ''school really wasn't my thing,'' he enrolled in the Army's delayed-entry program, in which he participated in monthly drills and some basic training. After he scored well on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, the basic aptitude test for entrance to the military, a recruiter came calling. 
 What Sergeant Guzman calls the laid-back job choices appealed to him, and he decided to become an administration clerk. After nine weeks in boot camp and postings in Fort Bragg, N.C., Seattle and Alaska, he became attracted to the idea of career recruiting, and spent four years working at a recruiting station in Astoria, Queens, before moving to Harlem. 
 He feels that he has found his perfect match. ''I don't think you'll ever find a recruiter like myself,'' he said. ''I love this business.''
 With its typical 8-a.m.-to-9-p.m. schedule, recruiting leaves him little time for a social life (although he keeps an updated black book, just in case). And around the office, he hears tales of recruiters in other jurisdictions who suffer nervous breakdowns while trying to reach their quotas. ''That's where the improprieties come in,'' he said. ''That's where you fake a diploma.''
 Though he won't be going to Iraq, he maintains that the Iraqi war was unavoidable. ''I don't see how we couldn't have gone,'' he said. ''The World Trade Center was attacked. The Pentagon was attacked. We had to do something.'' 
 And weapons of mass destruction?
 ''I'm thinking there are some there that we haven't found in the underground caves or whatever,'' he said. ''I believe that something is there, maybe Russian artillery. We have Hussein in custody, we killed his sons. We need him to confess or something.''

An Escape Route Out
 Unlike Sergeant Guzman, Alanna Chataigne does not support the war and thinks the American troops should come home immediately.
 ''It's just causing more terrorist attacks, here and in London, us being over there,'' said Alanna, a 17-year-old of Haitian descent who wears clear-rimmed glasses and has braids pulled back into a ponytail. Still, Alanna, a senior enrolled in the R.O.T.C. program at the High School of Graphic Communication Arts in Midtown, participates in the Army's delayed-entry program, just as Sergeant Guzman did, and she is counting the days until she turns 18 so she can fly off to boot camp and leave Harlem behind. ''I have no life,'' she explained. ''With the knowledge I learn from the Army, I want to go around the world.''
 Precocious and poised, Alanna acts the way a teenager thinks that an adult should act. During one of her frequent visits to the Harlem recruiting station, she rattled off the chronology of the founding of the American armed forces -- ''I was born exactly 212 years after the Marine Corps,'' she announced proudly -- before waxing rhapsodic, in equal measure, about Mozart and the reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee.
 Showing up several times a week in her black and gold ''Army of One'' T-shirt, Alanna runs errands for the recruiters and banters with the officers. ''Watch the language!'' she scolded Sergeant Guzman one afternoon when he fired off an expletive. When he complained that his Snapple was too warm, she jumped up to get ice.
 ''The Army is in her blood,'' Sergeant Guzman said of Alanna's passion for the military, which is shared by a sister at Marine boot camp and a stepfather in the National Guard. But Sergeant Guzman also thinks that Alanna turned to the Army to escape a rough family life on West 130th Street -- basically, as Sergeant Guzman described it, ''that situation that any person has with a stepparent.''
 Alanna would agree that the Army offers an appealing escape route for her. ''My mom just wants me to get out of the city,'' she said. ''She wants me to see something different. She lived here all her life.''

A Battle for Hearts and Minds
 On a recent afternoon, Sergeant Guzman dropped by City College on Convent Avenue and 138th Street to obtain its ''stop-out'' list, a register of students who have dropped out of college midcareer and might be likely recruits. 
 Sergeant Guzman acknowledged that some high schools and colleges were resistant to his presence, and potential recruits often report back that their teachers try to dissuade them from military service. He finds this attitude downright unpatriotic.
 ''You'd think that given the times and needs of the country now, schools would be more understanding,'' he said, seeming perplexed by guidance counselors who encourage college over the military. ''I've got a mission from the president of the United States. These schools are not going to tell me what to do.'' 
 After a quick chat with a City College receptionist, he emerged with a thick stack of papers containing the names of thousands of recent dropouts ripe for recruiting. Holding up the list as a proud father would his newborn child, he said: ''All this is potential recruits. This gets me excited right here.''
 Heading back to his car, he elaborated on his approach.
 ''I don't like taking no for an answer,'' he said. ''I've got a mission to accomplish each month. And it's not just recruiting. If I say no, I won't get anywhere in life, man.'' Placing the list safely in the trunk next to the boxes of key chains, stickers and yellow water bottles he gives to potential recruits, he added: ''Like in the dating scene. Sometimes no means yes. She just says it to make you want her more, you know?''

Yo Soy El Army
 Every Harlem recruiter has goals: to make two appointments a day with prospective recruits, to get four of those recruits interviewed that week, and to administer an aptitude test to two of them with the hope of a single passing grade. 
 Although curious teenagers sometimes make their way to the Harlem office, most of the recruiting is done in the street, which was why Sergeant Guzman was out in front of the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics that late summer day. He had set up his folding table, which is wallpapered with images of soldiers in combat, in a patch of shade provided by the scaffolding that surrounded the school. As he laid out pens, blank address cards and stickers that read ''Yo Soy El Army,'' a small crowd of rowdy teenagers began peppering him with questions.
 ''If you go to the Army to play ball, you got to serve four years, man?''
 ''How many push-ups can you do?''
 ''Is it true they can kick you out?''
 ''You think they're gonna do that draft thing?''
 Sergeant Guzman nodded to this one.
 ''Oh, I am running from that!'' said a young man sporting a heavy gold chain.
 ''You might not have a choice,'' Sergeant Guzman replied dryly.
 To each teenager he offered earnest eye contact and a spirited handshake. He opened by asking, ''What year are you?'' and closed with, ''Do good in school.'' Some of the young people filled out the address cards, giving the Army their contact information; when they did, Sergeant Guzman watched over their shoulders like a hawk. Upon returning to the office, Sergeant Guzman would file the cards and call the young people who had filled them out. If a person sounded hesitant on the phone, Sergeant Guzman would send him or her information and phone once more in the hope of setting up an interview. 
 ''Who's a senior?'' he called into a crowd of teenagers outside the Manhattan Center school. Most were curious, but politely declined to volunteer their status. 
 ''Hello, I like your T-shirt,'' he said to a girl wearing a camouflage tank top. Smiling, she moved on.
 Sergeant Guzman greeted familiar faces by their first names. In his opinion, matching names to faces is part of the job. ''It's like if you were buying a car and the sales rep didn't remember your name,'' he said. ''You'd think it was funny.''
 While Sergeant Guzman followed one teenager down the street, a group of girls commandeered the folding table. ''Buenas,'' one of them said, handing out T-shirts to her friends as if she were a staff sergeant herself. Her friends began taking Sergeant Guzman's pens and attaching his stickers to their stomachs.
 On average, Sergeant Guzman estimates, each visit to a high school nets three or four interviews, two passing aptitude test scores and one recruit. This session would attract one teenager, who stopped by the recruiting center a few days later, failed the test, and was sent home by Sergeant Guzman to study.
 The crowd at Manhattan Center High had dispersed into the bright summer day. But before leaving, Sergeant Guzman plastered ''Yo Soy El Army'' stickers onto the scaffolding poles. Just in case.

HEADLINE: Where Familiarity Breeds Contentment

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE LYNESS

 BODY:
I HAVE a thing for neighborhood restaurants. At their best, they emphasize comfort and familiarity, food without pretense. Regulars are recognized and appreciated. The food is neither too formal nor too expensive to eat regularly, and consistency is more important than exceptional cuisine. There should either be a few dishes that we love, or we need to like the chef's cooking well enough that we will eat much of what he or she cooks.
 Assaggio, a smallish, contemporary Italian restaurant just off Main Street in Branford, fits into the former category. There are some things it does better than others. 
Some may argue that it's too pricey for a neighborhood place, but it's not out of line with the economics of the shore, I'm afraid. Assaggio, which means ''a taste'' in Italian, does a nice job of making its clientele feel at home. Service there has been low-key but impeccable in my experience. The staff is serious about the job. 
 The menu is largely Italian with some Asian influences. The best dishes are the more traditional choices. A pane cotto appetizer of escarole, white beans and bread cubes, under a crust of parmigiano cheese, is hearty, tasty and uncomplicated. So is the white bean and tomato soup, which it resembles. (The tortellini soup hasn't much taste.)
 Crab and rock shrimp in well-made crepes are exceptionally tender, and the Madeira sauce, though thick, is delicious. But the broccoli rabe crepes can be bitter, and the puree is something of a mush. 
 Sauteed veal scallops with pancetta, eggplant and mozzarella are refreshingly delicate (this dish is often heavy) because everything is sliced so thin; the creamy tomato sauce with peas is neither too rich nor too sweet.
 Gnocchi made in-house are not ethereal but tender enough and satisfying; as an appetizer, they are served with a tomato sauce with duck confit, but the taste of the duck is lost in the tomato. Pork chops with sauteed potatoes and peppers in a well-seasoned brown sauce are an example of good home cooking.
 Forays into Asian cuisine are less successful. Chicken-arugula spring rolls are bland, and a balsamic glaze doesn't improve them. I have generally found reduced balsamic sauces to be acrid, not just this one at Assaggio.
 Tuna carpaccio -- four tiny squares of tuna on crackers drizzled with a spicy mayonnaise -- was disappointing at $9. But Little Neck clams steamed in lemon-grass broth were juicy and tasty.
 As a rule, beef and seafood steaks are cooked right, but the garnishes often don't work. Lobster cream sauce is overkill on the tenderloin. The spices on a pan-blackened swordfish competed with the spaghetti pesto. Wild salmon was beautifully cooked, but the accompanying ginger-soy risotto was too salty.
 Too many of the pasta sauces contain cream; it's hard to want to eat them regularly. The tomato cream sauce is quite rich and a little sweet; the rendition with peas served with the veal scallops is better. The Madeira cream sauce appears again on a dish of pappardelle with well-caramelized sweet scallops. Even pesto is creamy. Angel hair with shrimp, sun-dried tomatoes and shiitake mushrooms is lighter.
 Assaggio serves one of the better chocolate layer cakes I've eaten in this area: thin layers of moist cake sandwiched with bittersweet icing and drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauces. (I could do without the caramel.) White chocolate creme brulee is too viscous and dense with the chocolate, but if you like the sweet dairy taste of creme brulee, you'll love it here. Lemon sorbet with limoncello liqueur is tart, sweet and delicious. 
 Eat often at Assaggio, and you will be recompensed with a friendly welcome, genuine gratitude for your business and a bottle of after-dinner port on the table -- on the house. This kind of generosity and reward for loyalty is the hallmark of a neighborhood place.

HEADLINE: A Food Distributor 'Buys Local'

BYLINE: By BRIAN HALWEIL

 BODY:
WHEN Jeff Loshinsky, the executive chef at the Rockefeller Foundation in Midtown Manhattan, assembles a menu for its cafeteria, he is acutely aware of the ingredients' origins. Tomatoes from California. Apples from Washington State. Basil from as far away as Israel or Hawaii.
 ''This whole food economy is driven on this crazy transportation,'' Mr. Loshinsky said. ''And it's just not going to be feasible much longer.'' 
So in the interest of supporting local farmers and saving fuel and perhaps money, the foundation's staff and guests dined all summer on a Caprese salad composed entirely of local ingredients, including heirloom tomatoes from Latham Farms in Orient, basil from Satur Farms in Cutchogue and mozzarella made in Brooklyn. 
 As the weather turned cooler, Mr. Loshinsky began using stir-fry greens from Sang Lee Farms in Peconic, cabbage from Deer Run Farms in Brookhaven, cauliflower from Fred Terry Farms in Orient and potatoes from Edward Zilnicki in Riverhead. 
 These ingredients come courtesy of a new ''buy local'' program by J. Kings Food Service Professionals, one of Long Island's largest food distributors. Long Island chefs have long had some allegiance to local growers, but J. Kings makes buying local more convenient.
 J. Kings expanded its line of Long Island-grown produce in June, after its culinary advisers concluded that many New York and Long Island chefs wanted local produce but could not get to the farms to buy it. ''We said, 'Maybe we should see this as an opportunity,''' said John King, the company's founder and president. 
 National food distributors like Sodexho and Sysco have rolled out similar programs to support local farmers. For instance, in Minnesota, Sysco offers a Sysco Farmers' Market Web site, not dissimilar to the J. Kings Web site that allows chefs to select from more than two dozen Suffolk County farms selling a full line of seasonal fruits and vegetables. 
 Mr. King contends that his company can deliver this fresh flavor better than his national competitors while helping Long Island restaurants distinguish themselves from national chains and attract customers. The J. Kings headquarters in Holtsville are midway between Montauk and Manhattan and just a quarter-mile off the Long Island Expressway. 
 ''Our goal is to pick up North Fork produce in the afternoon and deliver it to the New York Stock Exchange the next morning,'' he said. (In contrast, it takes J. Kings four days to have a head of lettuce trucked from California.) ''If it costs me $3,000 to get a shipment of produce from California, I can split that with the farmer.'' 
 Still, the staff at J. Kings acknowledges that the ''buy local'' program is a work in progress. Empty J. Kings vehicles stop at farms after they have made deliveries to restaurants, cafeterias and grocers. At times, drivers have incurred overtime while waiting for farmers to come in from the fields, prepare the orders and load the trucks. 
 ''As soon as the season is over, we will just be starting to get good at it,'' said Herb Joynt, a produce manager at J. Kings. 
 Despite such glitches, the program provides convenience for busy chefs and busy farmers who do not have the staff or vehicles to make their own deliveries. 
 ''The ease of them being able to pick it up at the farm is definitely an attraction,'' said Chris Walbrecht of the Garden of Eve organic farm in Jamesport, which sold J. Kings zucchini and heirloom tomatoes in quantities that larger national distributors probably would not pick up -- as little as a single case. 
 Lyle Wells of Wells Homestead Acres, who has been a farmer in Riverhead for three decades, said that he had seen others try similar programs in the past.
 ''It's starting slow -- it always does,'' he said. ''The ultimate test is whether J. Kings will be able to do more business because it's local. Then we're creating a new market.''
 Although the program still represents a tiny share of the J. Kings produce business, the Long Island share has jumped for certain foods, said Joel Panagakos, the company's vice president for produce. 
 For instance, in recent years, 95 percent of the squash that J. Kings sold in summer was harvested in New Jersey or Canada. This summer, 30 to 40 percent came from Long Island. And all of the sweet corn was Long Island grown, up from 75 percent. 
 Most of the Long Island produce is sold in the original farm cases, but J. Kings has started slicing and processing Long Island-grown tomatoes for its kitchen-cut division, which offers processed foods. 
 ''With the fuel and the freight costs the way they are, the local farmers will always be able to put together that package at a cheaper rate,'' Mr. Panagakos said. 
 In fact, Eric Schrader, the owner of the Pines Pantry, a grocery store in Fire Island Pines that is a longtime J. Kings customer, said he was delighted with the expanded Long Island offerings, even when they cost more than alternatives. 
 ''It's worth the expense,'' he said. ''I'd much rather have a nice local heirloom than a California heirloom. It gets to me in better shape, and it's just a better tomato.''

HEADLINE: U.S. to Reduce Troops in Japan and Strengthen Military Ties

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
The United States and Japan announced Saturday a sweeping agreement to reshape their military alliance, including the reduction of marines on Okinawa and the construction of a new generation of radar equipment in Japan as part of a missile defense system.
 After a morning meeting of the two nations' foreign and defense ministers and secretaries, a joint agreement was released calling on Japan to accept more responsibility for its own defense, and requiring the United States and Japan to further integrate planning in case of conflict. The two sides agreed to greater sharing of intelligence and to expand joint military training and exercises. 
The document is yet another step in the evolution of modern Japan, which has already grown from a defeated adversary to an occupied nation to an economic powerhouse under the American security umbrella.
 The agreement and subsequent statements gave a clear indication of Japan's desire to take an even greater role in global security missions within constitutional constraints imposed at the end of World War II. The meeting came as Japan has troops on a humanitarian mission in Iraq, the first time Tokyo has deployed its forces into a combat zone since World War II.
 At a Pentagon news conference, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said the agreement would ''ensure a durable, more balanced and surely more capable alliance.''
 His counterpart, Yoshinori Ono, the director general of the Japanese Defense Agency, said that Japan is ready to move beyond territorial defense to play a greater role in contributing to ''peace and security around the world.''
 But Mr. Ono said Japanese military missions across Asia or around the globe would be for humanitarian and reconstruction efforts, or for logistical support to counterterrorism missions conducted with the United States.
 Although the use of the Japanese military beyond its territorial waters has been a striking extension for a nation that accepted pacifist limits in its postwar Constitution, Japan still would not insert combat troops into combat operations outside Japan.
 Ending a decade of negotiations on the placement of American troops within Japan, the agreement seeks to remove a severe irritant in relations by reducing American military personnel on Okinawa, where residents complain of noise and crime.
 The number of American military personnel in Japan, now about 50,000, will fall by 7,000 with the relocation of some Marine Corps units from Okinawa to Guam.
 Anger among Okinawans at the American military reached near-crisis levels in 1995, when a local schoolgirl was raped by American servicemen.
 The move also has significance for Guam, an American territory that is taking on increasing strategic importance in the Pacific.
 The agreement calls on Japan to deploy the American X-band radar, a part of missile defense that identifies and tracks incoming warheads. North Korea fired a missile over Japan in 1998, shocking the public there.
 The relocation of American forces on Japan and the reshaping of bilateral military headquarters is to be completed in six years. The cost of all movements of American forces in Japan will be paid by the Japanese government; no cost estimate was released Saturday at the conclusion of talks among Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. Ono, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the Japanese foreign minister, Nobutaku Machimura. President Bush is to visit Japan next month.
 American and Japanese officials also announced an agreement to remove American aircraft from Futenma Marine Air Corps Station in a southern part of Okinawa that is now highly urban. A large part of the aircraft and crews will move to expanded facilities at an existing base, Camp Schwab, farther north.
 The Pentagon news conference was held a day after Japan announced it had agreed to base a Nimitz-class American aircraft carrier in Yokosuka, 30 miles south of Tokyo, in 2008, the first time a nuclear-powered carrier has been allowed to use Japan as its home port.
 The Japanese public is especially concerned about the basing of nuclear-powered warships in its territory because Japan is the only country ever attacked with atomic weapons.

HEADLINE: For a Retainer, Lavish Care by 'Boutique Doctors'

BYLINE: By ABIGAIL ZUGER

DATELINE: BOCA RATON, Fla. 

 BODY:
It was on the plane from Shanghai to Beijing last year that Dorothy Lipson of Delray Beach, Fla., suddenly began to cough up blood: first in streaks, then in frightening, tissue-soaking spoonfuls. 
 But Mrs. Lipson, who was in China visiting an expatriate daughter, was lucky on two counts. First, her daughter happens to run a corporation that builds gleaming Western-style hospitals in China; Ms. Lipson was rushed to the Beijing hospital on landing. And second, Mrs. Lipson's internist back home in Florida is Dr. Bernard Kaminetsky, one of a new breed of ''concierge'' or ''boutique'' doctors who, in exchange for a yearly cash retainer, lavish time, phone calls and attention on patients, using the latest in electronic communications to streamline their care.
Since its debut in 1996, concierge medicine has evoked criticism from many corners. Some ethicists say it is exacerbating the inequities in American health care. Insurance regulators have raised concerns about fraud. Government watchdogs, worried that it threatens the tenuous equilibrium of the health care system, are keeping an eye on trends. 
 ''Concierge care is like a new country club for the rich,'' Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, said at a joint economic committee hearing in Congress last year. ''The danger is that if a large number of doctors choose to open up these types of practices, the health care system will become even more inequitable than it is today.''
 But for Mrs. Lipson, who pays $1,650 a year, the niceties enabled by concierge medicine can make all the difference.
 Dr. Kaminetsky was in daily touch with her doctors in Beijing. E-mail messages, X-ray reports and digitalized images flew back and forth. When the bleeding was stabilized and Mrs. Lipson returned home, Dr. Kaminetsky immediately connected her with a local specialist for a biopsy of her diseased lungs, and then with infectious disease experts for treatment of the unusual infection that was found. 
 Mrs. Lipson's long convalescence was seamless, with none of the snags that can magnify the misery of serious illness: no long hours in strange waiting rooms, no lost X-ray or culture reports, no contradictory pronouncements by specialists confused by missing information. Dr. Kaminetsky's office coordinated all her appointments, tests and treatments. He personally telephoned her with all results and saw her as often as necessary to make sure everything went smoothly. 
 Now, still on medication over 18 months later, Mrs. Lipson applauds her foresight in signing up for this deluxe model of medical care. The yearly expense, she points out, is far smaller than more traditional luxuries like cruises or late-model cars. ''I highly recommend it,'' she said. ''It's well worth the money.''

More Money, More Attention
 Anyone searching the country for a group of patients who are perfectly happy with their medical care, neither brutalized by the system nor fearful that the onset of a serious illness will plunge them into a morass of confusion and neglect, need look no farther than Dr. Kaminetsky's waiting room here in Boca Raton.
 Not that the waiting room usually has anyone in it. One promise made to patients paying for concierge service is that waiting will not be a part of their health care experience. Patients are guaranteed that phone calls will be returned promptly, appointments will be scheduled on a same-day basis if necessary, and appointment times will be honored. A bowl of fruit salad and platters of bagels and sponge cake set out for patients in the waiting room can go barely touched over the course of a day, and the television often plays to an empty couch. 
 A relatively simple tradeoff is responsible: the extra fees collected from patients let concierge doctors, who leave regular practice for concierge medicine, slash their caseloads. Before Dr. Kaminetsky became a concierge doctor five years ago he had 2,500 patients in his practice -- a standard number for most primary care internists. His list now numbers 600. 
 Sick and well alike, patients are delighted with the results.
 Joan Holzman, 69, takes no medicines and has no health problems; she comes to the office once a year for a physical exam, an X-ray, an electrocardiogram and blood tests. ''I adore it,'' Ms. Holzman said. ''Before, wherever you went you felt like cattle. But everyone here is top-notch -- the doctors, the secretaries, the nurses. They're warm, like family. It's a wonderful feeling of security.''
 Phoebe Kupps, 81, made a same-day appointment with Dr. Kaminetsky recently to discuss a scribbled list of minor problems, including her insomnia, her sinus congestion and an unpleasant sour taste in her mouth. For a half-hour (uninterrupted by ringing phones or any other distractions) she and Dr. Kaminetsky methodically reviewed her medications and considered ways to get rid of the bad taste and improve her sleep, including avoiding afternoon naps and alcoholic nightcaps, and turning the bedroom clock to the wall. 
 ''It's like having insurance and not using it,'' Mrs. Kupps said. ''I've been a well person. These little things are ridiculous. But here I can get them dealt with right away, they don't build up. I've heard stories from my friends, when they get ill, they can't get in to see their doctor for weeks.''
 Herbert Glickman, 75, has seen more than a dozen specialists since both of his knees were replaced in 2003, trying to find the cause of his persistent knee pain. He periodically drops off wads of consultation and test reports to add to his bulging file at Dr. Kaminetsky's office, and during long phone calls and appointments the two sort through the results. 
 When a month went by recently without a word from Mr. Glickman, Dr. Kaminetsky called him at home. ''He was calling to find out how I was,'' Mr. Glickman said in the tone of one discussing a miracle. ''I never heard that from any doctor!''
 Dr. Kaminetsky's practice is affiliated with a corporation called MDVIP, which he helped found. It processes the retainer fees, oversees the office's electronic capabilities and runs quality control to make sure the clerical staff members are courteous and make appointments with the promised alacrity. Nationwide about 250 medical practices and 100,000 patients have signed up with MDVIP and similar corporations, according to the professional society of concierge physicians, the Society for Innovative Medical Practice Design, founded in 2003. 
 These doctors charge fees as high as $10,000 a year, depending on the services promised. The majority charge $1,500 to $2,000. Basic services consist of same-day or next-day appointments and 24-hour telephone access to the doctor. The most expensive may also promise the doctor will make home visits, deliver medications and accompany patients on visits to other doctors.
 In Dr. Kaminetsky's practice of three doctors all the patients are concierge patients. Retired patients are sometimes enrolled by their children, who may also cover the retainer fees. About 10 percent of the patients are seen free of charge, ''scholarship patients'' who the doctors have decided are in real need of the extra services and whose yearly retainer fees are waived. Because the practice has a 96 percent annual retention rate, its waiting list of several hundred names moves up slowly.
 ''We turn people away every day,'' Dr. Kaminetsky said.

All About Numbers
 Despite the drastic decrease in patient load after he changed the way he ran his practice, Dr. Kaminetsky's personal compensation and the salaries of hisoffice staff members increased by about 60 percent.
 The arithmetic behind this seeming contradiction results from the low per-visit reimbursement rates set by Medicare for primary care office practices. Medicare now pays an internist like Dr. Kaminetsky slightly over $50 for an average office visit. Thus, a regular internist might earn about $200 a year from Medicare for caring for the average older patient with high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol but no other major health problems. 
 Other medical insurers follow Medicare fees closely, which is why office-based primary care doctors who accept insurance say they must see dozens of patients a day just to break even. 
 A concierge doctor charging the $1,650 MDVIP fee, though, makes at least $1,150 a year per patient (MDVIP retains $500 for its services). This huge increase in per-patient reimbursement allows the patient loads to be kept low.
 Primary care doctors also occasionally lower their patient loads by participating in only a few insurance plans, or, sometimes, in none at all. No one knows how many of these partly or completely ''fee-for-service'' practices operate in this country, or whether their number is increasing. 
 For office visits, these doctors set their own cash fees, which can be hundreds of dollars a visit, rivaling concierge medicine in out-of-pocket expense for the patient. Unlike concierge doctors, though, fee-for-service doctors do not enter into a formal legal contract with patients that enumerates the services patients will receive for the money.
 Some concierge practices operate exclusively on a cash basis. Others -- generally those with lower annual fees, like Dr. Kaminetsky's -- still participate in Medicare or other insurance plans. 
 These practices have reached an uneasy truce with insurers. Insurers forbid double billing for visits they cover, so the yearly concierge fees are specifically allocated for services that insurers do not cover, like annual physical exams and health reviews, preventive services like nutritional counseling and frills like a wallet-size CD containing an up-to-date medical history and test results for patients to carry with them.
 Even so, critics maintain that concierge services violate the spirit, if not the letter, of federal Medicare law, which aspires to regulate doctors' fees to a uniform standard and streamline access to medical care for the old and infirm. 
 After five senators wrote a letter of complaint to the Department of Health and Human Services in 2002, a formal examination was begun. Tommy G. Thompson, who headed the department at that time, concluded that as long as the retainer fee was clearly for services not covered by Medicare, collecting the fees did not violate the law.
 Subsequently, the Government Accountability Office examined trends in concierge medicine and concluded, in a report in August 2005, that the number of concierge physicians nationwide was still too small for the practice to limit Medicare patients' access to health care, but that the government would continue to monitor trends. 
 Some argue that concierge services actually save health care dollars. In Florida, for instance, internal MDVIP statistics indicate that concierge patients receive screening exams like mammograms and Pap smears more regularly than those with commercial insurance, and they require fewer hospital admissions, said Darin Engelhardt, the company's chief financial officer.
 ''As far as I'm concerned, we're saving Medicare money,'' Dr. Kaminetsky said.
 He pointed to cases like that of Philip Novack, 94. For Mr. Novack, who is in fragile health, Dr. Kaminetsky's office often becomes a low-stress alternative to the emergency room. One morning last summer, Mr. Novack woke up at 5 a.m. feeling unwell and asked his wife, Edythe Shane-Novack, to call an ambulance. A veteran of many similar emergencies, she waited till 9:02 a.m. and called Dr. Kaminetsky's office instead. 
 Less than three hours later Mr. Novack was perched on an examining table, smiling at the familiar faces in the office and receiving the same evaluation he would have had in the emergency room, including blood tests, an X-ray and a cardiogram. 
 The diagnosis, a slight imbalance in his blood sodium level, was made promptly, and Mr. Novack was better by the next morning. Instead of paying expensive emergency fees, Medicare would pay only for an office visit. ''This is the best thing that ever happened to us,'' Mrs. Shane-Novack said.

Perceptions
 Charges that concierge practices violate not financial ethics, but professional ethics, also abound.
 ''Philosophically, I think it's appalling,'' said David Barton Smith, professor of health services administration at Temple University in Philadelphia. ''It's creating a two-class system of medicine.'' 
 Critics have accused doctors who make the transition to a concierge practice from a regular one of abandoning patients who cannot afford to join up. Concierge doctors counter that when they convert their practices they do so over a transition period of several months, and always provide referrals to alternate sources of care, as mandated by the American Medical Association's code of ethics. 
 Other critics feel that concierge medicine hurts the profession's image. ''The public is already mistrustful of doctors' self interests,'' Dr. Jay Jacobson, a medical ethicist in Salt Lake City, wrote in 2002. ''Boutique practices exacerbate the distrust.''
 Others feel that concierge medicine is deeply at odds with the philosophy of primary care medicine, whose mandate is to care for all comers. Still others say it violates an unwritten code in which doctors must share the medical profession's duties equitably. In other words, if some doctors care for only a few rich patients, everyone else has that much more poorly reimbursed work to do.
 Dr. Kaminetsky counters with his own story. Had he not found this way of practicing medicine, he said, he would no longer be seeing patients at all: he would be in a desk job with a pharmaceutical company. A detail-oriented perfectionist who routinely works through lunch and still does his own filing, he was tormented in his previous practice by the impossibility of meeting his own standards.
 ''I hated it,'' Dr. Kaminetsky said. ''It was awful. Patients always had a litany of complaints. Driving home, I would think, 'Oh my God, I never saw this test, I never called that patient back.' Some people are not as easily distressed by loose ends. I don't like leaving things undone.''
 Now on his busiest days he sees perhaps half the number of patients he used to, spends twice as long with each one and has the time to make every last phone call.
 ''I'm really helping a lot of people,'' he said. ''I feel good about what I do. Does everybody deserve this kind of care? Yes, they do. And I don't purport to know the solution.''

HEADLINE: Divisions Appear Within a Storm Recovery Commission 

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
The president dined with its members during one of his many trips to New Orleans. Its mandate is no less ambitious and grand than a master plan by year's end that will serve as the blueprint for rebuilding the city. 
 Yet a month after the creation of the Bring New Orleans Back Commission by Mayor C. Ray Nagin -- before it has even had a chance to take up basic procedural questions -- there are already signs the commission is in trouble. It is struggling to focus on major rebuilding issues rather than smaller complaints, and sharp divisions have begun to develop among its members. 
The group was created as the principal advisory panel to the mayor, intended to deal with the looming political and financial questions that face the city as it staggers back to life after Hurricane Katrina. The mayor routinely defers to the commission when asked about long-range rebuilding questions, saying such matters are its responsibility.
 But several commissioners believe they have been granted secondary status among the membership, saying they are a kind of B-team whom the others do not invite to the private luncheon that precedes the group's weekly meetings, held each Monday afternoon.
 ''No one goes over with us what they discuss at those lunch meetings,'' said Oliver M. Thomas Jr., one of the commission's 17 members and president of the City Council. ''It would be nice if they did.'' 
 Added W. Anthony Patton, a small-business owner on the commission, ''Let's just say I haven't been invited to any lunches, either.''
 Joseph C. Canizaro, a local real estate developer who played a leading role in the creation of the commission, regularly attends the lunches. Mr. Canizaro described himself and his fellow attendees as ''a few friends of the mayor's who gather to help the mayor with advice and such.''
 ''It's really entirely separate and apart from the commission,'' he said.
 And others voice an opposite complaint: that the open format of the meetings discourages an honest debate over the tough issues of race and class that lie ahead. The meetings are broadcast on a local cable station, and some members say colleagues are playing to the cameras. 
 ''I'm going to be criticized for saying this, but if my fellow commissioners keep on throwing out motions on the floor that we pass without any discussion, just to gain applause, it's just not going to work,'' Mr. Canizaro said. 
 At last Monday's meeting, Mr. Thomas asked his fellow commissioners to commit formally to rebuilding the Ninth Ward, an impoverished, largely black and heavily damaged area that some experts have said is too environmentally precarious to be rebuilt. Mr. Canizaro abstained, but Mr. Thomas's resolution otherwise passed unanimously without debate. That prompted commissioners both black and white to grumble about the wisdom of making commitments before they have had a chance to discuss an issue.
 ''I'm a little concerned that members of the commission are starting to use the meetings to cater to certain constituencies and stakeholder groups they know are watching,'' Scott S. Cowen, a member and the president of Tulane University, said. 
 Still other members complain that the panel's meetings are devolving into protracted gripe sessions that have nothing to do with devising a workable plan to rebuild the city. Last Monday, for instance, more than an hour of public comment was taken up by residents angry about recovery jobs being filled by outsiders, business owners wanting government contracts and complaints about the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
 At that meeting, Daniel F. Packer, the chief executive of the New Orleans subsidiary of the Entergy Corporation, tried to persuade his fellow commissioners that the task before them was daunting enough without the additional burden of ''trying to solve all the problems that come along.'' Mr. Packer had only limited success, as several commissioners took up the residents' causes. 
 Even Mayor Nagin, in an interview on Tuesday, expressed concern that so much of the meeting was devoted to New Orleanians who were looking to the commission to solve problems that should be dealt with elsewhere. 
 ''I'm not saying we'll have a perfect process, but we do have a process,'' he said. ''And the process will get better as we move forward if we continue to work together.'' 
 The City Council said it would form its own advisory commission on the same day the mayor announced his. Three weeks later, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco named a 23-member commission she called the Louisiana Recovery Authority. It will focus on the rebuilding of South Louisiana.
 The City Council's commission, Mr. Thomas said, will consist of people ''who can roll up their sleeves and come out with some real recommendations. Concrete stuff that the city can act on.''
 Yet even Mr. Thomas acknowledged that Mr. Bush's decision to eat dinner with the mayor's commission in early October had given it an advantage over the other commissions, neither of which existed at the time. 
 Donald T. Bollinger Jr., a commission member and a local shipbuilder, said, ''Him coming in and having dinner with this group and meeting with our group helped sanction us and differentiates us from other groups.'' 
 Still, Mr. Bollinger also questioned the commission's ability to meet the president's challenge to devise a plan that is complete with specific suggestions. ''Can this group actually get anything done?'' he asked. ''That's a worry. I kind of question that myself.'' 
 Some members of the commission had assumed that the group would meet in private to thrash out everything from the fate of the city's lowest-lying neighborhoods to a reform plan for a school system that was scandal-plagued before it also became waterlogged.
 ''I think we're at the point where the commission has risk as to whether or not it's going to be able to make the tough decisions we need to make,'' Mr. Canizaro said.

 BODY:
THE ASSASSINS' GATE
 America in Iraq.
 By George Packer.
 467 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $26.
IN ''The Assassins' Gate,'' his chronicle of the Iraq war, George Packer tells the tale of Drew Erdmann, a young American official in Baghdad. Erdmann, a recent Harvard Ph.D. in history, finds himself rereading Marc Bloch's classic firsthand account of the fall of France in 1940, ''Strange Defeat.'' He was particularly drawn to a few lines. ''The ABC of our profession,'' Bloch wrote, ''is to avoid . . . large abstract terms in order to try to discover behind them the only concrete realities, which are human beings.'' The story of America in Iraq is one of abstract ideas and concrete realities. ''Between them,'' Packer says, ''lies a distance even greater than the 8,000 miles from Washington to Baghdad.'' 
 Packer begins his absorbing account with the ideas that led the United States to war. A few neoconservatives, most prominently Paul Wolfowitz, had long believed that ousting Saddam Hussein would pave the way for a grand reordering of the Middle East, pushing it away from tyranny and anti-Americanism and toward modernity and democracy. Others, including Douglas Feith, explained that eliminating Hussein would be particularly good for Israel's security. But the broadest reason to intervene in Iraq was that it was a bold use of American power that mixed force with idealism. Many neoconservatives were Reaganites who believed in an assertive, even aggressive, American posture in the world. For them the 1990's -- under Bush pere and Clinton alike -- had been years of retreat. ''They were supremely confident,'' Packer writes, ''all they needed was a mission.''
 But they wouldn't have had one without 9/11. As one of the neoconservatives Packer interviewed correctly points out, ''September 11 is the turning point. Not anything else.'' After 9/11, Bush -- and many Americans, including many liberals -- were searching for a use of the nation's power that mixed force with idealism and promised to reorder the Middle East. In Iraq they found it.
 Packer collects his articles from The New Yorker but goes well beyond them. His book lacks a tight thesis or structure and as a result meanders at times, petering out in its final sections. But this is more than made up for by the sheer integrity and intelligence of its reporting, from Washington, New York, London and, of course, Iraq. Packer provides page after page of vivid description of the haphazard, poorly planned and almost criminally executed occupation of Iraq. In reading him we see the staggering gap between abstract ideas and concrete reality. 
 Hard as it is to believe, the Bush administration took on the largest foreign policy project in a generation with little planning or forethought. It occupied a foreign country of 25 million people in the heart of the Middle East pretty much on the fly. Packer, who was in favor of the war, reserves judgment and commentary in most of the book but finally cannot contain himself: ''Swaddled in abstract ideas . . . indifferent to accountability,'' those in positions of highest responsibility for Iraq ''turned a difficult undertaking into a needlessly deadly one,'' he writes. ''When things went wrong, they found other people to blame.''
 Packer recounts the prewar discussions in the State Department's ''Future of Iraq Project,'' which produced an enormous document outlining the political challenges in governing Iraq. He describes Drew Erdmann's memo, written for Colin Powell, analyzing previous postwar reconstructions in the 20th century. Erdmann's conclusion was that success depended on two factors, establishing security and having international support. These internal documents were mirrored by several important think-tank studies that all made similar points, specifically on the need for large-scale forces to maintain security. One would think that this Hobbesian message -- that order is the first requisite of civilization -- would appeal to conservatives. In fact all of this careful planning and thinking was ignored or dismissed. 
 Part of the problem was the brutal and debilitating struggle between the State Department and the Defense Department, producing an utterly dysfunctional policy process. The secretary of the Army, Thomas White, who was fired after the invasion, explained to Packer that with the Defense Department ''the first issue was, we've got to control this thing -- so everyone else was suspect.'' The State Department was regarded as the enemy, so what chance was there of working with other countries? The larger problem was that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld (and probably Dick Cheney) doggedly believed nation-building was a bad idea, the Clinton administration has done too much of it, and the American military should stop doing it. Rumsfeld explained this view in a couple of speeches and op-ed articles that were short on facts and long on polemics. But how to square this outlook with invading Iraq? Assume away the need for nation-building. Again, White explains: ''We had the mind-set that this would be a relatively straightforward, manageable task, because this would be a war of liberation, and therefore reconstruction would be short-lived.'' Rumsfeld's spokesman, Larry Di Rita, went to Kuwait in April 2003 and told the American officials waiting there that the State Department had messed up Bosnia and Kosovo and that the Bush administration intended to hand over power to Iraqis and leave within three months. 
 SO the Army's original battle plan for 500,000 troops got whittled down to 160,000. If Gen. Tommy Franks ''hadn't offered some resistance, the number would have dropped well below 100,000,'' Packer says. At one point, Franks's predecessor, Anthony Zinni, inquired into the status of ''Desert Crossing,'' his elaborate postwar plan that covered the sealing of borders, securing of weapons sites, provision of order and so on. He was told that it had been discarded because its assumptions were ''too negative.'' 
 As the looting began and went unchecked, the occupation lost its aura of authority and began spiraling downward. Iraq's first czar, Jay Garner, was quickly replaced, as were dozens of American officials, in what was the first of a stream of shifts, countershifts and bureaucratic battles. Garner was followed by L. Paul Bremer. Bremer was an intelligent man but his previous administrative experience was confined to running the American Embassy in The Netherlands. In any event, his two catastrophic decisions were probably made in Washington -- disbanding the Iraqi Army and de-Baathification, which banned from government service the entire top four levels of the Baath Party, regardless of whether any of the individuals affected had been implicated in any crime. (In Iraq, to be banned from the public sector was effectively to be forced into unemployment.) Packer writes that ''at least 35,000 mostly Sunni employees of the bureaucracy, including thousands of schoolteachers and midlevel functionaries, lost their jobs overnight.'' Thousands more were purged subsequently.
 Bremer has often argued that the deBaathification decree was his most popular act. This is probably true, among the Shiites. But that would be like saying that had he proclaimed independence for the Kurds, it would have gone down well in Iraq's northern regions. As a balancing act that kept Iraq's three communities at peace, it was a disaster. Bremer's decisions signaled to Iraq's Sunnis that they would be stripped of their jobs and status in the new Iraq. Imagine if, after apartheid, South Africa's blacks had announced that all whites would be purged from the army, civil service, universities and big businesses. In one day, Bremer had upended the social structure of the country. And he did this without having in place a new ruling cadre that could take over from the old Sunni bureaucrats.
 These decisions did not cause the insurgency, though it is worth noting that for the first few months of the occupation, Sunni Falluja was much less of a problem for the United States than was Shiite Najaf. But Bremer fueled the dissatisfaction of the Sunnis, who now had no jobs but plenty of guns. And most especially, his decisions added to the chaos and dysfunction that were rapidly rising in Iraq. ''We expected the Americans would make the country an example, a second Europe,'' an unemployed electrician told Packer in the first year of the occupation. ''That's why we didn't fight back. And we are shocked, as if we've gone back 100 years.''
 Packer describes an occupation that was focused more on rewarding confederates than gaining success on the ground. Garner received instructions from Feith and Wolfowitz to be nice to the Iraqi exile leader Ahmad Chalabi, who was a favorite of the Pentagon. State Department officials were barred from high posts in Baghdad, even when they were uniquely qualified. Senior jobs went to Feith's former law partner and to the brother of Ari Fleischer, Bush's press secretary. Friendly American firms like Halliburton were favored over local Iraqis.
 Packer describes in microcosm something that has infected conservatism in recent years. Conservatives live in fear of being betrayed ideologically. They particularly distrust nonpartisan technocrats -- experts -- who they suspect will be seduced by the ''liberal establishment.'' The result, in government, journalism and think tanks alike, is a profusion of second-raters whose chief virtue is that they are undeniably ''sound.'' 
 The simplest proof of the myriad American errors is that, starting around May 2004, Washington began reversing course wholesale. Troop withdrawals were postponed. The decision to hold caucuses and delay elections was shelved. The American-appointed Governing Council was abolished. The hated United Nations was asked to come in and create and bless a new body. In recent months, the reversal is wholesale. The United States has been bribing tribal sheiks, urging the Iraqi government to end de-Baathification and make a concerted effort to bring the Sunnis back into the political process.
 Where is Iraq today? The continuing violence in the Sunni areas has kept most Americans from recognizing what is actually happening in the country. America's blunders forced Washington, hastily and with little planning, to hand over power to those Iraqis who were organized for it -- the Kurds and the Shiite religious parties. Iraq is currently three different lands -- though not three different countries. In the north, the Kurds run a relatively benign form of one-party democracy. In the south, while things are stable, in several places, Shiite religious groups, often with their own militias, have imposed their rule. Packer describes the disjuncture: ''Inside the Green Zone, long hours of negotiation about the role of Islam and women's rights . . . outside a harsh social code enforced by vigilante rule.'' And in the center, of course, is a war zone.
 Let's be clear: Iraq today is a much better, even more liberal, place than Saddam Hussein's Iraq. It has elements that are more progressive than many Arab countries. Divided rule and a federal structure may produce real checks and balances on absolute power. And its negotiations, debates and elections have had a positive effect. But Iraq is also plainly not what so many had hoped it would be -- a model and inspiration for the Arab world. For every day of elections, there are months of chaos, crime and corruption. Things will improve but it will take years, not months. And the costs have been unconscionably high -- for Americans and Iraqis.
 Was all this inevitable? Did the United States take on something impossible? That seems to be the conventional wisdom today. If so, what to make of Afghanistan? That country is deeply divided. It has not had a functioning government in three decades, some would argue three centuries, and yet it is coming together under a progressive leader. Two million Afghan refugees have voted with their feet and returned to their country (unlike Iraq, where people are leaving every day). And the reasons? The United States allied itself with forces on the ground that could keep order. It handed over the political process to the international community, preventing any stigma of a neocolonial occupation (it was the United Nations that created the loya jirga, the national assembly, and produced Hamid Karzai). It partnered with NATO for much of the routine military work. In fact the Afghan National Army is being trained by the United States -- and France. And it has accepted certain facts of Afghan life, like the power of its warlords, working slowly to change them.
 ''The Iraq war was always winnable,'' Packer writes, ''it still is. For this very reason, the recklessness of its authors is hard to forgive.'' But it is not just recklessness. The book that Drew Erdmann should have been reading in Iraq was not ''Strange Defeat'' but his dissertation adviser Ernest May's recent emendation to it, ''Strange Victory.'' In it, May explains that the fall of France was not inevitable at all. It happened because the French made some key misjudgments. Presciently, May argues that ''Western democracies today exhibit many of the same characteristics that France and Britain did in 1938-40 -- arrogance, a strong disinclination to risk life in battle, heavy reliance on technology as a substitute and governmental procedures poorly designed for anticipating or coping with ingenious challenges from the comparatively weak.'' Above all, he emphasizes the fatal cost of arrogance, closing his book with the injunction of Oliver Cromwell in 1650 to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland: ''I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.'' No one in the Bush administration ever did, and so we are where we are in Iraq.

HEADLINE: THE END OF PENSIONS?

BYLINE: By Roger Lowenstein. 
Roger Lowenstein, a contributing writer, has written about Social Security and health care reform for the magazine.

 BODY:
I. THE LATEST FINANCIAL DEBACLE 
 When I caught up with Robert S. Miller, the chief executive of Delphi Corporation, last summer, he was still pitching the fantasy that his company, a huge auto-parts maker, would be able to cut a deal with its workers and avoid filing for bankruptcy protection. But he acknowledged that Delphi faced one perhaps insuperable hurdle -- not the current conditions in the auto business so much as the legacy of the pension promises that Delphi committed to many decades ago, when it was part of General Motors. This was the same fear that had obsessed Alfred P. Sloan Jr., the storied president of G.M., who warned way back in the 1940's that pensions and like benefits would be ''extravagant beyond reason.'' But under pressure from the United Auto Workers union, he granted them. And as future auto executives would discover, pension obligations are -- outside of bankruptcy, anyway -- virtually impossible to unload. Unlike wages or health benefits, pension benefits cannot be cut. Unlike other contracts, which might be renegotiated as business conditions change, pension commitments are forever. And given the exigencies of the labor market, they tend to be steadily improved upon, at least when times are good. 
For the U.A.W., Miller noted forlornly, ''30 and Out'' -- 30 years to retirement -- became a rallying cry. Eventually, the union got what it wanted, and workers who started on the assembly line after high school found they could retire by their early 50's. ''These pensions were created when we all used to work until age 70 and then poop out at 72,'' Miller told me. ''Now if you live past 80, a not-uncommon demographic, you're going to be taking benefits for longer than you are working. That social contract is under severe pressure.'' 
 Earlier this month, Miller and Delphi gave in to the pressure and sought protection under the bankruptcy code -- the largest such filing ever in the auto industry. It followed by a few weeks the Chapter 11 filings of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, whose pension promises to workers exceeded the assets in their pension funds by an estimated $16 billion.
 The three filings have blown the lid off America's latest, if long-simmering, financial debacle. It is not hedge funds or the real-estate bubble -- it is the pension system, both public and private. And it is broken.

II...................THE MORAL HAZARD OF INSURANCE
 The amount of underfunding in corporate pension plans totals a staggering $450 billion. Part of that liability is attributable to otherwise healthy corporations that will most likely, in time, make good on their obligations. But the plans of the companies that fail will become the responsibility of the government's pension insurer, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The P.B.G.C., which collects premiums from corporations and, in theory, is supposed to be self-financing, is deeply in the hole, prompting comparisons to the savings-and-loan fiasco of the 1980's. Just as S. & L.'s of that era took foolish risks in part because their deposits were insured, the P.B.G.C.'s guarantee encouraged managements and unions to raise benefits ever higher. 
 In such situations, individuals are tempted to take more risk than is healthy for the group; economists, in a glum appraisal of human nature, call it ''moral hazard.'' In effect, America's pension system has been a laboratory demonstration of moral hazard in which the insurance may end up bankrupting the system it was intended to save. Given that pension promises do not come due for years, it is hardly surprising that corporate executives and state legislators have found it easier to pay off unions with benefits tomorrow rather than with wages today. Since the benefits were insured, union leaders did not much care if the obligations proved excessive. During the previous decade especially, when it seemed that every pension promise could be fulfilled by a rising stock market, employers either recklessly overpromised or recklessly underprovided -- or both -- for the commitments they made. 
 The P.B.G.C. is now $23 billion in the red -- a deficit that is expected to grow, significantly, as more companies go under. The balance sheet for the end of September will very likely show a deficit of more than $30 billion. If nothing is done to fix the system, the Congressional Budget Office forecasts, the deficit will mushroom to more than $100 billion within two decades. This liability will almost certainly fall back on the taxpayers, since the alternative to a bailout -- letting the pension agency fail -- would force aging former auto workers and other retirees onto the street. 
 As bad as that sounds, the problem of state and local government pensions is even worse. Public pensions, which are paid by taxpayers and thus enjoy an implicit form of insurance, are underfunded by a total of at least $300 billion and arguably much more. While governments have been winking at these deficits for years, they are now becoming intolerable burdens for taxpayers. In San Diego, pension abuse has effectively bankrupted the city. Thanks to a history of granting sweeter and sweeter pension deals that it has neglected to fund, the city has been forced to allocate $160 million, or 8 percent of the municipal budget, to the San Diego City Employees Retirement System this year, with similar allocations expected for years to come. San Diego has tabled plans for a downtown library, cut back the hours on swimming pools, gutted the parks and recreation budget, canceled needed water and sewer projects and fallen behind on potholes. 
 State or local governments in New Jersey, New York, Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia and elsewhere face similar budget strains aggravated by runaway pension promises. According to Carl DeMaio, director of the Performance Institute, which advocates better government accountability, ''There is a San Diego brewing in every community.''
 Not only are taxpayers certain to suffer, but senior citizens in the future may also have to settle for less secure retirements anchored only by Social Security and whatever they've managed to put away into their 401(k) accounts. A backlash already has begun in state capitals, where the political forces that have been lobbying for Social Security reform have been rallying lawmakers to get out of the pension business altogether. Alaska's Legislature recently passed a shotgun bill to deny pensions to future employees. This mimics a trend in the private sector, in which corporations have been leaving the system, either by paying off their workers and terminating their pension plans or by ''freezing'' their plans, a step recently taken by Hewlett Packard, so that many current employees will no longer accrue benefits and new employees will not participate at all.
 If the pension system continues to wither, it is not hard to envision a darker future in which -- as was true until early in the 20th Century, before the advent of pensions -- many of the elderly would be forced to keep working to stave off poverty.

III....................THE SHRINKING PENSION SYSTEM
 Congress has been debating legislation to fix the private system, but it has been unable to resolve a basic tension: anything it does to ease the burden on failing or failed pension plans lessens the penalty for failure and enhances moral hazard. By making it easier for, say, a Delta or a Delphi to offer benefits, it raises the possible cost of a future bailout. 
 The tough medicine favored by the Bush administration, which would eliminate loopholes in the system as well as much of the subsidy that now exists in the insurance system, would lead to more companies freezing their plans or leaving the system outright. The number of pension plans would continue to shrink and in time all but disappear. This would strip the elderly of the future of what is still the most secure form of retirement income.
 The fear of runaway pension costs plainly echoes the Social Security debate, and many suspect that the Bush administration would not much mind if pensions did disappear. ''I don't think the administration is very interested in creating a future for traditional pensions,'' says Julia Coronado, a senior research associate at Watson Wyatt, a human-resources consulting firm. ''It doesn't fit very well with their vision of the ownership society.'' 
 Bradley Belt, executive director of the P.B.G.C., shrugs off the charge. ''The last thing we want to do is chase people out of the system,'' he says. Besides, the government doesn't need to chase. As Belt points out, the number of workers covered by pensions is shrinking without government help. In 1980, about 40 percent of the jobs in the private sector offered pensions; now only 20 percent do. The trend is probably irreversible, because it feeds on itself. Hewlett Packard, for instance, must compete with younger companies like Dell Computer that do not offer traditional pensions. Freezing its plan, which was a legacy of the company's famously employee-oriented founders, was an embarrassing step for H.P.'s present managers -- but freeze it they did. 
 This may have made economic sense, but federal law has long recognized a social purpose to pensions as well. By allowing companies to deduct from taxes the money they contribute into their pension funds, the government encourages employers to provide a safety net for their workers. This remains a legitimate function, and if pensions were allowed to die, we would need something to take their place.

IV...............................WHY PENSIONS MATTER
 To understand why pensions are still important, you have to understand the awkward beast that benefits professionals refer to as the U.S. retirement system. It is not really one ''system'' but three, which complement each other in the crudest of fashions. The lowest tier is Social Security, which provides most Americans with a bare-bones living (the average payment is about $12,000 a year). The highest tier, available to the rich, is private savings. In between, for people who do not have a hedge-fund account and yet want to retire on more than mere subsistence, there are pensions and 401(k)'s. Currently, more than half of all families have at least one member who has qualified for a pension at some point in his or her career and thus will be eligible for a benefit. And among current retirees, pensions are the second-biggest source of income, trailing only Social Security. 
 During most of the 90's the decline in pension coverage was barely lamented. It was not that big companies were folding up their plans (for the most part, they were not) but that newer, smaller companies weren't offering them. As the small companies grew into big ones (think Dell, or Starbucks, or Home Depot), traditional pensions covered less of the private-sector landscape. This did not seem like a very big deal. Younger workers envisioned mobile careers for themselves and many did not want pension strings tying them to a single employer. And most were able to put money aside in 401(k)'s, often matched by an employer contribution. 
 It happened that 401(k)'s, which were authorized by a change in the tax code in 1978 and which began to blossom in the early 1980's, coincided with a great upswing in the stock market. It is possible that they helped to cause the upswing. In any case, Americans' experience with 401(k)'s in the first two decades of their existence was sufficiently rosy that few people shed tears over the slow demise of pension plans or were even aware of how significantly pensions and 401(k)'s differed. But 401(k)'s were intended to be a supplement to pensions, not a substitute. 
 From the beneficiary's standpoint, pensions mean unique security. The worker gets a guaranteed income, determined by the number of years of service and by his or her salary at retirement. And pensions don't run dry; workers (or their spouses) get them as long as they live. Because the employer is committed to paying a certain level of benefits, pensions are known as ''defined benefit'' plans. Since an individual's benefit rises with each year of service, the employer is supposed to sock money away, into a fund that it manages for all of its beneficiaries, every year. The point is that workers don't (or shouldn't) have to worry about how the benefit will get there; that's the employer's responsibility. Of course, the open-ended nature of the guarantee -- the very feature that makes pensions so attractive to the individual -- is precisely what has caused employers to rue the day they said yes. No profit-making enterprise can truly gauge its ability to meet such promises decades later.
 A 401(k), on the other hand, promises nothing. It's merely a license to defer taxes -- an individual savings plan. The employer might contribute some money, which is why 401(k)'s are known as ''defined contribution'' plans. Or it might not. Even if the company does contribute, it offers no assurance that the money will be enough to retire on, nor does it get involved with managing the account; that's up to the worker. These disadvantages were, in the 90's, somehow perceived (with the help of exuberant marketing pitches by mutual-fund firms) to be advantages: 401(k)'s let workers manage their own assets; they were a road map to economic freedom. 
 Post-bubble, the picture looks different. Various people have studied how investors perform in their 401(k)'s. According to Alicia Munnell, a pension expert at Boston College and previously a White House economist, pension funds over the long haul earn slightly more than the average 401(k) holder. Among the latter, those who do worse than average, of course, have no protection. Moreover, pensions typically annuitize -- that is, they convert a worker's retirement assets into an annual stipend. They impose a budget, based on actuarial probabilities. This might seem a trivial service (some pensioners might not even realize that it is a service). But if you asked a 65-year-old man who lacked a pension but did have, say, $100,000 in savings, how much he could live on, he likely would not have the vaguest idea. The answer is $654 a month: this is the annuity that $100,000 would purchase in the private market. It is the amount (after deducting the annuity provider's costs and profit) that the average person could live on so as to exhaust his savings at the very moment that he draws his final breath. 
 So the question arises: what if he lives longer than average? This is the beauty of a pension or of any collectivized savings pool. The pension plan can afford to support people who live to 90, because some of its members will expire at 66. It subsidizes its more robust members from the resources of those who die young. This is why a 401(k) is not a true substitute. Jeffrey Brown, an associate finance professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a staff member of the president's Social Security commission, notes that as baby boomers who have nest eggs in place of pensions begin to retire, they will be faced with a daunting question: ''How do I make this last a lifetime?''

V....FROM MANAGEMENT TOOL TO EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
 The country's first large-scale pension plan was introduced after the Civil War, when the federal government gave pensions to disabled Union Army veterans and war widows. Congress passed an act in 1890 that extended pensions to all veterans 65 and over. This converted pensions into a form of social welfare. Over the next 20 years, states and cities added pensions for police officers and firefighters. By World War I, most teachers had been granted pensions as well. Governments couldn't offer big paychecks for workers -- teachers, the police, firefighters -- so it offered stability and pensions instead. 
 In the private sector, the first pension was offered by American Express, a stagecoach delivery service, in 1875. Railroads followed suit. Employees were required to work for 30 years before they qualified for benefits, and thus pensions helped companies retain employees as well as ease older workers into retirement. These employers thought of pensions as management tools, not as employee ''benefits.'' But in the first half of the 20th century, as the historian James Wooten put it, government policies turned pensions into a tool of social policy. First came the tax deduction. This feature was abused, as companies used pensions to shelter payments to their executives. The rules were gradually tightened, however, forcing plans to include the rank and file. World War II gave more incentives to create pensions: punitive tax rates made the pension shelter enormously attractive and a government freeze on wages meant that pensions were the only avenue for increasing compensation. 
 The effect of these policies was to encourage unions to bargain for pensions and to pressure employers to grant them. After the war, John L. Lewis, the legendary labor leader, staged a strike to win pensions for miners. Ford Motor capitulated to the U.A.W. in 1949. G.M., headed by the reluctant Sloan, followed in 1950. This led to a so-called pension stampede; by 1960, 40 percent of private-sector workers were covered. Meanwhile, in the auto industry, the seeds of the problem were already visible. 
 Companies might establish plans, but many were derelict when it came to funding them. When companies failed, the workers lost much of their promised benefit. The U.A.W. was acutely aware of the problem, because of the failing condition of several smaller car manufacturers, like Packard. The union didn't have the muscle to force full funding, and even if it did, it reckoned that if the weaker manufacturers were obliged to put more money into their pension funds, they would retaliate by cutting wages. 
 Thus in 1959, Studebaker, a manufacturer fallen on hard times, agreed to increase benefits -- its third such increase in six years. In return, the U.A.W. let Studebaker stretch out its pension funding schedule. This bargain preserved the union's wages, as well as management's hopes for a profit, though it required each to pretend that Studebaker could afford a pension plan that was clearly beyond its means. Four years later, the company collapsed.
 The Studebaker failure was a watershed. Thousands of employees, including some who had worked 40 years on the line, lost the bulk of their pensions. Stunned by the loss, which totaled $15 million, the U.A.W. changed its tactics and began to lobby in earnest for federal pension insurance. A union pension expert tellingly explained to Walter Reuther, the U.A.W. chief, that insurance would reconfigure the ''incentives'' of both labor and management. Though business was skeptical of the idea, a decade later, in 1974, Congress finally passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa, which, among other protections, established the P.B.G.C. to insure private pensions. Erisa, according to Wooten, who wrote a history of the act, completed the transition of pensions into a part of the social safety net. It was also the birth of moral hazard. 

VI.....................THE SURPRISINGLY PLIABLE SYSTEM OF PENSION ACCOUNTING
 Erisa, which would be amended several times, was supposed to ensure that corporate sponsors kept their plans funded. The act includes a Byzantine set of regulations that seemingly require companies to make timely contributions. As recently as 2000, most corporate plans were adequately funded, or at least appeared to be. Their assets took a serious hit, however, when the stock market tumbled. (In retrospect, they had been cavalier in assuming the bull market would continue.) And they were burned again when interest rates fell. 
 Since pension liabilities are, for the most part, future liabilities, companies calculate their present obligation by applying a discount rate to what they will owe in the future. As interest rates move lower, they have to set more money aside because it is assumed that their assets will grow more slowly. The principle is familiar to any individual saver: you need to save more if you expect, say, a 5 percent return on your investment instead of a 10 percent return. What is much in dispute is just which rate is proper for pension accounting. 
 Corporations have been gaming the system by using the highest rates allowable, which shrinks their reported liabilities, and thus their funding requirements. The P.B.G.C., when calculating the system's deficit, uses what is in effect a market rate; whatever it would cost to buy annuities for everyone covered in a pension plan is, it argues, the plan's true ''liability.'' The difference between these measures can be extreme. Depending on whom you talk to, General Motors' mammoth pension fund is either fully funded or, as the P.B.G.C. maintains, it is $31 billion in the hole. 
 What is not in dispute is that when interest rates fell, the present value of pension liabilities (by whatever measure) soared. The confluence of falling stock prices, plunging interest rates and a recession in the beginning of this decade was the pension world's equivalent of the perfect storm. An unprecedented wave of pension sponsors failed and then dumped their obligations on the P.B.G.C. (To do so, a sponsor generally must prove that it could not re-emerge as a viable enterprise without shedding its pension plan.) By far the most costly failures were in airlines and steel, although the list ranges from Kemper Insurance and Kaiser Aluminum to Murray, a lawn-mower manufacturer. 
 As the P.B.G.C. assumed responsibility for more and more pensioners, it became clear that the premium it charged was way too cheap. Mispriced insurance, like mispriced anything, sends the market a distorted signal. Belt, the P.B.G.C. director, who served as counsel to the Senate Banking Committee in the late 1980's during the savings-and-loan crisis, says that cheap pension insurance gave rise to flawed incentives: namely it kept companies in the pension business who didn't deserve to be there. He also argues, rather convincingly, that lax rules allowed pension sponsors to get away with inadequate funding.
 For example, United Airlines did not make contributions to any of its four employee plans between 2000 and 2002, when it was heading into Chapter 11, and made minimal contributions in 2003. Even more surprisingly, in 2002, after two of its jets had been turned into weapons in the Sept. 11 disaster, and when the airline industry was pleading for emergency relief from Congress, United granted a 40 percent increase in pension benefits for its 23,000 ground employees.
 Bethlehem Steel similarly enjoyed a three-year funding holiday as it was going through hard times, letting its liabilities swell in advance of turning them over to the government. Meanwhile, in order to gain its unions' approval for plant shutdowns, it agreed to costly benefit enhancements. In 2001 Bethlehem filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It was guided through its bankruptcy by none other than Miller, now the Delphi C.E.O. Miller disputes the notion that capital-scarce companies like Bethlehem intentionally game the system by shirking funding. ''Companies don't like falling behind,'' he says. ''When you have a hard choice between starving the capital base to feed the pension plan, or making capital investments to become more productive, to the extent there is permission that's what you do.'' The point is, they had permission.
 Neither Bethlehem nor United broke any laws. Both companies made the full contributions required under Erisa. When the P.B.G.C. seized their plans, however, Bethlehem was only 45 percent funded, and United was only 42 percent funded. For companies that terminate their pension plans, such gross underfunding has become the norm. Either assets suddenly vanish when the P.B.G.C. walks in the door, or, evidently, the system for measuring ''full'' funding is broken. As Belt testified to the Senate Committee on Finance in June, ''United, US Airways, Bethlehem Steel, LTV and National Steel would not have presented claims in excess of $1 billion each -- and with funded ratios of less than 50 percent -- if the rules worked.''
 Even leaving aside the debate over which rate to use in calculating pension liabilities, there is no doubt that Erisa permits companies to use some doubtful arithmetic. For instance, the law lets corporations ''smooth'' changes in their asset values. If the stocks and bonds in their pension funds take a hit (as happened to just about every fund recently), they don't have to fully report the impact. Nor do they have to ante up fresh funds to compensate for the loss for five years. A similar smoothing is permitted on the liability side. And though, in theory, Erisa discourages underfunding by requiring offenders to pay higher premiums, its various loopholes render the sanction toothless. Thanks to another loophole, companies that contribute more than the required amount get to skip future contributions even if they later become underfunded. These companies are awarded so-called ''credit balances,'' which remain in place even if the actual balance is showing red.
 Incredibly, when United's plans were terminated, earlier this year, even though they were groaning under $17 billion in pension liabilities and a mere $7 billion in assets, they still had credit ''balances'' according to Erisa. (By law, the P.B.G.C. will be on the hook for most, but not all, of United's shortfall. The agency guarantees pensions up to $45,000 a year; employees, mostly pilots, who were owed richer pensions are uninsured above the cap.) 
 Their dubious funding history notwithstanding, corporations -- airlines in particular -- have been lobbying for greater permissiveness for several years. And they have gotten it. Congress has twice relaxed the rules, permitting pension sponsors to use a higher rate to calculate their liabilities.

VII..............................WHAT BUSH WOULD DO?
 Enter the Bush administration: it has essentially declared the era of permissiveness over. Among other changes, it wants the funding rules tightened. To tackle moral hazard, it wants to stop companies with poor credit ratings from granting benefit hikes, or from doling out unfunded pension benefits to unions who agree to plant shutdowns. It even wants to prevent workers at some companies whose bonds are given a ''junk'' rating from accruing more years of service. This would be painful to employees at many industrial companies, possibly including G.M.
 Indeed, one reading of the administration proposal is that, having seen the steel and airline industries raid the P.B.G.C., it is drawing the line at the auto industry -- whose initial distress, of course, prompted the agency's founding. Asked about that before Delphi went bust, Belt admitted: ''Eight auto-parts suppliers have come under Chapter 11 so far this year. No question our single largest source of exposure is the auto sector.'' 
 Since G.M.'s stock was downgraded to junk status earlier this year, the possibility that it would file for bankruptcy has been the subject of on-again, off-again debate on Wall Street. G.M.'s pension plan totals an astronomical $90 billion; a bankruptcy filing would be the P.B.G.C.'s biggest nightmare. G.M. says the notion is far-fetched. The company seems to have plenty of liquidity and, just two weeks ago, with retiree costs a major concern, it reached an agreement with the U.A.W. to trim health benefits. G.M. and other industrial companies, along with their unions, have harshly attacked the Bush pension proposal, which would force many old-economy-type corporations to put more money into their pension funds just when their basic businesses are hurting.
 Alan Reuther, Walter's nephew and the U.A.W.'s legislative director, says the provisions to restrict benefits would be ''totally devastating for workers and retirees.'' He makes no apologies for ''30 and out'' -- a fair reward, he maintains, for hard service on the assembly line -- and he wonders at the post-modern notion that blue-collar workers should be responsible for their own retirements because giant corporations can't handle it. Also, a typical G.M. pension for someone with 30 years on the job is about $18,000 a year. That is hardly to be compared with an airline pilot's. ''The P.B.G.C. is focused on protecting themselves from claims and not on protecting the claims of workers,'' he says. ''They forget why they were created.'' Social safety nets have their price -- in this case, a little moral hazard -- and that is really what the debate is about. 
 What has emerged from the Beltway skirmishing thus far are bills on either side of Congress that would in some ways tighten funding but give a special break to airlines. Premiums to the P.B.G.C. would rise from $19 per plan participant to $30, and variable premiums on distressed companies would be enforced. The bills would chip away (but not eliminate) gimmicks like ''smoothing.'' 
 The Senate is still divided, however, on how to treat corporations with junk credit ratings -- the ones most likely to wind up in the P.B.G.C.'s lap. Hard-liners like Senator Chuck Grassley insist they should be forced to strengthen their pension plans in a hurry; Senators Mike DeWine and Barbara Mikulski (both from states with blue-collar constituencies) want to give such companies lenience. So after months of lobbying, politicking and deal making, moral hazard is still alive. 

VIII..............................PENSION VS. POTHOLES
 The P.B.G.C. does not protect government pensions, but dynamics similar to those in the private sector have also wrecked the solvency of public plans. Even in states where budget restraint is gospel, public-service employees have found it relatively easy to get benefit hikes for the simple reason that no one else pays much attention to them. In the corporate world, stockholders, at least in theory, exert some pressure on managers to show restraint. But who are the public sector ''stockholders''? The average voter doesn't take notice when the legislature debates the benefits levels of firemen, teachers and the like. On the other hand, public-employee unions exhibit a very keen interest, and legislators know it. So benefits keep rising. 
 As a matter of practice, those benefits are as good as insured. Because public pension benefits are legally inviolable, default is not an option. Sooner or later, taxpayers will be required to put up the money (or governments will be forced to borrow the money and tax a later generation to pay the interest). Thus, unions can bargain for virtually any level of benefits without regard to the state's ability, or its willingness, to fund them. This creates moral hazard indeed. At least in the private sphere, there are rules -- ineffectual rules maybe, but rules -- that require companies to fund. In the public sector, legislatures wary of raising taxes to pay for the benefits that they legislate can simply pass the buck to the future. This explains how the West Virginia Teachers Retirement System has, embarrassingly, only 22 percent of the assets needed to meet its expected liabilities. It also explains how Illinois, a low-tax state, is underfunded by some $38 billion, or $3,000 per every man, woman and child in the state. 
 California is a good example of the political forces that have driven benefits higher. In the 90's, Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat who was strongly supported by public-employee unions, pushed through numerous bills to increase benefits. One raised the pension of state troopers retiring at age 50 to 3 percent of final salary times the number of years served. (Previously, the formula was 2 percent at age 50, more if you were older.) Thus, a cop hired at age 20 could retire at 50, find another job and get a pension equal to 90 percent of his final salary. 
 The higher benefits trickled down to the local level, as counties that feared losing police officers to the state felt forced to copy the formula. Counterintuitively, as benefits were going up, the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), which was boasting high returns in the stock market, allowed state agencies and local governments to reduce their contributions. 
 Contra Costa County, which adopted the ''3 percent at 50'' formula for its Police Department, got by with contributing only $55 million to retirement costs in 1999, near the market peak. When the market tanked, the county found itself with lower assets and greater obligations. Six years later, the county's retirement bill had more than tripled to $180 million. Bill Pollacek, the county treasurer-tax collector, says the excess earnings from the bull market were spent, among other things, on higher benefits; ''the losses were left for the taxpayers.'' 
 This example was repeated with various twists across the country. In New Jersey, for example, Christine Whitman, the Republican governor in the 90's, ultimately relied on buoyant stock-market predictions to finance hefty tax cuts, which were the centerpiece of her administration. In 1997, New Jersey borrowed $2.8 billion, at an interest rate of 7.64 percent. The money was advanced to its pension system, on the convenient theory that its pension managers would make more in the market than the state paid out in interest. For a while, they did. The state even raised benefits.
 Meanwhile, Trenton achieved a sort of transitory budget balance by contributing less to its pension system. New Jersey's contribution to the Police and Firemen's Retirement System was zero in 2001 through 2003. But during the dot-com debacle, its investments plunged. And the state came under intense budget pressure because of the recession, and so gave itself a few years more to start paying down its pension liability (which further widened the gap). This year, the last easy-funding year, New Jersey will contribute $220 million to its pension system; by 2010, the annual bill will be an impossible-seeming $2.5 billion. 
 I spoke to Jon Corzine and Doug Forrester, the candidates in next Tuesday's gubernatorial election, and while each expressed the proper horror with regard to past mismanagement, neither had much to say about how they would replenish New Jersey's pension system. State pension officials say that if New Jersey were a private corporation, its system would be nearly bankrupt. ''In the real world this is a P.B.G.C. takeover,'' Fred Beaver, the head of the pension division, told me. Raising taxes is politically forbidden (Forrester has been campaigning to cut property-tax rates). 
 And the state's reported pension underfunding, officially $25 billion, is undoubtedly optimistic. It assumes that New Jersey's pension assets will earn 8.25 percent, a number collectively determined -- some say pulled from thin air -- by the state's pension council. Even Orin Kramer, a private hedge-fund manager who also is also chairman of the council, says that any assumption higher than 7.5 percent is unrealistic. ''The published numbers are divorced from economic reality,'' Kramer says. ''No one even does the math for what will happen if you only do 7 percent because it's too serious. You start firing cops and teachers.'' 
 According to Barclay's Global Investors, if you use realistic assumptions, the total underfunding in all public plans is on the order of $460 billion. If this figure is even close to true, future taxpayers will be hopelessly in hock to the police, firefighters and teachers of the past. 
 Cutting pensions (unlike health benefits) is simply not an option. State constitutions forbid public entities, even prospectively, from reducing the rate at which employees accrue benefits. They can tinker with, or abolish, benefits for future employees, as Alaska did, but for a worker already on the payroll, benefits -- even benefits that might not be earned for many decades hence -- are sacrosanct. These benefits are like headless nails; once driven in they can never be removed. This year, New York's Legislature approved 46 new bills -- more headless nails -- to increase pension benefits, according to E.J. McMahon, an analyst at the Manhattan Institute. New York's benefits already rank among the most generous in the country, and the new bills would expand categories of workers who can retire early, or who can qualify for higher rates. Such bracket creep is pervasive.
 one of the biggest pension offenders is San Diego, where six members of the pension board, including the head of the local firefighters' union and two other union officials, have been charged with violating the state's conflict-of-interest code, a felony. What is interesting about San Diego is that, juicy details aside, its pension mess actually looks rather commonplace. The six board members are accused of making a deal to let City Hall underfund the pension system in return for agreeing to higher benefits -- including special benefits for themselves. Explicitly or otherwise, this is what unions and legislators have been doing all over the country. A senior adviser on pensions to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger told me he fears that ever higher benefits are inescapable, given the fact that legislators control the benefits of people whose support is vital in elections. 
 Calpers, the country's biggest state-employee retirement system, responds that the pension system has worked well. And for Calpers's 1.4 million members, it has. The average benefit for retirees is $21,000 a year, more than most at General Motors. But at some point, the interest of the public and the interests of public employees diverge. 
 Earlier this year, Schwarzenegger tried to move California to a 401(k)-style defined contribution plan (for new employees), but the Legislature refused to go along. Schwarzenegger has vowed to revisit the issue in 2006. This battle is being fought from statehouse to statehouse. Michigan (mimicking Alaska) has closed its pension plan to some new employees, and various states, including Florida, Colorado, South Carolina, Arizona, Ohio and Montana, are taking a partial step of letting employees choose between defined contribution plans and traditional pensions. This compromise does not really change much. Most employees who are given the choice opt, quite naturally, to keep their pensions. 
 Partly for that reason, the Citizens Budget Commission, a politically neutral watchdog, concluded that only by ending pensions outright (for new employees) could New York avert a future fiscal calamity. ''Changes in pension benefits for future workers would yield fiscal gains only slowly,'' the commission noted in a position paper, ''but the service to the future fiscal health of the City and State would be enormous.''
 Most legislatures are not about to do that anytime soon. There is a legitimate argument for preserving public pensions, however, if only they could be put on a sound fiscal basis. Critics like Grover Norquist, the tax-cut crusader, lampoons pensions as remnants of a stodgy, Old World economy. The desire to collect a pension, he argues, keeps workers from moving to better opportunities and shackles employers to workers who are just marking time. 
 But while mobility is generally considered a virtue in the modern economy, it isn't appropriate everywhere. It may be desirable for a software engineer to move from job to job, notes Robert Walton, a Calpers assistant executive; ''for teachers, firefighters, nurses, engineers, that isn't the type of work force you want.'' Stability is a virtue. The trick is to force legislatures to commit to funding with the same zeal with which they commit to benefits.
 De Maio, the San Diego watchdog, is lobbying for a federal law that would impose Erisa-type rules on public plans. Another solution might be found in the Texas Municipal Retirement System, which represents 800 cities and towns in the state. It has a blended system of automatic employer and employee contributions that are managed by the system and turned into an annuity upon retirement. These sorts of remedies could avert plenty of future San Diegos. In principle they are quite simple. It is only the politics that are difficult. 

IX...........HOW DO YOU MAKE SAVINGS LAST A LIFETIME?
 On the private side, benefits professionals have been touting so-called cash-balance plans, a hybrid that in some ways looks like a 401(k), as the best hope for saving the pension industry. With a traditional pension, employees accrue benefits very slowly during their first 20 years and very rapidly during their next 10 (this is why pension plans act as retention tools; you pay a penalty for leaving early). Thus, an employee who stays at a company for 30 years gets a much bigger pension than one who works at three companies for 10 years each. Cash-balance plans were devised to appeal to younger workers, most of whom do not envision retiring at the firm that hired them out of college. In these plans, employees accrue benefits steadily, one decade to the next. There is no penalty for leaving, and workers who change jobs simply roll their accrued benefits into their next plan, as with a 401(k). Many firms converted to cash-balance plans in the 90's to attract younger and more mobile workers. 
 But the downside of giving more to junior employees is that senior employees get less. When I.B.M. converted, it reduced the rate at which some employees of long standing would accrue benefits, touching off a firestorm. The company was sued, I.B.M. lost and the legal status of similar plans remains in doubt. The pension industry has been lobbying Congress to clarify the status of existing cash-balance plans, but neither the administration nor anyone on Capitol Hill has done so. 
 To some people, this is further evidence that the Bush administration would just as soon be done with pension plans altogether. I put that recently to Elaine Chao, the secretary of labor, and while her answer was diplomatic, she made no bones about the fact that, in the administration's view, traditional pensions are losing their relevance. ''Defined benefit plans have their advantages,'' she told me, ''but in an increasingly mobile 21st-century work force, the lack of flexibility of D.B. plans is yielding to greater usage of defined contributions plans.'' 
 It's hard to argue with her, if you look at the numbers. Although 44 million people are covered by private-sector plans, half are people who have already retired and are collecting benefits or whose plans have been frozen or terminated. In other words, on-the-job employees accruing benefits -- once the backbone of the system -- constitute only half. At that rate, even without legislation, the private-sector pension community will mostly die off in a generation. 
 And pension sponsors are likely to get another jolt soon. Under current accounting standards, companies can ''smooth'' their earnings reports, so that each quarter's net income reflects the average assumed performance of the company's pension assets, whether up or down, but not the actual performance. (Discrepancies from the average are sifted back into the earnings stream over time.) This means that reported earnings are often wildly misleading. Robert Herz, chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, has criticized this practice as ''a Rube Goldberg device.'' If FASB follows up and disallows it, corporate pension sponsors would have to cope with a lot more volatility in their earnings. Managers hate volatility, and such a change would prompt many of them to fold their plans. 
 If defined benefits are on their last legs, then it would make sense to try to incorporate their best features into 401(k)'s. The drawback to 401(k)'s, remember, is that people are imperfect savers. They don't save enough, they don't invest wisely what they do save and they don't know what to do with their money once they are free to withdraw it. Quite often, they spend it. 
 Here there is much the government could do. For instance, it could require that a portion of 401(k) accounts be set aside in a lifelong annuity, with all the security of a pension. Behavioral economists like Richard Thaler have demonstrated that you can change people's behavior even without mandatory rules. For instance, by making a high contribution rate the ''default option'' for employees, they would tend to deduct (and save) more from their paychecks. If you make an annuity a prominent choice, more people will convert their accounts into annuities. 
 Otherwise, it's not hard to predict that as octogenarians and nonagenarians become commonplace in society, many are going to outlive their savings, which is even more scary than outliving the savings of the P.B.G.C. Promoting an annuity culture is probably the single best way to make up for the demise of pensions. Yet most companies that provide 401(k)'s don't even give the option of purchasing an annuity when people cash in their accounts. As Brown, the Illinois professor, notes, ''There is no box to check that says 'annuities.''' That is a minor scandal. ''I wish someone in Washington were thinking bigger thoughts about what the optimal retirement package should look like,'' says Watson Wyatt's Coronado.
 What are Secretary Chao's thoughts? She bounced the question to the Treasury Department. Mark Warshawsky, the Treasury's top economist, has written about the need for annuities, and in an interview he allowed that as 401(k)'s become the primary, or the only, source of retirement income for more people, ''I think it is a concern that annuities are not being offered in those plans.'' When I asked what the Treasury was doing about encouraging annuities, Warshawsky merely said that it was under study. Anything that smacks of regulation (like rules to make sure employees get a particular menu of choices, whether for annuities or for their portfolios) gives the administration shivers. This is what you would expect, given the administration's strong free-market tendencies. 
 But the government is already deeply involved, since it shelters retirement savings -- pensions, yes, but also 401(k)'s, which are similarly permitted to grow tax-free. When it passed Erisa, Congress agreed that corporations that invested tax-sheltered retirement funds -- pensions -- should have to live by certain rules. But in the defined contribution world -- the world of 401(k)'s -- there are no rules. Employers can contribute or not. Employees can diversify or blow it all on the company stock (even if it is Enron). If nothing else, the century-long experiment with pensions has proved that in the absence of the right rules, the money will not always be there. The purpose of pension reform should be not merely to avoid a fiscal disaster but to find a fiscally sound way to preserve the likelihood of secure retirements. If people are going to retire on 401(k)'s, those should be subject to rules, and guidance, as well. 
 It would be nice to think that reform would include a future for pensions, but on the private side at least, it is doubtful. As Delphi's Miller put it simply: ''A pension plan makes no sense in today's world. It's not wise for a company to make financial promises 40 or 50 years down the road.'' Most American executives would agree. Miller says he has not decided what to do at Delphi. If workers grant wage concessions, he has said, the pension plan, which is $4.5 billion shy of what it needs, might even survive. This has the sound of a bargaining ploy. Knowing that the P.B.G.C.'s guarantee is in place, the unions will probably insist on keeping their wages as close to intact as they can, and Miller will probably end up handing the pension plan over to the agency, just as he did at Bethlehem. Then, Miller and other executives will get stock and dandy bonuses in a new Delphi that is happily stripped of pension obligations, and some 45,000 employees and retirees will, in time, happily collect their pensions -- courtesy of the U.S. Government. Moral hazard at work.

HEADLINE: China's Next Big Boom Could Be the Foul Air

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
THE steady barrage of statistics trumpeting China's rise is often greeted elsewhere as if the figures were torpedoes and the rest of the world a sinking ship. Economic growth tops 9 percent! Textile exports jump 500 percent! Military spending up! Manufacturing up! 
 The numbers inflame the exaggerated perception that China is methodically inhaling jobs and resources and, in the process, inhaling the rest of the planet. Burp. There goes the American furniture industry. Burp. Thanks for your oil, Venezuela. 
 But one statistic offered last week by a top Chinese environmental official should stimulate genuine alarm inside and outside China. The official, Zhang Lijun, warned that pollution levels here could more than quadruple within 15 years if the country does not curb its rapid growth in energy consumption and automobile use. 
 China, it seems, has reached a tipping point familiar to many developed countries, including the United States, that have raced headlong after economic development only to look up suddenly and see the environmental carnage. The difference with China, as is so often the case, is that the potential problems are much bigger, have happened much faster and could pose greater concerns for the entire world.
 ''I don't think it will jump four or five times,'' Robert Watson, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said of the pollution prediction by Mr. Zhang. ''But it could double or triple without too much trouble. And that's a scary thought, given how bad things are now.''
 China is already the world's second-biggest producer of greenhouse gas emissions and is expected to surpass the United States as the biggest. Roughly a third of China is exposed to acid rain. A recent study by a Chinese research institute found that 400,000 people die prematurely every year in China from diseases linked to air pollution.
 Nor does China's air pollution respect borders: on certain days almost 25 percent of the particulate matter clotting the skies above Los Angeles can be traced to China, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Environmental experts in California predict that China could eventually account for roughly a third of the state's air pollution.
 The air problem could become a major embarrassment if, as some experts believe, Beijing does not meet its environmental targets for 2008, when the Olympic Games will be played here.
 For the Chinese government, the question is how to change the country's booming economy without crippling it. President Hu Jintao has made ''sustainable development'' a centerpiece of his effort to shift the country from unbridled growth to a more efficient economy. Mr. Hu and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao have repeatedly mentioned environmental protection in speeches.
 The political attention comes as environmental problems are begetting social and economic problems. Violent riots have erupted in the countryside over contaminated water, stunted crops and mounting health woes. In a handful of villages, farmers have stormed chemical factories to stop the dumping of filthy water. Roughly 70 percent of China's rivers and lakes are polluted. In cities, people drink bottled water; in the countryside, most people are too poor to pay for bottled water, so they boil polluted water or simply drink it.
 Public anger is also rising in cities. In some, air pollution is so thick that on the worst days doctors advise, impractically, against going outside. Last week, hundreds of people living in the Beijing outskirts protested plans for a factory they fear would inundate the neighborhood with pollution.
 The severity of the situation has created an opening for environmentalists in and out of the government. Environmentalism is a chic issue for college students, who have participated in garbage cleanups and joined the growing number of nongovernment organizations focused on pollution. The once-meek State Environmental Protection Administration, or SEPA, has become more aggressive in identifying and going after polluters and calling for reforms.
 But the political and practical obstacles are formidable. Car ownership has become part of the Chinese middle-class dream, and the car industry has become a major contributor to tax coffers and a force in the overall economy. 
 Industrial pollution is difficult to control because local officials often ignore emissions standards to appease polluting factories that pay local taxes. SEPA has closed factories, only to see them reopen weeks later. To make a serious reduction in air pollution, experts say, tougher, enforceable standards are needed, and many factories would need new pollution control equipment.
 ''There has to be the political will,'' said Steve Page, director of the E.P.A office of air quality planning and standards. ''The challenge they face is how will these plants be lined up and told this will happen?''
 Politically, the Communist Party has based its legitimacy on delivering economic growth and understands that the boom cannot be taken for granted: high growth is needed simply to keep unemployment in check, and top leaders fear that a slowdown could lead to social instability. Local officials are promoted, foremost, for delivering economic growth. This is why environmental officials have pushed for a new ''green G.D.P.,'' which would alter how gross domestic product is calculated to reflect losses inflicted by environmental degradation.
 The party is suspicious of environmental groups because of the role similar groups played in promoting grass-roots democracy in the ''color'' revolutions of central Asia. Human Rights Watch reported that some environmentalists were recently arrested.
 But if there is resistance, there is progress, too. A law taking effect next year will require that China produce 10 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. Fuel efficiency standards for new cars are already stricter than those in the United States. At an air pollution conference last Monday, environmental officials solicited advice from their peers in Europe and the United States.
 Mr. Page, the E.P.A. official, praised Chinese officials and said China is considering the sort of regional pollution abatement strategies used in the United States. ''They are wrestling with a lot of the same pollution problems that we wrestled with several years ago and that, to some extent, we still are grappling with,'' said Mr. Page, who attended the conference.
 Ma Jun, an independent environmentalist based in Beijing, also praised the efforts by SEPA. Mr. Ma said China's status as the ''workshop of the world'' made it inevitable that its share of the world's pollution would increase. But he also cautioned that too many government ministries remained consumed by economic development. He said the government also needed to recognize the ''environmental rights'' of citizens.
 ''The pollution problem,'' he said, ''is very serious.''

HEADLINE: Before Long, Springing Ahead Sooner and Falling Back Later 

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Time is the enemy of the New Yorker. There is never enough of it. So there was something euphoric about the scene yesterday inside Tourneau TimeMachine in Manhattan, where white-gloved workers were busy setting the store's 8,000 wristwatches back an hour. For once, people got a second chance.
 Officially, the end of daylight saving time struck at 2 a.m. this morning. But, as Richard E. Gellman, a Tourneau vice president, explained, the world's largest watch store needs a head start. It will take workers three days to turn all the little knobs on the sides of all the watches to the previous hour, a significant effort undertaken each October, in accordance with the Uniform Time Act of 1966, as a courtesy to the customer. 
''It's a very big deal,'' Mr. Gellman said. ''We're all about time.''
 But time itself, it turns out, is changing.
 Tucked into the broad energy plan that President Bush signed into law in August, amid more publicized provisions, was a little-known section affecting most Americans, and their clocks. The bill will extend daylight saving time, beginning in 2007, by four weeks, to save energy. Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who cosponsored the legislation, has said the benefits will include energy conservation, less crime, fewer traffic fatalities and increased economic activity. 
 In 2007, daylight saving time will begin on the second Sunday in March instead of the first Sunday in April, and it will end on the first Sunday in November instead of the last Sunday in October. In short, people will set their clocks forward one hour in March rather than April, and set them back an hour in November rather than October. Congress retained the right to revert to the 2005 time schedules after the government studies the impact of the change on energy consumption.
 Yesterday, on the eve of mass clock-resetting, New Yorkers who were told of the change reacted with a bit of surprise, a bit of indifference and a bit of confusion. No one was against it; a few were even up to date on it.
 ''If it's going to conserve energy, it's the right thing to do,'' said Liam Culman, 37, an equity sales trader who paused at the display windows outside Tourneau, at Madison Avenue and 57th Street, while running errands with his 17-month-old daughter, Ellie. 
 Mr. Gellman of Tourneau already knew about the change. ''It was in The Tourneau Times,'' he said, referring to a company magazine.
 Later in the afternoon, Mr. Gellman greeted a man dressed as a floppy-eared Dalmatian. He was not shopping for a new Rolex. He was Hot Dog, the Fire Department's fire safety mascot, visiting the store to remind people to change the batteries of their smoke detectors when they reset their clocks. Three firefighters stood with him in the bucket of a fire truck's mechanical ladder and pretended to change the hands of the giant clock outside the store.
 The clock, controlled by a computer, was not budging for anyone before its automatic resetting at 2 a.m. The tinier ones in the display cases are not as self-sufficient.
 Robert Marcomeni, 42, who works at the store, said he had reset about 250 watches since Friday. He took a pragmatic approach to the task, and to the whole notion of daylight saving time. ''You don't question it,'' he said. ''You just do it.''

HEADLINE: Bronx Revival: Ferrer Played Crucial Part, But How Big?

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE and CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Since leaving office in 2001 after 14 years as borough president, Fernando Ferrer, now the Democratic candidate for mayor, has frequently taken credit for revitalizing the Bronx during his tenure there.
 ''Ferrer designed and oversaw the largest urban rebuilding effort in the country,'' his resume said a few years ago, ''transforming what was once a national symbol of urban decay into an international model for urban revival.''
With Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg emphasizing his own record of reinvigorating a post-Sept. 11 New York, Mr. Ferrer's performance as borough president has become especially relevant. And there is little doubt that the Bronx under Mr. Ferrer, while lagging behind the city's other boroughs by many economic measures, made huge progress from its condition when the sportscaster Howard Cosell informed viewers during the 1977 World Series that ''the Bronx is burning.'' More than 60,000 homes were built, 34,000 jobs were added and $2.5 billion in construction got off the ground during Mr. Ferrer's tenure, his resume said. 
 Although Mr. Ferrer has described those achievements as his own, however, the extent of his role is debatable. Even his critics credit him with making the most of a largely ceremonial office, but his claims of engineering a Bronx resurgence have sparked brush fires on the campaign trail, as when former Mayor Edward I. Koch, a supporter of Mr. Bloomberg, accused Mr. Ferrer of overstating his part in housing programs.
 The position of borough president underwent a major change during Mr. Ferrer's tenure. When Mr. Ferrer took office in 1987, the five borough presidents were prominent players in city affairs through their role on the Board of Estimate, which wielded significant authority over the city budget, contracts and leases. In 1989, though, a City Charter revision abolished the Board of Estimate and greatly reduced the powers of the borough presidency, leaving it largely a bully pulpit for the borough's interests.
 Despite the position's diminished clout during much of his term, Mr. Ferrer has not hesitated to describe his tenure in phrases typically applied to a mayoralty: His resume refers to ''the Ferrer administration'' and says he earned a national reputation as ''a rebuilder of cities.'' Mr. Ferrer had to leave office in 2001 after the city's term limits law took effect.
 But former colleagues from Mr. Ferrer's years as borough president say it would be inaccurate to give him, or any one person, too much credit for what went on during that era, although they praise him for making the most of the limited powers of his office. 
 Genevieve S. Brooks, who was deputy borough president under Mr. Ferrer for seven years, said that he performed his job well -- lobbying for economic development aid, joining a lawsuit over school financing, coaxing hospitals to improve health care access -- but that his office had little power over the financial resources needed to help the borough.
 ''His aggressiveness, his ability to maintain a positive image and really try to market the Bronx from a positive standpoint, that was a plus,'' Ms. Brooks said. ''He was a wonderful cheerleader, an excellent cheerleader, but the power was elsewhere.
 ''There is no other way you can slice that,'' she continued. ''Mayor Koch has to be commended for the job that he did. Mayor Koch brought in the money. There is no comparison there.''
 When Mr. Ferrer first joined the City Council in 1982, the echoes of Mr. Cosell's remarks still reverberated in a borough where quality of life seemed to have bottomed out. The sportscaster was referring to smoke from a five-alarm fire visible from Yankee Stadium, but his words captured a larger sense of despair. 
 In addition to its economic straits, the Bronx endured a political culture riven by racial and ethnic squabbling, as well as festering corruption, which bubbled to the surface in the mid-1980's in a series of scandals. 
 When the borough president, Stanley Simon, resigned in 1987 while facing indictment in an extortion case, Mr. Ferrer was chosen by Democratic leaders to replace him, and in a 1987 interview he said that it would be his seat on the Board of Estimate that gave him the most clout.
 ''My vote on the Board of Estimate,'' Mr. Ferrer said, ''is to a great degree the power that I have.''
 But two years after Mr. Ferrer took office, the charter revision approved by voters, in abolishing the Board of Estimate, neutered the office of borough president. Under their new mandate, the borough presidents could do little more than appoint members of community boards, issue reports, make recommendations for capital projects and decide how to spend a relatively small amount of money each year, usually several million dollars.
 An example of how those discretionary funds were spent can be found in the 1997 city budget, which contains a list of Mr. Ferrer's borough expenditures for that year. They are mostly small amounts, ranging from $293,332 for a ''late night youth-at-risk program'' to $3,500 for the Riverdale Jewish Community Council. In addition, the borough received commitments of $13 million for capital projects, among them a new playground, classroom computers and tree plantings.
 Ruth W. Messinger, who was Manhattan borough president from 1990 to 1998, said the post-1989 presidents relied more on powers of persuasion than governmental authority. Although she struggled to quantify the office's source of influence, she was ''very comfortable saying we had a very significant role'' in shaping decisions that affected borough life.
 ''I don't know quite how to describe it, because the legal power of the office kind of disappeared,'' said Ms. Messinger, who lost the 1997 mayoral election to the Republican incumbent, Rudolph W. Giuliani. ''But still, influencing who is running the boards, developing and discussing plans with them, the chance to influence development projects, critiques of public policy -- there continues to be a very real role for the borough presidents.
 ''A lot of it is done by the mayor,'' she said, ''but much depends on who the borough president is, whether the borough president is ready to rally the citizens of his or her borough to support a project.''
 When it comes to rallying support, Mr. Ferrer gets credit from all quarters for being an effective cheerleader, a term that more than one former colleague used to describe Mr. Ferrer's accomplishments back then. Even Peter F. Vallone Sr., a former City Council speaker and a Democrat who is supporting Mr. Bloomberg, said Mr. Ferrer ''was a terrific borough president'' in that regard.
 Mr. Ferrer lobbied hard to have the Bronx declared a federal ''empowerment zone,'' which would make it eligible for $100 million in low-interest loans and tax incentives, but he was almost thwarted by Mayor David N. Dinkins, who sided with a plan to give Harlem that designation instead. After Mr. Dinkins left office in 1994, Mayor Giuliani forged a compromise in which both Harlem and the South Bronx were included in a zone, giving each about $50 million.
 The Bronx portion of the money was administered by the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit agency that is effectively an adjunct of the borough president's office. The corporation's former chief financial officer, Derek Broomes, said such successes might not have been possible without Mr. Ferrer's advocacy.
 ''Once you are in that position of leadership, you become a cheerleader,'' Mr. Broomes said. ''And having the reality that you cannot really execute everything you need to because of the constraints on the office, you develop working partnerships with the City Council members, with your congressmen, with your state and local legislators. Freddy worked very closely with them.''
 Mr. Ferrer also joined the Campaign for Fiscal Equity in its legal battle for more money for city schools, and helped form a coalition of Bronx hospitals, called Bronx Health Link, to educate residents on how to get health care services. In 1994 he formed a commission that investigated allegations of corruption in Bronx school districts.
 As the mayoral campaign heated up this year, Mr. Ferrer has come under attack by Bloomberg supporters for statements about his Bronx record. When Mr. Ferrer released a television ad boasting of a program for affordable housing during his borough presidency, Mr. Koch said Mr. Ferrer had nothing to do with it. ''All that Freddy did, to his credit, was to stay out of the way,'' Mr. Koch said.
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Ferrer, Jen Bluestein, responded that he had been ''a partner'' with Mr. Koch in developing the housing and noted that the advertisement said that Mr. Ferrer had helped with the program, not that he had done it alone.
 The economic and social progress that occurred in the Bronx during the years that Mr. Ferrer was borough president was summarized in a report published by the state comptroller in April 2002, just a few months after Mr. Ferrer left office. The report, titled, ''The Bronx: An Economic Overview,'' described how ''federal, state, local and private sector resources'' were brought to bear on the poorest sections of the borough during the 1990's to create jobs and to help small businesses.
 The 61-page report barely mentions the borough president's office, although it does note that the office ''works closely'' with the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, which coordinated much of the government assistance. A real estate broker who served on the corporation's board in the 1990's, Susan E. Goldy, praised Mr. Ferrer for supervising it while not meddling in its operations.
 ''I was very impressed with Freddy,'' Ms. Goldy said. ''I really felt that the board operated at arm's length and was free to do what it needed to look at any project and see whether it would benefit the borough. He was financially and philosophically very much supportive of what it was that we were trying to accomplish.''
 A former president of the corporation, Kevin Nunn, contended that economic development efforts in the Bronx outpaced those in other boroughs, and he credited Mr. Ferrer with having a hand in it.
 ''I don't think that anyone can say, 'Yes, I did it,' '' Mr. Nunn said. ''But you got to have leaders who bring people together, to focus on a common objective, to put aside all of the backstabbing and infighting, all of the things that go on in New York and any big town. I think that Freddy can take huge credit for that.''

HEADLINE: What's a Modern Girl to Do?

BYLINE: By Maureen Dowd. 
Maureen Dowd is a columnist for The New York Times. This essay is adapted from ''Are Men Necessary: When Sexes Collide,'' to be published next month by G.P. Putnam's Sons.

 BODY:
When I entered college in 1969, women were bursting out of theirs 50's chrysalis, shedding girdles, padded bras and conventions. The Jazz Age spirit flared in the Age of Aquarius. Women were once again imitating men and acting all independent: smoking, drinking, wanting to earn money and thinking they had the right to be sexual, this time protected by the pill. I didn't fit in with the brazen new world of hard-charging feminists. I was more of a fun-loving (if chaste) type who would decades later come to life in Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie Bradshaw. I hated the grubby, unisex jeans and no-makeup look and drugs that zoned you out, and I couldn't understand the appeal of dances that didn't involve touching your partner. In the universe of Eros, I longed for style and wit. I loved the Art Deco glamour of 30's movies. I wanted to dance the Continental like Fred and Ginger in white hotel suites; drink martinis like Myrna Loy and William Powell; live the life of a screwball heroine like Katharine Hepburn, wearing a gold lame gown cut on the bias, cavorting with Cary Grant, strolling along Fifth Avenue with my pet leopard. 
My mom would just shake her head and tell me that my idea of the 30's was wildly romanticized. ''We were poor,'' she'd say. ''We didn't dance around in white hotel suites.'' I took the idealism and passion of the 60's for granted, simply assuming we were sailing toward perfect equality with men, a utopian world at home and at work. I didn't listen to her when she cautioned me about the chimera of equality.
 On my 31st birthday, she sent me a bankbook with a modest nest egg she had saved for me. ''I always felt that the girls in a family should get a little more than the boys even though all are equally loved,'' she wrote in a letter. ''They need a little cushion to fall back on. Women can stand on the Empire State Building and scream to the heavens that they are equal to men and liberated, but until they have the same anatomy, it's a lie. It's more of a man's world today than ever. Men can eat their cake in unlimited bakeries.''
 I thought she was just being Old World, like my favorite jade, Dorothy Parker, when she wrote:
 By the time you swear you're his,
 Shivering and sighing,
 And he vows his passion is
 Infinite, undying --
 Lady, make a note of this:
 One of you is lying.
 I thought the struggle for egalitarianism was a cinch, so I could leave it to my earnest sisters in black turtlenecks and Birkenstocks. I figured there was plenty of time for me to get serious later, that America would always be full of passionate and full-throated debate about the big stuff -- social issues, sexual equality, civil rights. Little did I realize that the feminist revolution would have the unexpected consequence of intensifying the confusion between the sexes, leaving women in a tangle of dependence and independence as they entered the 21st century. 
 Maybe we should have known that the story of women's progress would be more of a zigzag than a superhighway, that the triumph of feminism would last a nanosecond while the backlash lasted 40 years.
 Despite the best efforts of philosophers, politicians, historians, novelists, screenwriters, linguists, therapists, anthropologists and facilitators, men and women are still in a muddle in the boardroom, the bedroom and the Situation Room.

Courtship
 My mom gave me three essential books on the subject of men. The first, when I was 13, was ''On Becoming a Woman.'' The second, when I was 21, was ''365 Ways to Cook Hamburger.'' The third, when I was 25, was ''How to Catch and Hold a Man,'' by Yvonne Antelle. (''Keep thinking of yourself as a soft, mysterious cat.. . .Men are fascinated by bright, shiny objects, by lots of curls, lots of hair on the head . . . by bows, ribbons, ruffles and bright colors.. . .Sarcasm is dangerous. Avoid it altogether.'') 
 Because I received ''How to Catch and Hold a Man'' at a time when we were entering the Age of Equality, I put it aside as an anachronism. After all, sometime in the 1960's flirting went out of fashion, as did ironing boards, makeup and the idea that men needed to be ''trapped'' or ''landed.'' The way to approach men, we reasoned, was forthrightly and without games, artifice or frills. Unfortunately, history has shown this to be a misguided notion. 
 I knew it even before the 1995 publication of ''The Rules,'' a dating bible that encouraged women to return to prefeminist mind games by playing hard to get. (''Don't stay on the phone for more than 10 minutes.. . .Even if you are the head of your own company. . .when you're with a man you like, be quiet and mysterious, act ladylike, cross your legs and smile.. . .Wear black sheer pantyhose and hike up your skirt to entice the opposite sex!'')
 I knew this before fashion magazines became crowded with crinolines, bows, ruffles, leopard-skin scarves, 50's party dresses and other sartorial equivalents of flirting and with articles like ''The Return of Hard to Get.'' (''I think it behooves us to stop offering each other these pearls of feminism, to stop saying, 'So, why don't you call him?''' a writer lectured in Mademoiselle. ''Some men must have the thrill of the chase.'')
 I knew things were changing because a succession of my single girlfriends had called, sounding sheepish, to ask if they could borrow my out-of-print copy of ''How to Catch and Hold a Man.''
 Decades after the feminist movement promised equality with men, it was becoming increasingly apparent that many women would have to brush up on the venerable tricks of the trade: an absurdly charming little laugh, a pert toss of the head, an air of saucy triumph, dewy eyes and a full knowledge of music, drawing, elegant note writing and geography. It would once more be considered captivating to lie on a chaise longue, pass a lacy handkerchief across the eyelids and complain of a case of springtime giddiness. 
 Today, women have gone back to hunting their quarry -- in person and in cyberspace -- with elaborate schemes designed to allow the deluded creatures to think they are the hunters. ''Men like hunting, and we shouldn't deprive them of their chance to do their hunting and mating rituals,'' my 26-year-old friend Julie Bosman, a New York Times reporter, says. ''As my mom says, Men don't like to be chased.'' Or as the Marvelettes sang, ''The hunter gets captured by the game.''
 These days the key to staying cool in the courtship rituals is B. & I., girls say -- Busy and Important. ''As much as you're waiting for that little envelope to appear on your screen,'' says Carrie Foster, a 29-year-old publicist in Washington, ''you happen to have a lot of stuff to do anyway.'' If a guy rejects you or turns out to be the essence of evil, you can ratchet up from B. & I. to C.B.B., Can't Be Bothered. In the T.M.I. -- Too Much Information -- digital age, there can be infinite technological foreplay. 
 Helen Fisher, a Rutgers anthropologist, concurs with Julie: ''What our grandmothers told us about playing hard to get is true. The whole point of the game is to impress and capture. It's not about honesty. Many men and women, when they're playing the courtship game, deceive so they can win. Novelty, excitement and danger drive up dopamine in the brain. And both sexes brag.''
 Women might dye their hair, apply makeup and spend hours finding a hip-slimming dress, she said, while men may drive a nice car or wear a fancy suit that makes them seem richer than they are. In this retro world, a woman must play hard to get but stay soft as a kitten. And avoid sarcasm. Altogether.

Money
 In those faraway, long-ago days of feminism, there was talk about equal pay for equal work. Now there's talk about ''girl money.''
 A friend of mine in her 30's says it is a term she hears bandied about the New York dating scene. She also notes a shift in the type of gifts given at wedding showers around town, a reversion to 50's-style offerings: soup ladles and those frilly little aprons from Anthropologie and vintage stores are being unwrapped along with see-through nighties and push-up bras.
 ''What I find most disturbing about the 1950's-ification and retrogression of women's lives is that it has seeped into the corporate and social culture, where it can do real damage,'' she complains. ''Otherwise intelligent men, who know women still earn less than men as a rule, say things like: 'I'll get the check. You only have girl money.'''
 Throughout the long, dark ages of undisputed patriarchy, women connived to trade beauty and sex for affluence and status. In the first flush of feminism, women offered to pay half the check with ''woman money'' as a way to show that these crass calculations -- that a woman's worth in society was determined by her looks, that she was an ornament up for sale to the highest bidder -- no longer applied.
 Now dating etiquette has reverted. Young women no longer care about using the check to assert their equality. They care about using it to assess their sexuality. Going Dutch is an archaic feminist relic. Young women talk about it with disbelief and disdain. ''It's a scuzzy 70's thing, like platform shoes on men,'' one told me.
 ''Feminists in the 70's went overboard,'' Anne Schroeder, a 26-year-old magazine editor in Washington, agrees. ''Paying is like opening a car door. It's nice. I appreciate it. But he doesn't have to.''
 Unless he wants another date.
 Women in their 20's think old-school feminists looked for equality in all the wrong places, that instead of fighting battles about whether women should pay for dinner or wear padded bras they should have focused only on big economic issues.
 After Googling and Bikramming to get ready for a first dinner date, a modern girl will end the evening with the Offering, an insincere bid to help pay the check. ''They make like they are heading into their bag after a meal, but it is a dodge,'' Marc Santora, a 30-year-old Metro reporter for The Times, says. ''They know you will stop them before a credit card can be drawn. If you don't, they hold it against you.''
 One of my girlfriends, a TV producer in New York, told me much the same thing: ''If you offer, and they accept, then it's over.''
 Jurassic feminists shudder at the retro implication of a quid profiterole. But it doesn't matter if the woman is making as much money as the man, or more, she expects him to pay, both to prove her desirability and as a way of signaling romance -- something that's more confusing in a dating culture rife with casual hookups and group activities. (Once beyond the initial testing phase and settled in a relationship, of course, she can pony up more.)
 ''There are plenty of ways for me to find out if he's going to see me as an equal without disturbing the dating ritual,'' one young woman says. ''Disturbing the dating ritual leads to chaos. Everybody knows that.''
 When I asked a young man at my gym how he and his lawyer girlfriend were going to divide the costs on a California vacation, he looked askance. ''She never offers,'' he replied. ''And I like paying for her.'' It is, as one guy said, ''one of the few remaining ways we can demonstrate our manhood.''

Power Dynamics
 At a party for the Broadway opening of ''Sweet Smell of Success,'' a top New York producer gave me a lecture on the price of female success that was anything but sweet. He confessed that he had wanted to ask me out on a date when he was between marriages but nixed the idea because my job as a Times columnist made me too intimidating. Men, he explained, prefer women who seem malleable and awed. He predicted that I would never find a mate because if there's one thing men fear, it's a woman who uses her critical faculties. Will she be critical of absolutely everything, even his manhood?
 He had hit on a primal fear of single successful women: that the aroma of male power is an aphrodisiac for women, but the perfume of female power is a turnoff for men. It took women a few decades to realize that everything they were doing to advance themselves in the boardroom could be sabotaging their chances in the bedroom, that evolution was lagging behind equality.
 A few years ago at a White House correspondents' dinner, I met a very beautiful and successful actress. Within minutes, she blurted out: ''I can't believe I'm 46 and not married. Men only want to marry their personal assistants or P.R. women.''
 I'd been noticing a trend along these lines, as famous and powerful men took up with young women whose job it was was to care for them and nurture them in some way: their secretaries, assistants, nannies, caterers, flight attendants, researchers and fact-checkers.
 John Schwartz of The New York Times made the trend official in 2004 when he reported: ''Men would rather marry their secretaries than their bosses, and evolution may be to blame.'' A study by psychology researchers at the University of Michigan, using college undergraduates, suggested that men going for long-term relationships would rather marry women in subordinate jobs than women who are supervisors. Men think that women with important jobs are more likely to cheat on them. There it is, right in the DNA: women get penalized by insecure men for being too independent.
 ''The hypothesis,'' Dr. Stephanie Brown, the lead author of the study, theorized, ''is that there are evolutionary pressures on males to take steps to minimize the risk of raising offspring that are not their own.'' Women, by contrast, did not show a marked difference between their attraction to men who might work above them and their attraction to men who might work below them. 
 So was the feminist movement some sort of cruel hoax? Do women get less desirable as they get more successful? 
 After I first wrote on this subject, a Times reader named Ray Lewis e-mailed me. While we had assumed that making ourselves more professionally accomplished would make us more fascinating, it turned out, as Lewis put it, that smart women were ''draining at times.'' 
 Or as Bill Maher more crudely but usefully summed it up to Craig Ferguson on the ''Late Late Show'' on CBS: ''Women get in relationships because they want somebody to talk to. Men want women to shut up.''
 Women moving up still strive to marry up. Men moving up still tend to marry down. The two sexes' going in opposite directions has led to an epidemic of professional women missing out on husbands and kids.
 Sylvia Ann Hewlett, an economist and the author of ''Creating a Life: Professional Women and the Quest for Children,'' a book published in 2002, conducted a survey and found that 55 percent of 35-year-old career women were childless. And among corporate executives who earn $100,000 or more, she said, 49 percent of the women did not have children, compared with only 19 percent of the men. 
 Hewlett quantified, yet again, that men have an unfair advantage. ''Nowadays,'' she said, ''the rule of thumb seems to be that the more successful the woman, the less likely it is she will find a husband or bear a child. For men, the reverse is true.''
 A 2005 report by researchers at four British universities indicated that a high I.Q. hampers a woman's chance to marry, while it is a plus for men. The prospect for marriage increased by 35 percent for guys for each 16-point increase in I.Q.; for women, there is a 40 percent drop for each 16-point rise.
 On a ''60 Minutes'' report on the Hewlett book, Lesley Stahl talked to two young women who went to Harvard Business School. They agreed that while they were the perfect age to start families, they didn't find it easy to meet the right mates.
 Men, apparently, learn early to protect their eggshell egos from high-achieving women. The girls said they hid the fact that they went to Harvard from guys they met because it was the kiss of death. ''The H-bomb,'' they dubbed it. ''As soon as you say Harvard Business School . . . that's the end of the conversation,'' Ani Vartanian said. ''As soon as the guys say, 'Oh, I go to Harvard Business School,' all the girls start falling into them.''
 Hewlett thinks that the 2005 American workplace is more macho than ever. ''It's actually much more difficult now than 10 years ago to have a career and raise a family,'' she told me. ''The trend lines continue that highly educated women in many countries are increasingly dealing with this creeping nonchoice and end up on this path of delaying finding a mate and delaying childbearing. Whether you're looking at Italy, Russia or the U.S., all of that is true.'' Many women continue to fear that the more they accomplish, the more they may have to sacrifice. They worry that men still veer away from ''challenging'' women because of a male atavistic desire to be the superior force in a relationship. 
 ''With men and women, it's always all about control issues, isn't it?'' says a guy I know, talking about his bitter divorce.
 Or, as Craig Bierko, a musical comedy star and actor who played one of Carrie's boyfriends on ''Sex and the City,'' told me, ''Deep down, beneath the bluster and machismo, men are simply afraid to say that what they're truly looking for in a woman is an intelligent, confident and dependable partner in life whom they can devote themselves to unconditionally until she's 40.''

Ms. Versus Mrs.
 ''Ms.'' was supposed to neutralize the stature of women, so they weren't publicly defined by their marital status. When The Times finally agreed to switch to Ms. in its news pages in 1986, after much hectoring by feminists, Gloria Steinem sent flowers to the executive editor, Abe Rosenthal. But nowadays most young brides want to take their husbands' names and brag on the moniker Mrs., a brand that proclaims you belong to him. T-shirts with ''MRS.'' emblazoned in sequins or sparkly beads are popular wedding-shower gifts. 
 A Harvard economics professor, Claudia Goldin, did a study last year that found that 44 percent of women in the Harvard class of 1980 who married within 10 years of graduation kept their birth names, while in the class of '90 it was down to 32 percent. In 1990, 23 percent of college-educated women kept their own names after marriage, while a decade later the number had fallen to 17 percent.
 Time magazine reported that an informal poll in the spring of 2005 by the Knot, a wedding Web site, showed similar results: 81 percent of respondents took their spouse's last name, an increase from 71 percent in 2000. The number of women with hyphenated surnames fell from 21 percent to 8 percent.
 ''It's a return to romance, a desire to make marriage work,'' Goldin told one interviewer, adding that young women might feel that by keeping their own names they were aligning themselves with tedious old-fashioned feminists, and this might be a turnoff to them.
 The professor, who married in 1979 and kept her name, undertook the study after her niece, a lawyer, changed hers. ''She felt that her generation of women didn't have to do the same things mine did, because of what we had already achieved,'' Goldin told Time.
 Many women now do not think of domestic life as a ''comfortable concentration camp,'' as Betty Friedan wrote in ''The Feminine Mystique,'' where they are losing their identities and turning into ''anonymous biological robots in a docile mass.'' Now they want to be Mrs. Anonymous Biological Robot in a Docile Mass. They dream of being rescued -- to flirt, to shop, to stay home and be taken care of. They shop for ''Stepford Fashions'' -- matching shoes and ladylike bags and the 50's-style satin, lace and chiffon party dresses featured in InStyle layouts -- and spend their days at the gym trying for Wisteria Lane waistlines.
 The Times recently ran a front-page article about young women attending Ivy League colleges, women who are being groomed to take their places in the professional and political elite, who are planning to reject careers in favor of playing traditional roles, staying home and raising children.
 ''My mother always told me you can't be the best career woman and the best mother at the same time,'' the brainy, accomplished Cynthia Liu told Louise Story, explaining why she hoped to be a stay-at-home mom a few years after she goes to law school. ''You always have to choose one over the other.''
 Kate White, the editor of Cosmopolitan, told me that she sees a distinct shift in what her readers want these days. ''Women now don't want to be in the grind,'' she said. ''The baby boomers made the grind seem unappealing.'' 
 Cynthia Russett, a professor of American history at Yale, told Story that women today are simply more ''realistic,'' having seen the dashed utopia of those who assumed it wouldn't be so hard to combine full-time work and child rearing.
 To the extent that young women are rejecting the old idea of copying men and reshaping the world around their desires, it's exhilarating progress. But to the extent that a pampered class of females is walking away from the problem and just planning to marry rich enough to cosset themselves in a narrow world of dependence on men, it's an irritating setback. If the new ethos is ''a woman needs a career like a fish needs a bicycle,'' it won't be healthy.

Movies
 In all those Tracy-Hepburn movies more than a half-century ago, it was the snap and crackle of a romance between equals that was so exciting. You still see it onscreen occasionally -- the incendiary chemistry of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie playing married assassins aiming for mutually assured orgasms and destruction in ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith.'' Interestingly, that movie was described as retro because of its salty battle of wits between two peppery lovers. Moviemakers these days are more interested in exploring what Steve Martin, in his novel ''Shopgirl,'' calls the ''calm cushion'' of romances between unequals.
 In James Brooks's movie ''Spanglish,'' Adam Sandler, playing a sensitive Los Angeles chef, falls for his hot Mexican maid, just as in ''Maid in Manhattan,'' Ralph Fiennes, playing a sensitive New York pol, falls for the hot Latino maid at his hotel, played by Jennifer Lopez. Sandler's maid, who cleans up for him without being able to speak English, is presented as the ideal woman, in looks and character. His wife, played by Tea Leoni, is repellent: a jangly, yakking, overachieving, overexercised, unfaithful, shallow she-monster who has just lost her job with a commercial design firm and fears she has lost her identity.
 In 2003, we had ''Girl With a Pearl Earring,'' in which Colin Firth's Vermeer erotically paints Scarlett Johansson's Dutch maid, and Richard Curtis's ''Love Actually,'' about the attraction of unequals. The witty and sophisticated British prime minister, played by Hugh Grant, falls for the chubby girl who wheels the tea and scones into his office. A businessman married to the substantial Emma Thompson, the sister of the prime minister, falls for his sultry secretary. A novelist played by Colin Firth falls for his maid, who speaks only Portuguese.
 Art is imitating life, turning women who seek equality into selfish narcissists and objects ofrejection rather than of affection.
 It's funny. I come from a family of Irish domestics -- statuesque, 6-foot-tall women who cooked, kept house and acted as nannies for some of America's first families. I was always so proud of achieving more -- succeeding in a high-powered career that would have been closed to my great-aunts. How odd, then, to find out now that being a maid would have enhanced my chances with men. 
 An upstairs maid, of course.

Women's Magazines
 Cosmo is still the best-selling magazine on college campuses, as it was when I was in college, and the best-selling monthly magazine on the newsstand. The June 2005 issue, with Jessica Simpson on the cover, her cleavage spilling out of an orange croqueted halter dress, could have been June 1970. The headlines are familiar: ''How to turn him on in 10 words or less,'' ''Do You Make Men M-E-L-T? Take our quiz,'' ''Bridal Special,'' Cosmo's stud search and ''Cosmo's Most Famous Sex Tips; the Legendary Tricks That Have Brought Countless Guys to Their Knees.'' (Sex Trick 4: ''Place a glazed doughnut around your man's member, then gently nibble the pastry and lick the icing . . . as well as his manhood.'' Another favorite Cosmo trick is to yell out during sex which of your girlfriends thinks your man is hot.)
 At any newsstand, you'll see the original Cosmo girl's man-crazy, sex-obsessed image endlessly, tiresomely replicated, even for the teen set. On the cover of Elle Girl: ''267 Ways to Look Hot.'' 
 ''There has been lots of copying -- look at Glamour,'' Helen Gurley Brown, Cosmo's founding editor told me and sighed. ''I used to have all the sex to myself.''
 Before it curdled into a collection of stereotypes, feminism had fleetingly held out a promise that there would be some precincts of womanly life that were not all about men. But it never quite materialized.
 It took only a few decades to create a brazen new world where the highest ideal is to acknowledge your inner slut. I am woman; see me strip. Instead of peaceful havens of girl things and boy things, we have a society where women of all ages are striving to become self-actualized sex kittens. Hollywood actresses now work out by taking pole-dancing classes.
 Female sexuality has been a confusing corkscrew path, not a serene progressive arc. We had decades of Victorian prudery, when women were not supposed to like sex. Then we had the pill and zipless encounters, when women were supposed to have the same animalistic drive as men. Then it was discovered -- shock, horror! -- that men and women are not alike in their desires. But zipless morphed into hookups, and the more one-night stands the girls on ''Sex and the City'' had, the grumpier they got.
 Oddly enough, Felix Dennis, who created the top-selling Maxim, said he stole his ''us against the world'' lad-magazine attitude from women's magazines like Cosmo. Just as women didn't mind losing Cosmo's prestigious fiction as the magazine got raunchier, plenty of guys were happy to lose the literary pretensions of venerable men's magazines and embrace simple-minded gender stereotypes, like the Maxim manifesto instructing women, ''If we see you in the morning and night, why call us at work?''
 Jessica Simpson and Eva Longoria move seamlessly from showing their curves on the covers of Cosmo and Glamour to Maxim, which dubbed Simpson ''America's favorite ball and chain!'' In the summer of 2005, both British GQ and FHM featured Pamela Anderson busting out of their covers. (''I think of my breasts as props,'' she told FHM.)
 A lot of women now want to be Maxim babes as much as men want Maxim babes. So women have moved from fighting objectification to seeking it. ''I have been surprised,'' Maxim's editor, Ed Needham, confessed to me, ''to find that a lot of women would want to be somehow validated as a Maxim girl type, that they'd like to be thought of as hot and would like their boyfriends to take pictures of them or make comments about them that mirror the Maxim representation of a woman, the Pamela Anderson sort of brand. That, to me, is kind of extraordinary.''
 The luscious babes on the cover of Maxim were supposed to be men's fantasy guilty pleasures, after all, not their real life-affirming girlfriends.

Beauty
 While I never related to the unstyled look of the early feminists and I tangled with boyfriends who did not want me to wear makeup and heels, I always assumed that one positive result of the feminist movement would be a more flexible and capacious notion of female beauty, a release from the tyranny of the girdled, primped ideal of the 50's. 
 I was wrong. Forty years after the dawn of feminism, the ideal of feminine beauty is more rigid and unnatural than ever. 
 When Gloria Steinem wrote that ''all women are Bunnies,'' she did not mean it as a compliment; it was a feminist call to arms. Decades later, it's just an aesthetic fact, as more and more women embrace Botox and implants and stretch and protrude to extreme proportions to satisfy male desires. Now that technology is biology, all women can look like inflatable dolls. It's clear that American narcissism has trumped American feminism.
 It was naive and misguided for the early feminists to tendentiously demonize Barbie and Cosmo girl, to disdain such female proclivities as shopping, applying makeup and hunting for sexy shoes and cute boyfriends and to prognosticate a world where men and women dressed alike and worked alike in navy suits and were equal in every way.
 But it is equally naive and misguided for young women now to fritter away all their time shopping for boudoirish clothes and text-messaging about guys while they disdainfully ignore gender politics and the seismic shifts on the Supreme Court that will affect women's rights for a generation.
 What I didn't like at the start of the feminist movement was that young women were dressing alike, looking alike and thinking alike. They were supposed to be liberated, but it just seemed like stifling conformity.
 What I don't like now is that the young women rejecting the feminist movement are dressing alike, looking alike and thinking alike. The plumage is more colorful, the shapes are more curvy, the look is more plastic, the message is diametrically opposite -- before it was don't be a sex object; now it's be a sex object -- but the conformity is just as stifling.

And the Future. . .
 Having boomeranged once, will women do it again in a couple of decades? If we flash forward to 2030, will we see all those young women who thought trying to Have It All was a pointless slog, now middle-aged and stranded in suburbia, popping Ativan, struggling with rebellious teenagers, deserted by husbands for younger babes, unable to get back into a work force they never tried to be part of?
 It's easy to picture a surreally familiar scene when women realize they bought into a raw deal and old trap. With no power or money or independence, they'll be mere domestic robots, lasering their legs and waxing their floors -- or vice versa -- and desperately seeking a new Betty Friedan.

HEADLINE: Bernanke's Models, And Their Limits

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
IN terms of intellect, Ben S. Bernanke may be to the Federal Reserve what John G. Roberts Jr. is to the Supreme Court. And like Chief Justice Roberts, Mr. Bernanke, the nominee to replace Alan Greenspan at the Fed, has left a paper trail worth studying. What can it tell us about the sort of Fed chairman he would be?
 In general, Mr. Bernanke's work has been solidly in the mainstream -- a mainstream he has helped define since he began publishing papers in major economic journals since 1981. He has written repeatedly about ways of using mathematical models of a dauntingly complex economy to set monetary policy. When he has strayed from that subject, his conclusions have sometimes raised eyebrows. 
For example, in 2001 he joined Refet S. Gurkaynak of Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey, in urging colleagues to adopt the sort of savings-driven models of the economy that the White House used to justify its tax cuts. David H. Romer, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, whose earlier work was discussed in the paper, said the statistical support for their argument was unconvincing.
 In 1999, Mr. Bernanke and Mark Gertler, chairman of the economics department at New York University, wrote that financially fragile countries should not adopt fixed exchange rates, because they had been associated with crises in the past -- a logic that other economists have disputed. 
 ''Most of my American colleagues seem to go in this direction, but it's not a widely shared view around the world, and especially not in developing countries,'' said Charles Wyplosz, a professor of economics at the University of Geneva's Graduate Institute of International Studies. ''The experience with floating interest rates is that they tend to float too much, so some sort of harnessing of the exchange-rate movements is useful for small, open economies.'' 
 These topics, however, are not at the core of what Mr. Bernanke would be concerned with at the Fed. There, his opinions about domestic monetary policy would be more important. One tenet of Mr. Bernanke's philosophy could not be clearer: that the central bank should use a model, not just hunches, to decide about interest rates and the money supply. 
 This is how he put it in 1997 in a paper with Michael Woodford, now a professor of political economy at Columbia: ''We conclude that, although private-sector forecasts may contain information useful to the central bank, ultimately the monetary authorities must rely on an explicit structural model of the economy to guide their policy decisions.''
 Mr. Bernanke has examined exactly what data a central bank should use to calibrate its models. In 2003, he and Jean Boivin, an associate professor at the Columbia Business School, wrote that there was little advantage in waiting for ''final'' figures for government statistics, and that preliminary figures worked just as well for economic forecasts. The types of data used by the Fed could also change, said Anil K. Kashyap, a professor of economics and finance at the University of Chicago's business school.
 ''Greenspan was famous for looking at all these strange things like boxcar shipments,'' Professor Kashyap said, adding that Mr. Bernanke might prefer ''indicators motivated by theoretical considerations,'' like banks' loan commitments.
 Yet even in the ''data-rich environment'' that Mr. Bernanke and Professor Boivin described, models don't always encompass every possible outcome. Though models can explain various facets of the economy's behavior, even several at a time, no one has come up with a single formula that explains virtually everything.
 To wit: a recent theme of Mr. Bernanke's work, one that he expounded as a Fed governor, is that the central bank should not try to prick bubbles in asset prices -- mostly because it's too hard to tell when a bubble is really present. In that 1999 paper, he and Professor Gertler supplied a model to show how monetary policy should react to changes in asset prices.
 Rudiger Dornbusch, the late professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the model lacked one important feature. ''When it comes to monetary policy and asset price volatility,'' he wrote, ''the interesting issue is not the gentle part of the trip but rather when it crashes.'' At that point, credit and liquidity can dry up.
 ''Neither of these considerations has a place in the Bernanke-Gertler model, which is just price-based and lacks rationing and liquidity,'' Professor Dornbusch concluded. The absence of liquidity and the onset of credit rationing, he argued, can be extremely important factors in forming policy at times of crisis.
 Interestingly, Mr. Bernanke and Professor Gertler wrote a few years earlier that monetary policy might be most powerful during periods of tight credit, because of its effects on banks' balance sheets. But the periods of tightest credit -- usually just before, during and after a crash in the markets -- are the ones that are most difficult to model.
 That is not to say that Mr. Bernanke would shy away from radical action in a crash. In an early version of a paper with Professor Gertler that was eventually published in 1990, they wrote that ''under some circumstance, government 'bailouts' of insolvent debtors may be a reasonable alternative in periods of extreme financial fragility.''
 PROFESSOR ROMER at Berkeley said he believed that Mr. Bernanke would know when to discard his models. ''He of course understands that even in normal times, the best model is just a guide,'' Professor Romer said. ''If something extraordinary happens, like either Russia goes under or the stock market goes down by 20 percent, anyone with a modicum of common sense knows that the model's not going to be a reliable guide.''
 Despite their differences, Professor Romer gave Mr. Bernanke high marks as a potential Fed chairman. The professor's view carries some weight; in 2004, he and his wife, Christina D. Romer, also a professor of economics at Berkeley, published a paper entitled ''Choosing the Federal Reserve Chair: Lessons From History.''
 ''It's not your political abilities or who you know,'' David Romer said. ''What does matter is your understanding of the economy and the effects of monetary policy. By that standard, Ben is the best person you could choose, basically.''

HEADLINE: The Latest in Second-Term Scandals

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
White House scandals in the second term of presidencies have become the rule. 
 Dwight D. Eisenhower's chief of staff was forced from office by accusations of corruption. Richard M. Nixon resigned over Watergate. Ronald Reagan's White House was embroiled in the Iran-contra scheme. Bill Clinton was impeached over his deceptions regarding an affair with a White House intern.
But President Bush's situation is different in several respects. 
 Most important, from Mr. Bush's perspective, he is the first second-term president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to have both houses of Congress controlled by his own party. The other scandals were driven, at least in part, by Congressional investigations. This Congress is unlikely to investigate this president.
 On the other hand, except for Nixon, the other second-term presidents in the last half-century mostly maintained their popularity even as the scandals were unfolding. 
 At his low point, in the spring of 1958, Eisenhower's handling of the presidency was approved of by 48 percent of the public and disapproved of by 36 percent, a Gallup poll showed. At the end of his term, Eisenhower's approval rating had climbed to 59 percent.
 In February 1987, as the Iran-contra scandal was breaking, 42 percent of those questioned in a New York Times/CBS News poll approved of Reagan's presidency, with 46 percent disapproving. It was the only month of his second term when a plurality was against him. By summer, his approval rate had climbed above 50 percent, and it was 60 percent when he left office.
 Mr. Clinton's approval rating in his second term never fell below 55 percent, and it was 68 percent at the end of his presidency. 
 Mr. Bush is faring much worse. A Gallup/CNN/USA Today poll taken last weekend found Mr. Bush's approval rating to be 42 percent and his disapproval rating 55 percent. 
 Another difference is that I. Lewis Libby Jr. is the first high-ranking White House official in many decades to be indicted while still in office. Plenty of top White House staff members from other administrations have been indicted, including H. R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman from the Nixon White House and Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, who was Reagan's national security adviser, but they all resigned long before they were indicted.
 The last sitting White House staff member to be indicted may have been Orville Babcock, Ulysses S. Grant's private secretary, who was charged in 1875 with a group of whiskey distillers in a conspiracy to defraud the government of taxes.
 In 1973, Vice President Spiro T. Agnew resigned as part of a plea bargain on accusations of corruption in which he avoided a felony indictment. And in 1984, Reagan's labor secretary, Raymond J. Donovan, was indicted on a grand larceny charge that involved the construction business he owned before entering the government. Mr. Donovan took an unpaid leave of absence and resigned the next year. Ultimately, he was acquitted.
 Except for Nixon, the two-term presidents in the last 50 years took successful steps to get their presidencies back on track after the scandals broke. 
 In 1958, Eisenhower's seemingly indispensable chief of staff, Sherman Adams, was forced to resign after it was revealed that he had interceded with federal agencies on behalf of a businessman who had given him gifts. With the economy struggling to recover from a recession, Republicans lost 48 seats in the House and 15 in the Senate in the midterm elections. Eisenhower called the year, his sixth in office, the worst of his life.
 But his wartime associate Maj. Gen. Wilton B. Persons, who was named to succeed Mr. Adams, proved to be a competent chief of staff. Eisenhower focused on foreign affairs and took several trips abroad. The Adams scandal was soon old news.
 ''The president was still Ike, and the presidency went on,'' said Stephen Hess, who was a young White House aide in Eisenhower's second term and is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
 In the throes of the Iran-contra scandal, Reagan brought in a new top staff. He made Howard H. Baker Jr., the Senate Republican leader, his chief of staff and A. B. Culvahouse the White House counsel. 
 Mr. Baker demanded resignations of White House staff members and put trusted aides from his Senate staff in charge of operations.
 Mr. Reagan gave a speech taking responsibility for the Iran-contra affair, and his popularity began to rise.
 Then Mr. Reagan turned to foreign policy. He made his famous speech in Berlin demanding that the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev ''tear down this wall,'' and presided over the beginning of the end of the cold war.
 Mr. Clinton also turned to foreign policy after the Senate refused to convict him on impeachment charges. He traveled to China, negotiated a peace accord between Israelis and Palestinians and fought a successful war in Kosovo. 
 ''The president proved that he clearly had the whip hand on foreign policy,'' said John D. Podesta, his last chief of staff.
 In domestic policy, Mr. Clinton was strong enough to beat back Republican tax cuts and other policies advanced by Newt Gingrich, the Republican speaker of the House. 
 In the last 100 years, said Lewis L. Gould, author of ''The Modern American Presidency,'' ''there has not been one good second term.''
 But except for Nixon's, they did not end in disasters either.

HEADLINE: The Comic-Strip Revolution Will Be Televised

BYLINE: By LOLA OGUNNAIKE

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
FANS fearing that ''The Boondocks,'' the wildly scathing, racially charged comic strip, will lose its bite when it appears on television next week need not worry. Within the first 10 seconds of the new show of the same name, viewers will be offered the following Molotov cocktail of social criticism: ''Jesus is black, Ronald Reagan is the devil and the government is lying about 9/11.'' 
 Since its national debut six years ago, the strip, about two black children living in white suburbia, has slaughtered its share of sacred cows, eviscerating everyone from Condoleezza Rice and Strom Thurmond to 50 Cent and Ralph Nader. President Bush has been a frequent target. As a result, the strip has been suspended, banished to editorial pages and dropped from some newspapers (it currently appears in more than 300). 
Trying to translate that incendiary spirit into great television will be a challenge, an expensive challenge at that. Cartoon Network pays Sony Pictures Television, producer of the series, an estimated license fee of $400,000 per episode. Add to that the millions the network has spent on marketing, including many billboards in New York and Los Angeles trumpeting the show's premiere on Nov. 6 in the late-night ''Adult Swim'' block, and ''The Boondocks'' becomes the most expensive show the network has made. 
 ''We don't have a lot of money, so we decided that for this year, we're going to put every dime we have into 'Boondocks,''' said Mike Lazzo, senior vice president of programming and production at Cartoon Network. 
 It remains to be seen if the anime series will become a phenomenon like Dave Chappelle's ''Chappelle's Show'' or sputter and die like ''The PJs,'' Eddie Murphy's animated series about life in the projects. (Both shows satirized African-American culture and the culture at large.) ''I figure it will either be a big hit or a massive flop; there is no room for in between,'' Aaron McGruder, creator of ''The Boondocks,'' said one recent afternoon in the windowless warehouse space that serves as his studio here. ''I work presuming horrendous failure and I do my best to prevent that.'' 
 Like the strip, the series follows the adventures of Huey Freeman, a 10-year-old militant with the soul of a Black Panther, and his baby brother, Riley, a cornrow-sporting potty mouth who idolizes gangsta rappers. The boys live in the suburbs with their stern but loving grandfather. Played by John Witherspoon (best known for his role as a sartorially challenged father in the 1992 romantic comedy ''Boomerang''), Granddad is partial to corporal punishment and exercising in the nude. The actress Regina King (''Jerry Maguire'') gives voice to both Riley and Huey. (The singer Alicia Keys was originally cast as Huey but dropped out citing scheduling conflicts.) Unlike the strip, Mr. McGruder said, the series will not be topical. ''We cannot make a show that's going to be dated,'' he explained. ''It has to survive into syndication and be watchable in 10 years.'' 
 Still, it would not be an Aaron McGruder production if it were not controversial and ''The Boondocks'' is sure to inspire heated conversation. One episode imagines the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. emerging from a coma, only to find that his pacifism doesn't play well in the post-Sept. 11 world. No longer a beloved national hero, he lands on the cover of Time magazine as a traitor. Even worse, a film about him, directed by Oliver Stone and starring Cuba Gooding Jr., tanks. Another episode has a self-loathing black man praying to get into white heaven. In ''Guess Hoe's Coming to Dinner,'' Granddad dates a young gold digger who turns out to be a prostitute. And an episode poking fun at the R&B singer R. Kelly, who is facing child pornography charges, ends with Huey declaring, ''We all know the nigga can sing, but what happened to standards?'' 
 Mr. McGruder is unapologetic about the use of the N-word in his series -- it appears more than 20 times in one episode, even. ''I use it,'' he said. ''A lot of young black people use it and a lot of old black people use it. At a certain point it starts to feel fake if you're not using it.''
 The furor over the word ''speaks to how juvenile racial discourse is in this country,'' Mr. McGruder said.
 Mr. Lazzo said he was not bothered by the provocative content of ''The Boondocks.'' ''I'm 47 and I grew up with 'All in the Family' and I remember that show made people laugh and think and that's what good television does,'' he said. 
 Still, Mr. McGruder is willing to make certain concessions to more delicate sensibilities. When Sony executives asked that he heavily edit an episode that featured Oprah Winfrey being kidnapped by two thugs, he did not protest. ''They were scared of Oprah, which is O.K.,'' he said. ''We should all have a healthy fear of Oprah.'' 
 ''Oprah has the power to lay waste to entire industries with a mere utterance,'' Mr. McGruder said, quoting one his show's characters. ''That's a power that you have to respect. And ultimately I respect it.'' 
 That doesn't mean he's gotten softer, though; he views the very suggestion as a kind of trap. ''The same people that question me about getting soft to get me to say something crazy about Oprah will turn around and be like, 'Look at what this crazy fool just said about Oprah!''' 
 Standing just over 5 feet 7, Mr. McGruder is a slight, handsome man with small features and slim hands. Dressed in jeans, a Stevie Wonder T-shirt and horn-rimmed glasses, the cartoonist could easily pass for a bookish high school sophomore. Unlike his alter ego, Huey, whose face is all furrowed brow and self-righteous scowl, Mr. McGruder is quick to smile. One afternoon this month, he was brimming with opinions. Mr. McGruder on Senator Barack Obama's chances of ever sitting in the Oval Office: ''He's not even going to be able to smell the White House unless he's a member of Skull and Bones or any of those close-knit secret societies that really aren't so secret anymore.'' Regarding the rapper Kanye West's recent remark that Mr. Bush doesn't care about black people: ''If you're black and you don't know that by now, you're in trouble. I think it's time that poor whites start realizing that George Bush doesn't care about them either and he will let them die too.'' 
 Those who work with Mr. McGruder say that his passion for politics is infectious. ''Since meeting Aaron,'' Ms. King said, ''I've started listening to NPR. He inspires you to want to go out and learn more.'' 
 Born on the South Side of Chicago and raised in the middle-class suburb of Columbia, Md., an area that bears more than a passing resemblance to the bucolic Boondocks, Mr. McGruder began drawing as a child. In high school he listened intently to the black nationalist-inspired rhymes of rap groups like Public Enemy, X-Clan and Poor Righteous Teachers. During his years as an African-American studies major at the University of Maryland, Mr. McGruder said, he flirted with the idea of becoming ''a spokesman for the people.'' The life expectancy of that gig, however, proved an insurmountable deterrent. ''Usually if you're doing that job well, you're dead by 34, which is not in my plans,'' he said. 
 Instead, he set out to create a spokesman who could not be assassinated: an adorable, opinionated, elementary school kid with not-so-elementary insights about race, class and culture. The first person to put ''The Boondocks'' in print was a college student named Jayson Blair, who was then editor of The Diamondback, the campus paper at the University of Maryland. Mr. McGruder proudly recalled persuading Mr. Blair to pay him $30 per strip, $17 more than his fellow cartoonists were receiving at the time. Years later, Mr. Blair, hired by this paper and then resigned after fabricating stories, would be lampooned in the strip he help put on the map. ''You can actually look at Jayson Blair and say, 'Wow, you set black people back,''' Mr. McGruder said, shaking his head. ''A lot of people are accused of that, but he actually did it.'' 
 ''The Boondocks'' went national in 1999 and its creator quickly became a personality. Books of his cartoons, like ''Birth of a Nation'' and ''A Right to Be Hostile,'' soon followed. 
 This is not the first time Mr. McGruder has tried to turn his strip into a television show. From the fall of 2003 to the summer of 2004, he worked on a six-minute pilot for Fox. He described the process in a word: ''hellish.'' ''It was an incredibly difficult time for me,'' he said. ''I was worked half to death all the time. I was a zombie. I was mean. I was miserable.'' 
 Mr. McGruder said he had seriously contemplated walking away from his strip. Or getting himself fired: ''I didn't want to quit, but if they threw me out then I'm a martyr,'' he reasoned. As it turned out, however, the angrier and more frustrated he grew, the better his work got. ''Going as far as I can with my own creative instincts has generally only paid off,'' he said with a rueful shrug. 
 When Fox passed on the show, Mr. Lazzo contacted the cartoonist and asked to look at the pilot. ''It felt networky,'' Mr. Lazzo recalled. ''Aaron's voice felt watered down.'' Because cable is less restrictive, he said, ''we were able to say, 'Make the show you want to make, Aaron.''' 
 These days it is not uncommon for Mr. McGruder and his illustrator, Carl Jones, to write a week's worth of comic strips in one day. ''We're juggling so many things,'' Mr. Jones said. ''You have no idea how crazy it can get.'' Already Cartoon Network has asked Mr. McGruder for another season of scripts. When not working on the strip or the series, Mr. McGruder is fiddling with a movie script about black fighter pilots in World War II. 
 Friends and family rarely see him. ''Sometimes he works so hard, he gets sick,'' Ms. King said. ''Like a big sister, I'm always asking Aaron if he's getting any sleep.'' The answer, he said, is not yet. ''I made the decision early on that I was going to work myself to death now, so that I don't have to wait until 65 to enjoy my life,'' Mr. McGruder said. ''I'm trying to live well, and there is no freedom in America if you're economically bound to the system.''

HEADLINE: Your Ads Here (All of Them)

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

DATELINE: Mountain View, Calif. 

 BODY:
IN many ways, Larry Page and Sergey Brin seem an unlikely pair to lead an advertising revolution. As Stanford graduate students sketching out the idea that became Google, the two software engineers sniffed in an academic paper that ''advertising-funded search engines will inherently be biased toward the advertisers and away from the needs of consumers.'' 
 They softened that line a bit by the time they got around to pitching their business to venture capitalists, allowing that selling ads would be a handy safety net if their other, less distasteful ideas for generating revenue didn't pan out.
Google soared in popularity in its first years but had no meaningful revenue until the founders reluctantly fell on that safety net and started selling ads. Even then, they approached advertising with the mind-set of engineers: Ads would look more like fortune cookies than anything Madison Avenue would come up with. 
 As it turned out, the safety net was a trampoline. Those little ads -- 12 word snippets of text, linked to topics that users are actually interested in -- have turned Google into one of the biggest advertising vehicles the world has ever seen. This year, Google will sell $6.1 billion in ads, nearly double what it sold last year, according to Anthony Noto, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. That is more advertising than is sold by any newspaper chain, magazine publisher or television network. By next year, Mr. Noto said, he expects Google to have advertising revenue of $9.5 billion. That would place it fourth among American media companies in total ad sales after Viacom, the News Corporation and the Walt Disney Company, but ahead of giants including NBC Universal and Time Warner.
 Not content to just suck advertising dollars from Web search, Google is using its windfall to pay for an eclectic range of ambitious projects that have the potential to radically disrupt other industries. Among other things, it is offering to build a free wireless Internet network in San Francisco, plans to scan nearly every book published and is testing a free classified advertising system it calls Google Base.
 More quietly, Google is also preparing to disrupt the advertising business itself, by replacing creative salesmanship with cold number-crunching. Its premise so far is that advertising is most effective when seen only by people who are interested in what's for sale, based on what they are searching for or reading about on the Web. Because Google's ad-buying clients pay for ads only when users click on them, they can precisely measure their effectiveness -- and are willing to pay more for ads that really sell their products.
 HIDDEN behind its simple white pages, Google has already created what it says is one of the most sophisticated artificial intelligence systems ever built. In a fraction of a second, it can evaluate millions of variables about its users and advertisers, correlate them with its potential database of billions of ads and deliver the message to which each user is most likely to respond.
 Because of this technology, users click ads 50 percent to 100 percent more often on Google than they do on Yahoo, Mr. Noto estimates, and that is a powerful driver of Google's growth and profits. ''Because the ads are more relevant,'' he said, ''they create a better return for advertisers, which causes them to spend more money, which gives Google better margins.'' (Yahoo is working on its own technology to narrow that gap.)
 Google already sells its text ads for many other sites on the Internet (including nytimes.com), and is also moving tentatively to sell the picture-based interactive advertising preferred by marketers who want to promote brands rather than immediately sell products. Now it is preparing to extend its technology to nearly every other medium, most significantly television. It is looking toward a world of digital cable boxes and Internet-delivered television that will allow it to show commercials tailored for each viewer, as it does now for each Web page it displays.
 Eric E. Schmidt, Google's chief executive, explains the company's astounding success in advertising -- and reconciles it with the founders' distrust of hucksterism -- by suggesting that advertising should be interesting, relevant and useful to users. ''Improving ad quality improves Google's revenue,'' he said in an interview at the company's headquarters, known as the Googleplex. ''If we target the right ad to the right person at the right time and they click it, we win.''
 This proposition, he continued, is applicable to other media. ''If we can figure out a way to improve the quality of ads on television with ads that have real value for end-users, we should do it,'' he said. While he is watching television, for example, ''Why do I see women's clothing ads?'' he said. ''Why don't I see just men's clothing ads?''
 The media and advertising industries certainly see a future in which television ads are aimed at individual viewers. But few outside of the engineering Ph.D.'s at Google think that television ads should simply be utilitarian, rather than entertaining, provocative or annoyingly repetitive -- the models that have worked so far. And some media industry executives wonder whether Google, which has already become the most powerful force in Internet advertising, should also become the clearinghouse for ads of all types -- a kind of advertising Nasdaq. 
 ''For all of us to throw all our eggs in the Google basket is dangerous, because no one should have that much power,'' said Jeff Jarvis, a veteran magazine editor who publishes BuzzMachine, a blog about the media, and is a consultant for About.com, a division of The New York Times Company. He added that if Google were to expand its ad sales to other media outlets, prices would fall. ''Google commoditizes everything,'' he said.
 There is no better example of that than Google Base, a service that allows users to post all sorts of information free, including classified ads, he said. Newspapers, which increasingly use Google to sell ads on their own Web pages, will see Google Base as a ''frontal assault'' on their lucrative classified-ad business, and they will say, ''I can't trust Google,'' Mr. Jarvis said.
 Mr. Brin said that preliminary versions of Google Base leaked onto the Internet and that the company's partners should not fear it. ''Google Base is as much about classified as it is about zoology,'' he said.
 Larry Page and Sergey Brin were exceedingly ambitious from the day they started Google, but the job of finding some source of revenue fell to Omid Kordestani, an amiable former Netscape sales executive who was brought to the company in 1999 by K. Ram Shriram, another Netscape alumnus and an early Google investor. Mr. Kordestani explored a range of ideas, including charging users for searches as well as selling Google's technology to corporations or to other Web sites -- notably Yahoo -- that were less shy about selling ads.
 Eventually, in 2000, Google started to sell ads on its own site, but they were only a few lines of text placed above the search results. There were no graphics and no banners. At first, these ads -- and later, a second form of text advertisement that ran down the right side of the page -- were sold at fixed prices. But such an approach would not last long.
 In early 2002, a Google employee, Salar Kamangar, now 28, convinced Mr. Schmidt and the founders to switch to an auction-based system like the one set up by Bill Gross, the head of IdeaLab. Mr. Gross had created Goto.com, a search engine made up entirely of ads, where advertisers paid only if their ad was clicked on, and the advertiser who bid the most per click was listed first. (Goto was later renamed Overture Services and then bought by Yahoo, an early Google backer that has become its fiercest rival.)
 Mr. Kamangar, though, had an important improvement on the model. Rather than giving priority to the advertisers that bid the most per click, as Goto did, he realized that it was better to save the front of the line for ads that brought in the most money -- a combination of the bid and the number of clicks on the ad. This was not only more profitable, but it also linked readers to ads that were more relevant to them. He also figured out that the system should use what is called a Vickrey auction -- that is, to charge the winner only one cent more than the second-highest bidder. That gives advertisers an incentive to bid high, knowing that they will not be penalized if they are far higher than the rest of the market.
 Mr. Page and Mr. Brin were suspicious of any system that put high-bidding advertisers at the top, Mr. Kamangar said. ''They thought if someone was willing to pay more it was a negative,'' he recalled. But he was able to convince them that the site could be improved by incorporating how often users clicked on an ad.
 Mr. Schmidt, who was still new as chief executive, was worried more that moving to an entirely auction-based system -- amid a recession in online advertising -- could be financially disastrous. ''I said to Salar, 'Promise me the revenue won't go down,' '' Mr. Schmidt said. ''I was afraid people would realize these ads were worthless.'' In fact, revenue quickly increased tenfold.
 As Google's audience took off, advertisers came running -- many thousands of smaller ones at first, but soon large companies as well. Among Google's largest advertisers is eBay, which has long bought keywords for nearly every sort of merchandise it sells.
 ''The smartest thing that Google did was getting smaller advertisers to buy in,'' said Ellen Siminoff, the chief executive of Efficient Frontier, an agency that helps advertisers manage their campaigns on search engines. She estimates that Google has two to three times as many advertisers as Yahoo does, largely because Yahoo has a 10-cent minimum bid. This lets Google earn money on more obscure search terms for which rivals have no ads.
 This growing advertising business gave Google the confidence to expand its audience. Most significantly, in 2002, America Online brought in Google to replace Overture, which provided both search and search ads; that deal enshrined Google as the premier search engine and ad network. Google won the deal by guaranteeing AOL a substantial sum, which it would not disclose. Google was willing to make that bid only because of its confidence in its advertising sales prowess. ''If we were wrong,'' Mr. Kordestani said, ''there were some scenarios that would bankrupt the company.''
 But by that point, Google had figured out that the same sort of computing and engineering skill that it used to find Web pages could also be used to improve the quality and, ultimately, the profitability of advertising. ''Initially, we didn't understand how fundamental the computer science was in advertising,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''We didn't have enough staffing or focus on this area. I managed to fix that.''
 GOOGLE introduced its current system for determining which ad to show on which page late last year. It is a wonder of technology that rivals its search engine in complexity. For every page that Google shows, more than 100 computers evaluate more than a million variables to choose the advertisements in its database to display -- and they do it in milliseconds. The computers look at the amount bid and the budget of the advertiser, but they also consider the user -- such as his or her location, which they try to infer by analyzing the user's Internet connections -- as well as the time of day and myriad other factors Google has tracked and analyzed from its experience with advertisements.
 ''If someone is coming from a particular location, a certain ad may be more popular there,'' explained Jeff Huber, Google's vice president for engineering. ''The system can use all the signals available, and the system itself learns the correlations between them.''
 This technology is both amazing and potentially frightening. Google already collects and keeps vast amount of data about what Web pages and advertisements each of its users click on, and it can evaluate that history -- and compare it with that of hundreds of millions of other users -- to select the ad shown on each page. For now, Google says it identifies users only by a number in a cookie it places on each computer that uses Google. It says it has not connected the vast dossier of interests and behavior to specific users by name. But that could change as Google offers more personal services -- like e-mail messages and social networking -- and works more tightly with partners who already have such personal information.
 Lauren Weinstein, the founder of the Privacy Forum, said the data that Google collects creates troubling privacy issues, especially because it declines to say what data it keeps or for how long. ''If you start to target people based on a corpus of data, it can be abused in various ways internally and externally by organizations and government agencies,'' he said. Government investigators and lawyers in civil suits regularly get court orders to force Internet companies to reveal e-mail messages and other personal information about users.
 Google recently rewrote its privacy policy to make it easier to understand what data it collects, but it did not scale back its data retention. Nor did it, as Mr. Weinstein and others have demanded, give users the right to see the data collected about them and their computers.
 For now, the only personal information Google says it considers is the user's location, which allows it to display ads for local merchants. It is starting to encourage other Web sites to send it the ZIP codes of their registered users so Google can display ads relevant to their location.
 Mr. Brin said he was not sure what other information about users might prove useful, but he said Google would not use the data inappropriately. ''I don't think it's a big deal to show opera glasses to someone searching for binoculars that you somehow infer is a woman,'' he said. ''But you don't want to pop up ads for H.I.V. drugs on someone's page, because you inferred they have H.I.V., when their boss is standing there looking at their computer.''
 To be sure, other Web sites are far more aggressive in using personal information. Yahoo will let marketers display ads to users based on demographic information the users provide as well as the users' surfing and searching history. Microsoft's new system for MSN explicitly allows advertisers to bid different prices for clicks from users of different ages, sexes and locations.
 In addition to selling ads on its own site and on other sites that use its search technology, Google also places text ads on all manner of sites published both by professional media companies and by amateurs. Mr. Brin created this program in early 2003 after he became worried that the Internet crash would keep people from creating interesting Web pages for Google to index. This technology, called AdSense for Content, has made advertising on Google more attractive and provided the economic foundation for the rise of blogs.
 ''God bless Google,'' said Mr. Jarvis, the BuzzMachine blogger. ''They took the cooties off citizen media.'' Until Google's program came along, advertisers shied away from placing ads on individual user's pages. But AdSense analyzed each page and tried -- not always successfully -- to find ads related to the page's content.
 Now Google is looking to expand its advertising into even more places. It is testing a plan to buy pages in magazines on which to place text ads. And it also shows ads as users browse its new book search service. ''A lot of the world's content is not accessible today and thus it is not easily monetizable today,'' Mr. Kordestani said. ''We will figure out how to get more and more content and find the right way to put ads on it.''
 Advertisers, meanwhile, have had to scramble to adapt to this completely different approach to buying ads. They needed to find ways to keep track of bids on thousands of keywords, and to measure which ads, tied to which keywords, produced which sales -- and then to figure out if they had bid the right amount for the ad.
 Many advertisers and their agencies have a powerful love-hate relationship with Google. They find it a meaningful source of leads and sales, and the effectiveness of Google's ads is much easier to measure than that of traditional media. But Google has sometimes been hard to deal with. There is a growing sense that a significant number of clicks that advertisers pay for are fraudulent -- made by competitors trying to deplete advertising budgets or by Web sites trying to bolster the revenue they get for displaying the ads. Google says it has technology to minimize what is called click fraud, but many people in the Internet business are skeptical that the incidence of fraud is as low as Google contends. 
 Here, as in other places, many advertisers criticize Google for being like a black box, because the company gives them less specific information and control than they would like. Until recently, for example, advertisers could not specify where their ads ran, though they were convinced that some Web sites in Google's network were much more likely than others to send them customers. Google responded with what it calls ''smart pricing'' technology that discounts certain ads if Google's analysis shows that they are seen on sites it determines are less likely to produce paying customers. But Google discloses little about how this works, and advertisers find it frustrating.
 ''Google is very opaque and bizarre to deal with,'' said Joshua Stylman, a managing partner at Reprise Media, a search advertising agency, but he added that Google had become somewhat more responsive in recent months.
 Mr. Schmidt addresses those complaints by saying that advertisers are missing the point of Google's new model. It shouldn't matter what Google does with their ads, he argues, so long as the received value, which advertisers can measure, is higher than the price they pay. The entire discipline of media planning, which has long been important on Madison Avenue, may be rendered obsolete -- just as Google's fully automated news Web site threatens the livelihoods of human news editors.
 In any case, there is little doubt that Mr. Schmidt believes that science will replace much of the art of marketing. ''I have this fantasy that goes like this,'' he said at one point. ''You are the C.E.O. of a large company, and I come to you and say, 'Give me $1 million and give me your Web site, and we will guarantee you will get $100 million in sales.' Which C.E.O. would turn that down?''
 Google isn't quite pursuing that sort of deal, but it is trying to have big retailers link their inventory systems directly to its advertising auction. That way, a toy store chain, for example, could respond to a search for dolls with an ad for either Barbies or Bratz, depending on which were overstocked in the store near the user's home. ''Most retailers only advertise 5 percent of their products,'' said Tim Armstrong, Google's vice president for ad sales. ''We can let them advertise all of them.'' 
 ON the other end of the spectrum, Google is also trying to focus on what the Internet market calls branding advertising -- the sort that dominates television and magazines and creates awareness of a product, but doesn't directly call on viewers to buy right away. Yahoo, AOL and MSN have all evolved the simple rectangular banner ad into much more elaborate units with animation, interactivity and sometimes video formats that have been embraced by national advertisers.
 Google has been able to convince some companies that its text ads can help build awareness of their products, even if people don't click on them to buy something. But top executives are also meeting weekly to develop a broader strategy for branding advertisements. Google has already allowed its so-called publisher network -- those non-Google sites for which it sells ads -- to accept advertising with limited graphics. At first, these were simple images, perhaps with a little animation. It is now moving to accept ads that use the popular Flash technology that allows for more interactivity. So far, these nontext ads have been only a tiny part of Google's business.
 Indeed, such ads shine a spotlight on the mental compromise that Mr. Brin and Mr. Page made when they overcame their initial objections to advertising on their service. Text ads, they argued, were not the normal fluff of Madison Avenue, but actual information that was useful to searchers. 
 ''Advertising was not a business built by logic, and we don't work by algorithm,'' said Wenda Harris Millard, Yahoo's chief sales officer. ''Yes, we need to be more accountable, but that doesn't mean you sacrifice art and creativity.''
 Mr. Schmidt acknowledges that as Google explores moving into television, it may well face a conflict between its core belief that advertising must be useful and the typical television commercial that is ''based on feeling and emotion.''
 ''Our model is likely to affect television last,'' he said, while expressing optimism that a formula for useful, targeted commercials could be found. For now, he quickly added, the market for various forms of direct marketing is three times larger than that for television ads. ''I was shocked by this,'' he said. ''All of us are so conditioned to television as the height of advertising.
 ''We are in the really boring part of the business,'' Mr. Schmidt concluded, ''the boring big business.''

HEADLINE: Newspaper Ad Circulars Find Their Way Online

BYLINE: By BobTedeschi

 BODY:
YOU could argue that reading a newspaper online is much like reading one offline, but one thing is unmistakably missing from the Web: when you log on, an advertising circular does not fall into your lap.
 Until now, that is. Gannett, one of the nation's biggest newspaper publishers, said it would introduce a new service on its newspaper Web sites next month that displays banner ads that readers can expand into a virtual version of the weekly local circulars so familiar to offline newspaper readers.
Industry executives said the service, called PaperBoy, devised by a unit of Gannett called PointRoll, would give national advertisers a way to reach online readers in local markets with promotions tied to neighborhood stores. 
 Newspapers are trying to protecting their turf from Google, Yahoo and other Internet companies that have moved more aggressively to serve local information and ads to readers. ''Newspapers are still in a relatively strong position if they can act, but the local initiatives by the search engines are a threat," said Greg Sterling, an analyst with the Kelsey Group, an advertising consultant. ''Everybody understands what's at stake and even the strategy. It's just a question of execution.''
 For readers, PaperBoy would look like this: When a visitor to, for example, the Web site of The Journal News, Gannett's newspaper in Westchester County, N.Y., clicks open the day's news, they will be presented with an ad at the top of the page that looks like a typical message from, say, Home Depot.
 Unlike the typical static rectangular box, though, the Home Depot ad will invite readers to ''roll over'' it with the mouse. When reader does so, the ad will expand on the screen and become a miniature, animated version of a newspaper circular. Dog-eared pages flip when the user moves a cursor over them, showing special sale prices on items at the local Home Depot. A reader can check prices or products at another Home Depot by entering another ZIP code.
 ''We've been talking for a long time about how consumers -- especially younger ones -- don't read newspapers anymore, and how they get their news online,'' said Shar VanBoskirk, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''This gives newspapers a way to offer compelling local content online that'll keep readers engaged, and it's also pretty compelling local value for advertisers.''
 PointRoll, which specializes in online advertising, offered the Home Depot example for demonstration purposes only. It would not identify marketers that had signed up for the service; Home Depot declined to comment. But Christopher Saridakis, PointRoll's chief executive, said the company had signed 20 percent of the nation's top 50 advertisers. ''And we've been selling it for just about a month now. It's pretty intense,'' he said.
 Mr. Saridakis said he expected to be able to charge a significant premium over current rates for the ads -- between $3 and $4 more for every one thousand ads shown -- but would charge newspapers a premium of closer to $2 in the early stages to deliver the ads on behalf of advertisers. Publishers, he said, often build these charges into their advertising fees.
 Such revenue is critical to newspapers as they vie for pieces of a fast-growing market. According to Jupiter Research, another consultant on online advertising, the local online advertising market will grow by 26 percent this year, to $3.2 billion.
 PointRoll was bought by Gannett earlier this year for roughly $100 million, a price that raised many eyebrows in the online community, because PointRoll's main business was helping marketers create advertisements with motion and sound. Gannett has lined up newspapers within its group, as well as its recent teammates in the online realm, Knight Ridder and the Tribune Company, to distribute the Internet circulars on each of the Web sites of the triumvirate's 245 online newspaper sites, as well as sections of Yahoo. 
 Mr. Saridakis, who previously developed the technology that helped bring DoubleClick, the online advertising company, to online marketing pre-eminence, is relying this time on other technologists to help bring a service to market. Specifically, PointRoll is piggybacking on a system created by ShopLocal, of Chicago, a company jointly owned by Gannett, Knight Ridder and Tribune. ShopLocal creates digital versions of offline advertising circulars for companies like Target, Circuit City and others, and helps post those circulars on the companies' Web sites.
 PointRoll compresses those circulars -- they are also known in industry parlance as preprints or free-standing inserts -- and adds more motion and interactive elements. Because the company has relationships with online advertisers and publishers, it should have an easier time selling the service than typical start-ups would.
 But according to Paul Gunning, vice president of Tribal DDB, the online unit of the advertising agency DDB, PointRoll also has good timing on its side. ''I don't know what tipped it over, but just this summer we had three or four of our major retail clients ask us about how to move the preprint process at least partially online,'' he said. 
 ''These things have been one of their primary marketing tactics for decades, and the dollar amounts they invest in them are staggering, like hundreds of millions of dollars every year,'' Mr. Gunning said. ''It's not like they're saying it's a broken model now, but they see that times are changing and newspaper circulation is coming down, and younger people aren't even getting the paper anymore.''
 Mr. Gunning said the companies would probably start testing PaperBoy in January, when money from new budgets begins flowing and the holiday ad campaigns have ended. Newspapers need not worry that PaperBoy is taking revenue from offline advertising and putting it online at a discount. For one thing, many newspapers do not sell or print advertising circulars independently. Rather, they often rely on others to broker deals or print the circulars.
 According to John A. Williams, a senior vice president at Gannett, the online circulars will do something that the paper ones cannot. ''With preprints, not everybody that gets them actually goes through them. With these, you've got an ad that's more interruptive for people looking at the sites, so you know you're reaching them and telling them what's for sale.''

HEADLINE: Economic Ties Binding Japan To Rival China

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH and NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
At a call center in Dalian, in northeast China, young workers speaking flawless Japanese answer customer service calls for a Japanese insurance company. In western Japan, a new commercial Chinatown is rising in Kobe City's rebuilt port area.
 Rather than the gaudy restaurants of the old Chinatown, the new one contains nondescript office buildings leased to Chinese companies focusing on everything from biotechnology to that most traditional form of Japanese attire, the kimono.
 At a time of rising political tensions, heightened by a growing nationalism, China and Japan are more intertwined economically than they have ever been. In their breadth and intensity, the ties have begun to surpass those between the United States and Japan, whose economic relationship has often been called the most important in the world.
 The ties offer a counterpoint to rapidly deteriorating diplomatic relations, which reached another low point on Oct. 17 when Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan visited the Yasukuni Shrine, the nationalist memorial to Japan's war dead, and China immediately called off high-level talks. 
 Tensions will probably keep rising with Asia's transformation: China, which had lost its historical role as the region's economic and political leader to Japan in the last century and a half, is hungry to reclaim it.
 ''In the last few years, things have grown black and white between us,'' said Toshio Hori, general manager of the Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank branch in Shanghai, China's biggest city and an increasingly vital commercial artery to Japan. ''On the political and diplomatic side, things are pessimistic, but on the economic side, the relationship is growing stronger and stronger.'' 
 The possibility that ill will could lead to conflict is lessened by the reality that both countries would have a lot to lose:
 Sharply increased trade with China has lifted the Japanese economy out of a lost decade of feeble growth and recurring recession, while cheap imports from China have driven costs down significantly for Japan's long-suffering consumers.
 More than 150,000 Chinese students attend Japanese universities and language schools, and a million Chinese people work in Japanese companies.
 Shanghai, officially home to 20,000 Japanese, may actually house as many as 100,000, which would make it the largest overseas Japanese community.
 Japanese investment totaling $31.5 billion is enabling China to learn the formidable industrial skills of its neighbor.
 China's ascension has been so fast that Japan must now contemplate a true rivalry, with the Chinese economy not only outstripping Japan's in size, but perhaps matching it in sophistication before long.
 The uncertain new relationship between the countries, one rich in promise and in lingering suspicions, is on full view today in this city.
 Sixty-three years after Japanese troops stormed ashore, Shanghai is dotted with neighborhoods of Japanese residents. Japanese-language magazines cater to the wealthy Asian expatriates with everything from restaurant reviews to sex club listings, and the membership directory of the Japanese chamber of commerce reads like a who's who of the Japanese corporate world.
 The comfortable veneer of life overseas was suddenly stripped away in April, however, when a large protest march against visits by Mr. Koizumi to the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japanese forces responsible for atrocities throughout Asia, degenerated into a riot. Crowds pelted the Japanese Consulate with stones.
 Mr. Koizumi's landslide victory in the general elections in September suggests that the official relationship between China and Japan will remain rocky. However, a breakthrough could occur after Mr. Koizumi retires next year.
 Mr. Hori of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank, who is also chairman of the Japanese chamber of commerce in Shanghai, said his worst fear was another protest, perhaps even nationwide. Still, he added, ''it is meaningless to think Japanese companies would withdraw and go somewhere else, like Vietnam.''
 ''The relationship is too big for that already,'' he said.
 Among students at the Dalian University of Technology, many of whom will be vying for jobs at Japanese companies, there is a strong sense of pragmatism. ''History problems are history problems, but I think you have to be realistic,'' said Zhang Shuai, a 22-year-old engineering student. 
 Here and there, the same kind of pragmatism can be found in Japan, in sharp contrast to the anxious, sometimes hysterical public discussion of a rising China. Like the rest of the heavily industrialized Kansai region of Japan, Kobe, the port city that was devastated by an earthquake 10 years ago, has been economically depressed for years.
 Sensing opportunity in China's rise, the city government has invested heavily in attracting Chinese businesses and promoting trade with China, especially the Shanghai region.
 One businessman, Chen Jianjun, 43, is the founder of a biotechnology consulting firm, Shanghai Rundo Biotech Japan, in Kobe. After completing a graduate degree in Japan, Mr. Chen worked at Nestle before going out on his own. Now he advises Japanese pharmaceutical companies on conducting clinical trials and marketing in China, giving him a broad perspective on the countries' problems. ''China and Japan are close to each other but have a distant relationship,'' he said. ''Each does not understand the other well.''
 That plaint is echoed by businesspeople from each country, pragmatists who basically want to make money. In Japan, business tends to support Mr. Koizumi for leading domestic economic change, but cringes at his government's antagonistic policy toward China. Businesspeople fear that after Mr. Koizumi retires next year, an even more nationalistic leader may replace him.
 The gap in understanding extends to schools and universities. Even though more Chinese students are choosing Japanese universities over American ones, they are often surprised that their Asian neighbors are in many ways more foreign than the Americans.
 ''I think Chinese people understand American people better,'' said Gao Ruihong, 35, a Chinese student at Kobe University. ''People hold parties at home and invite their friends and neighbors in China or the United States. I came to Japan nine years ago, but I have seldom been invited to friends' homes.''
 But like most of her classmates, Ms. Gao was optimistic. ''The relationship between Japan and China will become closer in the future,'' she said, ''and I'd like to act as a bridge between the two countries.''
 For many in Shanghai's large Japanese community, the best way to build a better future between the countries appears to be in taking advantage of huge opportunities for prosperity today. 
 ''We don't know what will happen to this market in the future, but we know that our development will depend on what happens here to a large extent,'' said Satoshi Tachikake, director of operations for Mazda in Shanghai. Japanese car companies arrived late in China compared with their European and American rivals, but today no one is investing more heavily in China than Japan.
 Shanghai's official Japanese school has 2,214 students, a tenfold increase from a decade ago, and is expanding faster than ever. ''We have zero space now,'' said the principal of the school, Kazuyuki Taichi, smiling as he displayed the model of a new school that is near completion.
 Mr. Taichi, who came to Shanghai just before the April protests, expressed surprise at what he found on arriving in China. ''I expected to see another transition from Communism,'' he said, not a booming city as big as Tokyo. ''It's difficult to make Japanese, even your own brothers and sisters, understand that Japan's development depends on China and China's development depends on Japan. They are under the influence of the media back home, which is always blasting away at China.''
 Eriko Yamamoto, 26, believes that Japan can reinvigorate itself by building closer ties to China. After quitting her full-time job with Hitachi in Tokyo, she came to Shanghai recently to study at the China Europe International Business School.
 ''Initially I thought I should go to China and try things out, and if things didn't work here I could always go home,'' Ms. Yamamoto said. ''But here I discovered if you have a bit of money you can do just about anything. In Japan, you don't have that feeling. There is a sense of so many rules.''

HEADLINE: Commerce Sends South Korea Across DMZ 

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: GAMHO, North Korea 

 BODY:
On a grassy plain just north of the demilitarized zone, a brigade of men in olive green labored recently, erecting a steel structure the size of an airport terminal. Next summer, officials at this North Korean immigration building are to be stamping passports for South Korean tourists at the rate of 1,500 day.
 These tourist battalions are to roll north across the demilitarized zone on a new road and a new railroad, both built by South Korea. Motorcades of buses already travel the road. Test trains are to start this fall. 
The Korean peninsula's two opposing armies still watch each other across the 154-mile armistice line set in 1953, and routinely described as ''the most heavily guarded border in the world.'' But if borders are harbingers of changing international relations, the traffic surging through two holes in the demilitarized zone indicates that South Korea is reaching out to North Korea as never before.
 Behind some of this new push is fear in South Korea that North Korea could become an economic colony of China, North Korea's largest trading partner. While South Korea is paying for rebuilding parts of North Korea's railroads, a Chinese rail consortium has won access to the North's entire rail network. 
 Three years ago, it took weeks of paperwork to cross. Now, at two road crossings completed last year, one here on the east coast and one in Kaesong on the west coast, 1,000 South Koreans a day cross the border as a trickle has become in recent months a healthy flow of buses, trucks and private cars. North Korea allows only a select few of its citizens to visit the South.
 South Korea's fast-growing exposure to North Korea is pushing some South Koreans toward opposition to American confrontation with North Korea. However, many Americans praise the new relaxed atmosphere. [On Oct. 24, citing reducing security risks, Fitch Ratings raised South Korea's long-term foreign currency rating by one notch.]
 ''Yesterday, I had butterflies in my stomach; I was a little scared,'' Kim Sun Ja, 53, a Seoul homemaker, said the day after she crossed with a tour group to Mount Kumgang, the resort area 15 miles north of the border that opened to South Korean tourists in November 1998. ''But today, I feel like I am in South Korea.''
 The corner of North Korea north of this port of entry is already well on the way to becoming a South Korean tourist playground. The giant Hyundai conglomerate's inter-Korean business division, Hyundai Asan Corporation, is building golf courses, hotels, restaurants and a family reunion center, which will be able to accommodate half a million tourists a year.
 ''North Korea is new to capitalism, but by working together we will improve their economy,'' Byun Ha Jung, a Hyundai senior manager, said in this stretch of the 767-square-mile Mount Kumgang special tourism zone, a long sliver of beach and mountains, which starts just north of the demilitarized zone.
 In Kaesong, Hyundai is building the first phase of a planned 25-square-mile industrial park that will sprawl to within view of the demilitarized zone. With labor costs in South Korea rising, it has turned to China for cheap labor. After investing billions in China, some South Korean companies are looking north to a Korean-speaking labor force willing to work for some of the lowest wages in Northeast Asia.
 ''Why go to China when you can go to North Korea?'' asked Alan Timblick, a Briton who directs Invest Korea, a South Korean government investment promotion agency. ''The only way we can solve this North-South issue is by allowing the North to get on with their economic reforms.''
 One year after the first section of the Kaesong industrial park opened, 4,100 North Koreans now work for 15 South Korean companies. This fall, 25 more South Korean companies are building factories in the park, and 700 more are on a waiting list. Electricity comes from South Korea. Direct dial telephone service is being installed to link Kaesong with South Korea. Daily shuttle buses cross the demilitarized zone, carrying South Koreans between Seoul and Kaesong.
 Hyundai says the growth is continuing. By 2020, it hopes, Kaesong will have 600,000 North Koreans working for 2,000 South Korean companies, producing $16 billion worth of goods a year. President Roh Moo Hyun said 3,000 South Koreans now work in North Korea.
 Hyundai also hopes to make Kaesong, a day trip for Seoul's 10 million residents, a tourism draw. Kaesong, the capital of the Koryo Dynasty from 918 to 1392, survived the Korean War with much of its historic architecture intact. ''Look at the line of trucks from the North,'' said Gov. Sohn Hak Kyu of Kyonggi, the western province between Seoul and the demilitarized zone. Through a cleft in the fortified hills, South Korean trucks were delivering loads of construction sand. Heading north were busloads of engineers and foremen to run South Korean-owned factories in the Kaesong Industrial Park, seven miles north of the demilitarized zone.
 With cross-border traffic growing fast, workers are hurrying to complete by December a customs and immigration center on the South Korean side. Mr. Sohn is a conservative with presidential ambitions. His support for this piercing of the demilitarized zone is an indication that Seoul's northern policy has bipartisan backing. In November, a North-South economic cooperation office is to open in Kaesong. It will be the first time since the Korean War that South Korean government officials will work full time in the North. This year, trade and aid across the border are expected to hit $1 billion, six times the level of 2000. The easing of tensions has even reached Panmunjom, the third demilitarized zone crossing.

DEAR DIARY:
 A few years ago, my wife, Sandra, and I went to the Tilles Center on Long Island for a concert. A severe thunderstorm was raging outside.
 As I stood in the lobby waiting for my wife to return from the ladies' room, there was a sudden blackout in the building.
We all remained virtually motionless in the dimness of the few emergency lights. A few seconds later, a woman's voice came through loud and clear from the ladies' room: 
 ''Irving, don't check the coats!'' Noel Frank

Dear Diary:
 Recently, on the No. 5 express train, I sat next to a man who was having a rambling one-sided conversation with the woman sitting next to him. 
 It was obvious that the woman was politely humoring the man, who covered such topics as the Sharon Tate murder, Dionne Warwick's albums, Hurricane Katrina and the $5,000 worth of fertilizer he had bought for his grandmother after he was released from the V.A. hospital. 
 When he mentioned that he was getting off at 14th Street, the woman broke her silence and informed him that he had just missed his stop. 
 The man replied, ''That's O.K., this was an important conversation.''
 With that, the two said goodbye and the man got off at City Hall to begin his journey back uptown. Bret Eagan

Dear Diary:
 As newcomers to Manhattan, my husband, Jim, and I enjoy overheard conversations. Here's one that stood out:
 In the Petco at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue, a young boy said to his mother, ''But we could have a dog if we got a country house.''
 I was glad I was buying fish for my son. Malinda Allison

Dear Diary:
 The evening after Kylie, my 5-year-old daughter, lost her first tooth I found myself scrounging through my dresser for an envelope or a little box, or something suitable to hold the crisp $5 bill the tooth fairy would be depositing under her pillow. (Yes, this is another early indicator of inflation.) 
 I found an old ring pouch from Tiffany. It was soft, in trademark blue, and had a delightful little purse-string on it. 
 I did the tooth fairy's bidding, went to sleep, then woke up early and went to the office before I saw Kylie. Our phone conversation later in the day:
 Kylie: ''The tooth fairy came!''
 Me: ''What did she bring?''
 Kylie: ''She gave me $5.''
 Me: ''Oh wow, that's great.''
 Kylie: ''Oh, and it came in a little blue bag. And it had 'tooth fairy' written on it.'' Ed Wise
 Janet Berardi recently saw this in the window of a shop selling women's handbags on Sixth Avenue in Manhattan:
 Authentic

 Kelly & Birkin Bags

Dear Diary:
 ''Mama,'' 4-year-old Gregory said in a soft, lonely voice as we drove away from morning preschool, ''can we set up a play date with Nicole? Please?''
 ''Sure, honey, someday,'' I said. ''But I don't know who Nicole is. What does she look like?''
 ''She's got spots on her smock,'' he said slowly, ''and her hand was orange today. You could probably find her on eBay.'' Julie Walton Shaver

Dear Diary:
 My friends Jen and Babi Floyd have a house in Western Connecticut that they are selling. Interested buyers have been trooping in and out for two weeks. Their little boy, Davison, 5 years old, is just barely tolerating the parade.
 To make matters worse for Davison, his two favorite goldfish died within days of each other last week, due to an algae buildup in the tank. His parents were advised to buy a suckerfish, which acts as a kind of aquatic vacuum cleaner, ridding the tank walls of the offending algae.
 Alas, this past weekend he, too, passed away.
 Davison wanted a proper burial -- no toilet flushing for the suckerfish -- so he dug a little grave on a patch of lawn right next to the front door. He asked if he could make a gravestone and his mother said yes, of course.
 The next day, Babi went out for the paper and there, on the little grave, was the epitaph written in bold white paint, clearly visible to anyone exiting the house:
 ''Goodbye, Sucker.'' Lucy Nathanson

HEADLINE: Ballot Measure Calls for a Power Shift to Overhaul a Budget Process

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
Few disagree that New York State's budget process is a bit sick. Until the streak was broken this year, the budget was late for 20 years in a row. Spending outpaces inflation, fiscal gimmicks are all too frequently used to plug gaps, and New York is one of the most highly taxed and indebted states in the nation. 
 In November, a proposal will be on the ballot that would give voters in New York State the chance to overhaul the budget process in what would be the biggest change to the State Constitution in more than a generation. But there is no consensus that the measure would actually make things better.
While supporters say it will lead to responsible, on-time budgets, the measure's opponents say that the proposed cure is worse than the disease and that it would virtually guarantee later, more expensive budgets. 
 So far the battle over the proposal has been mostly invisible, except to the wonkiest New Yorkers. But it is heating up. The civic circuit is abuzz with debates. Television commercials in favor of the amendment, paid for in part by labor unions, are going on the air. And an 800-pound pig sculpture is being hauled on a trailer across the state by a group that believes the measure would lead to more pork-barrel spending.
 The ballot measure is supported by the State Legislature, which drafted it; several civic groups; and labor unions that argue that the status quo has not worked. It is opposed by several fiscal watchdog groups; virtually all newspaper editorial pages in the state; and by governors present, past and potential, including Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, and Mario M. Cuomo, Hugh L. Carey and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, all Democrats. They say it would lead to more spending and weaken the governor's powers. 
 The proposal would do several things, like moving the start of the fiscal year to May from April, creating an independent budget office, and budgeting school aid two years at a time. But the crux of the debate -- and the reason it has engendered such passions -- centers on how the proposal would shift power away from the governor and toward the Legislature. 
 Ever since 1927, when Gov. Al Smith persuaded New York voters to approve what became the state's executive budget process, New York governors have had the upper hand when it comes to drawing up spending plans. The governor proposes the budget, and the Legislature mostly works off his script, making changes where it can. 
 But the budget amendment that will be on the ballot on Nov. 8 would change that equation. It contains a provision that would allow a contingency budget, based on the previous year's spending plan, to take effect the moment a budget is late. Then the Legislature would have the power to pass its own spending bills to replace the contingency budget -- effectively allowing it to bypass the governor's proposal.
 Supporters say that the contingency budget will keep things running smoothly, while avoiding the distracting battles over the short-lived emergency bills that have been used in recent years to keep the government running when the budget was late. And they say that because the contingency budget would be based on the previous year's spending plan, meaning it would not increase spending, all sides would have an incentive to pass the budget on time in order to avoid it.
 But opponents of the measure say that the contingency budget would give the Legislature the power to undo more than 75 years of executive budgeting in the state. Once the contingency budget took effect, they note, the governor's proposal would be declared dead, and the Legislature would be able to pass what would essentially be its own spending plan. Its incentive to avoid the contingency budget, critics say, would be about as strong as Br'er Rabbit's incentive to keep from being thrown into the briar patch.
 And since individual lawmakers -- who are elected to bring home bacon for their districts -- almost always try to increase spending over the proposals of the governor, who must worry about trying to balance the budget, opponents are warning that an amendment giving power to the Legislature could prove very expensive. The Business Council of New York State has called it the ''runaway spending amendment.''
 Supporters of the amendment say the governor would still be able to veto additional spending that he disapproves of. ''If these dire consequences were to emerge, and we were to do these terrible things, well, then, the governor should veto them,'' Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky said recently while debating in favor of the proposal. 
 Governor Pataki warned that the measure would return the state to the days when governors had little control over setting budgets for the agencies they led. 
 ''If allowed to pass, this dangerous proposal would turn the hands of time back to a dark age in New York history -- one of rapidly escalating state spending, irresponsible and unrestrained borrowing, and oppressive taxation,'' Governor Pataki said in a recent address to the Citizens Budget Commission, a group that has been critical of the state's budget process but opposes the proposed amendment.
 But lawmakers say the amendment is needed to even out what they see as the lopsided balance of power in New York State and provide a check on executive power. Three civic groups that favor the proposal -- the League of Women Voters, Common Cause New York and the New York Public Interest Research Group -- have found that 46 states give their Legislatures more budget powers than New York does. 
 And the groups say that the measure would provide added public accountability to the budget process. They say that creating an independent budget office, as called for in the measure, could help avoid a repeat of what happened in 2002, when Governor Pataki, who was running for re-election, refused to discuss the size of the state deficit -- only to acknowledge after the election that it had grown to $12 billion. 
 ''It goes a modest but good step forward in fixing the dysfunctional Albany budget process, and it does that by putting forward transparency, accountability and certainty,'' said Barbara Bartoletti, the legislative director of the state's League of Women Voters. ''The status quo is certainly something the citizens of New York have rejected.''
 The Legislature's desire to change the Constitution took on a new urgency last year after the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, issued a ruling that found that the governor was free to slip changes of laws into his budget bills, so that the Legislature had little or no power to amend them. The decision infuriated the Legislature.
 But some analysts question whether the amendment is the best way to give the Legislature the power to amend laws that are slipped into budget bills.
 Frank Mauro, the executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal watchdog group that has joined with a number of conservative groups to oppose the amendment, said that another constitutional amendment would directly tackle the problems raised by the court decision. He said the amendment, which is wending its way through the Legislature, would not damage the concept of the executive budget. The current proposal, he wrote, ''would make the state budget process even more of a mess than it has been in many recent years.''
 Current and former governors have also united against the measure. 
 Mr. Cuomo said in an interview recently that he did not think it wise to increase the Legislature's power at the expense of the executive, and said that much more needed to be done to change the system in Albany.
 ''I don't think we should settle for anything other than a constitutional convention,'' he said. 
 Predicting the outcome of constitutional change is an inexact science. After the Court of Appeals ruled last year that the Legislature had little power to change the governor's budget proposals except to delay passage, in the hopes of forcing a compromise, many lawmakers predicted that the budget would never be on time again. A few months later the state passed the first on-time budget in a generation.

HEADLINE: Ending the Fraudulence

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Let me be frank: it has been a long political nightmare. For some of us, daily life has remained safe and comfortable, so the nightmare has merely been intellectual: we realized early on that this administration was cynical, dishonest and incompetent, but spent a long time unable to get others to see the obvious. For others -- above all, of course, those Americans risking their lives in a war whose real rationale has never been explained -- the nightmare has been all too concrete. 
 So is the nightmare finally coming to an end? Yes, I think so. I have no idea whether Patrick Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor, will bring more indictments in the Plame affair. In any case, I don't share fantasies that Dick Cheney will be forced to resign; even Karl Rove may keep his post. One way or another, the Bush administration will stagger on for three more years. But its essential fraudulence stands exposed, and it's hard to see how that exposure can be undone. 
What do I mean by essential fraudulence? Basically, I mean the way an administration with an almost unbroken record of policy failure has nonetheless achieved political dominance through a carefully cultivated set of myths. 
 The record of policy failure is truly remarkable. It sometimes seems as if President Bush and Mr. Cheney are Midases in reverse: everything they touch -- from Iraq reconstruction to hurricane relief, from prescription drug coverage to the pursuit of Osama -- turns to crud. Even the few apparent successes turn out to contain failures at their core: for example, real G.D.P. may be up, but real wages are down.
 The point is that this administration's political triumphs have never been based on its real-world achievements, which are few and far between. The administration has, instead, built its power on myths: the myth of presidential leadership, the ugly myth that the administration is patriotic while its critics are not. Take away those myths, and the administration has nothing left. 
 Well, Katrina ended the leadership myth, which was already fading as the war dragged on. There was a time when a photo of Mr. Bush looking out the window of Air Force One on 9/11 became an iconic image of leadership. Now, a similar image of Mr. Bush looking out at a flooded New Orleans has become an iconic image of his lack of connection. Pundits may try to resurrect Mr. Bush's reputation, but his cult of personality is dead -- and the inscription on the tombstone reads, ''Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job.''
 Meanwhile, the Plame inquiry, however it winds up, has ended the myth of the administration's monopoly on patriotism, which was also fading in the face of the war. 
 Apologists can shout all they like that no laws were broken, that hardball politics is nothing new, or whatever. The fact remains that officials close to both Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush leaked the identity of an undercover operative for political reasons. Whether or not that act was illegal, it was clearly unpatriotic.
 And the Plame affair has also solidified the public's growing doubts about the administration's morals. By a three-to-one margin, according to a Washington Post poll, the public now believes that the level of ethics and honesty in the government has declined rather than risen under Mr. Bush. 
 So the Bush administration has lost the myths that sustained its mojo, and with them much of its power to do harm. But the nightmare won't be fully over until two things happen. 
 First, politicians will have to admit that they were misled. Second, the news media will have to face up to their role in allowing incompetents to pose as leaders and political apparatchiks to pose as patriots.
 It's a sad commentary on the timidity of most Democrats that even now, with Lawrence Wilkerson, Colin Powell's former chief of staff, telling us how policy was ''hijacked'' by the Cheney-Rumsfeld ''cabal,'' it's hard to get leading figures to admit that they were misled into supporting the Iraq war. Kudos to John Kerry for finally saying just that last week.
 And as for the media: these days, there is much harsh, justified criticism of the failure of major news organizations, this one included, to exert due diligence on rationales for the war. But the failures that made the long nightmare possible began much earlier, during the weeks after 9/11, when the media eagerly helped our political leaders build up a completely false picture of who they were. 
 So the long nightmare won't really be over until journalists ask themselves: what did we know, when did we know it, and why didn't we tell the public?

HEADLINE: U.N. IS EXPECTED TO PASS MEASURE PRESSURING SYRIA

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE and STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Warren Hoge reported from the United Nations for this article, and Steven R. Weisman from Washington. Michael Slackman contributed reporting from Damascus.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Security Council diplomats worked out final details on Sunday on a tough resolution against Syria, an action that will forcefully step up international pressure on the country's embattled president, Bashar al-Assad, and deepen his government's struggle to ward off increasing isolation. 
 Diplomats from the resolution's three co-sponsors, Britain, France and the United States, said they expected passage on Monday and did not foresee a veto from either China or Russia, the two countries most reluctant to punish Syria.
The resolution threatens Syria with economic penalties if it does not give full cooperation to the United Nations investigation that has identified high-ranking security officials as suspects in the assassination of a former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri.
 The measure also orders Syria to take into custody and make available to the investigators people they suspect of involvement in the killing. 
 That provision in particular could pose a problem for Mr. Assad, a relatively inexperienced leader perceived as weak and vulnerable in the power politics of the Middle East. Among the suspects are his brother, Maher Assad, and his brother-in- law, Asef Shawkat, the chief of military intelligence, who is considered the most powerful man in the country aside from the president.
 The expected censure of Syria comes at a time when Mr. Assad's government has been thrown on the defensive by a deeply incriminating report on the Hariri killing delivered Oct. 20 by Detlev Mehlis, the German prosecutor who leads the United Nations investigation.
 Mr. Hariri, an opponent of Syrian domination of Lebanese politics, and 20 others were killed Feb. 14 when a bomb detonated in a Beirut street as his convoy passed. The murder was followed by large and angry demonstrations in Beirut against Syria, which had been obliged by a Security Council resolution last September to withdraw its troops and intelligence agents from Lebanon and end its 29-year control of Lebanese public life.
 The United States has been keeping pressure on Syria, accusing it of allowing insurgents to cross its border into Iraq and demanding that it close the offices of militant Palestinian groups in Damascus and cease its longtime support for anti-Israel guerrilla groups like Hezbollah.
 Although the Middle East has been rocked by the war in Iraq and leaders there fear that turmoil in Syria could spill into their countries, none of its neighbors have come to Syria's defense over the Hariri killing.
 That inability of Syria to enlist vocal defenders is reflected at the United Nations, where even Security Council members troubled by some provisions of the resolution have not disagreed about the need to send Syria a stern message about its responsibility to cooperate with the investigation. That includes Algeria, the council's lone Arab member.
 ''There is a unanimous feeling within the Council that there must be greater cooperation from the Syrians,'' Richard A. Grenell, the spokesman for John R. Bolton, the United States ambassador, said Sunday.
 Mr. Grenell declined to be specific about the anticipated outcome of the Monday vote, but he said that nothing had occurred during the weekend to alter optimistic statements on Friday night from Mr. Bolton. Predicting that the measure already had the nine votes needed for passage, Mr. Bolton said, ''I don't foresee a veto.''
 Casting the American vote on Monday will be Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the leader of the American diplomatic campaign to isolate Syria. She is joining foreign ministers from the other Security Council states in the higher-level ''ministerial'' meeting of the panel that the resolution's sponsors requested to give it added force.
 The foreign ministers of the council's five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- held a private dinner in New York Sunday at which the resolution was to be discussed. 
 Ms. Rice and other American officials have said they do not seek ''regime change'' in Syria but rather ''behavior change.'' As an example, they point to Libya, where Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi decided in 2003 to admit the existence of his weapons programs, agree to dismantle them and thereby start to shed his country's pariah status. 
 Even for those wishing to see Mr. Assad's removal, there is a fear that his successor could come from the ranks of either his family or cronies in his government of Allawites, a minority Muslim sect, or from the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, the most popular organization among Syria's majority Sunnis.
 ''For the first term of his presidency, the Bush administration had a long list of complaints about Syria that got longer after Iraq,'' said Flynt Leverett, a Middle East specialist at the Brookings Institution who worked in the White House at the start of this presidency. ''Since the second term started, I think they've been moving toward an undeclared policy of regime change, as long as it doesn't require too much effort by the United States,'' Mr. Leverett added. ''It's regime change on the cheap.''
 In Damascus, Syrian officials say the United States has broken off communication with the country, withdrawing its ambassador and not responding to Syrian concerns. That silence has Syrian officials concerned that the American goal is to pull down the government. ''What do you do if the other party won't talk?'' Bouthaina Shaaban, the minister of expatriates, said Saturday.
 To cope, Syria has reached out to the international community, including Arab leaders, trying with little success to promote the idea that it had nothing to do with Mr. Hariri's death. In that connection, Syria sent its deputy foreign minister, Walid al-Mualem, on a tour of Persian Gulf states on Sunday. On Saturday, President Assad said he would set up a commission to conduct Syria's own investigation into the assassination.
 He also said border agents would be more cautious about visitors -- a reference to Arabs who do not need visas and may be intent on infiltrating Iraq. Syria has also proposed domestic changes, like giving Kurds citizenship, to promote national unity.
 The text of the Security Council resolution, first circulated last Monday, has been revised to meet the objections of individual countries. It calls on all states to impose a travel ban and asset freeze on anyone who is designated a suspect in the Hariri slaying. A Security Council committeewould be established to oversee these individual penalties and to rule on approving exceptions in cases like religious travel and emergency need.
 In its most contentious provision, the resolution states that to ensure compliance by Syria it will ''consider further measures'' under Article 41 of the United Nations Charter. That article permits the Council to decide what diplomatic and economic penalties may be used against a state.
 The revised text still includes the threat of penalties but it makes several adjustments to meet the objections of dissenters. In one concession, the co-sponsors moved a reference to Syria's need to ''cease all support for all forms of terrorist action and all assistance to terrorist groups'' from the text to the preamble, a section of Security Council resolutions that has less force. In another, language saying that Syria ''must stop interfering'' in Lebanese domestic affairs was changed to ''that Syria not interfere.''
 The Mehlis investigation has been extended to Dec. 15. Until then, Mr. Mehlis is to return periodically to report to the Security Council on Syrian cooperation or lack of it.

HEADLINE: One Debate, But a Glimpse Of 2 New Yorks

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
A smiling Shirley Taylor stood outside the WABC studio on Columbus Avenue yesterday as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Fernando Ferrer debated, waving a Bloomberg placard and holding a large bag decorated with eight Bloomberg buttons.
 Ms. Taylor, 70, is a Bloomberg volunteer because he responded with a ''beautiful letter'' when she called his 311 help line last winter to complain that a police officer had denied her access to a station house restroom when she was in need. Recruited months later -- coincidentally, insists Stu Loeser, a Bloomberg campaign spokesman -- she enlisted. ''I've been a volunteer since; I go to everything,'' explained Ms. Taylor, a lifelong Democrat who was born in Colombia and lives in the Bronx.
Welcome to the new New York, where the old assumptions do not seem to hold sway the way they used to. 
 In this New York, the Latino population is diverse, a clever management tool can help citizens as well as deliver political advantage, Democrats will vote Republican and pragmatism is edging out ideology. 
 No event in the campaign has made the changing nature of the city more apparent than yesterday's debate. It provided no break-out moment. But it did manage in one hour to illustrate the evolving politics of New York through the starkly contrasting views of the two candidates. Each saw a fundamentally different city.
 In Mr. Ferrer's New York, voters are as party conscious as ever. They see the label Republican as an epithet and care that Mr. Bloomberg has contributed to Republican candidates and supports President Bush. ''You can't disclaim responsibility for the policies you politically and financially support,'' Mr. Ferrer said.
 In Mr. Ferrer's town, the public will oppose projects like the development of Brooklyn's Atlantic Yards as a tainted ''backroom deal,'' won't object to reviving the stock transfer tax to support education and will focus on the high school dropout rate, not improvements in lower grades.
 In Mr. Ferrer's city, most people recognize that a wealthy candidate has the right to spend his money, but think he should not.
 In Mr. Bloomberg's New York, voters are pragmatic and figure he backs the president and contributes to Republicans to encourage support for the city. ''Bush is president of the United States,'' the mayor said. ''We agree on some things, disagree on others.''
 He reiterated that he was spending his money heavily to combat the city's 5-to-1 Democratic registration advantage, but clearly he knows that people do not care. In a recent New York Times poll, 69 percent of those questioned said a candidate's own spending bothered them ''not at all.''
 In the mayor's New York, the public supports economic development initiatives and tax breaks for projects like the $2 billion headquarters Goldman Sachs downtown as job-generators and stimulants to the economy. In his city, people oppose taxes that could discourage Wall Street and are willing to experiment with mayoral control of the schools, because ''At least the public finally has someone to blame, or give credit to -- there's accountability.''
 IN Mr. Ferrer's New York, the public wants mayoral control, but with a twist that sounds a lot like the failed decentralized school system. ''Parents and communities are shut out,'' he argued. His city is actually two figurative places -- the ''two New Yorks'' -- and as he sees it, the mayor favors the wealthier component. 
 In the mayor's city, the economy is resurgent and improvements are helping everybody. ''I believe we are going in the right direction,'' he kept saying.
 No campaign, including this one, is a clean test of political change. Mr. Ferrer has had trouble connecting with the public, Mr. Bloomberg benefits from incumbency and his popularity, and he has spent overwhelmingly -- $64 million so far, 17 times Mr. Ferrer's spending.
 Still, it was impossible to listen to yesterday's debate without coming away feeling that there truly are two New Yorks -- the old city and the emerging one.
 A clarification: Although he was described here on Thursday as the fabled Douglas Muzzio, professor at Baruch College's School of Public Affairs, he is not ''unreal or fictitious'' (Webster's New World Dictionary). The word ''fabled'' stayed behind when a reference to the proverbial ''level playing field'' was cut for space. It surely is fictitious. Professor Muzzio is not.

HEADLINE: Energy Failure

 BODY:
President Bush's habitual response to energy-related problems like oil dependency is to try to increase supply rather than to cut demand through energy efficiency. The imbalance is getting worse as Congress rushes to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration. Meanwhile, the Interior Department is leasing out more fragile public land than the oil and gas companies know what to do with in the Rocky Mountain West. 
 The administration's conservation strategy, by contrast, consists mainly of gestures, like Treasury Secretary John Snow's pledge to ride the train to New York instead of flying the shuttle, and the Energy Department's chirpy consumer-education program featuring a cartoon villain called Energy Hog. As we learned long ago when President Gerald Ford started passing out those WIN (Whip Inflation Now) buttons, a policy that rests solely on slogans and mascots is no policy at all.
 Obviously we can't expect this administration to turn on a dime and start supporting big increases in automobiles' fuel economy. But Mr. Bush has also ignored less controversial measures.
 Last month, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York joined with the Natural Resources Defense Council and others in a suit against the Energy Department because it has repeatedly ignored deadlines to review and strengthen efficiency standards for 22 products and appliances, including room air-conditioners and furnaces. 
 Congress requires periodic upgrades because technology gets better all the time. The first President George Bush strengthened 5 efficiency standards; President Bill Clinton strengthened 11. This administration hasn't strengthened any. Indeed, it tried unsuccessfully to roll back standards for central air-conditioners.
 The energy savings from updated standards would not be trivial at a time when prices for oil and natural gas have zoomed. New standards for furnaces and boilers alone could save about 3 percent of the oil and 6 percent of the natural gas used to heat American homes. The electricity savings could equal the output of 40 power plants, and the value to consumers could amount to about $6,000 per household by 2020.
 There's nothing inherently wrong with Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman's campaign to persuade consumers to reduce energy use voluntarily. But he should give them efficient products to work with.

HEADLINE: In Equal Footing of a Debate, Ferrer Gets Feisty

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
Fernando Ferrer tore into Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg during their first debate yesterday, saying he had failed to address the dual crises of unaffordable housing and high dropout rates among high school students. But Mr. Bloomberg argued that his record on public safety, the economy and education had earned him a second term.
 In the first of two hourlong televised encounters, the candidates offered starkly different visions of the city: one believes it is moving in the right direction for all New Yorkers and the other believes that for all its prosperity, it is leaving too many behind.
The spirited, often testy encounter was dominated by efforts by Mr. Ferrer, the Democratic nominee, to score direct hits against Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, while standing side by side with the incumbent for the first time in a campaign in which the mayor enjoys a huge advantage in spending and in the polls. 
 Mr. Ferrer was feisty and at times passionate, and hardly let a speaking opportunity pass without criticizing Mr. Bloomberg over his ties to the national Republican Party, his huge campaign spending or his priorities, which Mr. Ferrer said favored the rich over the poor.
 The challenger used his first chance to speak to say: ''Here's something you won't hear on a Mike Bloomberg ad: You have a 50 percent dropout rate. There's another thing you won't hear in a Mike Bloomberg ad. One out of five New Yorkers today lives in poverty.'' Summing up his debate argument later, he said: ''Mike Bloomberg thinks everything's going just great in this town, and for some it is, but for millions of others it isn't. There are two New Yorks.''
 Mr. Bloomberg was often matter-of-fact and at times declined to engage -- especially when it came to his national party's position on guns. He stuck close to a nearly clinical recitation of his record and plans for the future, arguing that he had made tough, politically unpopular choices that ultimately steered the city's resurgence after the devastation of the Sept. 11 attack.
 ''I've always tried to do what is right for the city, and I am proud of what we have accomplished,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in his closing remarks. ''We've brought crime down. We've improved test scores. We've made life expectancy in this city longer than the country as a whole. We've reduced death by fire and pedestrian deaths.'' He went on to say: ''Is there more to do? Absolutely.''
 With hardly enough money to advertise in a campaign in which it has been outspent 17 to 1, the Ferrer camp viewed the debate as a rare chance to press its case against Mr. Bloomberg more effectively than it has been able to in television commercials. 
 Political observers gave Mr. Ferrer some points for landing punches, but it was far from certain that he had done enough to make much change in his standing. ''Did he score any knockout blows? No,'' said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. ''Did he show that he belonged in the race? Sure.'' 
 Mr. Ferrer will have another chance tomorrow night in the second debate, at 7 on WNBC-TV, Channel 4. 
 From the start it was clear that he was looking for a fight, and that Mr. Bloomberg was largely trying to avoid one -- or, at least, to engage only when he thought it tactically beneficial.
 Mr. Bloomberg stuck tight to his lectern and spent most of the debate looking dead ahead or at his panel of questioners in the studios of WABC-TV, Channel 7. Mr. Ferrer, who is often criticized for being flat when campaigning, was anything but. He frequently seemed to be trying to rattle the mayor by standing to the side of his lectern and staring directly at him as Mr. Bloomberg spoke, sometimes even stepping toward him or wagging his finger as he made a point.
 Mr. Ferrer seemed more rehearsed and frequently used what appeared to be planned zingers, although at times their delivery was stilted. On several occasions he derided Mr. Bloomberg's ''globe-trotting'' lobbying for the Olympics and his ''sweetheart deal'' to bring a stadium for the Olympics and the Jets to the West Side. For instance, in reference to stalled efforts to rebuild downtown, he said, ''For four years we've chased Olympic dreams and sweetheart deals for West Side stadiums; now it's time to rebuild that economic engine for all of New York.''
 Mr. Bloomberg defended both projects. The Olympics would have created more than 100,000 jobs, he said, adding: ''It is a big economic thing. That's why every city wants the Olympics, and it is a shame we didn't get it.'' The stadium, he said, ''would have been great for this city.''
 Mr. Ferrer twice faulted the mayor for what he portrayed as excessive emphasis on improving test scores in grades three through seven, saying at one point, ''I'm not running to be the mayor of fourth-grade reading tests, I'm running to be the mayor of all of them.'' 
 Mr. Ferrer argued that the city's focus on elementary-school tests ignored the larger problem of high dropout rates among older students. ''You won't see 50 percent of our kids entering high school and dropping out,'' he said, ''without a diploma, without a job, without a future.''
 That opened the door to one of the testier exchanges. ''Freddy, you have a right to your opinions but not your own facts here,'' Mr. Bloomberg responded before noting that the city's on-time graduation rate rose to 54.3 percent from 50.8 percent during his tenure and that many of those who do not graduate on time do graduate later.
 When Mr. Ferrer snapped that he was quoting figures from Mr. Bloomberg's schools chancellor, Mr. Bloomberg ended the exchange by dismissively saying, ''O.K.''
 Mr. Bloomberg also tried to tie Mr. Ferrer to the school system's past failings, noting that as Bronx borough president, he always had an appointee on the Board of Education. Mr. Ferrer replied that one of them, Ninfa Segarra, was now working on Mr. Bloomberg's campaign. When Mr. Bloomberg said, ''She doesn't run my educational policy,'' Mr. Ferrer shot back, ''Thank goodness!'' Mr. Ferrer and Ms. Segarra had a public falling out in 1992 when she said teachers presenting lessons on AIDS should place more emphasis on abstinence than other forms of prevention. 
 Mr. Bloomberg started the most heated exchange of the debate when he used a question about a jump in the number of shootings to note that Mr. Ferrer had been ''out campaigning with Howard Dean, who was eight times endorsed by the N.R.A.''
 Asked if he wanted to respond, Mr. Ferrer, with an exaggerated laugh and speaking somewhat haltingly at first, launched into Mr. Bloomberg for his financial support of Republicans who supported a measure that shields firearms manufacturers from liability lawsuits.
 Mr. Ferrer pivoted to the side, leaned toward his opponent and wagged his finger as he spoke. ''Let's talk about Mike Bloomberg's support of the party and the president whose policies have hurt this city,'' Mr. Ferrer said, prompting Mr. Bloomberg to cut in, ''Not on this policy, I didn't.''
 As the exchange went on Mr. Ferrer snapped, ''You gave them money -- excuse me a second -- you gave them money, Mike. And you can't have it both ways. You can't disclaim responsibility for the policies you politically and financially support.''
 It was not the first time Mr. Ferrer had tried to tie Mr. Bloomberg to his national party -- which is decidedly unpopular in this overwhelmingly Democratic city -- by alluding to the mayor's previous support of President Bush's case for war and at another point asking him pointedly if he was proud of Mr. Bush. (Mr. Bloomberg responded, ''I agree with him on some things, I disagree with him on others.'')
 It was also not the first time Mr. Ferrer had tried to make an issue of Mr. Bloomberg's checkbook, saying his campaign spending was distorting the election-year dialogue.
 At various points in the debate Mr. Ferrer implied that Mr. Bloomberg's wealth kept him from understanding the plight of the average New Yorker, who he said was besieged by ''ticket blitzes,'' increasing property taxes and increased fees.
 ''Those fees, those fines, those penalties are doing little to help middle-class and working-class people to be able to live in their own neighborhoods,'' Mr. Ferrer said. 
 Mr. Ferrer used the debate to repeat his promise to cut property taxes by $973 and to criticize Mr. Bloomberg for going back on his promise in 2001 not to raise taxes.
 Mr. Bloomberg countered that Mr. Ferrer was proposing ''$12 billion in extra spending and $6 billion in tax increases already and he isn't even elected,'' to which Mr. Ferrer loudly cackled.
 The mayor charged that Mr. Ferrer's proposal to reinstate a stock-transfer tax to pay for school construction would ''drive thousands of jobs out of the city.''
 Even though the city faces a $4 billion deficit next year, Mr. Bloomberg said he believed the economy's continued expansion would allow the city to ''get through that year without any tax increases or fee increases.''
 He acknowledged that he had not wanted to raise taxes but said they were crucial in helping the city survive one of its worst fiscal crises without debilitating service cuts. He also noted he had introduced $400 property tax rebates and fought successfully for the elimination of the sales tax on clothing priced under $110. 
 Mr. Ferrer said that he would maintain mayoral control of schools; immediately reopen four firehouses Mr. Bloomberg closed during the fiscal crisis; and halt plans to build a Nets arena and several residential buildings in Downtown Brooklyn, a stand his campaign hopes will be popular in a politically important part of that borough.

IN STORE -- Retailers have already been cutting prices in fear of a slow holiday season. The International Council of Shopping Centers releases its monthly store sales index this week, giving one indication of whether the lower prices are paying off. (Tuesday.) 


MEDIA STOCKS -- Electronic Arts, Sirius Satellite Radio and Viacom, all media companies with their own challenges, report earnings this week. In particular, Viacom will not be able to show the stock price bump it had hoped for after announcing it was breaking into two parts. Sirius will announce its quarterly results in preparation for Howard Stern's debut on the service in January. (Tuesday.)

MONEY TALKS -- Fans of international monetary policy will need to get up early. John W. Snow, below, the United States Treasury secretary, and Rodrigo de Rato, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, will both speak at the Cato Institute's annual monetary conference. On the same day, Alan Greenspan will testify before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. What a day for ticket scalpers. (Thursday.)

LABOR PAINS -- In a critical report, the Labor Department will unveil October's unemployment rate. In September, the unemployment rate rose to 5.1 percent, from 4.9 percent in August, the first such increase in seven months. This week's report should give a better indication of whether that increase was a result of short-term factors like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita or a longer-term softening in the job market.

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds May Be Stung By Losses In October

BYLINE: By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
Some of the year's best-performing hedge funds are nursing big losses for October, stung by reversals in energy stocks, takeovers and investments overseas.
 Some large hedge fund managers are facing losses of 5 to 10 percent for the month, according to people briefed on the results. The losses may be tied in part to many funds selling their biggest winners at the same time, putting pressure on prices.
October, historically the cruelest month for investors, has been rocky. Despite a rally on Friday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down more than 2 percent for the month, and Treasury yields have recently spiked. Comments by Federal Reserve officials early in the month set off fears of rising inflation, while crude oil prices have eased. 
 Yet hedge funds -- private, lightly regulated pools of capital -- are not supposed to ride the currents of the markets, but are intended to be ''uncorrelated,'' meaning they hope to produce returns that are superior to conventional investments. That is why wealthy investors and big institutions are willing to pay hedge fund managers hefty fees, typically a management fee of 1 to 2 percent and a 20 percent slice of the profits.
 The disappointing results for October suggest the explosion in hedge fund growth has led too much money chasing too few investments. For example, a number of hedge fund managers followed the hedge fund star Edward S. Lampert into Sears, where he is also chairman. Sears is down 5.6 percent this month.
 ''Everyone is long the same stuff,'' said Robert L. Chapman Jr., a veteran fund manager who is returning from a sabbatical to raise a new hedge fund. ''Investors piggyback off of competitors' research, but then get easily spooked when the stocks move against them.''
 Hedge funds may now be particularly jittery, because investors who want to redeem their holdings by the end of the year can put in requests as early as November.
 ''This will clearly be one of those months that people look at to see how specific funds fared,'' said Antoine Bernheim, publisher of The U.S. Offshore Funds Directory.
 Some of this year's top-performing hedge funds have given back portions of their profits in October. The flagship hedge fund of Atticus Capital, an $8 billion manager, is down 9 percent for the month as of last week, although the fund is still sitting on gains of 40 percent for the year, according to a person briefed on the results.
 Third Point, a hedge fund firm managed by Daniel S. Loeb, a well-known activist investor, is facing a loss of around 9 percent this month for its largest fund, leaving it with a gain of more than 11 percent for the year so far, a person briefed on that fund's results said. The person declined to speak for attribution, citing regulatory restrictions on promoting hedge fund results. And York Capital, a $7 billion manager, was nursing a loss of more than 4 percent as of the middle of this month, while clinging to a nearly 3 percent gain for the year, according to a person with knowledge of its performance. 
 Hedge funds that specialize in picking stocks have been particularly hurt this month, as have so-called activist funds, which push for companies to sell assets or take other actions to raise stock prices. And some hedge funds have made big bets on commodity companies that have soured in recent weeks. Atticus, for example, owns nearly 4 percent of Phelps Dodge, a copper producer, whose shares are up almost 23 percent this year but down almost 10 percent from their highs earlier this month.
 Another popular stock with hedge fund managers, including Carl C. Icahn, has been Kerr-McGee, the oil exploration company, whose shares are up 48 percent this year, but down 13 percent since late September.
 Hedge funds have also been hurt by a reversal in European stocks. Among the losers is Gartmore, a hedge fund manager based in London, whose biggest fund is down 2.8 percent this month, as of last week, according to a person briefed on the results.
 A recent letter from Gartmore managers to investors said that ''something is broken'' in European stock markets, The Financial Times reported on Friday. 
 Funds have also been hit by losses in a variety of other areas, including emerging markets and junk bonds. Deals that have been withdrawn, like the proposed buyout of Cablevision, and deals that may be in trouble, like Johnson & Johnson's acquisition of Guidant, have also weighed on hedge funds. 
 Hedge funds, of course, have weathered turmoil and downturns before. This spring, hedge funds that specialize in the credit markets were wrong-footed by a cut in General Motors' credit rating that roiled the markets. Many of those funds rebounded, and the average hedge fund was up 7.4 percent through September, according to an index from Hedge Fund Research, versus a total return of 2.8 percent for the S.& P.
 Some investors in hedge funds take comfort from that rebound.
 ''This is a good time to invest,'' said Sandra Manzke, a hedge fund consultant. Some energy stocks, for example, ''have a long way to go,'' she said.
