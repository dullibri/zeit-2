HEADLINE: Drop in Home Loans Takes Toll on Banks

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase reported strong earnings, but added that mortgage income was declining. 

 BODY:
Wall Street knew the craze wouldn't last.
The nation's biggest banks, capitalizing on government efforts to bolster the housing market, have raked in handsome mortgage profits of late. On Friday, that started to change.
Wells Fargo, the nation's largest home lender, disclosed that it originated fewer home loans and recorded lower mortgage banking income in the first quarter of 2013. JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank by assets, reported limited appetite for new mortgages and a drop in mortgage banking income.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the banks' mortgage business had hinged on government intervention rather than fresh demand from consumers. When the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in recent years, it spurred millions of borrowers to refinance their home loans to reduce costs. 
Now, as mortgage rates inch upward from their lows late last year and refinancing enthusiasm wanes, the pipeline of borrowers is drying up.
"You need a next level of people that are willing to buy and that simply isn't there," said J. J. Kinahan, a strategist at TD Ameritrade.
Banks are more optimistic, arguing that demand for new home mortgages will replace the refinancing frenzy. The banks, in predicting a continued housing recovery, point to their declining mortgage litigation costs and the increase in car lending and credit card spending.
"People are buying cars, taking vacations and doing things to help fuel the economy," John G. Stumpf, Wells Fargo's chief executive, said in an interview. While noting that "the country has been through a shock" in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, he argued that "you will see different loan categories start to grow."
And despite the sluggish mortgage business, the banks showed broader signs of strength on Friday and managed to report record overall profits. JPMorgan posted a 33 percent jump in first-quarter earnings, to $6.53 billion, or $1.59 a share. Those results exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations of $1.40 a share.
Wells Fargo announced a 22 percent increase in earnings, to $5.17 billion, or 92 cents a share. The results outpaced estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, who had forecast earnings of 88 cents a share. For Wells, which is based in San Francisco, it was the 13th consecutive rise in quarterly earnings and the eighth consecutive record.
But revenue declined at both banks. And investors seemed skeptical about the banks' returns. Shares in both banks fell, with JPMorgan dropping 30 cents, or 0.61 percent, to $49.01, and Wells Fargo sliding 30 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $37.21.
The results of both banks represented a turning point for their mortgage business. That business has been especially lucrative of late, as the banks pass on most loans to government entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which guarantee the loans will be repaid. Armed with the guarantee, the banks package and sell the mortgages to investors for a significant profit.
The Federal Reserve has also stoked a refinancing boom after keeping interest rates at record lows. But the results on Friday signaled that those gains were unsustainable.
Underscoring a slowdown in refinancing, Wells Fargo said those loans accounted for 65 percent of mortgage originations in the first quarter, down from 76 percent in the period a year earlier. The bank's mortgage banking income also slipped 3 percent, presenting potential problems for Wells Fargo, whose fortunes rise and fall with the mortgage market. And while handling $109 billion in mortgage originations might be a feat for some banks, it was a 16 percent drop for Wells Fargo.
JPMorgan's mortgage originations actually soared 37 percent, but new loan applications slipped 8 percent from the fourth quarter. In total, the mortgage banking group posted a profit of $673 million for the first quarter, down 31 percent from a year earlier.
Still, JPMorgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, struck a confident tone about the housing market.
"We are seeing positive signs that the economy is healthy and getting stronger," Mr. Dimon said. "Housing prices continued to improve, and new home purchases are also starting to come back."
He argued, however, that new regulations had clogged the lending spigot. The government's lending standards remain too tough, he said, excluding some qualified borrowers from the market.
With the mortgage business in transition, the banks found other ways to burnish profits. For one, they cut expenses. Both banks also notched big gains in credit card and automobile lending. At JPMorgan alone, car lending grew 12 percent from a year earlier, to $6.5 billion.
JPMorgan's results were also buoyed by gains in the investment banking business, where fees rose 4 percent, to $1.4 billion. The asset management business, which JPMorgan has expanded as regulations crimp other areas of the bank, reported net income of $487 million for the quarter, up 26 percent from a year earlier.
The gains were further fueled by JPMorgan's decision to reduce reserves for mortgages and credit card loans. By moving money from the reserves, which cushion the bank against potential losses, the bank collected a net gain of 18 cents a share.
Addressing questions on Friday about whether the earnings are deceptively strong, Mr. Dimon said in a conference call that even after the reserve reductions, "we had really good numbers everywhere."
At Wells Fargo, the strong returns were spread across the bank. Wholesale banking, which includes the sales and trading business along with the corporate lending division, reported that profits rose 9 percent. The bank also posted a 14 percent profit gain in its wealth management business. And profit in the community banking division, which includes Wells Fargo's retail branches and consumer lending business, climbed 24 percent, to $2.9 billion.
"Wells Fargo's diversified business model continued to produce outstanding results," said Timothy J. Sloan, the bank's chief financial officer.

HEADLINE: Bomb North Korea, Before It's Too Late

BYLINE: By JEREMI SURI. 
Jeremi Suri, a professor of history and public affairs at the University of Texas, Austin, is the author of ''Liberty's Surest Guardian: American Nation-Building From the Founders to Obama.''

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex.
SINCE February, the North Korean government has followed one threatening move with another. The spiral began with an underground nuclear test. Then the North declared the armistice that ended the Korean War invalid. The young dictator Kim Jong-un followed with a flurry of threats to attack civilian targets in South Korea, Japan and the United States.
Earlier this week, North Korea closed the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the only facility where citizens from North and South Korea work together. And now the North is openly threatening (and visibly preparing) to fire a mobile-launcher-based Musudan missile with a range that could reach many of the places Mr. Kim has menaced in his public statements. American intelligence agencies believe that North Korea is working to prepare even longer-range delivery systems to carry the nuclear warheads already in its arsenal. 
The Korean crisis has now become a strategic threat to America's core national interests. The best option is to destroy the North Korean missile on the ground before it is launched. The United States should use a precise airstrike to render the missile and its mobile launcher inoperable.
President Obama should state clearly and forthrightly that this is an act of self-defense in response to explicit threats from North Korea and clear evidence of a prepared weapon. He should give the leaders of South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan advance notice before acting. And he should explain that this is a limited defensive strike on a military target -- an operation that poses no threat to civilians -- and that America does not intend to bring about regime change. The purpose is to neutralize a clear and present danger. That is all.
If North Korea is left to continue its threatening behavior, it will jeopardize the fragile economies of the region and it will encourage South Korea and Japan to develop their own nuclear weapons -- a policy already advocated by hawks in both countries. Most of all, North Korean threats will encourage isolated states across the world to follow suit. The Iranians are certainly watching. If North Korea can use its small nuclear arsenal to blackmail the region with impunity, why shouldn't the mullahs in Tehran try to do the same?
The United States and its allies in East Asia have a legitimate right to self-defense and they have a deep interest in deterring future threats on this scale.
Thanks to precise satellite reconnaissance, striking the North Korean missile on the ground would be much easier than after it was launched. Since the United States cannot possibly know the missile's trajectory before a launch, and Mr. Kim has said he is targeting America and its allies, we have reason to believe that civilians face serious danger.
Since a missile on the ground is an obvious and largely undefended target, we can be reasonably sure that a strike would destroy it and preserve regional stability and the safety of our allies. An American pre-emptive strike would also re-establish necessary red lines for North Korea and other countries in similar circumstances.
As President Xi Jinping of China stated earlier this month, ''No one should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gains.'' By eliminating the most recent North Korean missile threat, the United States will reduce the threat posed by the North's arsenal. The United States would also reassure everyone in the region, and those watching from other parts of the world, that although it is not seeking regime change, America and its allies will not be blackmailed by threatened missile launches.
The North Korean government would certainly view the American strike as a provocation, but it is unlikely that Mr. Kim would retaliate by attacking South Korea, as many fear. First, the Chinese government would do everything it could to prevent such a reaction. Even if they oppose an American strike, China's leaders understand that a full-scale war would be far worse. Second, Mr. Kim would see in the American strike a renewed commitment to the defense of South Korea. Any attack on Seoul would be an act of suicide for him, and he knows that.
A war on the Korean Peninsula is unlikely after an American strike, but it is not inconceivable. The North Koreans might continue to escalate, and Mr. Kim might feel obligated to start a war to save face. Under these unfortunate circumstances, the United States and its allies would still be better off fighting a war with North Korea today, when the conflict could still be confined largely to the Korean Peninsula. As North Korea's actions over the last two months have shown, Mr. Kim's government is willing to escalate its threats much more rapidly than his father's regime did. An unending crisis would merely postpone war to a later date, when the damage caused by North Korea would be even greater.
China's role in a potential war on the Korean Peninsula is hard to predict. Beijing will continue to worry about the United States extending its influence up to the Chinese border. If armed hostilities erupt, President Obama should be prepared for direct and close consultations with Chinese leaders to negotiate a postwar settlement, in a larger multinational framework, that respects Beijing's legitimate security interests in North Korea. The United States has no interest in occupying North Korea. The Chinese are unlikely to pursue an occupation of their own.
Destroying the North Korean missile before it is launched is the best of bad options on the Korean Peninsula. A prolonged crisis would undermine regional security and global efforts to stop nuclear proliferation. And a future war would be much worse. The most prudent move is to eliminate the most imminent military threat in self-defense, establish clear and reasonable limits on future belligerence, and maintain allied unity for stability -- not forced regime change -- in the region. This is the kind of pre-emptive action that would save lives and maybe even preserve the uneasy peace on the Korean Peninsula.

HEADLINE: A Guilty Plea Over Mortgage Bond Fraud

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
A former senior trader at Credit Suisse Group pleaded guilty on Friday to charges that he fraudulently inflated the value of mortgage bonds as the housing market collapsed, becoming one of the highest-ranking Wall Street executives to admit to crimes related to the 2008 financial crisis. 
Kareem Serageldin, the former Credit Suisse trader, admitted to mismarking their positions to avoid losses in their investment portfolio at the end of 2007. He appeared in Federal District Court in Manhattan a week after being extradited from Britain.
During the court hearing, Mr. Serageldin, 39, said that after discovering that members of his team were fudging the value of its bond portfolio, he made the fateful decision to participate in the fraud rather than put an end to it.
''Why did you do that?'' asked Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein.
''To preserve my reputation in the bank at a time when there was great financial turmoil,'' he said.
Judge Hellerstein asked Mr. Serageldin numerous questions about his misconduct, at one point suggesting that the bank turned a blind eye to the scheme.
A Credit Suisse spokesman, Jack Grone, referred to an earlier statement from securities regulators commending the bank for immediately reporting the wrongdoing and cooperating with the investigation. Sean P. Casey, a lawyer for Mr. Serageldin at Kobre & Kim, declined to comment.
Federal prosecutors first charged Mr. Serageldin, an American citizen living in London, in February 2012, and urged him to return to the United States to face the charges against him. Two of Mr. Serageldin's underlings, David Higgs and Salmaan Siddiqui, pleaded guilty to participating in the conspiracy and cooperated with the government.
The assets overvalued by the three former Credit Suisse traders were mortgage-backed securities, the complex bonds that caused hundreds of billions of dollars in losses across the banking system and brought global markets to its knees.
The traders inflated the value of the bonds to increase their 2007 year-end bonuses, prosecutors said. Mr. Serageldin secured a cash bonus of more than $1.7 million and a stock award of more than $5.2 million.
''While the real estate market was imploding and the financial crisis emerging, Kareem Serageldin and his co-conspirators concealed significant subprime mortgage-related losses in order to secure multimillion-dollar paydays,'' Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said.
Mr. Serageldin, the former global head of structured credit in Credit Suisse's investment banking division, pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to falsify books and records. The charge carries a maximum sentence of five years. His sentencing is set for Aug. 2.
Credit Suisse rescinded Mr. Serageldin's stock award after uncovering the fraud. He agreed to forfeit about $1 million -- the approximate after-tax amount of his cash bonus.
The government's investigation originated in early 2008 when the bank disclosed that it was taking a $2.65 billion write-down after discovering Mr. Serageldin's team had misstated the value of mortgage securities on their books. Credit Suisse suspended the team and reported them to the authorities.

HEADLINE: Fewer Americans Lose Jobs, but Hiring Is Also Down

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
AMERICAN workers are being fired or laid off less often than at any time in the last decade, the government reported this week. But companies are also less willing to hire than they used to be. 
The Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for February showed that during that month the total number of people who were either discharged or laid off totaled just 0.9 percent of all job holders in the United States. It was the first month since that survey began in 2000 that the figure dipped below 1 percent.
Over the most recent 12 months, the Labor Department figures show, only 15.1 percent of workers lost their jobs because of layoffs or discharges. Until this year, the lowest figure for any 12 months had been 15.3 percent, during the period ending in September 2006. That came as the economic boom was cresting before the recession that began at the end of 2007.
As can be seen in the accompanying charts, the rate peaked in the fall of 2009 with 21 percent of jobs being terminated by firing or layoff in the preceding 12 months.
The rate of labor turnover shown by the report is somewhat stunning in the degree of labor turnover that was common before the Great Recession. There is still substantial turnover, but the rate fell sharply during the downturn and has yet to recover to the preceding levels. The hiring rate has been rising steadily since 2009, but remains below any level seen before the recession.
To some extent, the decline in mobility may help to explain the current prevalence of long-term unemployment. Employers who have no need to replace employees who left are not going to hire anyone, making it all the more difficult for unemployed workers to find work.
The department survey asks employers each month how many workers they have and how many left and were added in the preceding month. It also asks how many unfilled jobs the employers have available.
For employees who left, the employers are asked how many were laid off or discharged, and how many quit. In the accompanying chart, the number quitting is combined with the other reasons for departure, which include retirement, transfer and death.
It is, of course, possible that some departures listed as voluntary are at least partly forced. Some workers taking buyouts or early retirement may have concluded they would lose their jobs anyway if they did not do so.
The estimate that 15.1 percent of jobs were terminated by discharge or layoff in the most recent 12 months does not mean that that proportion of the work force was affected over the period. Layoffs are far more prevalent in some industries, notably construction, where the nature of the work may mean that a worker has a series of jobs, losing each one as the job is completed, and is counted as having been laid off several times in any one year.
The charts also show the rates in some industries. In some, including construction, health care and finance, the current rate of firings and layoffs is above the low before the recession. That is also true in government. But in fields like manufacturing, retail trade and accommodation and food services, fewer workers are now being let go than at any time during the boom years early in this century.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Fewer Are Losing Their Jobs: The rate of layoffs and discharges has fallen to the lowest level since the government began calculating the figure at the end of 2000, dropping below the level seen in the fall of 2006, before the Great Recession began. More people are leaving their jobs voluntarily and more are also being hired than during the recession, but those rates remain well below the previous peaks. Rates of firings and layoffs are highest in the construction industry, and lowest in government jobs. (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, via Haver Analytics)

HEADLINE: Celebrating Landmarks Law Where the City Is Miniature

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
David Grainger is walking on the water again. One foot is upstream from the Manhattan Bridge and the other foot is downstream from the Williamsburg Bridge, and he is reaching over the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to plant a yellow flag at the intersection of Pierrepont Street and Hicks Street in Brooklyn Heights.
His feet are covered in protective blue bootees. The bootees protect the water, which is not water at all but dark-blue paint on wood. 
He is standing on the surface of the Queens Museum of Art's Panorama, the 9,335-square-foot diorama of the city built for the 1964 World's Fair. The yellow flag is one of 109 that he is putting in place as part of a project to highlight the city's historic districts and the 50th anniversary of the municipal law that made them possible.
''The flags give some sense of place to viewers, residents and visitors,'' said Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, an author and preservationist who has organized the NYC Landmarks50 Advisory Committee to mark the anniversary of the law in 2015. ''The Panorama is all about all of New York. It describes graphically and quickly the reach of the landmarks movement. People might say there are 109 that encompass 30,000 properties. Does that sound like a lot? It represents less than 3 percent of all of the properties in New York City.''
The World's Fair straddled two important moments in the history of historic preservation: The demolition of the old Pennsylvania Station in 1963 and the approval of the landmarks law in 1965.
The Landmarks50 Advisory Committee has a long list of members that includes Simeon Bankoff, the executive director of the Historic Districts Council; Kent L. Barwick, a former chair of the landmarks commission and president emeritus of the Municipal Art Society; Peg Breen, president of the private New York Landmarks Conservancy; Vin Cipolla, president of the Municipal Art Society; Andrew S. Dolkart, director of the Historic Preservation Program at Columbia University; the architecture critic Paul Goldberger; and the designer Massimo Vignelli, who created the group's logo.
Ms. Diamonstein-Spielvogel said one of the committee's goals was to highlight the significance of historic preservation in shaping the city since the 1960s.
''I think it reflects the growth and importance of the landmarks movement, which I consider to be one of the most important national movements after things like human rights, civil rights, gay rights,'' she said. ''Down that same line is the historic preservation movement. It cuts across all economic lines. There isn't a neighborhood, certainly not in New York, that doesn't have a range of organizations public and private devoted to this.''
On the Panorama, there is a one-district, one-flag policy. So there was one flag for the 75 blocks of the Upper West Side/Central Park West district, one flag for the one-block West 71st Street Historic District and one for each of the other districts, which are spread across all five boroughs.
''As the flags go up,'' said Mr. Bankoff of the Historic Districts Council, who watched as Mr. Grainger planted the flags, ''you see how many historic districts there are compared to how large the city is. On the one hand, there are people who say there's too much preservation, and on the other, you look around and see how few areas are protected and how much more there is to be done.''
Mr. Bankoff said the district in Brooklyn Heights -- the one Mr. Grainger had stretched to reach -- was the city's first, designated in November 1965. Four more districts, all in Manhattan, came into being the next year.
By this time Mr. Grainger, an art installer, hunting for the place to plant the flag for the Fillmore Place Historic District in Williamsburg, was on his knees in the East River.
It is territory Mr. Grainger knows well -- he repainted the water several years ago, and lately has been vacuuming off dust that has accumulated since then -- and territory that Mr. Bankoff approached with apprehension.
''I'm terrified I'll trip over the Verrazano,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Longtime CUNY Chancellor to Step Down After Pushing Higher Standards

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER

 BODY:
Matthew Goldstein, who oversaw an expansion of the city's public college system and set out to raise its prestige with a new honors college and other measures, announced on Friday that he would step down after 14 years as chancellor of the City University of New York.
In an interview on Friday, he said that having been the longest-serving chancellor by far, he felt the time was right to leave. ''I had an agenda that was in my mind when I first accepted the invitation to do the job, and we have succeeded beyond that agenda, things I never envisaged we would be able to do,'' he said. 
When Dr. Goldstein, 71, came into office in 1999, a mayoral task force had just labeled CUNY ''an institution adrift.'' The task force called for the university's total restructuring, to transform it from a confederation of loosely affiliated institutions into a coherent entity with more consistent standards and effective practices. Benno Schmidt, a former Yale president and an author of the report, later said of CUNY, ''The word chaotic doesn't even begin to describe it; it's moribund.''
Dr. Goldstein had administrative experience, having previously led CUNY's Baruch College, and, briefly, Adelphi University. But reforming CUNY posed enormous logistical and political challenges. The university now has 490,000 students at 24 colleges and professional schools. It is jointly funded by the city and the state, in addition to tuition, which is now $5,730 at the four-year schools. And with the overwhelming majority of its students coming from New York City public schools, the university's success is somewhat dependent on the quality of education those institutions offer.
In an important initiative, Dr. Goldstein raised the admissions standards at CUNY's top five four-year colleges -- Baruch, Brooklyn, City, Hunter and Queens -- and carried out a policy, which was proposed before his arrival, that required applicants who needed remedial classes to begin their studies at one of CUNY's community colleges. The average SAT scores of freshmen entering the top colleges rose to 1147 last year from 998 in 1999, according to CUNY. But the changes had the additional effect of altering the colleges' racial and ethnic profiles. As these colleges began accepting more Asian and fewer black and Hispanic students, critics denounced the new policy as discriminatory.
Dr. Goldstein added more than 2,000 full-time faculty positions. He also opened new schools and initiated new degree programs, including: the Macaulay Honors College, which began luring some of the city's top public school graduates, including one winner of the nationwide Intel Science Talent Search; a school of public health; a graduate program in journalism; and a new community college meant to keep students on track toward a degree.
To help pay for these innovations, he sought out private donors in a way that CUNY never had before. During his tenure, CUNY's annual fund-raising rose to almost $250 million from about $50 million. He assiduously cultivated allies in City Hall and Albany, was chairman of the city's 2010 Charter Revision Commission and was appointed chairman of the New York City Regional Economic Development Council by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
In a prepared statement on Friday, Mr. Schmidt, who is now the chairman of CUNY's board, said: ''Chancellor Goldstein has led the unprecedented transformation of CUNY into the premier integrated urban university in America. By all indications, CUNY's outstanding reputation, rising enrollments, increased standards and enhanced resources should be attributed in large measure to his exemplary and courageous leadership.''
The CUNY board will conduct a national search to replace Dr. Goldstein, who earns $490,000 a year, and receives a $90,000-a-year housing allowance. He will step down this summer.
A recent push by Dr. Goldstein called the Pathways Initiative, a program to establish common ''learning outcomes'' across the entire system, has met with defiance from large swaths of the faculty. The program sought to make it easier to transfer credits from one CUNY college to another, and to lessen what Dr. Goldstein considered a burdensome number of core courses that some colleges required.
Critics described it as a way to centralize control and stint on instruction. The union representing CUNY faculty and the university faculty senate have brought two lawsuits to try to block the initiative.
''I think he has done a number of really wonderful things. I think he has had a number of really good ideas,'' said Sandi Cooper, a history professor at the College of Staten Island and a former chairwoman of the university faculty senate. But, she added, ''I think the worst idea he had was Pathways, and even worse than the idea was the way he stuffed it down the faculty's throat,'' resulting in what she said was the worst morale since the fiscal crisis of the 1970s. ''Otherwise his achievement is terrific.''

HEADLINE: March Retail Sales Fell As Consumers Cut Back

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Sales at United States retailers fell in March, suggesting that higher taxes and weak hiring made some consumers more cautious about spending.
Retail sales declined a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent last month, compared with February, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That followed a 1 percent gain in February and a 0.1 percent decline in January. The figures for February and January were both revised lower from initial reports.
Consumers cut back spending across a wide range of categories last month. Sales at auto dealers dropped 0.6 percent. Gas station sales dropped 2.2 percent, partly reflecting lower prices for fuel. The retail figures are not adjusted for price changes. 
Excluding the volatile categories of autos, gasoline and building materials, core sales dropped 0.2 percent in March. That followed a gain of 0.3 percent in February. Department stores, electronics retailers and sporting goods outlets all reported lower sales.
The retail sales report is the government's first look at consumer spending, which drives about 70 percent of economic activity.
The decline in March shows that higher Social Security taxes are starting to affect consumers and could blunt growth in the spring.
Many economists still predict that economic growth accelerated to an annual rate of roughly 3 percent in the quarter from January to March. That would be a significant increase from the anemic growth rate of 0.4 percent reported for the quarter from October to December.
Still, economists say the improvement is most likely temporary. Many now expect weaker spending will be among factors that slow growth again in the quarter from April to June quarter, with an annual growth rate of around 1.5 percent.
''The U.S. consumer looks a little less resilient,'' said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase. ''It now appears that close to $200 billion in higher taxes may have actually had some impact on consumer spending.''
A separate report Friday on consumer confidence for April seemed to underscore that point.
The University of Michigan's preliminary survey of consumer sentiment fell to 72.3. That's down from 78.6 in March and the lowest since July. The discouraging jobs report and other weak economic reports are probably responsible for influencing consumers' sentiment.
Companies are also less optimistic about the next few months, according to a separate Commerce Department report issued Friday. Businesses increased their stockpiles only 0.1 percent in February, the smallest gain in eight months. That suggests that companies had expected sales to weaken this spring, a point confirmed by the March retail sales figures.
Economists said restocking would probably remain tepid in the quarter from April to June. Slower restocking means companies order fewer goods, which slows factory output and growth.
''The economy appears to have lost some momentum,'' said Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics. ''But with gasoline prices now falling, we don't expect too sharp a slowdown.''
The cost of a gallon of gas averaged $3.56 nationwide Thursday, down from $3.70 a month earlier, according to AAA.
The increase in Social Security taxes has lowered take-home pay this year for nearly all workers. Someone earning $50,000 will have about $1,000 less to spend in 2013. A household with two high-paid workers will have up to $4,500 less.
There were a few positive signs in the retail spending report. Furniture stores reported a 0.9 percent sales increase, suggesting that the housing recovery was still encouraging more spending. And sales at hardware and garden supply stores ticked up 0.1 percent, despite an unseasonably cold March.
But sales at general merchandise stores, which include major department stores like Macy's and big discount stores like Walmart and Target, dropped 1.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Beer Venture Fails in North Korea, Despite Eager Market

BYLINE: By JOHN RUWITCH | REUTERS

 BODY:
TUMEN, CHINA -- Setting up a brewery in North Korea seemed like a good idea to Harry Kim and his Chinese friends two years ago. Everyone likes beer, even in one of the world's most closed and least understood countries, they believed.
Mr. Kim and his partners managed to start production after workers strapped brewing equipment to a truck in the Chinese border town of Tumen and drove it to the North Korean coastal city of Chongjin. Chinese engineers taught the locals how to brew. City officials loved the taste, he said.
But the small Chinese-North Korean venture ran aground within months after failing to get final approval from the authorities in Pyongyang.
Mr. Kim's experience is an illustration of both the challenge and the potential of doing business in North Korea, which has grabbed global attention in recent weeks with its threats to wage nuclear war on South Korea and the United States. 
''It wasn't rejected. We just waited. The central government didn't come and say 'no', but the documents were just never issued and so we eventually gave up,'' said Mr. Kim, a Chinese national of Korean descent who lives in Tumen, in China's northeastern Jilin Province.
Building a brewery in Chongjin, one the biggest cities in North Korea, would appear to make good business sense.
Domestic beer has to be trucked up from Pyongyang, 460 kilometers, or 285 miles, to the southwest. Terrible mountain roads and the long journey take their toll on the cargo, said Mr. Kim, speaking at a restaurant he owns a few blocks from the icy Tumen River, which divides the two nations. One tour operator said North Korean beer in Chongjin was twice as expensive as it was in Pyongyang.
Chongjin and provincial officials supported the project. Factory space was available in the struggling city, which is 130 kilometers south of Tumen. The local water was crystal clear, too, promising a clean and tasty product.
And to hedge the obvious risks, the local business partner arranged for the Chinese to buy shipments of North Korean seafood to sell in China at each stage that they invested in the beer venture.
''The problem isn't that the people are hard to deal with,'' Mr. Kim said. ''These are all firsts. It's not that the nation does not want to do it, but rather that it's the first time.''
Indeed, North Korea lies at the very edge of the global investment frontier. After years of U.N. sanctions over the country's nuclear and missile programs, few have tried to make money there, apart from Chinese companies and, in an industrial park near the North-South border, some South Korean companies. Pyongyang effectively closed that factory zone in the past week, recalling its workers amid its threats of war.
Between 2003 and 2009, Chinese investment in North Korea was the equivalent of $98.3 million, according to Chinese data cited in a 2011 report by Drew Thompson, a Korea specialist now at the U.S. Department of Defense. Analysts say Chinese investment has risen more recently after a push by Beijing, North Korea's only major diplomatic ally, to increase economic links.
Examples of collapsed Chinese investments abound. Last year, the Xiyang Group said it had been ''cheated'' in a failed deal to refine North Korean iron ore. In public comments, the miner and steel maker said doing business in North Korea had been a ''nightmare.''
There is little public information on North Korea's beer market, but one thing seems clear -- demand outstrips supply.
Troy Collings, a director at Young Pioneer Tours, a travel operator based in China that takes groups into North Korea and has organized brewery visits, said there were probably fewer than a dozen locally made beers available in the country.
In Pyongyang, two hotels concoct their own microbrews. The Rakwon department store creates its own eponymous beer, too, he said.
''They can't produce enough for the domestic market,'' Mr. Collings said.
The opportunity was clear -- and reinforced for Mr. Kim when he saw the elite in Chongjin drinking a lot of Heineken and Corona.
So, in mid-2011, Mr. Kim and two friends joined with a North Korean businessman to put the brewery plan in motion.
Approval from the city of Chongjin came easily, he said. The province, North Hamgyong, gave the green light too.
And the first of three investments in equipment and supplies -- the initial one worth about 200,000 renminbi, or $32,000 -- was made.
Since North Korea has no system of credit and the risks of investing were high, Mr. Kim and his partners tied the beer project to seafood exports.
Before each investment was made, they were allowed to buy a cargo of North Korean seafood to sell in China. The first was about 50 tons of squid, he said.
North Korean seafood, hauled from the frigid, pollution-free waters off the coast, is a delicacy in China. In Hunchun, a Chinese city near the northeastern tip of North Korea, wholesalers of North Korean crabs line one street.
It took about nine hours to drive from Tumen to Chongjin with the brewery equipment, including stops at customs.
The equipment was installed quickly, and Chinese engineers showed the North Koreans how to brew. Soon, suds were flowing. The product was dubbed Wongang, or ''river source,'' beer.
On the first day of business the investors invited senior city and provincial leaders to the brewery for a sample. All approved, Mr. Kim said.
But the new brewery could not increase production without authorization from Pyongyang, which never came, despite months of waiting. There was never a response and the investors never got an explanation. ''If you push too hard it could raise suspicions,'' Mr. Kim said.
It was a pity, because the North Koreans were good workers, he said, citing how the investors had overcome the frequent power cuts that made it hard to use a computer to monitor the brewing process.
The investors stationed North Korean workers at each of the pressure gauges on the brewing equipment in 12-hour shifts. The workers were told that if the dial reached a certain level they should turn a knob to let off pressure. ''They got chairs and sat there looking at the gauges, not sleeping all night, one person at each position,'' Mr. Kim said.
Thanks to the seafood hedge, the Chinese investors basically broke even. Mr. Kim now runs his restaurant in the space where the brewing equipment was stored before it was hauled to Chongjin.
Someday Pyongyang may give the green light, he said, but he is not holding his breath. ''As I was leaving they said, 'It's not that we don't want to do it, and it's not that our senior leaders or the central government don't want to do it, but we just don't have practical experience with this kind of thing.'''

HEADLINE: The Sun Rises on Human Rights

BYLINE: By KENNETH ROTH and KANAE DOI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- As U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrives in Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is making waves. Known for his aggressive efforts to revive Japan's economy, his nationalist rhetoric and his openness to military strength, he is also pushing Japan toward a new assertiveness on human rights.
Despite a vibrant democracy at home, the diplomats who guide Japan's foreign policy are famous for their caution on human rights. To avoid interrupting friendly relations with other countries, harming Japan's economic interests or risking criticism of Japan's war record, they discuss human rights, if at all, only quietly, behind closed doors. Tokyo generally votes with its Western allies on human rights matters at the United Nations, but almost never takes the initiative, fearful of sticking its neck out. 
Abe may be changing that. Soon after coming to power, he ordered Japanese diplomats to take the lead on an effort at the U.N. Human Rights Council to establish a commission of inquiry to collect evidence of North Korea's crimes against humanity.
Japanese governments have long faced domestic pressure to resolve the cases of its citizens whom Pyongyang abducted decades ago, apparently to teach Japanese language skills to Korean spies. But to back the U.N. initiative, Abe effectively had to accept that the abductees' fate reflected the systematic denial of the rights of everyone in North Korea. That's a reasonable conclusion, but no prior Japanese government had been willing to reach it.
Many other governments were lukewarm about a commission of inquiry for North Korea. Some disliked the (modest) expense. Others questioned its utility. Others may have feared diverting attention from the North's nuclear program.
Working with South Korea, Japan confronted this skepticism. And it succeeded. Last month, the Human Rights Council unanimously launched a commission of inquiry. North Korean leaders are now on notice that evidence of their criminality will be officially collected, meaning possible international trials if they do not change their ways.
This new assertiveness on human rights was foreshadowed in a speech that Abe gave in January. He embraced a foreign policy built around ''the fundamental values of freedom, democracy, basic human rights, and the rule of law.'' A Japanese leader has rarely made such a call, let alone acted on it.
But Abe has his work cut out for him in implementing his vision. Last month, Japan's powerful foreign-policy bureaucracy resisted a parallel U.N. resolution on Sri Lanka's failure to seriously investigate indiscriminate attacks by its military that caused up to 40,000 civilian deaths in the final months of its conflict with the rebel Tamil Tigers four years ago.
The resolution passed overwhelmingly. But Japan, acting with its traditional caution, abstained.
We asked Japan's leading diplomat on Sri Lanka how Japan could be so out of step with its peers. He offered various excuses, but the main factor seemed to be a desire to maintain good relations with Sri Lanka, despite the lack of evidence that Japan's quiet diplomacy has more influence than the U.N.'s visible pressure.
Perhaps Japan's greatest human-rights challenge is China. Given Japan's war record, it has had a particularly difficult time raising human rights concerns in China, but after nearly 70 years, it is time for a strong leader to overcome this obstacle.
Like many others, Japan limits the topic to a roughly once-a-year ''human rights dialogue.'' It typically involves bureaucrats meeting with no outsiders present and little revelation of what was said. For the rest of the year, senior officials can cite this charade to avoid addressing China's repression themselves.
The result does no good for the rights of the Chinese people -- or Japan's reputation. The Chinese people are left to think of Japan as preoccupied with allegedly trying to steal ''their islands'' but indifferent to their rights. In an age of Sina Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter, and government-permitted attacks on the Japanese Embassy, Chinese public opinion matters.
For decades, Japan's foreign policy has been built around the country as a donor nation, with few strings attached. Japan has been extraordinarily generous, but China can now play that game as well, with even deeper pockets.
Abe seems to recognize that Japan has been squandering its greatest foreign-policy asset -- its democracy. Building a foreign policy around promoting democracy -- and the rights essential to it -- will require overcoming the sclerotic perspective of the foreign ministry mandarins. The response to Japan's North Korea initiative shows that much of the world will welcome Tokyo assuming such a leadership role. John Kerry should encourage that.
Kenneth Roth is executive director and Kanae Doi is the Japan director of Human Rights Watch.

HEADLINE: Austria, Under Pressure, Defends Bank Secrecy Rules

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY and JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
DUBLIN -- Austria will not yield to pressure to follow Luxembourg in dropping its banking secrecy rules, Finance Minister Maria Fekter said Friday, as she sought to portray Britain as one of the European Union's biggest tax havens. 
''Great Britain has many money-laundering centers and tax havens in its immediate legal remit,'' Ms. Fekter said, pointing to the Channel Islands, Gibraltar, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands. Those offshore financial centers are under effective British control, though all but Gibraltar remain technically outside of the European Union.
In a move that could raise pressure on Austria, Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, said on Friday that the bloc's 27 leaders would discuss the issue at a meeting next month.
''The current economic crisis only helps to stress the urgent need for fair and effective tax systems,'' Mr. Van Rompuy said in a statement broadcast on the Internet. Added pressure was placed after Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain announced plans to improve bank transparency in Europe and beyond.
In an opinion piece on Thursday in Kurier, an Austrian newspaper, Ms. Fekter called on the European Union to demand the same openness in financial matters of Britain as it had of Cyprus as a condition for the latter's bailout.
Ms. Fekter spoke in Dublin on Friday as euro zone finance ministers were beginning two days of meetings in which the subject of combating tax evasion was to be on the agenda. The European tax commissioner, Algirdas Semeta, has said that tax evasion costs European nations about 1 trillion euros, or $1.3 trillion, in lost revenue each year, and cash-poor governments are eager to track down their citizens' hidden assets.
Austria had been sending mixed messages on the topic, with its chancellor, Werner Faymann, suggesting recently that talks were possible. But Ms. Fekter was adamant on Friday, saying: ''Austria is sticking to bank secrecy.''
On Wednesday, Luxembourg bowed to pressure from its European partners after the collapse of Cyprus's financial sector and from the United States, which is demanding client data under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, and said it would start sharing banking information with other nations in 2015.
Luxembourg's decision left Austria as the only European Union member state to not share foreign clients' data with their home governments. Austria transfers to foreign account holders' home governments the proceeds of a 35 percent withholding tax on interest income earned in Austrian banks, but it does not disclose the clients' identities.
''We fight tax evasion and money laundering,'' Ms. Fekter said, but added, the ''automatic exchange of information involves a massive interference in people's privacy rights.''

HEADLINE: Gloom in Commodities Markets Ends a Rally

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A four-day rally in the stock market came to an end on Friday as signs of a slowing economy rattled commodity markets, weighing down energy and mining companies.
The price of crude oil dropped 2 percent, to $91 a barrel, as weak United States economic reports followed forecasts for diminished demand for oil.
Gold plunged $64, to $1,501 an ounce, reaching its lowest level since July 2011. 
One cause for the latest plunge was a government report that wholesale prices in the United States fell the most in 10 months in March. Traders tend to sell gold when inflation wanes. Traders also pushed gold prices lower on reports that Cyprus may sell some of its gold reserves, possibly prompting other weak European countries like Italy and Spain to do the same.
Compared with the commodities markets, the stock market looked stable. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped just 0.08 of a point to close at 14,865.06. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 4.52 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,588.85.
The two major indexes finished the week with strong gains: The Dow rose 2.1 percent, and the S.& P. 500 rose 2.3 percent.
David Joy, the chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial, said it was as if the stock market was telling a different story from the bond and commodity markets.
Copper and other industrial metals slid along with gold on Friday, while Treasury yields sank near their lows for the year. He said the moves implied that traders in those markets were more worried about an economic slowdown.
''It gives me pause,'' Mr. Joy said. ''Commodities and bonds are telling stock investors: don't be in such a hurry to say the U.S. economy is in great shape.''
The sharp drop in gold futures tugged down mining companies. Barrick Gold shares lost 8.5 percent, to $22.62, Newmont Mining stock fell 5.9 percent, to $36.37, and Freeport-McMoRan shares fell 2.7 percent, to $31.92.
Materials and energy stocks fell the most of the 10 industry groups in the S.& P. 500, with materials stocks down 1.5 percent and energy shares off 1.3 percent.
The Nasdaq composite dropped 5.21 points, to 3,294.95, a fall of 0.2 percent.
A handful of reports issued Friday heightened concerns. Sales at retailers fell in March, and companies restocked their shelves at a much slower pace in February than in the month before. That is usually a sign that companies expect weaker spending from consumers and businesses. A measure of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan also slumped.
Still, the stock market has held up well, leaving ''a lot of investors scratching their heads,'' said Lawrence Creatura, a fund manager at Federated Investors.
This earnings season will most likely determine which direction the market takes, Mr. Creatura said. Next week, when Bank of America, Google and other big names turn in their quarterly results, could make the difference.
Wells Fargo reported stronger quarterly profits on Friday, but its revenue fell short of Wall Street's forecasts. The bank's stock lost 0.8 percent, to $37.21.
Treasury yields were near their lows for the year. The yield on the 10-year note dropped to 1.72 percent, from 1.79 percent late Thursday. The low point of the year, 1.69 percent, was reached April 5. The price rose
21/32, to 102 17/32.

HEADLINE: China Must Exploit Its Shale Gas

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH MULLER. 
Elizabeth Muller is the co-founder and executive director of Berkeley Earth, a nonprofit research organization focused on climate change.

 BODY:
BEIJING
IF the Senate confirms the nomination of the M.I.T. scientist Ernest J. Moniz as the next energy secretary, as expected, he must use his new position to consider the energy situation not only in the United States, but in China as well.
Mr. Moniz, a professor of physics and engineering systems and the director of M.I.T.'s Energy Initiative, sailed through a confirmation hearing Tuesday before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
But some environmentalists are skeptical of Mr. Moniz. He is known for advocating natural gas and nuclear power as cleaner sources of energy than coal and for his support of hydraulic fracturing to extract natural gas from shale deposits. The environmental group Food and Water Watch has warned that as energy secretary, he ''could set renewable energy development back years.''
The criticism is misplaced. Instead of fighting hydraulic fracturing, environmental activists should recognize that the technique is vital to the broader effort to contain climate change and should be pushing for stronger standards and controls over the process.
Nowhere is this challenge and opportunity more pressing than in China. Exploiting its vast resources of shale gas is the only short-term way for China, the world's second-largest economy, to avoid huge increases in greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal.
China's greenhouse gas emissions are twice those of the United States and growing at 8 percent to 10 percent per year. Last year, China increased its coal-fired generating capacity by 50 gigawatts, enough to power a city that uses seven times the energy of New York City. By 2020, an analysis by Berkeley Earth shows, China will emit greenhouse gases at four times the rate of the United States, and even if American emissions were to suddenly disappear tomorrow, world emissions would be back at the same level within four years as a result of China's growth alone.
The only way to offset such an enormous increase in energy use is to help China switch from coal to natural gas. A modern natural gas plant emits between one-third and one-half of the carbon dioxide released by coal for the same amount of electric energy produced. China has the potential to unearth large amounts of shale gas through hydraulic fracturing. In 2011, the United States Energy Information Administration estimated that China had ''technically recoverable'' reserves of 1.3 quadrillion cubic feet, nearly 50 percent more than the United States.
The risk is that what is now a nascent Chinese shale gas industry may take off in a way that leads to ecological disaster. Many of the purchasers of drilling rights in recent Chinese auctions are inexperienced.
Opponents of this drilling method point to cases in which gas wells have polluted groundwater or released ''fugitive'' methane gas emissions. The groundwater issue is worrisome, of course, and weight for weight, methane has a global warming potential 25 to 70 times higher than carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas that results from the burning of coal.
Moving away from fossil fuels entirely may make sense in the United States, where we can potentially afford to pay for more expensive renewable sources of energy. But developing countries have other priorities, like improving the education and health of their people. Given the dangers that hydraulic fracturing poses for groundwater pollution and gas leaks, we must help China develop an approach that is environmentally sound.
Mr. Moniz has warned of the need to curb environmental damage from the process. But he has also stressed the value of natural gas as a ''bridging'' source of energy as we strive to move from largely dirty energy to clean energy. Extracting shale gas in an environmentally responsible way is technically achievable, according to engineering experts. Accomplishing that goal is primarily a matter of engineering and regulation.
That is where we need the engagement of environmental activists. At home, they can push the United States to set verifiable standards for clean hydraulic fracturing and enforce those standards through careful monitoring. Internationally, American industry can lead by showing that clean production can be profitable.
We need a solution for energy production that can displace the rapid growth of coal use today. Switching from coal to natural gas could reduce the growth of China's emissions by more than 50 percent and give the world more time to bring down the cost of solar and wind energy to levels that are affordable for poorer countries.

HEADLINE: U.S. Imposes Sanctions on Russians Accused of Human Rights Violations

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and ELLEN BARRY; Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Ellen Barry from Moscow.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States imposed new sanctions Friday on about two dozen Russians accused of human rights violations, and Moscow vowed to retaliate as a fractious dispute between the two countries escalated further into a cold war-style, tit-for-tat clash.
The Obama administration barred 18 Russians from traveling to the United States and froze any assets they may have here under a new law intended to punish human rights violations. A handful of other more highly placed officials, including the head of the Russian region of Chechnya, were put on a list not publicly revealed. Russian officials promised to ban a like number of Americans. 
The back and forth was reminiscent of the days when the two powers expelled equivalent numbers of diplomats to disrupt spy rings or signal displeasure, underscoring the depth of discontent just four years after President Obama resolved to reset the relationship. The dispute has already resulted in Moscow shutting down American adoptions of Russian orphans. The new sanctions came just days before Mr. Obama's national security adviser, Tom Donilon, travels to Moscow to try to smooth over the tension.
The public sanctions targeted largely midlevel officials but the classified list included Ramzan A. Kadyrov, the president of Chechnya, a Kremlin ally known as a ruthless ruler, according to people briefed on the list. Others on the secret list were figures of such prominence in Russia that the administration feared identifying them might invite retaliation by President Vladimir V. Putin against similarly situated American officials like members of Congress.
While critics were disappointed the scope was not more expansive, some called it a powerful statement of values and a first step in a broader effort to hold human rights abusers accountable.
''We've just crossed the threshold,'' said William F. Browder, once a prominent foreign investor in Russia who lobbied Congress to pass the law requiring sanctions after his lawyer died in a Moscow jail. ''This is the end of impunity. This is a historic moment and the United States has made a very strong statement about human rights abuses.''
Russia has assembled its own list of Americans to ban, dubbed by some the ''Guantnamo list,'' in reaction to Friday's move. ''We will respond to it, and the American side knows it,'' said Sergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister. ''The timing is bad.''
The move could undercut any good will engendered by an Obama administration decision to scale back missile defense in Europe. But there were signs the two sides hoped to keep the issue from escalating further. Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said the administration was ''very frank and candid'' with Moscow about human rights but ''we will engage with the Russians'' on other important matters.
Moscow evidently expected the American action to be tougher. The newspaper Kommersant reported that the government had identified 104 Americans to ban if necessary. Aleksei K. Pushkov, the hawkish head of a parliamentary international affairs committee, told the Interfax news agency that the Obama administration was ''taking the minimalist path'' to avoid a deeper political crisis before Mr. Donilon's visit.
Administration officials recognized that release of the list, required by Saturday under the law, would complicate Mr. Donilon's visit. But they decided to proceed with the trip anyway because Mr. Obama is to meet with Mr. Putin on the sidelines of an economic summit meeting in Northern Ireland in June and then travel to Russia in September.
Of the 18 Russians identified on the unclassified list, all but two are tied to the death of Sergei L. Magnitsky, the lawyer for Mr. Browder who was investigating official corruption only to be arrested and die in custody in 2009. His death became a cause clbre for Russia critics, and the American sanctions law was named for him.
Among those targeted Friday were investigators, tax officials, judges and prison supervisors connected to Mr. Magnitsky's case. The other two were Chechens implicated in prominent murders: Lecha Bogatirov, accused of gunning down Umar S. Israilov, a Chechen dissident, on the streets of Vienna in 2009, and Kazbek Dukuzov, accused of murdering the American journalist Paul Klebnikov in Moscow in 2004.
Many of those penalized were already barred from obtaining visas and it is not clear whether any of them have assets in the United States. Even so, Russians complained that the blacklist makes those on it pariahs and will make it hard for them to travel or invest in Europe.
''What is important for the Russian authorities is the fact that this list exists at all,'' said Aleksei Makarkin, an analyst at Moscow's Center for Political Technologies. ''For the first time, there is officially some number of Russian officials considered guilty of violating human rights.''
Elena A. Panfilova, director of Transparency International in Russia, said that the officials had plenty of time to transfer any vulnerable property, but that: ''It's all about sending a message. If you restrict somebody's rights, expect someone to restrict yours.''
American officials said the list was only the beginning. ''This is not a one-time-only act,'' said a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity. ''The law makes clear that additional names should be added as additional information becomes available.''
Even so, the list disappointed lawmakers and rights activists in Washington. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, called the announcement ''so damaging'' because the list was not robust enough. He vowed new legislation to go after abusers.
Representative Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, had sent the administration a list of 280 Russians compiled by Mr. Magnitsky's family for possible sanctions, including senior officials like Yuri Y. Chaika, the country's general prosecutor.
Lawmakers like Mr. McGovern wanted the administration to apply the sanctions to anyone about whom there was ''credible information'' on rights violations. But the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control required a higher degree of evidence normally used with economic sanctions, because if challenged in court, it will have to justify depriving people of assets.
''While the list is timid and features more significant omissions than names, I was assured by administration officials today that the investigation is ongoing,'' Mr. McGovern said.
David J. Kramer, president of Freedom House, an advocacy group, said he wished the list were longer but was encouraged that it went beyond the Magnitsky case. ''The key now is to keep this as an ongoing process by which more names can be added,'' he said.

HEADLINE: When Shareholder Democracy Is Sham Democracy

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, I argued that it was hard to imagine a more compelling case for ousting directors than the one posed by Hewlett-Packard.
It turns out there are many stronger cases -- 41.
That's the number of publicly traded companies where directors actually lost their elections last year, meaning that more than 50 percent of the shareholders withheld their votes of approval. Yet despite these resounding votes of no confidence, they remained in their posts.
At least at H.P., all the directors got a majority of the votes cast, and even then, two resigned and a third gave up his post as chairman. But at Cablevision Systems, the New York cable and media company controlled by the Dolan family, three directors lost shareholder elections twice in the last three years -- in 2010 and 2012 -- and received only tepid support in 2011. Nonetheless, the three remain on the board.
''As fiduciaries, we can't sit by and let the board make a mockery of our fundamental right to elect directors,'' said New York City's comptroller, John Liu, who oversees the city's pension funds, which own more than 532,000 Cablevision shares. ''Share owners need accountable directors who will ensure the company isn't being run for the benefit of insiders at our expense.'' 
Mr. Liu sent the company a letter earlier this month urging it not to nominate the three again and threatening a proxy fight. ''The fact that all three directors remain on the board suggests that one of the few rights'' afforded shareholders is ''illusory,'' he wrote. Mr. Liu warned that he'd oppose their election and that ''my office will also encourage other shareholders to join us.''
Mr. Liu didn't get a response, but a Cablevision spokesman told me this week, without being specific, that Mr. Liu's letter was ''woefully misinformed, inaccurate and political.'' In proxy materials released by Cablevision this week, all three directors -- Thomas V. Reifenheiser, John R. Ryan and Vincent S. Tese -- were renominated for new terms.
Even directors who resign after losing votes don't necessarily leave. Two directors of Chesapeake Energy in Oklahoma, V. Burns Hargis, president of Oklahoma State University, and Richard K. Davidson, the former chief executive of Union Pacific, were opposed by more than 70 percent of the shareholders in 2012. Chesapeake requires directors receiving less than majority support to tender their resignations, which they did. The company said it would ''review the resignations in due course.''
It later said that the board declined to accept Mr. Hargis's resignation, a decision made with the ''input'' of the activist shareholder Carl Icahn and another large shareholder who had voted against Mr. Hargis. (Mr. Davidson left a month after the vote, but Mr. Hargis left only last month.)
At Iris International, a medical diagnostics company based in Chatsworth, Calif., shareholders rejected all nine directors in May 2011. In keeping with the company's policy, they submitted their resignations. And then they voted not to accept them. The nine stayed on the board. (The company was acquired in late 2012 by the Danaher Corporation.)
A list of companies retaining directors who were rejected by shareholders in 2012 -- so-called zombie directors -- was compiled by the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents pension funds, endowments and other large investors. The list includes not just smaller, family-controlled companies, where disdain for shareholder views may be more ingrained, but also Loral Space and Communications, Mentor Graphics, Boston Beer Company and Vornado Realty Trust.
''It's appalling,'' Nell Minow, a co-founder of GMI Ratings, which rates companies based on risk to shareholders, including corporate governance issues, told me this week. ''It's the No. 1 issue in corporate governance.'' She noted that the reason such a thing was possible was that many companies operate under a ''plurality'' voting system, in which directors run unopposed and just one vote is enough to be elected. And even companies that require a majority vote may decline to accept a director's resignation.
That an electoral system unworthy of Soviet-era sham democracies is flourishing today in corporate America is largely thanks to the management- and director-friendly policies of Delaware, where more than half of United States companies are incorporated and where the corporate franchise tax contributes disproportionately to the state's revenue. State law controls board governance, and Delaware has long tolerated plurality voting. The Delaware Supreme Court has also affirmed the power of boards to reject the resignations of directors who fail to gain a majority of votes.
''We've had lengthy correspondence suggesting they change this,'' Amy Borrus, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors, told me. ''We've even provided the wording to make it easier. Nothing happens.''
Ms. Minow agreed. ''Delaware is a race to the bottom,'' she said. ''There's no benefit to doing anything friendly to shareholders.'' The only state, she said, that bars plurality voting is North Dakota -- and it's no coincidence that no major company is incorporated there.
A spokesman for the Delaware secretary of state's office, which oversees the division of corporations, didn't have any comment.
Defenders of plurality voting have typically argued that majority voting or elections that would be binding might be destabilizing or disrupt continuity. But ''that's simply to say that democracy is destabilizing,'' Ms. Minow said. ''Continuity is exactly what shareholders voting against directors do not want. That's why they're withholding their votes.''
Shareholders of Cablevision, which is incorporated in Delaware, have plenty of reason to be disgruntled: over the last two years, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has rallied to a new high, Cablevision shares have dropped from more than $36 a share to under $15, where they were trading this week. (During that period, Cablevision spun off Madison Square Garden and AMC Networks to shareholders, which the company said would add about $16 to the share price.) Yet Cablevision's chief executive, James Dolan, earned $16.9 million last year, and his father, Charles, earned $16.6 million as chairman -- an unusually high amount for a chairman who is not serving as chief executive. Both payments were about 50 percent higher than the year before. In addition to their compensation, the two Dolans get a full-time car and driver as well as access to a helicopter and jet for personal use. Institutional Shareholder Services noted there was a ''disconnect'' at the company between performance and executive pay.
Mr. Tese, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Reifenheiser make up the compensation committee of the board, which approves the Dolans' compensation.
Mr. Tese, a former chief executive of the New York State Urban Development Corporation and former director of economic development for New York State, was also Bear Stearns's lead director before its collapse in 2008 and served on its finance and risk committee. ''Given the significant lack of oversight provided by Mr. Tese during his tenure at Bear, particularly in the area of risk management, we believe he should not continue to serve on any public company board,'' the proxy advisory service Glass, Lewis & Company said last year. Mr. Tese is a member of four boards, including that of Madison Square Garden, which was spun off by Cablevision and is also controlled by the Dolan family.
Mr. Ryan and Mr. Reifenheiser were both members of a special committee that approved an ill-fated proposed buyout of the company by the Dolans in 2007. Independent shareholders blocked the deal on grounds that the Dolans' offer was self-serving and too low. ''Its improvident support by the special committee is among the reasons we have lost confidence in Messrs. Reifenheiser and Ryan,'' Mr. Liu wrote in his recent letter to the company.
Last year, Cablevision paid Mr. Tese $233,967, Mr. Ryan $247,508 and Mr. Reifenheiser $220,786 in cash and stock, according to the company's proxy statement.
Cablevision declined to make any of the directors available for comment, but Charles R. Schueler, a spokesman for the company, said, ''These directors have each provided more than a decade of service to the company's board, and they are widely well regarded for their independent insight, vast experience, as well as their sound counsel.''
Last year, both Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis recommended that shareholders vote against the three. Mr. Tese received the support of just 45.4 percent of shareholders, which is an abysmal showing by the standards of shareholder democracy. Mr. Reifenheiser and Mr. Ryan each received 46.6 percent. After the vote, the Council of Institutional Investors wrote a letter to Cablevision insisting that the three step down and urging Cablevision to adopt majority voting for director elections. The council didn't get any response.
''We give Cablevision an F for corporate governance,'' Ms. Minow said, ''and if there were a lower grade we'd give it to them. The Dolans run Cablevision like a private company, and anyone who thinks they're interested in shareholders hasn't been paying attention.''
Cablevision's Mr. Schueler responded that the directors ''were elected because they received the most votes,'' adding: ''Cablevision has been a family-controlled company since it was founded 40 years ago. Our shareholders have always been aware that Cablevision is a controlled company. The company rules clearly indicate that the director nominees who receive the most votes are elected to the board.''
Even though shareholders nominally own companies, it seems appalling that they can't even elect a board of their choosing. That's unlikely to change as long as plurality voting prevails. As Ms. Borrus put it: ''Why even bother to have an election? It's just a rubber stamp for what the board wants.''

HEADLINE: Japan in Deal To Join Talks On Trade Pact

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Japan and the United States agreed on Friday on a deal that paves the way for Tokyo to join talks on an Asia-Pacific free trade agreement, increasing the economic weight of the proposed pact and bringing a loud protest from American automakers. 
The deal brings Japan closer to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the United States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Australia and New Zealand hope to finish this year.
''I think Japan's national interests are protected under this U.S.-Japan agreement,'' Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday.
Mr. Abe, who took office in December, is making the regional free trade pact a keystone of his strategy to open Japan's economy and spur long-sought growth.
President Obama's administration sees the pact as part of an economic rebalancing toward Asia. The agreement got a chilly reaction from Detroit automakers, which have lost substantial market share to Japanese competitors over the decades.
Separately, the Obama administration on Friday put Japan on notice that it was watching its economic policies to ensure they were not aimed at devaluing the yen to gain a competitive advantage. In a semiannual report on currency practices of major trade partners, the United States also said China's currency remained ''significantly undervalued,'' but again stopped short of labeling the country a currency manipulator.
It has been more than 18 years since the Treasury has designated any country a manipulator. China was labeled a manipulator between 1992 and 1994.

HEADLINE: Tasting Good Life, Opposition In Zimbabwe Slips Off Pedestal

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
HARARE, Zimbabwe -- The guests arrived in Bentleys, Benzes and BMWs. At a plush, riverside wedding in an upscale suburb, the wine and spirits flowed and tables groaned with the ample buffet. Politicians, celebrities, diplomats and business leaders mingled to the strains of Oliver Mtukudzi, a Zimbabwean music star, serenading the happy couple with his famous love song ''Svovi Yangu.''
This was not the wedding of some stalwart of the dominant party that has ruled this mineral-rich nation for decades. Instead, the 60-year-old groom was a one-time labor organizer,Morgan Tsvangirai, the longstanding opposition leader and now prime minister in a once uneasy but increasingly comfortable unity government with PresidentRobert Mugabe.
''I couldn't believe my eyes,'' said Misheck Shoko, a member of Parliament for Mr. Tsvangirai's party, the Movement for Democratic Change. ''It must have cost a fortune. We cannot help but wonder: who paid the bill?'' 
As Zimbabwe prepares to choose a new president this year in long-awaited elections, voters are increasingly questioning the erstwhile opposition, the only serious challenger to the tight grip Mr. Mugabe and his party, ZANU-PF, have held on this nation for decades.
Mr. Tsvangirai's underdog movement has long been the vessel of millions of Zimbabweans' hopes for a more democratic, peaceful and prosperous future in what was once one of Africa's most stable and wealthy nations. But four years of governing alongside Mr. Mugabe -- and in some ways, analysts say, being co-opted by him and his allies -- has taken a toll on its reputation.
The disenchantment was evident in a survey last year conducted for Freedom House, a watchdog group based in the United States, that found support for Mr. Tsvangirai's party had fallen to 20 percent from 38 percent two years earlier among voters who declared a preference. By contrast, support for ZANU-PF -- the party that clung to power by beating, torturing and intimidating thousands in the last election in 2008 -- grew to 31 percent last year from 17 percent in 2010, the survey found, though some analysts noted that an unusually high number of people declined to respond, probably out of fear.
Mr. Tsvangirai rocketed to fame as the courageous leader of a party that dared to challenge the rule of Mr. Mugabe, who has led this country since independence in 1980. Photographs of him beaten and bleeding from the head in 2007 galvanized global opinion against Mr. Mugabe's brutal reign.
But these days, Mr. Tsvangirai's lifestyle has been the talk of a nation where millions live on $2 a day. He has taken to traveling abroad with a sizable entourage, officials and analysts say, honeymooning in London and spending holidays in Monaco. He recently moved into a government residence that cost about $3 million to build.
His party entered the power-sharing government in 2009, after disastrous elections in which Mr. Tsvangirai won the most votes but withdrew from a runoff because of the violence meted out against his followers. Hundreds of people were killed in the crackdown. In a deal hammered out with Zimbabwe's neighbors, Mr. Tsvangiriai became prime minister, and the two parties agreed to share power.
In practice, Mr. Tsvangirai's party has had almost no authority to change the fundamental structure of Zimbabwe. The army and police forces remained under Mr. Mugabe's control. Mr. Tsvangirai's party held ministries controlling the economy and social services, both of which have improved, but it has struggled to transform the architecture of Mr. Mugabe's security state.
Meanwhile, officials in Mr. Tsvangirai's party, many of whom suffered poverty while fighting to remake Zimbabwe, began enjoying the trappings of power. Government ministers, members of Parliament and other officials were awarded fancy cars and travel allowances. Mr. Tsvangirai traded his trade-unionist leather jacket for tailored suits.
His personal life has been a source of embarrassment as well. His wife Susan died in a car accident in 2009, and his romantic life since has been the subject of extensive news coverage, much to his party's chagrin. When he was planning to marry Elizabeth Macheka, his current wife, another woman challenged, claiming that she had been married to Mr. Tsvangirai in a traditional ceremony in 2011.
The matter ended up in court, with a magistrate ruling that Mr. Tsvangirai was in fact already married under customary law. He was forced to cancel plans for a legal wedding, and instead called the ceremony last September a celebration.
Another woman also filed court papers, claiming that she and Mr. Tsvangirai had been engaged. Mr. Tsvangirai did not respond to repeated interview requests, but he apologized publicly to supporters for his messy search for a new wife, saying: ''I had no intention to hurt anyone. It was a genuine search.''
Other problems have erupted. In Chitungwiza, a stronghold of Mr. Tsvangirai's party, a corruption scandal has engulfed the City Council. Elected officials stand accused of selling access to hundreds of pieces of city-controlled land for about $4,000 per plot and pocketing most of the money.
Council members from Mr. Tsvangirai's party, with the help of their former adversaries, parceled off soccer fields, playgrounds, wetlands and areas set aside for schools and churches. Land in Chitungwiza is not privately owned; individuals and businesses lease it from the government. But there is a long waiting list, and bribes to city councilors helped people jump the line.
For many, the painful irony is that thousands were pushed out of Chitungwiza by Mr. Mugabe's government in a 2005 demolition campaign to eviscerate opposition strongholds. Hundreds of homes and businesses were destroyed, and today housing is scarce and expensive. City employees are supposed to receive land for houses, but many are waiting -- and officials from Mr. Tsvangirai's party are now accused of profiting from the misfortune.
Never Tarugarira, a janitor and handyman at a community center, has been on a waiting list since 2005, but his number has never come up. So he rents two tiny, fetid rooms for $100 a month, eating up much of his paycheck -- that is, when he gets one. He has not been paid for the past five months because of the city's fiscal woes.
''Some nights we go to sleep without eating,'' he said.
Alice Chihambakwe, another Chitungwiza resident waiting years for a plot, says her husband goes to work every day at the city's sewer plant, but has not been paid in months. Two of her children had to postpone crucial high school exams because the family could not pay the fees, about $30 per child.
''Our lives are on hold,'' Ms. Chihambakwe said, weeping softly.
The councilors proved easy marks for corrupt bureaucrats from Mr. Mugabe's party, said Amos Matanhike, a former town clerk in Chitungwiza.
''The problem is that most of the M.D.C. councilors are very young,'' Mr. Matanhike said. ''They did not have houses, they owned no property. So these youngsters took that opportunity, and they got onto the gravy train.''
Once it got wind of the scandal, Mr. Tsvangirai's party tried to take action, firing the councilors involved. But the minister for local government, a ZANU-PF appointee, vetoed the dismissals, so the councilors remain.
Critics say the former opposition party has been nave, falling into a trap set by Mr. Mugabe to co-opt and compromise them.
''Old Bob must be chuckling and enjoying himself right now,'' said Munyaradzi Gwisai, a prominent activist. ''He has them right where he wants them.''
Nelson Chamisa, a top official with the Movement for Democratic Change, says Mr. Tsvangirai remains the best hope for change in Zimbabwe.
''He is the next big thing in Zimbabwe,'' Mr. Chamisa said. ''He is the only game in town.''
He called Mr. Tsvangirai's ceremony ''a basic wedding'' and that he deserved sympathy after the tragic death of his previous wife.
''At times people are very harsh and unkind to a very noble man,'' Mr. Chamisa said.
Asked who paid for the wedding, Mr. Chamisa said, ''There are many people who wish him well.''

HEADLINE: Tax Disincentives for Working Moms

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The attitudes described in ''How the I.R.S. Hurts Mothers,'' by Lilian V. Faulhaber (Op-Ed, April 4), are precisely those that keep women from ''leaning in.'' The notion that a wife should not go back to work if her individual salary does not justify the expense of child care is wrongheaded.
When my husband and I were starting our careers and family, I was making less than he was, but we did not calculate whether it made economic sense for both of us to work based on my salary alone. We recognized that the expense of child care was an investment in both of our careers, and one that would enable us jointly to achieve a certain level of income and support our family. The result: We both invested in our future by working. Eventually, my annual income exceeded his. 
If women take themselves off the career track based on whether, early in their careers, child care costs eat up a significant portion of the family's income, they will never achieve income parity or career success.
AMY SABRIN Washington, April 4, 2013
To the Editor:
Lilian V. Faulhaber would have the government provide better tax breaks to subsidize paid child care for dual-income families. She does not propose any subsidy at all, however, for families who forgo the second income to allow a parent to care for children. While the two-earner families usually pay more tax than single-income families, and pay for child care, they still typically have more money at the end of the day. Unlike the two-earner families, single-income families do not get subsidies from tax credits or dependent care spending accounts.
If the purpose is to ease the financial burden of child care, eligibility for subsidies should depend on total family income, and subsidies should not be reserved only for those who hire outsiders to do the job.
RICHARD K. BETTS New York, April 4, 2013
To the Editor:
Lilian V. Faulhaber proposes allowing child care expenses to be treated as business expenses to make the decision to work more economically favorable for mothers. She also suggests that this proposal is unlikely to gain support in the current budget climate. I believe there is much more promise.
Today many providers of child care (and other domestic service) are paid under the table. They avoid taxes, but are also left out of benefits such as state disability. Providing a real tax advantage to the employer will move many of these providers into the tax system -- increasing revenues.
Another benefit is that reducing the cost of child care (by making it deductible) will create more demand for these services. Mothers (and fathers!) are job creators.
Not treating child care as a business expense is illogical. If I take a client to dinner at a fine restaurant, the meal is deductible. Why isn't the baby sitter who allows me to go?
JOE LICHY San Jose, Calif., April 4, 2013
To the Editor:
Lilian V. Faulhaber factors child care expenses for two-parent families as being paid solely out of the mother's salary. I say this is a family expense, and the cost should be split between the mother's and father's salaries.
Also, there are other benefits that mothers gain from employment besides salary that are valuable to themselves, their families and their careers; the I.R.S. cannot touch these.

HEADLINE: Focus on Dairy Farmers in Immigration Debate

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
PERRY, N.Y. -- When the letter arrived at Jeff True's dairy farm here in western New York, it was, he recalled, ''like getting sucker punched right in the gut.''
A federal audit had found that 12 of his 14 workers were immigrants who had provided Mr. True with false work documents, the letter said. The immigration authorities ordered him to dismiss those workers.
Mr. True, whose family has been dairy farming for two centuries, scrambled around the clock with his relatives to milk their 1,100 cows, hire and train new workers and keep the farm in business.
Most of his workers are immigrants from Latin America, and he now dreads that he could receive another letter at any moment. 
''My biggest fear is my labor is not going to be here tomorrow,'' he said. ''Most of us live in fear of that every day.''
The struggles of the dairy industry in western and central New York, one of the nation's leading dairy regions, have become an unlikely focus of the national debate over immigration policy. Delegations of local farmers, including Mr. True, have made trips to Washington to lobby for an expansion of the guest-worker program for agriculture, or the creation of a new one, to help ensure a reliable supply of labor.
Dairy farmers are generally not able to hire foreign workers through the existing guest-worker program for agriculture because it is only for seasonal workers, and milk production is year-round.
A bipartisan group of senators negotiating a comprehensive immigration reform bill have struggled with the details of an agricultural workers program. Late Friday, however, they announced they had reached an agreement over terms of the program. Officials involved in the talks said the dairy industry's concerns were addressed in the deal.
Still, the farmers said they were preparing for a lengthy fight in Congress before the proposals become reality.
Besides their hiring problems, the farmers here say that they have also come under growing scrutiny from the immigration authorities.
While the states bordering Mexico typically draw most of the attention in the discussion over illegal immigration, the Obama administration has also stepped up enforcement along the Canadian border. At the same time, the administration has shifted its strategy of curbing illegal employment from an emphasis on workplace raids to subtler tactics like audits of employment records.
While the heightened enforcement has been felt throughout the agricultural communities of upstate New York, the dairy farmers said this pressure had been acute for them because their farms are concentrated close to the border. Under the law, agents from the federal Customs and Border Protection agency can patrol within 100 miles of any border.
The farmers said labor was a primary obstacle to the expansion of the dairy industry in New York, the fourth largest in the nation, with 610,000 milk cows. Lack of workers, they said, was threatening their ability to meet rising demand, caused in part by the booming yogurt industry, which has benefited from the popularity of Greek-style yogurt.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has championed the industry, noting that the number of yogurt plants in New York has more than doubled since 2000.
The farmers have warned that if they are not able to boost milk production, yogurt manufacturers will go out of state for milk.
''Politically, it's going to look bad,'' Mr. True said.
Mr. Cuomo sent a letter last week to members of the state's Congressional delegation, urging them to support the creation of a new guest-worker program for the dairy industry.
The bipartisan Senate group is expected to present draft legislation next week.
Negotiations over agricultural workers were slowed by disagreements over wages and the number of visas. But Craig J. Regelbrugge, co-chairman of the Agriculture Coalition for Immigration Reform, which has been involved in the talks, said the agricultural agreement reached Friday would set up a new guest-worker program that would include year-round dairy workers.
The visa terms ''will accommodate the year-round employment situation for dairy,'' Mr. Regelbrugge said.
Like agriculture in general, most dairy farms rely on newly arrived foreign-born workers because United States citizens simply do not want these jobs, farmers and industry officials said.
Julie C. Suarez, public policy director for the New York Farm Bureau, said the native-born population that once provided the bulk of the farm labor in upstate New York -- high-school graduates between ages 18 and 30 -- ''have been leaving in droves.''
She added, ''They don't really exist where we live anymore.''
Dan Wolf, 65, who runs a dairy farm in Lyons, N.Y., founded by his wife's grandfather in 1929, said that even during the recent recession, only one American citizen came looking for work -- ''and he wanted a job driving a truck.''
Some critics of the farmers' reform proposals said there was an obvious solution to the apparent shortfall in legal laborers: better wages.
''They say that it wouldn't work, but we haven't seen any evidence that they've actually tried,'' said Eric Ruark, director of research for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a national group seeking to reduce immigration.
Farmers contended that they already paid decent wages. A 2009 Cornell University survey found that ''experienced'' employees were paid an average of nearly $10 per hour -- plus, for the majority of workers, some benefits.
Higher wages, farmers said, would eliminate thin profit margins and would still not attract the quality of worker they needed.
Dairy farmers in upstate New York said in interviews that they did not knowingly hire immigrants without work authorization. If laborers present documents that seem legitimate, they can be hired, the farmers said.
Most dairy workers upstate who are originally from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America did not enter the country through Canada, laborers and their advocates said. They immigrated along traditional routes -- via Arizona, California or Texas -- and then made their way across the country.
In recent years, scores of immigrants in upstate agricultural communities have been detained and deported after being questioned at road blocks or in random traffic stops, advocates and laborers said.
''When you go out in the street, you're really careful, remain alert and make no mistakes,'' said a dairy worker in western New York, who was in the country illegally and requested that most identifying details be withheld for fear that he and his employer could be traced.
The worker, who is Mexican, lives with his wife and young children in a rented trailer in a remote rural area, where he settled nine years ago. He recently changed jobs, and now works six days a week and as many as 15 hours a day, for $8.25 an hour, without overtime pay.
''You get accustomed to it,'' he said during an interview at his home, ''because there is no other work for us.''
Immigrants who had worked in other states said they never operated under the kind of enforcement pressure that exists in the agricultural regions near the Canadian border.
''In Indiana and Omaha, it was easy to travel -- you'd see the police and say, 'Hello!' '' recalled a 67-year-old agricultural worker from Mexico now living in Sodus, N.Y. He would give only his first name, Blas.
He said the pressure was so intense that he was considering returning to his former job on a corn-packing assembly line in Nebraska, where there were fewer worries about the immigration authorities. Some farmers, too, said they had been thinking about a shift from dairy, or at least from the border regions, if Congress did not help them.
Matt Lamb said his family's 6,000-cow dairy operation, based in Oakfield, N.Y., had been subjected to two crippling immigration audits in the past three years. He said he envied dairy farmers outside border regions.
''The Pennsylvania farmers don't have a clue what I'm talking about,'' he said. ''They say, 'Immigration who?' ''

HEADLINE: Early in Mayoral Battle, Carriage Horses Are Drawn Into Race

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
As a political issue, it has legs. Four legs.
A surprising flash point -- animal rights -- has erupted in the early weeks of the race for New York City mayor, complete with boldface endorsers, voluble protests, and a generously financed attack ad.
New York's animals, from Central Park horses to rescue shelter dogs, have one of the city's most clamorous lobbying groups, with thousands of motivated supporters and celebrity champions like Alec Baldwin, Lea Michele and Gloria Steinem.
And in a robust show of political muscle, a group of horse lovers is helping to back the first major advertising buy of the 2013 race: a $1 million attack on Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, who, despite being a dog lover, has been a longtime target of animal rights advocates because of her support for horse-drawn carriages in Central Park.
Ms. Quinn's rivals in the Democratic primary have taken notice. Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, has promised that on his first day in City Hall, if elected, he would ban the famous carriages. He described the conditions of the horses, which have trotted through Central Park for decades, as ''inhumane.'' 
On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio stood before dozens of self-proclaimed animal lovers at an Upper West Side fund-raiser hosted by the famed Pop artist Peter Max. Mr. de Blasio pledged to pursue a bill requiring sprinkler systems in pet stores.
''He just gets animal cruelty,'' said Mary Max, the wife of the artist and a director of the Humane Society of the United States. ''This isn't somebody who we have to convince.'' By night's end, Mr. de Blasio, who has not owned a pet since childhood, had raised thousands of dollars for his campaign.
Animals also cropped up last week at a candidate forum in Brooklyn, where one of the fiercest exchanges of the evening had to do not with policing tactics or affordable housing, but instead the fate of abandoned animals in the city's shelter system.
Ms. Quinn -- who walks Justin and Sadie, the Labrador mixes she owns with her spouse, Kim Catullo, on the sidewalks of Chelsea nearly every morning -- earned loud applause by pledging to seek a ''no-kill'' policy for the city's shelters and by noting that she had helped pass laws that increased financing for animal care.
''As the owner of two shelter dogs, that's something I feel very deeply about moving toward,'' she said.
But not every candidate was sure what to make of the issue. Sal F. Albanese, a former city councilman, appeared mystified as to why everybody was talking about animals in the first place.
''Bill says on the first day he's going to ban horse carriages,'' Mr. Albanese said. ''I'm worried about creating jobs on my first day.''
For a cute, if disenfranchised, constituency, animals have long played an outsize role in the city's political process -- sometimes as a heartstring-tugging front for moneyed municipal interests like real estate, labor, and big business.
The attack ads against Ms. Quinn, for instance, were paid for in part by Steve Nislick, a wealthy parking garage magnate who founded an anti-horse-carriage group that has clashed with the Council speaker. The group recently began donating thousands of dollars to Mr. de Blasio's campaign.
Mr. Nislick, whose wife has also contributed to Mr. de Blasio, joined forces with a labor group and Wendy Neu, a wealthy Manhattan businesswoman who is active in animal rights causes, to found the anti-Quinn coalition that bought the ad. The coalition has declined to disclose its full list of donors.
Some critics have suggested that Mr. Nislick wants to ban the carriages so he can buy the horse stables, which are on valuable land along Manhattan's West Side. A spokesman for Mr. Nislick said he had ''no interest in the stables whatsoever.''
Ms. Quinn, like her ally Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, has defended the Central Park carriages, saying they employ 300 people and are a valuable source of jobs at a time when unemployment remains stubbornly high. As speaker, she has sought to improve conditions for the horses by supporting the passage of a bill that requires bigger stalls and heavy blankets for the horses.
But the carriages have already proved politically problematic for Ms. Quinn. Last year, she rebuked the industry after the tennis star Martina Navratilova complained that a carriage driver had used antigay and racist slurs, an incident captured on video. And Ms. Steinem, who this week endorsed Ms. Quinn for mayor, noted that the speaker's support for the carriage horse industry was a lingering area of disagreement between them.
Sensing a vulnerability for Ms. Quinn, Mr. de Blasio has seized on the issue, arguing that the picturesque rides -- memorialized on ''Sex and the City'' and ''Seinfeld'' -- are a form of animal cruelty and should be shut down. The carriages operate in Midtown traffic, and there are periodic collisions between carriages and motor vehicles, with some resulting in injury.
The de Blasio campaign has tried to drum up interest from animal rights supporters by creating a hashtag on Twitter, #AnimalLoversforBdB, and posting a photograph of Roland, a staff member's terrier, posing with a ''de Blasio for Mayor'' placard.
''I grew up with the romantic notion that this was part of New York City culture,'' Mr. de Blasio said. ''I had not really thought honestly about the ramifications of it.''
Could his recent embrace of the issue be considered opportunistic? ''This has been an organic process about understanding what needs to change,'' Mr. de Blasio replied.
One New York political official said he viewed Mr. de Blasio's actions in a different light. ''He's at the buffet table, and he's looking to see what stuff Chris is not eating,'' said the official, who is unaffiliated with any campaign but insisted on anonymity so as not to offend Mr. De Blasio.
Motivations aside, it may be hard for Ms. Quinn to ignore the ire of her opponents: Animal rights activists affiliated with Mr. Nislick's group staged a protest outside her Midtown Manhattan office on Thursday, chanting ''Anybody but Quinn.''
Several of the protesters described themselves as single-issue voters, and many said they welcomed Mr. de Blasio's interest in their cause. Carlos Rodriguez, a film editor who attended the rally with Cliff, his miniature pinscher, said he was now promoting Mr. de Blasio to his 900 Facebook friends, almost all of whom he said lived in New York.
Still, Mr. Rodriguez conceded he was well aware of the gamesmanship in politics.
''You know how they are -- politicians say one thing and then they change it completely,'' he said. ''We have to take the lesser of two evils.''
As for the carriage industry itself, the political fuss can be frustrating. Steve Malone, a spokesman for the Horse and Carriage Association of New York, an owners' trade group, said he could not quite understand how horses were suddenly a campaign issue.
''How they tie it in is still beyond me,'' Mr. Malone said of the mayoral candidates. ''They're the ones who drag us into the middle of it.''
''Believe me,'' Mr. Malone added, ''the carriage industry wants to be as far away from the New York City mayor's race as possible.''

HEADLINE: Signs of Easier Money for Mortgages

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
What was so unusual about Phillip Ratliff's experience in getting approval for his first mortgage was that it wasn't difficult at all -- even though he could afford a down payment of only 5 percent.
In the years after the housing bubble burst, borrowers had to practically promise their firstborn child to secure a mortgage.
And while the requirements are still pretty rigorous, particularly for those with less than perfect credit, there are signs that at least some regional lenders and mortgage insurers are beginning to ease up. Some regional banks and credit unions are even offering products that vaguely resemble the more aggressive financing that became all too common during the boom days and eventually got many borrowers into trouble.
The piggyback loan, for instance, is back, mortgage lenders and brokers said. That is when borrowers take out two mortgages simultaneously (or a mortgage and a line of credit) so they can avoid the private mortgage insurance required on traditional mortgages for more than 80 percent of the home's value. 
And some credit unions, including Navy Federal and NASA Federal Credit Union, are offering 100 percent financing, at least in markets where home values have stabilized and appear to be on the upswing. U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo said they still allowed borrowers to use piggyback loans.
The big difference this time, lenders and mortgage brokers say, is that the loans are not being made to just anyone but to borrowers who can afford to pay them back (at least for now).
''This is all good news for consumers,'' said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. ''We are starting to see some loosening, but it's very specific. It's just in its infancy now, and it's not the type of piggyback loans or low down payment loans that we saw before.''
And while there were clearly too many confusingly complex loans offered to too many unqualified borrowers at the height of the housing boom, what is being offered now seems reasonable, Mr. Cecala said. How far the lenders will eventually go to stand out from the competition remains to be seen. ''The real question,'' he said, ''is, Will they be any more dangerous than what we've seen before?''
Lenders are beginning to be more accepting of merely average loan candidates, in certain circumstances. According to Mr. Cecala, traditional mortgages in the last several years were largely made to people with down payments of at least 20 percent and a strong average credit score of 760.
''That is phenomenally tough underwriting,'' he said. ''Now, what you are seeing is that lenders are willing to tinker with one element at a time. So if someone is putting at least 20 percent down, they will go down to 720. And if someone has a 760 or a 780 credit score, they might be willing to go up to a 95 percent'' financing, he added, referring to a mortgage for 95 percent of the home's value.
After 2008, many borrowers with little money to put down, and decent but not perfect credit, had little choice but to look to the Federal Housing Administration. The F.H.A., which does not make loans but insures mortgages that meet its guidelines, filled the hole left by the more traditional lenders: it extended credit to people who had as little as 3.5 percent to put down and spotty credit scores. As a result, the number of new mortgages originated by the F.H.A. ballooned.
But now, mortgage lenders and brokers say, more homeowners with smaller down payments are able to use private mortgage insurance. That is because the private insurers, which imposed even stricter qualifying standards than some banks during the housing downturn, are also becoming a bit more flexible. At the same time, the F.H.A. has been significantly increasing its fees over the last couple of years to shore up its finances and encourage more traditional lending again .
''We were frequently in the position where we could underwrite the loan but we couldn't find the mortgage insurance,'' said Brian Thielicke, a partner and senior loan officer at Cobalt Mortgage in Tukwila, Wash. ''Now, it's completely gone the other way.''
Mr. Ratliff, a 27-year-old software tester, said he had no real trouble getting a mortgage for the four-bedroom house in Seattle that he bought for $325,000. He got a 30-year mortgage with a fixed rate of 3.5 percent.
''There was money out there if you had the credit,'' Mr. Ratliff said, adding that he had a good credit score. Finding an affordable first home proved the hard part, since there were so many other buyers to compete with and few homes in his price range.
He was able to make a down payment of 5 percent, or about $16,000, because he obtained private mortgage insurance. He borrowed another $15,000 or so from his 401(k) to cover closing and other costs, including the insurance. (He paid $5,800 upfront so he could avoid monthly insurance payments.) His overall monthly payments, about $1,700 and another $200 for the 401(k) loan, will be only slightly more than what he paid in rent.
It appears that more borrowers are taking out mortgages similar to Mr. Ratliff's. Fannie Mae acknowledged, in its 2012 annual report, that it was buying more mortgages where the loan amounts were higher relative to the homes' values. Part of the reason was that the mortgage insurance companies reduced their premiums for loans with higher credit scores (the average credit score on the Fannie loans purchased was still strong at 755) and F.H.A. loans had become more expensive.
Fees on F.H.A.-backed mortgages have been inching higher for several years. Borrowers must pay an upfront mortgage premium of 1.75 percent of the loan amount, which can be rolled into the mortgage. But as of April 1, another fee, the annual mortgage insurance premium, rose to 1.35 percent from 1.25 percent of the loan, which is broken down into monthly payments. And while this monthly mortgage premium was typically canceled once the mortgage amount fell to less than 78 percent of the original loan value (after a minimum of five years), starting in June, the insurance must generally be paid for the life of the loan.
''This will be the game changer for many future borrowers,'' said Rick Cason, a branch manager at Integrity Mortgage in Orlando, Fla. ''No one is going to want to take a loan out where mortgage insurance is guaranteed for the life of the loan. You would simply have to be forced into it because there were no other financing options available and you were desperate.'' (Private mortgage insurance can be canceled once the loan amount is less than 80 percent of the home's value.)
Some lenders, including credit unions, are making more flexible loans that they are keeping in their own portfolio. Navy Federal, for instance, is offering members up to 100 percent financing without requiring private mortgage insurance, though the loans carry a slightly higher interest rate, about 4.125 percent for borrowers with good credit histories. (The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.43 percent for the week ending April 11, along with a fee of 0.8 percent of the mortgage amount, according to Freddie Mac.)''Even through the recession, our mortgages performed very well,'' said Jack Gaffney, executive vice president of lending at Navy Federal.
NASA Federal Credit Union -- which is open to many consumers, not just NASA employees -- is offering some members with strong credit and income up to 100 percent financing, without mortgage insurance, for primary homes in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, all markets it says are on the rebound.
As for the big banks, many of them said they continued to offer mortgages with low down payments. Bank of America said it allowed up to 95 percent of the home value to be financed, with mortgage insurance, in certain regions. Citibank said it offered loans with down payments of less than 20 percent with insurance, too. Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank let qualified borrowers take out two loans -- one for 80 percent of the home's value and the second for 10 percent, along with a 10 percent down payment -- which lets them avoid private mortgage insurance.
That type of piggyback loan structure ''has become more available and we are seeing it more frequently,'' said Erik Johansson, vice president of mortgage lending at Guaranteed Rate, a mortgage lender in Schaumburg, Ill.
The problem, according to Mr. Thielicke of Cobalt Mortgage, is that some borrowers are considering home equity lines of credit, with adjustable interest rates, for the second loan. While they may be able to afford the loan now, that could change.
''It's a good short-term product if you can pay it off in two years or so,'' he added. ''But if you're not, I'm cautioning against it because the rate will adjust up substantially once rates start going up.''
Besides, he said, those loans often require borrowers to pay interest only. ''You are renting that mortgage,'' he added.
Still, for some borrowers, F.H.A.-backed loans will remain the only option since they permit people to carry a little more debt relative to their income (compared with loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) and are a bit more forgiving to other blemishes, like a bankruptcy within the last two years.
''It's a lot more accommodating a product,'' said Paul Reid, a market manager at Redfin, a real estate broker. ''When people are trying to make a competitive offer and find themselves in a bidding war, they oftentimes find themselves back in F.H.A. because they are trying to push the barrier of what they can afford.''

HEADLINE: $1.9 Billion Oregon Experiment Gives Federal Medicaid Program Local Roots

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
SALEM, Ore. -- Some say America has been homogenized, a chain-store nation bereft of regional distinction in dialect or dinner. But now this state, at the pioneer's end of the road, is testing the idea that local community difference is alive and well, and that grass-roots leadership holds the key to fixing health care in America.
Under an agreement signed with the Obama administration last year, and just now taking shape, Oregon and the federal government have wagered $1.9 billion that -- through a hyper-local focus on Medicaid -- the state can show both improved health outcomes for low-income Medicaid populations and a lower rate of spending growth than the rest of the nation. If Oregon fails on either front, the consequences are grave, potentially tens of millions of dollars in penalties a year, bleeding a state budget still wounded from recession. 
Fifteen Community Advisory Councils have been established across the state, charged with setting local goals. One of them, around the college town of Eugene, will take aim starting July 1 at smoking by pregnant women, hoping to cut neonatal costs through a system of rewards, like gift cards at the doctor's office for women who go tobacco free. Another council, in Portland, is focusing on something that might sound ho-hum in health care, but that local leaders have identified as a care-and-cost driver: mold in low-income housing. Another group, in an economically depressed rural swath in the state's center, will try getting people out of their cars, aiming for a payoff in reduced cardiovascular care that is both measurable and relatively quick. Hands-on work with patients is common to all the efforts, including one that is using ''patient guides,'' to talk through care options with people who stack up in emergency rooms with often routine medical problems.
Other states, notably Massachusetts and Vermont, are experimenting with new models as well, mainly through regulation. But Oregon's way -- one ear to the ground, health care with local input -- has always been different, and the Medicaid experiment, health care experts said, has now sharpened those distinctions to an incisive edge.
''We've got essentially 15 experiments going around Oregon,'' said Gov. John Kitzhaber, who was an emergency room physician before entering public life, and still signs his official correspondence with an M.D. next to his name. ''They all have to meet the same metrics in outcome and quality,'' he added, but after that the new Coordinated Care Organizations, to which the advisory councils report, are largely being left to their own devices in finding a way that makes sense for them.
Local, interventionist, hands-on attention -- reducing health problems before care is warranted or billed -- means breaking deep tradition in a system that thinks mostly about treatment and response. ''We're building something that's never been built before,'' Mr. Kitzhaber said.
National health care experts are divided about whether the Oregon Experiment, as many people call it, can achieve real, measurable goals within the five-year timeline of the federal agreement. Some say that to expect once-competing hospitals, in some cases with different cultural traditions and billing systems, to pull together for a common goal -- a pattern in some of the new organizations -- runs contrary to human or institutional nature.
Others say that Oregon's path through the health care wilderness is so idiosyncratic that what happens here might stay here, untransplantable to other locales even if it does succeed.
The state has been tweaking its Medicaid system for years under Mr. Kitzhaber, a Democrat who served two terms starting in the mid-1990s, then ran again and won in 2010. Nonprofit organizations with a collaborative bent, like Kaiser Permanente, also run deep in the health care culture, with a big presence and market share. And Oregonians tend to be joiners, with some of the highest rates of volunteerism in the nation, especially in liberal Portland, which has 40 percent of the state's Medicaid patients, and where words like ''community'' and ''social justice'' get repeated in public life like mantras.
''One thing unique about the C.C.O. process is the degree to which it focuses on all the elements of an Oregon Health Plan recipient's life,'' said Steve Weiss, the chairman of the advisory board at Health Share of Oregon, a Coordinated Care Organization in Portland. Mr. Weiss, 70, is disabled and gets by, he said, on $864 a month.
Mr. Kitzhaber, in an interview in his office at the Capitol, said the anecdotal interventionist health care story he imagines is that of a poor 92-year-old woman who develops congestive heart failure in a heat wave because she has no air-conditioner.
''Under the current system, Medicaid will pay for an ambulance and $50,000 in the hospital,'' he said. ''What it won't pay for is a $200 window air-conditioner, which is all she needs to stay in her home and out of the acute medical system.''
Getting to that $200 decision, though, is not easy. It means both having a community health care worker able to check in on the woman, he said, then having a system flexible enough to send someone down to the local Target store with a credit card.
It also requires a paper trail of measurements and procedures, officials said, to ensure that local decisions are fair and based on predictable outcomes, so that something like the purchase of one air-conditioner does not open the door to questions of bias, or claims that every poor family is entitled, in the name of fairness or social equity, to cooler air at state expense.
Mike Bonetto, a health policy adviser to Mr. Kitzhaber, said: ''How do you maximize the value of the tax dollars that are being spent on health care? If it's to pay for the air-conditioner, so be it.'' He says the public understands that linkage -- that savings on many small things can mean greater support for big things like public safety and education -- and the Democratic-controlled State Legislature has endorsed it with bipartisan votes on elements of the health package.
The state has also developed 33 performance measures to aim to show to the public and the federal government how the project is working, with financial incentives to local Coordinated Care Organizations for meeting goals like rates of adolescent well-care visits and colorectal cancer screening.
The first reports of baseline data are scheduled to start coming in this spring.
Mark V. Pauly, a professor of health care management at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, says he thinks coordinated care of the sort Oregon is embarking on might seem a little too interventionist in parts of the country where people are expected to mind their own business.
''We don't know whether Americans are ready for coordinated care,'' he said. ''But Oregon keeps trying. God bless them.''

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: Mental Health

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times and the latest happenings in Washington, plus a look at the weekly addresses. 

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
Lawmakers have been working on legislation that would lead to some of the most significant advancements in treating mental illness in years and address a problem that people on both sides of the issue agree is a root cause of gun violence, Jeremy W. Peters reports. The legislation would also serve as a political refuge for Republicans and more conservative Democrats who are eager to offer a federal response to the nation's recent mass shootings, but have no interest in taking action on anything that could be construed as an infringement on the Second Amendment.
 

        
Illegal immigrants who arrived in the country after Dec. 31, 2011, could be ineligible to apply for legal status under a new bipartisan bill, Ashley Parker reports. Every bill that legalizes immigrants has a cutoff date for eligibility, but immigration advocates had been pushing for the date to be as current as possible - Jan. 1, 2013.

        
President Obama released his 2012 tax returns on Friday, showing that his personal income has dropped significantly since he was first inaugurated, mostly because of declining sales from his two books, Michael D. Shear reports.

        
Fund-raising totals for Organizing for Action, the grass-roots group that grew out of President Obama's campaign machine, suggest that it may initially struggle to raise the kind of money that Mr. Obama relied on during his presidential campaigns, Michael D. Shear writes.
Weekly Addresses

        
President Obama relinquished his usual role of delivering the weekly address to Francine Wheeler, whose 6-year-old son, Ben, was killed in the Newtown, Conn., shooting in December. She spoke with hopes that the Senate would pass reforms to protect other children and communities in the future. "I've heard people say that the tidal wave of anguish our country felt on 12/14 has receded," she said. "But not for us. To us, it feels as if it happened just yesterday. Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy."

        
Representative Jackie Walorski of Indiana delivered the Republican Weekly Address, harping on President Obama's proposed budget and offering "a better way" to solve the nation's deficit. "If we were to implement the president's budget, taxes would go up on just about every American, including middle-class families," she said. "The president's budget isn't a compromise; it's a blank check for more spending and more debt." She offered her party's alternative, which aims to balance the budget in 10 years, end "the waste of taxpayer dollars" and foster a healthy economy.
 Happenings in Washington 

        
The White House will host the Spring Garden Event this weekend, opening the grounds for visitors to see the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, the Rose Garden, the White House Kitchen Garden and the South Lawn of the White House. The National Park Service will distribute free tickets at the Ellipse Visitor Pavilion on Saturday and Sunday beginning at 8 a.m.

HEADLINE: The Trauma of the Pink Shirt

BYLINE: By SIMON CRITCHLEY. 
A philosophy professor at the New School.

 BODY:
LET me tell you an odd little story, in anticipation of summer. Last June, just as New York City was turning back into a summer sweatbox, our friend Shirley called my wife and said she knew someone with a pool in New Jersey who was away for the weekend, and wouldn't mind our using it. An irresistible invitation.
We made haste. An hour later, we were heading up Route 9W, windows open, looking out over the Hudson River on a lovely day.
At my suggestion, we stopped for some snacks and drinks. I was the last of the three of us to leave the gas station, a bag bulging with goodies in my hand. 
That's when I walked into a situation, right there in the parking lot. Three cars, one of them Shirley's, were simultaneously trying to pull out of their parking spots. The two male drivers were screaming at each other, at Shirley and at my wife.
Ever the conquering diplomatic hero, I decided to intervene. Channeling some bizarre amalgam of Basil Fawlty and Rodney King in his ''Can we all get along'' moment, I said: ''Come on, gentlemen, let's be reasonable. We can settle this amicably and all be on our way.''
Big mistake. The first driver, in a black S.U.V., gave me the finger while accusing me of having had sex with my mother (which was, moreover, completely untrue), just before making a wheel-spinning exit from the parking lot.
In a spirit of hopeful solidarity, I looked at the second driver, shrugged my shoulders and raised my eyebrows in disbelief at the actions of the one who had just sped off. I turned and made my way back to Shirley's car.
That was when things really kicked off. The second driver -- he was in a red convertible -- started screaming at me, dropping an impressive number of unprintable adjectival expletives that circled around my being bald (true) and speaking like a limey (undeniable).
I paused for a moment, turned around, straightened my back, and slowly walked toward the sports car, my carrier bag gently rustling in the wind, full of diet sodas and trail mix. I took a good long look at the guy. He was nicely, if casually, dressed, with expensive shades and a deeply impressive mop of black hair. It was thick and gleaming with some kind of styling product. I said: ''Excuse me, sir. Would you perhaps like to apologize?''
That was when I realized my real mistake, which had occurred hours earlier. Back home, after Shirley called, I had quickly found my swimming trunks and earplugs, pulled on some jeans and flip-flops and buttoned up a newish shirt, a birthday gift from my wife.
Let me tell you about this shirt. I loved this shirt! It was a beautiful, brushed cotton button-down in a dusty, slightly shocking pink. This shirt cost $200! I wore it to please myself, my wife and, on this occasion, to impress Shirley, who is an executive in the fashion industry.
Pride first; fall second. The sports-car guy lowered his shades, looked at me in my pink shirt and yelled: ''Who are you looking at, pudendum boy? Why are you wearing a pudendum boy shirt, pudendum boy?'' (I should point out that the sports-car guy did not choose the Latin term.)
I was taken aback. I mean, this was a nice shirt, right? This was a $200 shirt. This was a Steven Alan shirt. Maybe it was the color of Pepto-Bismol. Maybe I looked a little like living diarrhea relief. But this was no pudendum boy shirt. (I live in Brooklyn. I keep it real.)
Warming to his theme and realizing he had the upper hand, the sports-car guy began to improvise, Coltrane-style. Again, the number and rapidity of obscenities was truly impressive, but if I could summarize the drift of his reasoning, it would be as follows:
By virtue of the fact that I was wearing what we can call, for the sake of economy, a P.B.S., and, on the basis of the assumption, repeated once again (but still untrue), of my having had sex with my mother, he invited me repeatedly to perform fellatio on him. He emphasized the invitation with explicit hand gestures and by pointing to the area of his crotch. (I am not that slow. I got the point.) And so it went round and round for ages, like a three-stroke engine or the three persons of the trinity: P.B.S., incest, fellatio.
I was impressed by this bravura display of American masculinity. But I was also bewildered by it. What exactly was he asking me to do to him? It was terribly confusing. Was it the pinkness of the shirt that led to the insinuation that I should fellate him? And -- most of all -- who exactly was the P.B. in this situation? Me or him? Surely him, I thought. After all, he was apparently initiating some kind of homosexual liaison between us. I was just buying soda and trail mix.
My head spinning, I fell silent. He slipped his shift into drive and the car purred into motion. As he left the parking lot I screamed, ''Learn some manners!'' I don't think he heard me. I tramped back to the car where my wife and Shirley were laughing uncontrollably, tears in their eyes. ''That went quite well,'' I said with some pride. ''At least I didn't swear back or rise to his bait. I was clearly occupying the moral high ground.''
THE rest of the day passed peacefully enough. Frankly, the pool was disappointingly small. Undressing that night, I looked hard at my pink shirt as I put it back on the hanger, gazing at it quizzically for the longest time. Did the sports-car guy have a point? Don't be so stupid, I said to myself.
But I never wore the shirt again.
It lies folded in a drawer. I'm looking at it right now. All I can think when I see it is ''P.B.S.! P.B.S.! P.B.S.!'' It's as if the shirt is screaming obscenities at me in a Jersey accent. I close the drawer.
So, what is the moral of this little tale? Don't wear pink shirts in the summer in New Jersey? Hardly. Is it about the fact that our nobly intended moral interventions often have bizarre consequences? We've known that for quite some time. Sophocles had some thoughts on the matter.
It seems to me it's more about the way words can wound in the oddest ways. Despite the fact that the currency of swearwords has become greatly devalued through over-circulation, they still harbor a power of transgressive pleasure and can inflict pain. As people in my line of work are wont to say, we could do with a richer phenomenology of swearing.
We know swearwords are literally meaningless. He didn't mean for me to perform fellatio on him; I would not have literally meant for him to have sex with himself; and so forth. Yet they carry a force that compels us. This is why many of us like to swear a lot. It feels really good to swear and really bad to be sworn at. Swearing always aims at something intimate, something usually hidden, which is why the words are often so explicitly and violently sexual. But in hurting us, they can hit the bull's-eye of an unpleasant truth that we'd rather not acknowledge.
This is why the sports-car guy was right. I am that smug, self-righteous fool who lives in a fashionable corner of Brooklyn with the $200 Steven Alan shirt, going to a private swimming pool in my friend's car with my little bag of snacks in order to escape the city heat. It's pathetic. That pink shirt is a P.B.S. and I am a P.B. I deserved what I got.
So I've made a resolution. This summer I'm going to take my P.B.S. out of the drawer, wash it and wear it with pride. If you see me sporting it in the street, in a car or in a gas station parking lot, be sure to yell out some pudendal obscenity. Thank you in advance, from the bottom of my heart, for all your future abuse.

HEADLINE: Lost Plenty of Pounds, But Not a Lightweight

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
BIG WATER, Utah -- On the specification sheet for the 2013 Range Rover is an entry you don't often see applied to a luxury vehicle: wading depth, 35.4 inches.
The number coincides with one of the tests performed by engineers during the development of the new Range Rover. The opulently outfitted S.U.V. -- the pinnacle of Land Rover's blue-blood model line -- is driven into nearly three feet of standing water, its ignition turned off and the door opened, allowing the interior to flood. After 30 minutes, the engine is restarted and the vehicle is driven out of the water, demonstrating its ability to endure even the most extreme conditions.
Besides the water torture routine, a Range Rover must prove its ability to pull through axle-deep mud and sand, maintain its grip through ice and snow, crawl up and over huge boulders and churn through heaps of debris.
Yes, Land Rover's flagship, the subject of a complete redesign for 2013, still has the capability to carry occupants to all sorts of places where most owners would never dream of driving their six-figure luxury vehicle. 
Land Rover says that fewer than 10 percent of owners ever take their Range Rovers off-road, much less punish them with expedition-caliber terrain. Indeed, romping through muddy bogs, blasting across sand dunes or fording deep streams might well be seen as irresponsible.
On a long off-highway test-drive here in the mountains of southern Utah, during which I sampled a variety of surfaces that included red clay the consistency of gumbo, it occurred to me that it may be enough to just know that a Range Rover can handle almost anything its owners may ncounter. It's entirely O.K. with me that it is rarely called upon to do so.
But it is with the possibility of blizzards, flooded roadways and combat-zone pavement gaps in mind that the company has built such a high degree of versatility into this model.
A Range Rover redesign is a rare occurrence; the 2013 model is the fourth generation of a nameplate first sold in Europe in 1970. The previous model was still selling well, but technology had advanced sufficiently to warrant a complete makeover.
In laying out the guidelines for the redesign, Land Rover management told its engineers and stylists to change everything -- except the looks. In my view, they succeeded: its girth may appear a bit more full (it's actually within fractions of an inch of previous measurements), but over all the Range Rover maintains its characteristic stance.
The most pressing issue, and the matter to which the greatest amount of engineering effort was devoted, was weight reduction.
Not that fuel economy and curb weight are crucial considerations for Range Rover buyers, but at three tons, the previous version was ponderous on the road. Its affinity for visiting gas stations was, at the least, a nuisance, if not a financial concern, to its well-heeled owners.
So the steel body has been replaced by an all-aluminum unibody structure that is 39 percent lighter, part of an overall weight reduction of 700 pounds, and according to Land Rover, will uphold the company's hard-earned reputation for toughness.
The weight savings pay dividends in handling, acceleration and, Land Rover says, a 9 percent improvement in fuel economy -- now 14 miles per gallon in town and 20 on the highway for the standard V-8; with the supercharged V-8, consumption drops to 13 city, 19 highway.
Those 5-liter engines carry over from last year's model with ratings of 375 and 510 horsepower; having much less bulk to push down the road for 2013, they feel unchained. Zero to 60 m.p.h. times are quicker by nearly a second -- now 6.5 and 5.1 seconds respectively. For model year 2014, the base V-8 will be replaced by a 340-horsepower supercharged V-6, and all models will get an idle stop-start feature.
Also playing roles in the improved efficiency are a new Bosch engine-management system, the latest direct-fuel-injection technology and an 8-speed automatic transmission. Steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters offer manual gear selection, though the transmission seemed to intuitively, and almost imperceptibly, choose the appropriate gear on its own, even while descending a steep mountain switchback.
A reworking of the air suspension, including new springs at the front, helps the Range Rover corner more confidently, though that is offset by the new electric power steering system, which has a disappointingly numb feel. Still, at its new fighting weight the top Rover feels almost like a sport-tuned BMW X Series S.U.V. on the road -- and less like a Hummer off it.
A new version of the adaptive Terrain Response system, which adjusts the engine, transmission, differential and chassis controls for varying surfaces, adds an automatic mode. Still, it cannot read and anticipate terrain as a human does, so manual control is retained for sand, mud, snow and rock-crawling situations. I spent 90 percent of my off-road drive in the sand setting, which handled most anything I chose to tackle.
Approach and departure angles -- measurements that indicate the degree of difficult terrain a vehicle can handle -- are improved, and a multiple-setting height adjustment can increase the ground clearance by nearly 3 inches for tricky off-road situations. Wheel options of up to 22-inch diameters are offered, though all of my ambitious off-road antics were successfully completed on standard all-season tires.
A suite of hard-core all-terrain systems assists the driver when the going gets toughest: Hill Descent Control, Gradient Release Control, Hill Start Assist, Roll Stability Control and stability and traction control. A new Bosch antilock braking system enhances all these functions and helps the vehicle stop promptly, with great on-road control.
The full-time 4-wheel-drive system has a 2-speed transfer case with a locking center differential. Torque, nominally split 50-50, can be shifted by a multiplate clutch as needed to make the best use of the available traction.
I could go on. But the full set of technical descriptions can -- and does -- fill a thin book. I'm waiting for the Kindle version.
My favorite feature of the new Range Rover is subjective, not technical. The interior is even more luxurious than before. And I think this is where the company is to be applauded: while some automakers continually scrimp, save and cost-cut on luxury items, it seems that Land Rover has not, at least as far as the Range Rover is concerned.
The top -- rather fussily named -- Autobiography model now starts at $130,995. Given the brand's strong sales, it seems that Land Rover's demographic of ultrahigh-net-worth individuals have a rationale that justifies paying for yards of matched wood trim, Bridge of Weir semianiline leather upholstery, heated and cooled massaging seats, a center console beverage cooler, parallel-parking assistance, rear-seat entertainment, an 825-watt sound system (a 1,700-watt upgrade is a further $4,500) and a concierge-level list of other amenities.
Of course an adequately equipped base model, the HSE, can be purchased for a somewhat less breathtaking sum, $83,545. Land Rover reports that fully 50 percent of Range Rovers ''go out the door under $100,000.''
For those seeking a lower price point, the company also offers the Range Rover Sport, a somewhat smaller, sportier version with slightly reduced off-road capability, fewer electronic helpers and less wood and leather for a saving of about $20,000.
If anything, the comparatively high price is an attraction of the Range Rover. It helps keep the clientele exclusive, a fact that probably enhances, rather than hinders, its appeal.
But keep this in mind: at any price, a Range Rover buyer is probably getting more capability than is needed. And there may be opportunities -- crossing three feet of standing water, for instance -- when it may be more prudent not to use this vehicle as intended.

HEADLINE: When 'Affordable' Is Just a Word

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
The spring has the real-estate press enthusiastically reporting on the construction of 432 Park Avenue, an apartment tower that its developers claim will be the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere. Apartments in the tower, designed by Rafael Violy and to be completed in 2015, are offered in the $20 million to $80 million range, which in the context of Ludicrously Priced Housing for Oligarchs Who Spend Most of the Year in Tax Exile on Mediterranean Yachts isn't as numbing as it might otherwise be. Such is the historical moment that a few blocks west, in another glass tower, called One 57, apartments have sold in the past year for more than $90 million.
Given these perversions, it is hard to understand what affordable housing means in New York, in one sense because the market doesn't really abide it, and in another because the phrase itself in policy terms has become so amorphous. 
Just as shocking, arguably, as the $44 million four-bedroom duplex in TriBeCa that turns up in the real estate listings of The New York Times is the $1,400-a-month, two-bedroom rental apartment in the Belmont section of the Bronx. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which calculates what it calls the housing wage -- the earnings necessary to pay no more than 30 percent of your income on rent, the threshold usually used to define affordable housing -- you would need to make $26.92 an hour, or $56,000 a year, to afford the apartment. If you held a minimum-wage job, a likely circumstance in a neighborhood where the poverty rate is 43 percent, twice the city's on the whole, and median household income is just over $22,000, you would have to work 149 hours a week to meet the cost. Alternatively, you could clone yourself 2.7 times.
As it happens, affordable housing was the subject of a mayoral forum last week at New York University. Democratic candidates all expressed the view that despite the Bloomberg administration's ambitious and lauded affordable housing program -- which has financed the preservation and construction of 165,000 units of low-, moderate- and middle-income housing -- the city, at a time of record homelessness, soaring rents and stagnating wages, needs to do more and needs to generate affordable housing that is actually affordable.
Two months ago, a report issued by the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, a consortium of neighborhood housing groups, indicated that out of the 38,670 units developed by the Bloomberg housing plan from 2009 to 2011, only one-third of them were economically within reach of households making the median income or less for the typical household in their neighborhood. Of the units the city developed over the same period, only about 8 percent were intended for households making less than 40 percent of the metropolitan area's median income, though they make up nearly one-third of all New York City households.
Another dimension to all this is what Alex Schwartz, a professor of urban planning at the New School, likens to a bathtub with a running faucet and an open drain. As the city builds new units of affordable housing, old units age out of the system. Much of the affordable housing isn't meant to be affordable forever simply because it isn't financially feasible, so rents go up, tax breaks expire and units nudge toward market rate. Last week, the housing development association issued new data indicating where existing affordable housing had disappeared or was threatened. In the University Heights section of the Bronx, 5,000 units of housing from 2008 to 2011 became unaffordable, with rents requiring incomes of more than 80 percent of the area's median income.
The New York City Housing Authority, where the average monthly rent as of this year is $436, offers permanent affordability, of course, but there are currently more than 167,000 families on its waiting list (and more than 123,000 families on a waiting list, now closed, for Section 8 federal housing vouchers, which have had their financing reduced by sequestration). One partial solution to clearing the backlog would be to relocate older residents living alone in large apartments in public housing to smaller ones and give over two- and three-bedroom apartments to the families who need them. ''It isn't all that complicated,'' Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker and a Democrat, said at the candidates' forum, ''even though it isn't happening.''
Creating actual affordable housing, buildings that can pay for themselves in the absence of growing subsidies, will be a formidable challenge for the next mayor. John C. Liu, a Democratic candidate, proposes to do it with what he calls the People's Budget, which he unveiled last week and which includes $27 million in housing vouchers for the homeless and $3.7 billion in capital funds to help create 100,000 units of affordable housing over a four-year period. He would finance these and other ambitions through tax increases on those making more than $1 million a year, charging rents to charter schools using city facilities and taxing private equity firms' carried interest, to cite a few examples.
Advocates and analysts in the affordable housing world have talked about addressing some of this difficulty by cross-subsidizing buildings, a process that would have a mixed-income building in the Bronx, for instance, helping to offset the costs of a primarily low-income building in Brooklyn. I would propose another form of cross-subsidization called the You Don't Need to Live in a $50 Million Penthouse Tax, which would require anyone buying a property for more than $10 million (of which there are currently about 280 listed in The Times) to pay a percentage of that cost to an affordable-housing fund. And then commit, in writing, to never complain about it.

HEADLINE: Obama's Budget Revives Benefits as Divisive Issue

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Sarah Wheaton contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Whether or not Republicans ever agree to a budget deal with President Obama, one thing seems certain: now that he has officially put Social Security and Medicare benefits on the negotiating table, opponents on his party's left will make that an issue for Democrats in the midterm elections next year -- and perhaps in the 2016 presidential contest.
In the midterm races already taking shape, Democrats who back Mr. Obama's budget proposals to trim future benefits as part of a long-term deficit-reduction compromise could be attacked from the left and the right.
Liberal groups and some union activists are threatening to recruit candidates to challenge these Democrats in their primaries. At the same time, the head of the House Republicans' campaign committee gleefully signaled last week that he would use Mr. Obama's ''shocking attack on seniors'' against Democrats in general-election races -- though Republican Congressional leaders demanded the concessions from Mr. Obama. And while party leaders rebuked the campaign committee chief, Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, individual Republican candidates and ''super PACs'' would be free to wage their own attacks. 
For now, at least, the political warnings to Democrats are coming mostly from the left of their own party.
''You cannot be a good Democrat and cut Social Security,'' said Arshad Hasan, the executive director of Democracy for America, a liberal grass-roots group, which staged a small protest outside the White House last week even before Mr. Obama released his annual budget on Wednesday.
''People would be looking to punish them,'' said Robert Borosage, a co-founder of the Campaign for America's Future, another liberal group, ''and they would be looking for primary challengers.''
Even if Democratic incumbents do not draw a primary challenger, liberal activists say, they might face a shortage of volunteers motivated enough to do the hard work of campaigning -- just as Democrats did in the 2010 midterms, which resulted in big Republican gains.
Looking further ahead, to 2016, some on the left have already begun talking about encouraging a liberal Democrat -- the freshman Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is the name most bandied -- to take up the ''don't touch Social Security or Medicare'' banner as part of a liberal bid for the party's nomination to succeed Mr. Obama, even against Hillary Rodham Clinton or Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Such talk was stoked when Ms. Warren, within hours of the release of the president's budget on Wednesday, sent supporters an e-mail sounding an alarm: ''Our Social Security system is critical to protecting middle-class families, and we cannot allow it to be dismantled inch by inch.''
She was not available for an interview, aides said on Friday.
''If the major candidates running for the Democratic nomination hedge on important issues like Social Security, they will leave open a tremendous amount of space for an insurgent,'' said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group often critical of Mr. Obama.
But, Mr. Green acknowledged, ''I wouldn't say anybody's laying the groundwork yet.''
At a minimum, Mr. Borosage said, all Democratic candidates in 2014 or 2016 ''will be forced to take a stand.''
That prospect could complicate the campaign strategies of establishment favorites. Mr. Biden is inevitably tied to Mr. Obama's policies. And Mrs. Clinton, as a senator, was a fiscal moderate who extolled her husband's budget-balancing record of compromise. President Bill Clinton negotiated Medicare savings with Congressional Republicans, and their 1997 deal nearly included the same proposal trimming Social Security cost-of-living increases that Mr. Obama has put in his budget to entice Republicans to compromise in turn.
Ideological litmus tests have lately been more divisive for Republicans than for Democrats, over taxes and social issues like abortion, same-sex marriage and immigration. But the agitation on the left to defend Social Security and Medicare, the two programs that Democrats consider perhaps their party's greatest legacy, did not begin last week with Mr. Obama's new budget.
It had been building since mid-2011, when the president, in private negotiations with Speaker John A. Boehner, tentatively agreed to the new formula for calculating cost-of-living adjustments in Social Security; economists recommend the formula as more accurate, but it would mean smaller increases for Social Security beneficiaries. Even so, Democrats in Congress and the White House agree that the party would have supported Mr. Obama back then if a compromise deal had come to a vote.
But the 2011 talks, just like a second round of negotiations in December, collapsed after Mr. Boehner declined to agree to Mr. Obama's counterdemands: new taxes on the wealthy and on some corporations, and job-creating investments in infrastructure projects, research and education.
As his second term began, Mr. Obama used his annual budget proposal to make his most public overture toward compromise yet. The budget, incorporating the final December offer to Mr. Boehner, also proposed other cuts in spending for domestic programs and the military and $400 billion in savings over 10 years from Medicare. Those savings would come mostly from reducing payments to hospitals and pharmaceutical manufacturers, but also from trimming benefits and raising out-of-pocket costs for higher-income beneficiaries.
Liberals found much to praise, like Mr. Obama's proposed new spending for road construction, nationwide prekindergarten education and advanced manufacturing research; a higher federal minimum wage; and reduced tax breaks for the wealthy. But they were shocked that he proposed the new cost-of-living formula. With that as the kindling, their opposition movement intensified.
More than two years away from Democrats' presidential-nominating contest, however, it is hard to see who could or would become the left's standard-bearer. Besides Ms. Warren, other party leaders mentioned include Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
Certainly an unexpected candidate could emerge, as Mr. Obama did in the 2008 race. Three years ahead of that year's nominating convention, few Democrats saw him as a likely candidate, much less one who could vanquish Mrs. Clinton.
Now Mrs. Clinton is again seen as the nearly invincible front-runner, should she choose to run. Many potential aspirants, including Ms. Warren, are widely considered unlikely to challenge her as Mr. Obama did in 2008.
Back then, the issue that he seized was opposition to the Iraq war. In 2004, Democrats' disgust with that war had powered Howard Dean's liberal challenge to Senator John Kerry, who ultimately defeated Mr. Dean for the nomination.
Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said that while the issue of protecting Social Security and Medicare could be potent in coming Congressional and presidential campaigns, it ''will not be galvanizing in 2016 quite the way that voting for the Iraq war was.''
''Certainly today, and presumably still at the time of the next election, President Obama has enormous credibility with Democratic voters, particularly liberal Democrats,'' Mr. Garin said. That credibility extends, he added, to the president's case for making changes that bolster the finances of the social-insurance programs for future generations.
''While I have no doubt that there would be some Democratic voters who rally around a candidate who runs on a 'don't touch Social Security or Medicare' platform,'' Mr. Garin added, ''there would not be enough to sustain a candidacy unless that candidate has a lot of other things going for him or her.''

HEADLINE: Motor City Missionary

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
THE best way to experience all that is strange and a little otherworldly about downtown Detroit is to walk the streets around 5 p.m. on a weekday. At that hour, you'll notice not just the peculiarity of what is around you -- notably, the gorgeous, Art Deco skyscrapers alongside empty, decrepit buildings -- but also what is missing. There is no traffic here. As the workday ends, cars trickle out of underground parking lots and speed off to nearby highways, but in a volume that doesn't cause delays.
It is just one small sign of how far Detroit's fortunes have fallen: the birthplace of the mass-produced automobile, the city that gave us the infuriating, bumper-to-bumper commute, is now so sparsely populated that it doesn't have a rush hour. 
Dan Gilbert would like to change that. No, he's not interested in a honking pileup of S.U.V.'s. Mr. Gilbert, 51, a Detroit native and the fantastically wealthy founder and chairman of Quicken Loans, wants to revive two square miles that were once the thrumming heart of this city. To do so, he has already spent roughly $1 billion acquiring nearly three million square feet of real estate, and is ready to close another deal, for the Greektown Casino-Hotel and nearby parking lots, that will add one million more square feet to his holdings.
His real estate company, Bedrock Real Estate Services, is renovating properties, building apartments and wooing corporate tenants. A seven-mile light rail system is in the planning stages, underwritten by a number of businesses and business leaders, including Mr. Gilbert, as well as foundations and a federal grant.
Along with his employees, civic groups and public-spaces gurus, he is devising strategies to ''activate'' streets with outdoor seating and ground-level retail stores. Taxpayers will kick in a yet-to-be-determined sum for parts of this rehabilitation program, but it will be a fraction of what Mr. Gilbert contributes.
His plans, according to academics like Brent D. Ryan, author of ''Design After Decline: How America Rebuilds Shrinking Cities,'' amount to one of the most ambitious privately financed urban reclamation projects in American history.
Opportunity Detroit, as Mr. Gilbert has branded it, is both a rescue mission and a business venture that, if successful, will yield him a fortune. When he started buying in 2011, the city was having what he has described as a ''skyscraper sale.'' Among the bargains was the Dime Building, a 23-story neo-Classical gem of glazed brick and terra cotta trim, designed by Daniel Burnham -- of Flatiron Building fame -- and completed in 1912. In August 2011, Bedrock bought all 330,000 square feet of it, reportedly for $15 million. There are high-end apartments in Manhattan that cost more.
If this area turns around, no one will profit quite like Mr. Gilbert, but the risk looks as great as the potential reward. Even with its auto industry in relatively robust, post-bailout health, Detroit has been on a long, distressing slide. A quarter of its population left in the last decade, and it has $14 billion in long-term debt. The financial situation is so dire that Michigan's governor recently appointed an emergency manager. Detroit remains a national symbol of municipal decline, a victim of macroeconomic trends, poor planning and political corruption.
Mr. Gilbert is undaunted. Part-owner of a handful of casinos, he is familiar with big bets and steep odds, and, as they say in poker, he is all in. In 2010, he started moving his employees from a nearby suburb, and 7,600 people on his payroll now work downtown.
''Not a single one of them has told me, 'I don't want to be here,' '' he said in a recent interview in his office next to downtown's Campus Martius Park, formerly among the city's busiest gathering points and a focus of his campaign. ''Kids coming out of college want that urban core excitement, more and more.''
DRESSED in a red-checked button-down shirt and a blue blazer, Mr. Gilbert is 5 feet 5 inches of restless energy. He has slicked-back dark hair, a Hollywood smile and dolorous eyes that give him the look of a man in need of sleep. Growing up in Southfield, a nearby suburb, he spent little time in the city. One of his earliest memories is of his father, who owned a nightclub-restaurant in the city, explaining the Detroit riots as the violence unfolded over five days in 1967, leaving more than 40 people dead and 2,500 stores burned or looted.
It was a searing moment in the city's history, one that highlighted racial disparities that still haunt Detroit.
''People my age, we would hear from our parents and grandparents who were raised in Detroit about how great this city was, from 1900 to the 60s,'' Mr. Gilbert said. ''But none of us had any memory of that. And it wasn't until my late 20s and early 30s, when I started traveling for business, to places like New York City and Los Angeles, that I realized how much we were missing. As I started visiting these great American cities, it hit me -- man, how did we blow this so badly?''
He seems to consider it his duty to rebuild what a previous generation allowed to fall apart. He aims to turn downtown into a high-tech hub, where young entrepreneurs both live and work. (He and a handful of companies are offering rent and mortgage subsidies to people willing to live downtown.) These pioneers will have easy access to high culture: the city's leading museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Detroit Opera House are nearby, as are stadiums for the city's professional baseball and football teams.
About 80 small companies have already settled into buildings owned by Bedrock, many of them start-ups funded by Detroit Venture Partners, a venture capital firm co-owned by Mr. Gilbert. A Twitter office is here, too, as is a branch of Uber, the online taxi-calling service. National brands, like Nike, are being courted.
A master salesman, Mr. Gilbert describes a reinvigorated downtown as though it is inevitable, but there are more than a few skeptics. They include Mr. Ryan, who teaches in the department of urban studies and planning at M.I.T.
''Urban renewal always happens as a symphony of events, and part of the symphony is innovative, optimistic developers with the ability and willingness to transform historic properties,'' he said in a recent interview. ''But another part is a strong regional economy. You can't fight the fact that Detroit is a de-industrializing market and it isn't facing dramatic, positive transformation.''
Mr. Gilbert, though, is not just any innovative, optimistic developer. This is a guy who at age 12 organized a pizza delivery service, with children on bikes rushing store-bought pies to neighbors. (Local restaurants eventually shut down the operation with a complaint to the health department.)
He remains just as driven, but now his self-made fortune stands at $3.5 billion, according to Forbes. He has learned from mistakes of previous efforts to reimagine downtown, and he and his staff will apparently have a largely free hand. Government officials have promised to expedite permits for renovations, signs and so on.
''My job,'' said Dave Bing, the Detroit mayor and former National Basketball Association star, ''is to knock down as many barriers as possible and get out of the way.''
THE week I went to Detroit to interview Mr. Gilbert, in mid-March, the city was undergoing its latest in a long series of this-must-be-rock-bottom moments. It started on Monday, March 11, when a former mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick, was found guilty of racketeering, extortion and other crimes. Three days later, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan introduced Kevyn Orr, a Washington bankruptcy lawyer, as Detroit's emergency manager.
The appointment was greeted with some vocal resistance, like that of a few dozen protesters who poured into the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center on March 28 for 90 minutes of chants and protest songs. A federal lawsuit contending that the appointment is unconstitutional was filed by a number of unions, local activists, clergy members and others.
But many locals seemed to decide that usurping local politicians' power was a fine idea. Even Mayor Bing immediately pledged support. He and others -- Mr. Gilbert included -- seem to regard the city as an addict and Mr. Orr as a hard-nosed counselor leading an intervention.
The day before Mr. Orr's appointment was announced, Mr. Gilbert met in a conference room for his twice-a-month Detroit real estate meeting, with about a dozen people who work for him, plus a lawyer and leasing agent. If Detroit 2.0, as this group often calls the effort, has a planning committee, this is it. The conversation started with a long discussion about the terms of a lease with a specialty grocer, then segued into a look at a handful of buildings, some for sale, others already under contract.
''There was a massage parlor in that one,'' said Matt Cullen, president of Rock Ventures, one of Mr. Gilbert's companies, as the group looked at a photograph of one less-than-spiffy building.
''How would you know that?'' Mr. Gilbert needled.
Mr. Gilbert speaks with an accent that is Bill Murray-esque, and his default expression is, too: deadpan, which somehow makes him look perpetually on the verge of saying something wry. An inveterate prankster, he recently had a few dozen farm animals, including goats, chicken and geese, hauled into the office of a neat-freak colleague who was turning 50.
''You could smell that they were in the building,'' says Bill Emerson, the C.E.O. of Quicken Loans, who was not the target of the prank. ''Some days, I think Dan is just a big kid at heart.''
If so, he is a big kid who really likes to win. Mr. Gilbert is majority owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers of the N.B.A., and gained brief national fame when the team's star, LeBron James, announced in 2010 that he was decamping for the Miami Heat. Mr. Gilbert issued a statement to fans personally guaranteeing that the Cavs would win an N.B.A. championship ''before the self-titled former 'king' wins one.'' He added: ''You can take it to the bank.''
Fortunately for Mr. Gilbert, there is no bank for errant predictions. The Heat won the N.B.A. championship last year.
Thirty minutes into the Detroit real estate meeting, talk turned to Moosejaw , a Michigan seller of outdoor apparel that is the first large retailer to open in downtown in the Gilbert Age. A representative of the chain had been quoted a few weeks earlier in a local newspaper, talking in upbeat but not quite superlative terms about the site, in a building on Woodward Avenue, one of the city's grandest streets and a primary focus of Detroit 2.0.
The comments weren't rosy enough for Mr. Gilbert. He turned to a woman newly hired as a liaison with retailers and urged her to reach out to Moosejaw's management. ''Tell them we'll do promotions, we'll do whatever they want,'' he said. ''If the one store that moved in were to move out? Forget about it. We're dead.''
In late March, Mr. Gilbert would announce that Moosejaw had signed a long-term lease. But the chicken-and-egg problem of his vision is that retailers won't come unless there are people on the streets, and people won't walk the streets unless they are lined with retailers. (There is pre-Gilbert retail on ground floors, including a CVS store, but lots of empty spaces, too.)
The solution is what Mr. Gilbert calls the big bang: bring in as many stores and people, at the same time, as quickly as possible.
Of course, both retailers and people need to feel secure, and Detroit's dicey reputation is no secret; its murder rate was among the highest in the country last year, and among the city's highest in nearly two decades. So there's a command center in Chase Tower, a Bedrock-owned building where a bank of monitors are watched by security guards, with live feeds from video cameras downtown. It was the one part of Mr. Gilbert's operations deemed off-limits during my tour.
THESE guards keep an eye on what is actually one of the safest parts of the city. Few people live downtown, which means that the area is largely empty at night, and during the day it is filled with white-collar workers. There are rough patches, and a block-wide hole where the Hudson's department store once stood. But the place feels more sterile than threatening.
It's the rest of Detroit that could use 24-hour surveillance. One of the looming and unanswered questions posed by Mr. Gilbert's campaign is what, if anything, they will mean for the 137 square miles of the city that are not in his blueprints. To get a sense, I sat in the passenger seat of the Prius owned by George Galster, a professor in the department of urban studies and planning at Wayne State University and author of ''Driving Detroit.'' Professor Galster is steeped in the arcana that shape neighborhoods, like zoning laws and topography, and as he explained early in this three-hour drive, he is the fifth consecutive George Galster to live in Detroit.
''My great-great grandfather came here from Germany in 1851,'' he said, easing to the side of Mount Elliott Street, not far from downtown. He put his car in park and pointed to the moribund remains of a large, once-grand building of bricks and wood boards.
''This was the church my great-grandfather built,'' he said. ''This is the church where my parents met. It's where I was baptized.''
Today, it is a hovel that looks too dangerous to enter.
''This is what is horrible about Detroit,'' he says, putting his car back into drive. ''It takes away your memories.''
The surprise about this city is that most of it doesn't look like a city. It looks like a suburb that has gone bankrupt. It's filled with single-family homes -- some inhabited, many not -- that sit on streets where other houses have been razed, excavated and plowed over. Once, two million people lived here. Now, it's down to about 700,000, spread around an area large enough to accommodate every acre of land in San Francisco, Boston and the Bronx, combined.
There are a handful of strikingly lovely neighborhoods, like Sherwood Forest and Indian Village, which is studded with gorgeous Tudor Revival homes. At the opposite end of the spectrum, there are stops in what has become a perversely popular tour of ruins, like Michigan Central Station, designed by the same architects behind Grand Central Terminal and now so hollowed out that you can actually see through it.
Most of the city, though, is flat and featureless. It lacks what urban planners call ''good bones,'' large structures in dense neighborhoods. Parts of it appear to be in the midst of an evacuation.
''We're looking at a lot of torched buildings,'' Professor Galster said.
Burned homes are among the 5,000 to 8,000 dwellings that are abandoned in Detroit every year, according to Professor Galster. And this highlights one of the city's chronic maladies: a continuing exodus of population and tax base.
There are many causes -- the decline of the auto industry and white flight among them -- but the one that Professor Galster returns to time and again is development in the suburbs.
''The villains are the rules of the game,'' he said. ''Developers find it far more profitable to build in farmland in the suburbs than in vacant land in the core. It's easier to acquire big sites without worrying about hidden basements, or gas stations, or a reputation for violence, or corruption or inefficiency or the potential racism of your customers.''
It makes financial sense for developers, but it is disemboweling the city, he said. Which is why he believes that without reform to housing and development laws, neither Mr. Gilbert nor the emergency manager, nor any combination of earthly forces, can salvage Detroit.
What if downtown is resuscitated and no improvements are made to any other part of the city? It's a possibility that concerns the Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P.
''What we don't want to see is two Detroits, one for those who are downtown and one for those in the neighborhoods,'' Reverend Anthony said. ''I don't think that is what Mr. Gilbert wants, either. But I know that unless we have viable and strong neighborhoods, downtown will be merely a city near a river. It has to spread, it must spread to the neighborhoods.''
The uncomfortable reality is that Mr. Gilbert is a white guy trying to change the choicest parts of a city that is 83 percent African-American. A white guy who lives in an affluent village about 20 miles from downtown. But as he explains, his project is just a beginning.
''This is not the only solution,'' he said. ''The education system needs to be addressed. But what we're doing is a big part of the solution. I can't think of a great American city that doesn't have a great downtown.''
WHEN Dan Gilbert was in the fourth grade, he bought candy at wholesale from the father of a friend and sold it at retail prices to classmates. It was the start of a nearly obsessive quest to create enterprises and earn profits. He estimates that he's either invested in or started 70 companies in his career. One early and ill-fated venture was running a short-lived bookmaking operation with some friends while a freshman at Michigan State University. It ended when he was arrested by an undercover agent. He served probation, the charges were dropped and there was no conviction.
''We were college teenagers,'' he said.
Subsequent ventures were more mundane, and far more successful. He later earned a real estate agent's license and, while at Wayne State University Law School, worked part time at a Century 21 office. At some point, he realized that the serious money was in selling mortgages, not homes. So he and two partners, including his younger brother, Gary, went into the mortgage-origination business together. Mr. Gilbert and his partners took out ads in those once-ubiquitous free magazines that listed houses for sale, something that none of his competitors did.
''From the very beginning we could make the phones ring,'' Mr. Gilbert said, ''even if we didn't know what to do once they rang.''
The company, called Rock Financial because it sounded sturdy, would eventually become Internet-based, selling mortgages in all 50 states. It was acquired by Intuit for $532 million in 1999, says Mr. Gilbert, and renamed Quicken Loans. Three years later, after the dot-com bubble burst, the company was sold to a group of investors led by Mr. Gilbert for a sum he put at roughly $55 million.
This year, Quicken Loans will do $100 billion worth of mortgage business, says Mr. Gilbert, making it the third-largest home lender in the country, behind Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, according to Mortgage Daily.
Quicken Loans now employs nearly 2,500 mortgage bankers. One morning last month, 300 of them were working on the third floor of the Chase Tower, and a swing through the office was like a visit to a frat party at a telemarketing firm. There were many men and some women with headsets, talking to customers and staring at computer screens -- nothing novel there. But a karaoke machine sat in an aisle. Guys threw footballs to one another; one employee shot at colleagues with a Nerf gun. Basketball pennants were draped from the ceiling, as part of a March Madness theme.
''You should have been here last week,'' said one broker, Nerf gun in hand. ''The theme was spring break. I was wearing shorts, a hat, sunglasses.''
Mr. Gilbert espouses a philosophy of instilling fun in the workplace, one piece of an elaborate corporate culture that he has fine-tuned over the years, and describes, every few months, in a surprisingly entertaining, seven-hour monologue to new employees. One of more than a dozen core principles described in ''Isms in Action,'' as the lecture is titled, is summed up as ''Obsessed with finding a better way.''
That could work as a pretty good motto for Opportunity Detroit. It is being designed and unveiled with the city's past missteps in mind. One of the most infamous is the Renaissance Center, a huge, mirrored complex of towers built in 1977 and currently the headquarters of General Motors.
''One critic said it was the pre-eminent example of terrible urban planning,'' said Mr. Cullen of Rock Ventures, who formerly worked for G.M. and helped champion the idea of buying the RenCen, as everyone here calls it, and moving the company in. ''The building basically sucked the remaining people out of downtown and stuck them in a fortress.''
Mr. Gilbert wants to return the area to the pedestrian haven that it was decades ago. If he succeeds -- he expects significant results within four or five years -- the place will again resemble the scene captured in a photograph that is plastered on a wall not far from his office. It is a huge, sepia-toned shot of Campus Martius, snapped in 1917. Looking at the picture, you realize that it includes the neighborhood where you are standing, though at a time when it bustled with men and women in hats, strolling amid billboards, retailers and a lineup of trolley cars.
This urban idyll was a few years from extinction by the time Dan Gilbert was born. If his quest to bring it back to life proves anything, it's that you can feel nostalgia for a place you've never actually been.

HEADLINE: Can You Say 'Do It Again' in Norwegian?

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
In January ''Kon-Tiki,'' a biopic about the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl and his perilous 1947 journey across the Pacific on a balsa-wood raft, was nominated for the Academy Award for best foreign-language film. (It lost to Michael Haneke's ''Amour.'') On April 26 the film will be released commercially in the United States -- but in a version that is entirely in English, rather than in the original Norwegian.
The ''Kon-Tiki'' that Americans will see is not a remake: each version features the Norwegian actor Pal Hagen as Heyerdahl and is directed by Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg. The production team and cast took the highly unusual step of shooting two versions of the film simultaneously, shuttling between languages.
''The decision was a practical one for us,'' Mr. Ronning said, driven by what he described as market and linguistic realities. ''Given a choice between making 'Kon-Tiki' this way or not making it at all, after having worked on it for so many years, when you're down to that the choice is easy.'' 
Shooting in English and another language at the same time may seem like a new strategy designed for an international film market that is increasingly conversant in English. But it represents a return to a practice common in the late 1920s and early '30s.
With the advent of sound in film Hollywood studios seeking to maintain their share of the European market often turned to what were called ''multiple language versions'' in which the same cast and director would make a movie simultaneously in two or even three languages. Paramount, for example, opened a multiple-language version studio in the suburbs of Paris that in one 12-month period bridging 1930 and 1931 shot more than 100 such feature films.
''This is a part of film history that until recently seems to have been overlooked,'' said Thomas Elsaesser, an expert on German film who is teaching at New York University this semester. ''The arrival of talking movies and recorded speech posed a serious challenge of both an economic and industrial kind, especially to the United States and Germany, the two countries that dominated the international film business at that time.''
In the end what killed such films was simple economics, rather than aesthetic considerations. Making multiple versions of a movie proved far more expensive than the alternatives that emerged -- subtitles and dubbing -- and by 1933 Hollywood had abandoned the practice; soon afterward German and French studios did too.
The best-known multiple-language film from this period is probably Josef von Sternberg's ''Blue Angel,'' filmed in German and English versions with Marlene Dietrich, Emil Jannings and Kurt Gerron. But in 1953 Jean Renoir also made ''The Golden Coach,'' in French, English and Italian, and in 1979 Werner Herzog revived the technique for his ''Nosferatu the Vampyre,'' shot in German and English with Klaus Kinski in the title role.
For all those historic reasons it is difficult to known whether ''Kon-Tiki'' is a harbinger of a revival or just an interesting anomaly.
For cast and crew working in the two languages at the same time proved rigorous and challenging. After a long day of filming, often out on the water, the actors and directors would sit down for dinner and translate the next day's scenes into English with the advice of a British dialogue coach.
''It was hard, sometimes exhausting, a 24-hour-a-day job, and we didn't know if it was going to work,'' said Mr. Hagen, 32, whose own English is nearly flawless. ''We were already under pressure, because here we were doing this film about this legendary guy that people have very strong thoughts and feelings about, and with a budget that is very large for a Norwegian film. A lot was at stake.''
''Kon-Tiki'' is the third film that Mr. Ronning, 40, and Mr. Sandberg, 41, friends since childhood, have made together. Mr. Ronning said, ''Espen concentrates more on the actors, and I concentrate more on the visuals,'' operating one of the two cameras they always use on the set.
For ''Kon-Tiki,'' they said, each scene was shot first in Norwegian, and then after a couple of takes, the language would shift to English. Somewhat to their surprise the filmmakers soon discovered that technique enriched the film aesthetically.
''What we found was that the Norwegian take would have one vibe, and then when we would do it in English that vibe would change,'' Mr. Hagen said. ''So often we went back and did more takes for the Norwegian version because we had been taught something new. I focused on that as an opportunity rather than a bad thing.''
Not every scene in the film, nearly two hours long, had to be reshot. Some early ones, in which Heyerdahl is in the United States trying to raise money for his expedition and gain acceptance for his controversial theories about migration to Polynesia, were always in English, and other scenes on the high seas, some featuring computer-generated images of sharks menacing the raft, were shot from a distance and could therefore be dubbed.
''Kon-Tiki'' was originally conceived as a film that would be made in English, the directors said, but some of the 24 different financing sources that contributed to the $15 million budget had different ideas. About half the money came from Norwegian investors, the government Norwegian Film Institute in particular, with the proviso that the film be made in that language.
''It is unusual, but it makes sense,'' Mr. Sandberg said of the Norwegian-English compromise that resulted. ''It's only five million Norwegians, and we have to take that into consideration when we make expensive movies.'' Filming only in Norwegian is fine, he added, ''when we make these little Dogme things, but when we go out and make something expensive like this, it's just a reality we accept.''
In addition Heyerdahl, who died in 2002 at the age of 87, always wanted any film about his exploits to be available in English. That was an important consideration for Mr. Ronning and Mr. Sandberg, who grew up in a small town in southern Norway that neighbors the explorer's birthplace and who as children were enthralled by the daring of Heyerdahl and his five fellow adventurers.
''We visited the Kon-Tiki Museum in Oslo when we were kids, and when you see the raft, it's amazing how small it is,'' Mr. Ronning said. ''These guys went over this huge ocean on these nine balsa-wood logs.''
Heyerdahl ''inspired people and still does,'' Mr. Sandberg added. ''He could not swim, and he was terrified of water. But he overcame his own fears and crossed the biggest ocean there is.''
''Kon-Tiki'' is not the only recent film to have been shot simultaneously in two languages. Using two scripts and a cast from the former Yugoslavia, Angelina Jolie in 2011 directed English and Serbo-Croatian/Bosnian versions of ''In the Land of Blood and Honey,'' set in Sarajevo during the fratricidal Bosnian war of the 1990s.
''We did it in both because we wanted to make it as accessible as possible,'' Ms. Jolie said in an interview just before the film's release. ''It's confusing at times, and complicated for the director. But if you can, and you feel audiences can absorb it, you should do it as authentically as you can,'' which to her meant filming in the language in which the events occurred.
As for Mr. Ronning and Mr. Sandberg, now at work on a coming-of-age story based on a Norwegian novel about an obsessive Beatles fan, they described their experience on ''Kon-Tiki'' as daunting but ultimately fulfilling.
''That said,'' Mr. Ronning cautioned, ''we'd rather not do that again.'' Mr. Sandberg broke in to complete the thought: ''You have to catch lightning in a bottle twice,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Palestinian Prime Minister Resigns, Despite U.S. Efforts

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER and JODI RUDOREN; Khaled Abu Aker contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Jackie Calmes from Washington.

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- The internationally respected prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, Salam Fayyad, resigned on Saturday, raising concerns about political stability in the West Bank days after Secretary of State John Kerry proposed a broad initiative to aid the Palestinian economy there to shore up peace efforts.
The president of the Western-backed authority, Mahmoud Abbas, accepted Mr. Fayyad's resignation but asked him to stay until a new government could be formed, according to Palestinian officials, signaling an effort to minimize the upheaval.
But the timing of the resignation, which had been brewing for weeks over Mr. Fayyad's differences with Mr. Abbas and his Fatah party, seemed to deliver a blow to American prestige at the very least. The possibility of heading off the prime minister's resignation was among the topics that President Obama discussed with both Mr. Fayyad and Mr. Abbas when he visited Ramallah, West Bank, last month, and it was also a focus of Mr. Kerry's meeting with Mr. Abbas last week.
Since Mr. Kerry left the region, he has had more than one telephone conversation with both men to try to prevent the resignation. Israeli officials have also been quietly urging Mr. Fayyad to stay, aware that their public support is likely to backfire. 
''The U.S. has worked very hard,'' one Western diplomatic official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''Kerry asked him to stay. There's been a lot of messaging from the Western community about how much we value Fayyad's work.''
Underlying tensions between Mr. Fayyad and Mr. Abbas burst out in early March when the finance minister, Nabil Qassis, announced that he was quitting. Mr. Fayyad accepted the minister's resignation against the wishes of Mr. Abbas.
Palestinian insiders said that Mr. Fayyad, a political independent, submitted a letter to the president on March 23 laying out his intention to resign. In the meantime Mr. Fayyad helped pass a new annual budget, spent a few days in a hospital after suffering stomach pains and kept things on course during the visits of Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry. Mr. Obama told an Israeli audience in Jerusalem that the Israelis had ''true partners'' in Mr. Abbas and Mr. Fayyad. The resignation was sealed in a brief meeting with Mr. Abbas on Saturday evening, two days after Mr. Abbas returned from a trip abroad.
Mr. Fayyad, an American-educated economist, had gained the confidence of the West and of many Israelis, building up the credibility of the Palestinian Authority by introducing transparency, accountability and stability. Since being appointed to the premiership in 2007, he has championed law and order in the West Bank after years of chaos and focused on building the institutions of a future state.
But he has struggled to build a popular constituency on his home turf and became a target for senior Fatah figures resentful of his power, and who blamed him for all the authority's problems. People who spoke with Mr. Fayyad on Saturday and throughout the past week said he had grown increasingly frustrated over attacks on his leadership by Fatah officials, and over Mr. Abbas's failure to either defend him publicly or move behind the scenes to quell the criticism.
This month, the Fatah Revolutionary Council, the party's Parliament, criticized Mr. Fayyad's policies with unusual bluntness, describing them as ''improvised and confused.'' Mr. Fayyad has also borne the brunt of popular anger in recent months over rising prices and economic hardship in the West Bank.
The Palestinian Authority has been mired in financial crisis for two years, in part because of a shortfall in donations and Israel's withholding of tax revenues in response to Mr. Abbas's bid for enhanced status for the Palestinians at the United Nations. The authority has frequently been unable to pay its tens of thousands of employees in full and on time over the past year.
''Fatah has been critical of Fayyad for the last five years because he came to put things in order,'' said Mahdi Abdul Hadi, director of the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs, an independent institute in East Jerusalem, noting that Fatah has over the years been notoriously divided and corrupt.
''Fayyad claims his mission was accomplished,'' Mr. Abdul Hadi said. ''Some Americans talk of 'Fayyadism' as a school of thought.'' Now, Mr. Abdul Hadi said, ''the Americans will deal with whoever is his successor in office.''
''This is realpolitik,'' he said.
Ghassan Khatib, vice president of Birzeit University in the West Bank and a former Palestinian Authority spokesman, said he sensed feelings of anxiety among the public.
Mr. Fayyad, he said, was associated with moving the authority ''from a state of lawlessness to order and due process and from a chaotic financial situation, corruption and a poor image to a situation of proper financial management.''
He said the confidence of foreign donors would now depend on whom Mr. Abbas assigned to replace Mr. Fayyad.
Some Western officials suggested that Mr. Fayyad might stay a month or more as a caretaker, easing immediate donor concerns, but also suggested that the Palestinian Authority's future did not depend on Mr. Fayyad.
''Yes Fayyad is important,'' said the diplomatic official, ''but I think the P.A. must go on, and it'll be interesting to see who comes next.''
''We've been reiterating the message that we value his work enormously,'' he said of Mr. Fayyad, ''but we also know that the bigger picture remains the P.A., and the game will be to work with the P.A. to build a credible institution, Fayyad or no Fayyad.''
In Washington, Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said: ''Prime Minister Fayyad has been a strong partner to the international community and a leader in promoting economic growth, state-building and security for the Palestinian people. We look to all Palestinian leaders to support these efforts.''
One name that has been mentioned as a possible successor is Mohammad Mustafa, the chairman and chief executive of the Palestine Investment Fund and also a respected economist. He is seen by Western officials as part of the old-style Arab politics and by Palestinians as a technocrat with little political stature.
Members of Fatah have also floated the candidacy of Muhammad Shtayyeh, a senior Fatah official and an adviser to Mr. Abbas. But they added that Mr. Abbas was not likely to appoint a replacement before exploring new possibilities of reconciliation with his rivals in Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza -- a situation that could further complicate peace efforts.
In a previous unity deal reached over a year ago, Mr. Abbas agreed to lead an interim government of political independents and technocrats to pave the way for elections in the West Bank and Gaza.
Mr. Abbas appointed Mr. Fayyad prime minister of the government formed after the split with Hamas. The Islamic group, Hamas, won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 and a year later seized control of Gaza after a factional war there. Hamas routed Fatah from Gaza, confining Mr. Abbas and his authority to parts of the West Bank.

HEADLINE: The Furtive Tax

BYLINE: By LINDA SUGIN. 
A law professor at Fordham University.

 BODY:
APRIL 15 is dreaded as the deadline for filing income tax returns, but in fact every day is tax day for most working people. That's because more than half of all Americans pay more in payroll tax than in income tax. That includes nearly everyone in the bottom half of the income distribution.
We don't file annual payroll tax returns because payroll taxes have one rate and they aren't adjusted for individual differences that affect taxpaying ability. Your bill remains the same regardless of how many children you support, your medical or education expenses, or your charitable contributions. No standard deduction or personal exemption either: payroll taxes apply to the first dollar. 
Since they were introduced in 1937, payroll taxes have risen from two cents to more than 15 cents for every wage dollar earned. Although the tax is technically split between employers and employees, economists agree that workers suffer the whole cost of the tax. Without it, workers could expect to have higher wages, not just lower taxes.
The social insurance rhetoric surrounding the payroll tax might lead you to think that you are paying for your future retirement benefits. That's not how it works, though: current taxes pay for current benefits. The Social Security ''trust fund''? That's an accounting mechanism, not an actual pot of money.
Workers saw their take-home pay rise for two years on account of a partial payroll tax holiday, but that expired at the end of 2012, when there was virtually no support in the fiscal cliff negotiations for extending it, even though it was good for the economy.
Payroll taxes produce 40 percent of total federal revenue, but they are largely invisible. This is unfortunate because they play an important role in the overall balance of the federal tax burden, which falls much more heavily on income from work. Income from investments is not subject to the payroll tax, and it is also more lightly taxed than wages under the income tax.
Because people with high incomes earn a much greater percentage of their total income from investments -- and, crucially, because much of that investment income is wealth accumulation that has not been liquidated -- tax law favors the rich far more than most people realize. The money that has been gained on investments that have appreciated but have not yet been sold is not taxed and may permanently escape tax under current law.
This might sound reasonable -- why should I pay taxes before I cash out? -- but it is actually where the tax system is especially inequitable. Poor people with no savings cannot benefit from the tax preferences for investment, and middle-income workers often pay tax at a higher rate than rich investors, a problem made famous by Warren Buffett.
The ideal level of progressive taxation in our federal system is a vexing issue of philosophy and economics, and reasonable people can (and certainly do) differ about how graduated the rates should be. But even if we cannot agree about what would be fair, we should still be troubled by the substantial disparity in the taxation of individuals at the same income level. At every income level, workers pay significantly more tax than their counterparts who earn an equal amount through their investments.
At $70,000 total income, the worker pays almost $20,000 in federal taxes, roughly half in payroll tax and half in income tax. The investor with $70,000 in capital gains pays less than a fifth of that. This is not just an abstract discussion; it means that the 25-year-old trust funder is paying less in tax than his counterpart who fixes computers for a living.
Tax fairness depends on overall burdens, not just who does and who doesn't pay how much income tax. The federal tax system has become overwhelmingly skewed to burden work. Why? Because the link between payroll taxes and retirement security is political fiction. The average person retiring today cannot expect to collect in Social Security what he paid in taxes.
Removing or raising the $113,700 earnings cap over which you do not have to pay payroll taxes would reduce the tax's regressivity, but it would not address our unequal treatment of earners with different sources of income.
April 15 is as good a time as any to think about how we can readjust the federal tax burden so that both workers and investors pay their fair share to finance the many and varied federal programs -- including retirement security -- that we deem worthy of our tax dollars.

HEADLINE: Indentured Servitude in the Persian Gulf

BYLINE: By RICHARD MORIN. 
A former polling editor at The Washington Post and a visiting scholar at the Social and Economic Survey Research Institute at Qatar University.

 BODY:
DOHA, Qatar
LAST year, Theresa M. Dantes signed a contract with an employment agency in the Philippines to come here to work as a housemaid for $400 a month, plus room and board. But when she arrived, her employer said he would pay her only $250. She acquiesced; her family back in Quezon City depended on her earnings.
Other surprises quickly followed. Ms. Dantes, 29, said she was fed one meal a day, leftovers from the family's lunch: ''If no leftovers, I didn't eat.'' She worked seven days a week. When she finished work in her employer's house, she was forced to clean his mother-in-law's house, and then his sister's. 
After eight months, Ms. Dantes tried to leave. Her boss laughed. ''You can't quit,'' he told her.
Under kafala, the system that governs the working lives of every foreigner employed in Qatar, Ms. Dantes could not resign without her employer's permission. She fled and joined 56 other women who had sought shelter at the Philippine Overseas Labor Office.
Some 1.2 million foreign workers -- mostly poor Asians from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Indonesia and the Philippines -- make up 94 percent of the labor force in Qatar, an absolute monarchy roughly the size of Connecticut.
Developed in the late 1950s in sparsely populated Persian Gulf states that needed workers for their oil and gas industries, the system has expanded to the point where there are nearly five foreign workers for each Qatari citizen. Perhaps a million foreign workers are expected to arrive in the next few years to help build nine new stadiums and $20 billion in roads needed by 2022, when Qatar will host the World Cup.
Many of these workers will labor under near-feudal conditions that Human Rights Watch has likened to ''forced labor.'' Qatari employers assume legal responsibility for their employees in addition to providing them with a paid job, a work visa, housing and often food. In exchange, an employee agrees to work for an employer for a fixed length of time.
But a worker cannot change jobs, leave the country, get a driver's license, rent a home or open a checking account without the permission of his or her employer-sponsor, or kafeel. And a kafeel also can withdraw sponsorship at almost any time and send the employee home.
It's not just housemaids and other low-skilled workers who are the victims. An Arab-American businessman, Nasser Beydoun, said he spent 685 days as an ''economic hostage'' in Doha before he was released in October 2011. After he quit as chief executive of a local restaurant chain, his former employer denied him a permit to leave Qatar.
''Foreign workers in Qatar are modern-day slaves to their local employers,'' Mr. Beydoun, who now lives in Detroit, told me. ''The local Qatari owns you.''
Only about half of foreign blue-collar workers sign formal work contracts before coming to Qatar, according to a poll by the Social and Economic Survey Research Institute at Qatar University. The rest come with nothing more than a verbal agreement.
Even a formal contract offers inadequate protection. A quarter of the blue-collar workers who signed contracts said employers failed to fully honor the agreements, the poll found. That proportion increased to 42 percent among the third who made less than $275 a month.
Under pressure from human rights and labor advocates, the government has promised new protections. ''Seven, eight years ago we didn't have labor laws,'' said Hussein al-Mulla, under secretary of the Labor Ministry. ''It is better now than before. It will be better in the future.''
The ministry has created a phone line for workers to anonymously report abuses, and a system of arbitrating labor disputes. Employers now must report paycheck details to the Labor Ministry. The country is finalizing a law setting occupational health and safety standards and a charter of workers' rights.
But new laws are not enough. ''The challenge is enforcement of these laws and establishing a new work culture,'' Andrew Gardner, an anthropologist at the University of Puget Sound who studies gulf laborers, told me. ''The scope of the problem is so large and the number of foreigners is growing so quickly.''
Most construction workers, security guards, household staffers and service workers come to Qatar through personnel agencies, which are hired by prospective employers and draw up the contracts. Officials in some sending countries are supposed to review the contract before they issue exit visas.
The average recruiting fee for a blue-collar worker, according to the poll, is almost $1,000 for a job that typically pays about $470 a month. Most workers have to borrow to pay the fee. Among workers earning $275 or less, 80 percent take at least three months just to earn back their recruiting fee; nearly a third take six months or longer.
Foreign workers in Qatar, which has no minimum-wage law, have little recourse if they are offered wages lower than they expected, and the high fees the personnel agencies charge give employers no incentive to free their employees from their obligations.
Remarkably, some migrant workers help circumvent the very laws intended to protect them. Francisco Moceros, 50, a driver-for-hire here, said he signed a work contract for $340 a month -- the Philippine government's minimum -- at an employment agency in Manila, but is paid $220. The recruiter said the listed salary was a sham, Mr. Moceros said, but he signed anyway.
Qatar's 250,000 citizens are among the world's richest, with a gross national income (adjusted for relative purchasing power) of $87,478 last year -- about double the figure in the United States.
The typical household is served by a staff of three. Some 95 percent of Qatari families employ a housemaid; more than half have two or more. A recent survey by the research institute found that nearly 9 in 10 Qataris did not want to see the kafala system weakened; if anything, 30 percent said they wanted to see employers' prerogatives strengthened.
This means that reform efforts ''must go slowly,'' Mr. Mulla, of the Labor Ministry, told me. In 2009, neighboring Bahrain allowed foreign workers to freely change jobs. Mr. Mulla agrees that the Qatari system must change: ''It will be better -- or it will be history.''
Until it does get better, indentured servitude on the Persian Gulf will live on.

HEADLINE: Mentors Are Good. Sponsors Are Better.

BYLINE: By SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT. 
Sylvia Ann Hewlett, an economist, is the founding president and C.E.O. of the Center for Talent Innovation in Manhattan and the author of ''Forget a Mentor, Find a Sponsor,'' forthcoming from Harvard Business Review Press.

 BODY:
AS Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook tells it, what accounts for her spectacular leap to leadership is her unfettered embrace of career opportunity. By ''leaning in,'' she maintains in her new book, she has been able to join the male-dominated ranks of corporate executives.
But it's simply not enough for a woman to put her self-doubt aside, grab hold of ambition and aim for the top, as Ms. Sandberg advises. A woman needs someone to lean in with her. That's according to recent research by the Center for Talent Innovation, an organization I founded that focuses on advancing women and minorities. 
To get ahead, women need to acquire a sponsor -- a powerfully positioned champion -- to help them escape the ''marzipan layer,'' that sticky middle slice of management where so many driven and talented women languish.
Our two-year study, which sampled some 12,000 men and women in white-collar occupations across the United States and Britain, shows how sponsorship -- unlike mentorship, its weaker cousin -- makes a measurable difference in career progress.
Mentorship, let's be clear, is a relatively loose relationship. Mentors act as a sounding board or a shoulder to cry on, offering advice as needed and support and guidance as requested; they expect very little in return. Sponsors, in contrast, are much more vested in their protgs, offering guidance and critical feedback because they believe in them.
Sponsors advocate on their protgs' behalf, connecting them to important players and assignments. In doing so, they make themselves look good. And precisely because sponsors go out on a limb, they expect stellar performance and loyalty.
A sponsor can lean in on a woman's behalf, apprising others of her exceptional performance and keeping her on the fast track. With such a person -- male or female -- in her corner, our data shows, a woman is more likely to ask for a big opportunity, to seek a raise and to be satisfied with her rate of advancement.
Ms. Sandberg does talk about the importance of mentors and sponsors in her book, but she doesn't really distinguish between the two, nor does she discuss the measurable benefits of sponsorship.
Just look at what sponsorship did for Ms. Sandberg. Clearly, she brought a great deal of achievement to the table, but as she acknowledges, she also secured a champion in the form of Lawrence H. Summers, who selected her as his research assistant. She followed him to the World Bank and the United States Treasury, where she ended up, at 29, as his chief of staff. This, in turn, positioned her for a megawatt career, making her visible to the likes of Eric Schmidt at Google and then Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook.
It's not easy to find a sponsor. You need to earn this kind of investment. ''Sponsorship only works when it's a two-way street,'' says Patricia Fili-Krushel, chairwoman of the news group at NBCUniversal. ''It can't be just 'Gimme, gimme, gimme -- I need help, I need advice.' '' You must demonstrate that you'll deliver outstanding performance -- ''you've got to consistently make your boss look good,'' she says.
''Trust is at the heart of this relationship,'' says Kerrie Peraino, global head of talent at American Express. ''When I put my faith in up-and-coming talent and become their sponsor, I need to know I can totally depend on them -- because they are, after all, walking around with my brand on.''
It's in this area of trust that women and minorities often fail to get the help they need. When it comes to figuring out whom to sponsor, senior leaders -- typically white men -- most readily turn to the people they feel most comfortable with. Most often, that means other white men. Employers need to work to counteract this natural tendency.
SINCE we started our research, companies that have created paths to sponsorship include American Express, AT&T, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deloitte, Genentech and Morgan Stanley. They recognize that while powerful advocacy needs to be earned, potential sponsors need to be better apprised of who is worthy of their investment. While sponsorship can't be forced, it can be made more transparent and accessible to high-potential employees who aren't white and male.
It doesn't quite take a village, but breaking into the white-boys' club takes more than individual effort. No matter how fiercely you lean in, you still need someone with power to lean in with you.

HEADLINE: The Data Filters Are Clogged Again

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
ROBERT HEILBRONER, the author and economist, was often asked where interest rates, the stock market and the economy were heading.
He would say he had no idea, though few non-economists believed him. As he wrote in The New Yorker in 1991, people thought he was hoarding the inside dope so he could make a killing on his own.
Alas, it wasn't so. He really couldn't foresee the future of financial markets, or of wages and prices, or of economic production -- and he was sure that no one else could, either. Financial and economic forecasting was more art than science, he said. Yet there was a voracious demand for it. 
But why? At least Mr. Heilbroner could answer that question. ''The human psyche can tolerate a great deal of prospective misery,'' he wrote, ''but it cannot bear the thought that the future is beyond all power of anticipation.''
Two decades later, financial and economic forecasting has advanced technologically. Vast quantities of data are being analyzed and repackaged in inventive ways. Yet even the Federal Reserve has no certainty about where we are heading, notwithstanding its monumental and largely successful campaign to bolster the value of financial assets, from homes to stocks and bonds.
Is the economy slowing? Is the stock market's epic rally preparing for a big fall? Are interest rates rising or falling?
There is a torrent of fresh numbers, but they form an ambiguous pattern.
Consider the employment outlook, perhaps the most crucial issue for working people and for the economy's health. The Labor Department's report on April 5 was discouraging at best. It showed that American employers added only 88,000 jobs last month, versus 268,000 in February.
That was the slowest pace since June, less than half the number that economists had expected. And the unemployment rate stood at 7.6 percent, shockingly high for a recovery that is nearly four years old. The rate would be even higher if not for the unusually large numbers of working-age people who have dropped out of the job market. There is very little to cheer about here.
On Thursday, the Labor Department issued a happier report. Initial jobless claims dropped by 42,000, to a seasonally adjusted rate of 346,000 in the week ended April 6, the biggest decline since November, and better than economists had predicted. Job losses may be moderating, even if job creation is too slow to put many people back to work.
There's more. The effects of the federal government's budget sequestration -- $85 billion in spending cuts -- are just beginning to be felt. It's not clear whether there will be a big multiplier effect, amplifying unemployment and sapping growth, as Washington tightens the spigot and government spending shrinks nationwide.
The Fed, which has a mandate to promote ''maximum employment,'' hasn't made up its mind about the state of the current labor market. At its last meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee said it was ''not yet confident'' that the Fed's low-interest, expansionary monetary policy had ensured an improving outlook for jobs. And the policy makers worried about the risks of financial storms in Europe and elsewhere. That's drawn from the minutes of the Fed meeting, which were inadvertently released on Tuesday afternoon, a day early, to a small group of bankers and others in an embarrassing breach of protocol. On Wednesday morning, after the general public finally got the news, the stock market resumed its long rally, with major indexes reaching new highs.
That may be because the Fed's uncertainty about the economy's strength suggests that it will keep adding fuel to financial markets. Its policies appear to have ''supported gains in asset prices and encouraged the flow of credit to households and businesses,'' the minutes said.
In fact, that old Wall Street mantra, ''Don't fight the Fed,'' has generally been a good guide to financial markets, if not the rest of the economy, since the bull market in stocks began in 2009.
But the minutes also suggested that the Fed was worrying more about the risk of continuing its policies. In a close reading of the text, David Rosenberg, the chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff in Toronto, found that the word ''risk'' appeared 27 times in the new minutes, compared with eight in December and five in October.
Yet Wall Street isn't acting as though it expects the party to end soon. Perhaps that's because another bank with deep pockets, the Bank of Japan, has started a new asset-buying spree of its own.
''Now that the Fed has another central bank joining them, watch out!'' said Joseph Carson, director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein. ''What happens when they all run out of assets to buy?'' He noted that the Bank of Japan said it would buy about $600 billion of bonds and other assets in each of the next two years -- roughly doubling the size of its balance sheet. That bank is focused on reviving Japan's economy, but borders are porous and money flows are global.
Already, rising asset values have restored total household net worth in the United States, which took a beating during the financial crisis, Mr. Carson said. After peaking at $67.4 trillion in 2007, household net worth dropped to $51.4 trillion in 2009, according to Fed figures. But he estimates that it reached $68 trillion in the first quarter this year.
That's great news for those with substantial financial assets.
''It's fair to say that people in the upper-income brackets, who have the financial assets, have recovered much more rapidly,'' Mr. Carson said. ''Prices of financial assets have been rising rapidly. Wages have not. Job creation has not.'' People in less exalted income brackets are still struggling.
That helps explain why the recovery has been so uneven. And, despite the conspicuous efforts of the central banks, it helps explain why the economy's prospects are so uncertain.

HEADLINE: Public Pensions in Bankruptcy Court

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Devastated by the recession, the city of Stockton, Calif., is trying to renegotiate its debts in a bankruptcy case that could set an important precedent on whether courts can forcibly reduce the pensions of government employees. 
Like many cities hit hard by the bursting of the housing bubble, Stockton found its finances in a mess. Even after drastic cuts to city services that have sent the crime rate soaring, the city of 300,000 people about 80 miles east of San Francisco has an annual budget deficit of $26 million. It has laid off a quarter of its police force, which has meant that officers often respond only to crimes in progress.
The city's crisis is not unique. San Bernardino in Southern California has also sought bankruptcy protection, and numerous other municipalities in the state and elsewhere are on a financial precipice. To fix its finances, Stockton is asking the bankruptcy court to restructure debts totaling about $250 million. But the city's creditors, which include bondholders and insurance companies that have guaranteed some of its bonds, say the plans are unfair. They want the city to reduce the $30 million it spends annually on pension benefits for its 2,400 retirees.
Unlike private companies, which have often renegotiated labor contracts in bankruptcy, few municipalities have sought bankruptcy protection and used it to reduce vested pensions. The California Public Employees' Retirement System, which manages Stockton's pensions, argues that the state's Constitution and court rulings forbid state and local governments from ever lowering the pensions of retirees and current employees.
The creditors assert that federal bankruptcy law, which lets judges break contracts, should trump state law. So far, city officials have said they do not intend to trim pensions, though they have reduced health benefits for retirees.
The case raises many fundamental and difficult questions about whether federal bankruptcy law should pre-empt state laws. Many legal analysts say that the Stockton case could eventually be appealed to the Supreme Court.
While a Supreme Court decision would help clarify an important area of the law, a drawn-out court case is the last thing Stockton needs. The way to get the city back on its feet is for city officials, creditors and retirees to negotiate a fair settlement quickly. Sophisticated investors and bond insurers have to recognize that they made terrible decisions when they lent the city money during the bubble years and will have to take big losses. Retirees, especially those who were awarded unsustainably generous pensions and health care benefits, should also come to the table by forming a committee, as the bankruptcy judge recently suggested. There are few winners in bankruptcy. It is time for all sides to acknowledge that reality.

HEADLINE: How Should We Rank Margaret Thatcher?

BYLINE: By DAVID CANNADINE. 
A professor of history at Princeton and the author, most recently, of ''The Undivided Past: Humanity Beyond Our Differences.''

 BODY:
ON Wednesday, Margaret Thatcher's funeral, at St Paul's Cathedral in London, will put her in the company of only three other Britons in more than 200 years: Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington and Sir Winston Churchill.
To Mrs. Thatcher's admirers, this is entirely appropriate: she made Britain great again; she was the longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century; and she was the first and only woman to hold that post.
But to her detractors, such elaborate obsequies are wholly inappropriate: imperial pomp that is out of place in post-imperial Britain, a state-funded extravaganza that seems a self-indulgent luxury at a time when government spending is being drastically cut. Hence the demands that the funeral should be privatized by obtaining some form of commercial sponsorship, and hence the threats of protests and demonstrations on the day itself.
Like Churchill before her, Mrs. Thatcher was always more uncritically admired in the United States than in Britain. Here she was a world leader, of unrivaled charisma and authority; there she was a partisan politician, who regarded her enemies as knaves or fools -- or Marxists. 
Yet as the disagreements over her funeral arrangements vividly demonstrate, Mrs. Thatcher is dividing and polarizing opinion as much in death as she invariably did in life. This seems a fittingly controversial legacy for someone who loathed the concept of consensus and who often seemed to relish making enemies more than making friends.
Not surprisingly, the tributes paid to Mrs. Thatcher in the House of Commons last week were laden with ironies aplenty. The Conservatives hailed her as their heroine and inspiration; but they had ruthlessly bundled her out of Downing Street in 1990 because they (rightly) feared she had become a liability with the voters; and since 1992, the Tories have not won a parliamentary majority at any general election.
Meanwhile, successive Labour speakers sought to distance themselves from many of her policies and most of her legacy, yet their party became electable under Tony Blair only because he was in many ways Mrs. Thatcher's self-proclaimed heir.
Mrs. Thatcher was a more complex personality and contradictory politician than the true-blue-rinse, pearls-and-twin-set, Britannia-meets-Gloriana caricature so beloved by her admirers and reviled by her opponents. She achieved more as a woman in public life than ever seemed possible in her generation; but feminists reciprocated her undoubted dislike of them; and having married a rich man, she enjoyed many advantages denied to most of her gender. She also claimed to be a ''conviction politician''; but before 1974, those convictions were the conventional welfare-state pieties of postwar consensus Toryism, and she won the 1979 general election by not being Labour rather than by being the Thatcherite she later became.
In winning two more electoral victories, Mrs. Thatcher achieved undoubted and unprecedented success at the ballot box; but she was also the beneficiary of an opposition that was deeply divided between the fledgling Social Democrats and a Labour Party more extreme in its policies than at any stage in its modern existence.
THERE were many areas of Britain where she never played well: especially Scotland, Wales, parts of Northern Ireland and the inner cities. Although she was much more interested in ideas than Mr. Blair would ever be, most intellectuals loathed her, and she had many enemies in the universities, the BBC, the Church of England and the trade unions. So while Mrs. Thatcher was a self-proclaimed populist politician, she was never all that popular with the majority of the British people.
Nor was her record in power one of single-minded action or single-handed success. To be sure, she authorized the sale of public council houses to their tenants and the privatization of nationalized industries, and she broke the militant trade unions. But the decline of such traditional, 19th-century industries as coal and steel, and of the organized labor on which they depended, was occurring throughout the Western world: Mrs. Thatcher merely intensified (and celebrated) a trend already well in train.
After her 11 years in power, government spending was still high, the reach of the centralized state had been increased rather than diminished, and for all her claims to have rekindled the spirit of enterprise, the rate of economic growth during the 1980s was little better than during the 1970s.
In foreign affairs, Mrs. Thatcher's record was equally mixed. She gambled everything on getting back the Falkland Islands from Argentina, and she scored a spectacular triumph. But it was a close-run thing; if she had lost, she would have been the most derided British prime minister since Anthony Eden in the aftermath of the Suez Canal fiasco in 1956; whereas instead she became the most acclaimed war leader since Churchill.
But elsewhere, Mrs. Thatcher was less belligerently defiant and more pragmatically accommodating: not only in the case of Hong Kong, where she initiated negotiations with China that would culminate in the 1997 transfer, but also in Rhodesia, where she was determined to face down the Tory right, and bring about an independence settlement. And although she was viscerally opposed to the reunification of Germany, there was nothing she could do to stop it in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
As for her ''special relationship'' with Ronald Reagan: the personal chemistry was there, and they put on a terrific public show of mutual admiration, even surpassing in that regard the earlier partnership of Churchill and Roosevelt. But as Richard Aldous has recently shown in his study of the two leaders, revealingly subtitled ''the difficult relationship,'' the private reality was often very different.
There were some in the Reagan administration who supported Argentina rather than Britain over the Falklands, and the president came down on Mrs. Thatcher's side only at the 11th hour. As Sir Nicholas Henderson, then the British ambassador to Washington, later recalled, ''if I reported to you what Mrs. Thatcher really thought about President Reagan, it would damage Anglo-American relations.'' Thereafter, the two of them disagreed on foreign affairs at least as much as they saw eye to eye.
Beyond a doubt, Mrs. Thatcher was the dominant British public figure of her generation: for most of her time at 10 Downing Street, her mastery of the cabinet, the Commons and the Conservative Party was exceptional; her energy, patriotism and courage were conceded even by her most bitter opponents; and she captured and kept the political initiative to a degree that has not been true of any other British prime minister in living memory.
But she was at least as much a product of her times as she was the master of them, and Thatcherism was not so much a coherent creed as it was something she made up as she went along. Like many public figures, Margaret Thatcher had a touching and nave concern about ''the verdict of history,'' but in her case, the only certainty is this: there will be never be agreement as to what that verdict should be.

HEADLINE: Heavier Trucks From Mexico Could Prove a Boon for Texas

BYLINE: By AMAN BATHEJA. 
abatheja@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Each year, just before they approach the United States border, thousands of truck drivers hauling produce from western Mexico to southern Texas stop in the city of Reynosa to lighten their loads.
Mexico allows heavier trucks on its roads than Texas does. To avoid being charged a fine -- which averages about $110 -- when they reach Texas, drivers routinely drop off a few pallets of bell peppers, avocados, tomatoes or watermelons to be picked up by lighter trucks before crossing one of Hidalgo County's international bridges, according to Keith Patridge, president of the McAllen Economic Development Corporation, which promotes commerce in both McAllen and Reynosa.
The transfer can be costly. ''In a 100-degree day, if you're out jostling produce around, it reduces the quality of the product,'' Mr. Patridge said. 
State Representative Sergio Muoz Jr., Democrat of Mission, wants to put an end to those detours. He has filed legislation that would allow trucks to pay an $80 fee in exchange for crossing the border overweight.
That change, along with the construction of a highway in Mexico that the United States Department of Agriculture predicts will spark a surge in refrigerated trucks entering Hidalgo County, could set off an economic boom, Mr. Muoz said.
''It's just a huge amount of economic development that's going to occur with the increased traffic,'' he said. ''It's not going to be only for South Texas, but it's going to be increased commerce for the state.''
Mexican officials are finishing the Mazatln-Matamoros Corridor, a highway that will provide a direct route between Mexico's western growing regions and South Texas. The road is expected to accelerate a shift of Mexican produce trucks entering the United States to Hidalgo County from Nogales, Ariz., for quicker access to East Coast markets.
''For the Mexican produce industry, it's a no-brainer,'' said Richard Sanchez, Mr. Muoz's chief of staff. ''They're going to save about six hours' travel time coming through South Texas.''
Mr. Munoz's bill would direct money from the $80 fees to road maintenance related to damage from the heavier trucks. The Texas Department of Transportation already oversees three corridors for overweight trucks in other parts of the state; this new one would be the first to apply only to produce trucks. Arizona has a similar system for overweight trucks crossing the border near Nogales.
John McClung, who oversees boarder issues for the Texas International Produce Association, said vegetable and fruit sellers are willing to pay the fee to avoid unloading cargo before reaching one of the cold storage facilities in and around McAllen, Hidalgo County's largest city.
The produce is typically unloaded at those warehouses and prepared for redistribution around the country. More facilities are being built in the county to prepare for increased produce truck traffic.
''It is just that first few miles in the U.S. that is the concern,'' Mr. McClung said.
Some lawmakers initially wondered whether an $80 fee was too low. State Transportation Department officials told a House committee that the fee would cover the costs of road repair.
Mr. Muoz's bill passed the House on Thursday without debate. Senator Juan Hinojosa, Democrat of McAllen, has filed a companion bill in the Senate.
Carlos Zambito, the marketing director of the McAllen Produce Terminal Market, where hundreds of trucks transfer produce daily, said the measure would mean fewer trucks passing through the area.
And if truck drivers are able to skip a detour, the measure could also lead to fresher produce at thousands of grocery stores.
''In perishables,'' Mr. Zambito said, ''every hour counts.''

HEADLINE: W.N.B.A. Hopes Griner Can Change Perceptions, As Well as Game Itself

BYLINE: By JER LONGMAN

 BODY:
Forget for a moment whether Brittney Griner has the skill to play in the N.B.A. There are more urgent and relevant questions. One is whether she will thrive as a primary face of the W.N.B.A.'s campaign to rebrand itself in its 17th season, beginning with its first prime-time draft Monday.
Another question is whether Griner will become as transformative off the court as she has been on the court.
Even before she plays her first game, her influence has been significant. A decade ago, W.N.B.A. officials might have been reluctant to celebrate as a standard-bearer of the league someone who did not conform to conventional standards of femininity, said Mary Jo Kane, the director of the Tucker Center for Research on Girls and Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota. 
''You cannot ignore her athleticism, and the W.N.B.A. has not tried to isolate or marginalize Griner,'' Kane said.
''That is a rather remarkable and fundamental shift.''
To be determined, Kane said, is whether Griner and her towering skill and engaging personality will defy the odds and attract corporate sponsors as part of widespread public acceptance four decades after passage of the gender-equity legislation known as Title IX.
It is rare for female athletes to receive endorsements, especially in team sports, and particularly among those who do not play up their feminine side, yet significant shifts are occurring in the appreciation of women, Kane said.
''That's the $64,000 question,'' Kane said. ''Tiger Woods just said, 'Winning takes care of everything.' We're about to see with Brittney Griner.''
The 6-foot-8 Griner is expected to be the No. 1 overall draft pick by the Phoenix Mercury. She has become a focal point of a league that has a new logo, an extended television deal with ESPN and an orchestrated drive to promote three highly visible rookies: Griner of Baylor, Skylar Diggins of Notre Dame and Elena Delle Donne of Delaware.
Although the W.N.B.A. and Griner's agent declined to discuss specific marketing campaigns and endorsement possibilities, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, her agent, wrote in an e-mail: ''It's the age of innovation, of advocacy, and 'authentic' is what sells. And here comes Brittney, equal parts provocative, brave, playful and humble, a skater kid in a basketball player's body who is true to herself and dressed in tomboy clothes. She's radical in the most charming and relevant way because she embraces what makes her different.''
Griner, 22, sometimes appears shy or reserved at news conferences, but she can be funny and endearingly goofy when she lets her guard down. She rides a longboard, eats bacon at pregame meals for good luck and surely is among the world's most accomplished shot-blocking kayakers.
''I'm up for the challenge,'' Griner said of being central to the league's rebranding effort. ''I changed stuff in college basketball, I guess you could say, so I'm up for it. I never shy from anything. Whatever's thrown at me, I'm ready for it.''
The W.N.B.A. has far outlived other women's basketball leagues in the United States. It remains the gold standard internationally. The level of play and coaching has never been higher. Yet it remains a summer league whose players spend the rest of the year with professional club teams in places like Russia, Turkey and China.
Television viewership has dropped considerably since the league's inception in 1997. And, after drawing more than 10,000 spectators a game in two of its first three seasons, the W.N.B.A. hit an average attendance low last year of 7,457, which league officials attributed largely to a struggling economy and a shutdown during the London Olympics.
Laurel Richie, the president of the W.N.B.A., said she thought it was time to reassess everything about the league.
''I think we're going to look back at 2013, 10 to 20 years from now, and say it was a really important year in the history of the W.N.B.A.,'' she said.
The league replaced its logo, a design that resembled the N.B.A. emblem of a player dribbling the ball. Jerry West with a bob, some called it dismissively. The new W.N.B.A. logo depicts a player driving to the basket and is meant to reflect the league's ethnic diversity and athleticism.
The campaign to spotlight Griner, Diggins and Delle Donne is a continuation of ESPN's ''3 to See'' promotion during the recent college season. It suggests a realization that women's basketball must provide a united front to succeed.
''It seems they're beginning to figure out a triumvirate of relationships needed for a 24-hour, 12-month season for women's basketball,'' said Helen Wheelock, who operates the Women's Hoops Blog. ''That means there has to be a conscious connection between the N.C.A.A., ESPN and the W.N.B.A. It has not been a really successful partnership. It's been push-pull.''
The league's contract extension with ESPN -- worth $12 million a year, or $1 million a team -- runs through the 2022 season. The network is satisfied with the league's following, said John Skipper, ESPN's president, although broadcasts reached a low of 262,000 viewers a game in 2012.
One W.N.B.A. challenge, Skipper said, is fending off unrealistic expectations. It took the N.B.A. 15 seasons to average 10,000 fans, officials said. And as recently as 1981, more than three decades into the league's existence, the N.B.A. finals were broadcast on tape delay.
Of the W.N.B.A. he said, ''If you drew it up 15 years ago and said, 'Here's where you'd be,' if you were reasonable, you'd go, 'It's doing fine.' ''
For viewership and attendance to grow at a desired level, though, Skipper said the league must enhance its marketing efforts and, most important, ''They've got to have some players who people really care about.''
That is why Griner becomes so important. Perhaps no other player has entered the W.N.B.A. with such visibility. At Baylor, Griner probably had the greatest impact of any player in the women's game, setting an N.C.A.A. record for blocked shots, finishing second on the career scoring list and making the highlight shows with her dunks. In the 2012-13 season, opponents averaged 3,642 more fans for their home games against Baylor.
The W.N.B.A. and ESPN are hoping that Griner will create similar buzz as a pro. Beginning Memorial Day, Phoenix is scheduled to appear in 6 of the 14 regular-season games carried by ESPN and ABC. Plans are being explored leaguewide for innovations like cameras worn by referees, lower camera angles and increased viewer access to practices and locker rooms.
Since her emergence in high school in Houston, Griner has stimulated widespread discussion about precepts concerning female athletes: Could women, as Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, recently suggested, play in the N.B.A.? Could women be appreciated as athletes and help redefine beauty? And, when Griner punched another player as a freshman at Baylor, she even raised questions about whether women's sports were growing more violent.
''Brittney is an interesting conversation for people to have,'' said Dawn Trudeau, a co-owner of the Seattle Storm.
Griner turns pro at a time when the W.N.B.A., with 6 of 12 teams independently owned, is distancing itself somewhat from the N.B.A. and comparisons to men's basketball. The league appears increasingly comfortable with its diverse fan base, described by Richie, the league president, as followers who ''have a love of basketball and very progressive views on gender roles in society.''
It seems likely that in the W.N.BA., Griner will largely avoid the taunting and homophobic slurs she faced in college, sometimes mercilessly, about her somewhat androgynous appearance and deep voice. She plans to use her platform as a pro to advocate against bullying.
Although some people will remain negative toward female athletes, Trudeau said, ''People who watch the sport and watch Brittney are excited for what she can do; I don't think they are put off by how she looks or anything like that.''
In pure basketball terms, the pro game will require some adjustment for Griner. The teams are relatively evenly matched, and victory or defeat can rest on a possession or two; Baylor frequently prevailed in blowouts. Play is also much more physical in the W.N.B.A.; although Griner has developed a poised demeanor since the punching episode, jostling seemed to bother her in Baylor's recent N.C.A.A. tournament loss to Louisville.
''Her coach went off, saying it was too physical for her,'' said Bill Laimbeer, the coach and general manager of the Liberty. ''But that's an everyday occurrence in the W.N.B.A.''
This season, Griner and other centers should have more space to maneuver. The 3-point line will be extended to 22 feet 1  inches from 20-6 . And a technical foul will be assessed if a defender spends more than three seconds in the lane without actively guarding an offensive player.
''No more two and three people and the whole team sitting around Brittney,'' Griner said with a laugh.
What happens off the court will also be telling, said Kane, the Minnesota professor. Will Griner receive any endorsements?
''I will be cautiously optimistic she will break through that barrier in terms of corporate sponsorship,'' Kane said of Griner. ''But I think the odds are very long. If it happens, it would be groundbreaking.''

HEADLINE: Israel's Hard Drive

BYLINE: By DANNA HARMAN. 
Danna Harman is a features writer for Haaretz in Israel.

 BODY:
WHEN the Technion class of 1957 graduated, its members got together and wrote a letter of complaint to their prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, who was otherwise busy building a nation. ''There were no jobs for us in our fields,'' recalls Gideon F. Inbar, an electrical engineer who is now 79. ''My wife kept saying, 'Oy, things are grim, grim, grim.' ''
In 2013, the student body has pretty much the opposite problem.
''Officially, the rule is that first- and second-year students should not take outside jobs,'' says Peretz Lavie, president of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Cornell's partner in creating an ambitious graduate school for applied science and engineering in New York City. Mr. Lavie, a psychophysiologist who periodically ducks out of his roomy hilltop office to check in on his sleep-disorder laboratories and two start-up companies, acknowledges that exceptions are made. Often. Because getting out and ahead in the work force is, in many ways, the very idea. 
''They turn a blind eye,'' says Asaad Malshy, 24, who is studying physics and electrical engineering while working two afternoons a week at Intel, one of Israel's largest employers. ''I used to dream that I would finish university and get a job in high tech,'' he says, ''until I realized the dream was already in reach.''
It's a weekday evening during exam period. Mr. Malshy is at the game center in the student union, where young men and women are slouching on couches behind Falcon flight simulators or facing off in FIFA 13 soccer matches on a wall of monitors -- each one with a knapsack still strapped firmly onto both shoulders.
''It's a pressure cooker here and doing O.K. requires a lot of effort,'' Mr. Malshy says. ''This university consumes you, and you don't get a break if you have a job, or even if you start your own company.'' He adds with a grin: ''You still have to pass advanced integral algebra.''
But if the Technion refuses to coddle its charges -- about 9,000 undergraduates and 3,800 graduate students -- Intel, I.B.M., Microsoft and Yahoo and the like make up for it. All have set up offices along a direct bus route from student housing, recruit heavily from the student body and offer working hours that take those advanced integral algebra exams into account.
Much as Silicon Valley popped up around Stanford, and Route 128 came to symbolize high technology because of its proximity to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, so the Technion has transformed the sleepy northern city of Haifa into a buzzy high-tech center.
In a country known as start-up nation, this is not the only university where students can bury themselves in robotics, engineering and computer science labs, but it is generally considered the best. When M.I.T. is mentioned in a movie showing in Israel -- ''American Pie,'' for example -- the Hebrew subtitle simply says ''Technion.''
Conceived by the Zionist Congress in 1905, in part as a response to the exclusion of Jews from engineering studies in Europe, the Technion finally opened in 1923, when there were no Hebrew words for most of the technical terms needed to teach a basic engineering class. Since then, the university has come up with more than just translations for ''aerodynamic'' and ''nuclear.''
''I can say without exaggeration that Israel could not have been built without the Technion,'' says Yossi Vardi, who has founded or helped build more than 60 companies in Israel and has five degrees from the Technion. ''There is a Technion graduate behind practically every highway, desalinization plant, new missile technology and start-up company in the country.''
This is not mere school spirit talking. According to Shlomo Maital, senior research fellow at the Samuel Neaman Institute for Advanced Studies in Science and Technology, a fourth of the university's 60,000 alumni who are of working age have, at one time or another, initiated a business, and a fourth are C.E.O.'s or vice presidents. The annual output of graduates in high-tech industries is estimated to be at least $21 billion. Among inventions from Technion research labs: the memory stick, drip irrigation, the Parkinson's drug rasagiline, the iron dome air defense system and instant messaging.
''Just how does the Technion do it?'' Mr. Lavie asks himself, clearly amazed.
EMBEDDED in the Haifa curriculum is learn by doing. Interdisciplinary courses that combine business and innovation -- like ''Technological Entrepreneurship,'' taught by Dan Shechtman, a Nobel laureate in chemistry -- are the most popular on campus.
The curriculum at the Technion-Cornell Innovation Institute will be similarly multidisciplinary. The institute is a major component of the new Cornell Tech campus scheduled to open on Roosevelt Island in 2017 and currently being rolled out in temporary headquarters in Chelsea. Craig Gotsman, a Technion computer science professor with two start-ups under his belt, will direct the institute, which will ultimately be responsible for a third of the academic activity on campus. Next year, the institute will begin recruiting students who are interested in ''connective media,'' one of three focal hubs (the others: ''healthier life'' and ''built environment'').
The hope is to build an ecosystem like Haifa's, where industry and academics feed off each other. And, says Mr. Gotsman, ''to provide the necessary background and skills to top off the typical science/engineering degree offered in the United States, which, while providing fundamentals, does not fully prepare students for hands-on, cutting-edge work in an industrial environment.''
Mr. Vardi, a Technion board member and one of Israel's most high-profile entrepreneurs, puts it more simply: ''What the Technion is really bringing is its genes. It's like bringing in genes from outside the family.'' When tasked with explaining where the innovative fervor comes from, Israelis often refer to DNA -- a belief that there is something genetic in the determination of its students.
''Teaching entrepreneurship is extremely difficult,'' says Saul Singer, co-author of ''Start-Up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle.'' ''But it is clear that to succeed in it, your students have to understand something about being on a mission. You have to know what it is to be part of something larger than yourself.'' Immigrants and soldiers, he says, understand. Military experience, mandated in Israel, instills leadership, teamwork, improvisation, obedience and sacrifice, and means students are older and more focused. Israel is also a country of newcomers, he adds, hungry for success, willing to take risks and good at adapting to new situations.
Alon Wolf, who directs the biorobotics and biomechanics lab at the Technion, has another theory. ''People say it's the army, or the stressful, uncertain life in Israel that makes youngsters resilient and pushes them to think out of the box and find a way ahead,'' says Professor Wolf, who of course has a promising start-up of his own. ''But I'm telling you, it's the Jewish mother. I look at my wife'' -- who happens to be an industrial engineer at the Technion -- ''she is on the kids' case day and night. Did you do your homework? Good. Now, what was it about? Why did they give you that homework? And what about your extracurricular activities? Tell me about that.''
Others talk of chutzpah, the same cultural trait of audacity and arrogance that propelled the class of 1957 to write to the prime minister to complain about not finding good jobs, and that continues to propel so many current graduates as they charge into industry.
''Israelis will not hesitate to tell me how wrong I am, even though I have gray hair and 40 years of experience,'' says Mr. Maital of the Neaman Institute, who was born in Canada and has taught at universities around the world, including M.I.T. ''They are not afraid of risk, and will start companies even though the odds are against them. And they will not hesitate to leave a well-paying job if their innovative ideas are shelved.''
Mr. Malshy doesn't buy into the chutzpah culture. He does not have a Jewish mother, did not serve in the army and is not an immigrant. Like 20 percent of the Technion student body, he is Arab. To the question of what creates the bubbling innovation on campus, he responds that it is just something taught. No DNA involved. ''They take students who are already talented and at the top of the class,'' he says, ''and then hammer excellence into them, and not just excellence, but the expectation of innovative thinking. That's what happens to us.''

HEADLINE: How Cornell is creating a high-tech graduate school from scratch (very seat of the pants).

BYLINE: By RICHARD PREZ-PEA. 
Richard Prez-Pea covers national higher education for The Times.

 BODY:
IF all the hopes and hype are warranted, a nondescript third-floor loft in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan offers a glimpse of the future, for New York City and for Cornell University. In truth, it doesn't look like much -- just cubicles and meeting rooms in space donated by Google. But looks deceive; here, with little fanfare, Cornell's new graduate school of applied sciences is being rolled out.
The sparkling, sprawling new campus on Roosevelt Island filled with gee-whiz technology -- still just ink on paper. The thousands of students and staff, the transformative effect on the city's economy, the integration with the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology -- those all remain in the future, too.
But just 13 months after being awarded the prize in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's contest to create a new science school, Cornell NYC Tech got up and running. Eight students enrolled in January in what is being called the beta class, a one-year master's program in computer science. And Cornell has made it clear that, in many ways, this is not the usual university program. 
Not long ago, three young high-tech entrepreneurs sat with the students, talking about failure. They talked about questionable technical, financial or personnel decisions in start-up businesses they had created or worked in, about companies they had seen disintegrate, and about detours into projects they later discarded.
A question was asked about Andrew Mason, co-founder of Groupon, who had been fired a day earlier as the company's chief executive.
''We should all be so lucky as to build a company that the investors care enough about to fire us,'' Tim Novikoff, the C.E.O. of a small company making mobile phone software, said with a wave of his arm around the table, prompting laughter from the students and knowing nods from the Cornell Tech staff. A rail-thin man with the deep-set eyes of someone who could use a little more sleep, Mr. Novikoff is in his early 30s, making him the oldest of the three visitors.
''It's a miracle if a start-up gets off the ground,'' he said. ''The last six months I've had no income, I have no health insurance. But I got to fly out to a C.E.O. conference and talk with Ashton Kutcher about mobile video for 10 minutes.''
The visitors urged the students to take risks but to expect, at least at first, a precarious existence, riddled with setbacks, that will require obsessiveness and a thick skin -- and they made it sound like the grandest of adventures. None of them made the reference, but they could all have been citing Samuel Beckett's maxim: ''Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.''
Scenes like this play out each week at Cornell Tech, part of an unorthodox curriculum designed to eschew the traditional detached, highly academic approach to learning. Instead, business, technology and real-world experience is baked into the coursework.
''There's no parallel to that in any traditional computer science program I'm aware of,'' said Dan Huttenlocher, dean of Cornell Tech. ''We're taking a page from business schools.''
The practicums are organized by Greg Pass, a Cornell alumnus who was the chief technology officer at Twitter and now is the chief entrepreneurial officer of the graduate school. They are held in an informal setting each Friday with entrepreneurs from the city's blooming tech sector, who are often no more than a few steps ahead of where the students are.
Reinforcing the sense that the work produce practical results, the United States Commerce Department has stationed a patent officer on the premises to help with patent applications and commercial strategies -- an arrangement that federal officials say is a first.
A business class is mandatory, in addition to the usual technical courses. And the students are required, in each semester, to work with mentors from the private sector to design and create new products. Two of the students, Alex Kopp and Andrew Li, are working with a Google engineer on open-source software that predicts the severity of weather events.
''In Ithaca, you take a bunch of classes and then you have your one master's project -- you work on it alone,'' said Mr. Kopp, who transferred from a master's program at Cornell's main campus. ''It typically doesn't have a business aspect to it, or you might be working on something that a professor is doing. This has a very different feel to it.''
Information technology is the common thread through the eight degrees the school plans to offer. Three will be dual master's degrees from Cornell and the Technion, based on three ''hubs'' rather than traditional departments. One hub program, ''connective media,'' has largely been mapped out -- though professors warn that it is subject to change as technology changes -- and will deal with designing the mobile, fragmented and endlessly malleable technology that makes everyone a media creator as well as consumer. The other hubs, still under development, are being called ''healthier life'' (systems to improve health care delivery as well as personal technology) and ''built environment'' (computing applied to the physical world around us, from robotic devices to smart building design to real-time traffic information).
The curriculum will not be confined to standard disciplines, but will combine fields like electrical engineering, software development and social sciences, and professors will teach across those boundaries.
In fact, no professor has an office, not even the dean, and Dr. Huttenlocher insists they will not when the campus moves to Roosevelt Island, either. Instead, each person has a desk with low dividers, and people can grab conference rooms as needed -- much like the headquarters of a small tech company.
''We're trying to separate personal space from private space, to create an environment with constant interaction,'' he said. ''Believe it or not, this is a very important piece of the culture we're trying to create.''
Some of Cornell Tech's approach can be seen in Deborah Estrin's computer networking course. She invites important innovators in the field to poke holes in conventional wisdom and get the students thinking about questions that go far beyond the curriculum.
One week, Bob Evans, a project manager at Google, challenged a clich in software development, ''Good, fast or cheap -- pick two,'' meaning you can't have all three. To Mr. Evans, fast and cheap -- and highly adaptable -- is good by definition, allowing engineers to identify needed updates, repairs and new features. Creating a polished product before it is ever put to use is pointless, he told the class, because it will always need to be changed.
''Software is one brief moment of creation and a lifetime of maintenance,'' he said.
Another week, Dr. Estrin's guest was Scott Shenker, chief scientist of the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley. ''I'm going to ask you questions,'' he said at the outset. ''The most important thing to know is I don't care about your answer. It's to get you to think.''
In acerbic fashion, he argued that the Internet protocols that are a foundation of global communication are fundamentally flawed, hinder traffic rather than help it and require billions of dollars in networking equipment that will soon become unnecessary.
In fact, Dr. Estrin had helped develop those very protocols before taking a turn into wireless sensing systems, and then applying those systems to health care. Her nonprofit organization, Open mHealth, develops open-source software that collects, combines and analyzes streams of data from devices that monitor the human body, be it one's physical activity or blood sugar.
Cornell officials consider it a coup to have gotten Dr. Estrin, who recently finished a 10-year project at the University of California, Los Angeles, backed by the National Science Foundation.
Reading Cornell's proposal, with its hubs on connective media and healthier life, Dr. Estrin said,''I felt like I had been part of the team writing it.''
THE staff and students at Cornell Tech can be seen as pioneers or guinea pigs -- or both -- and it was a select group who were ready to play that role (one of the original eight has already dropped out). The student body is intentionally small. They had to accept a high degree of uncertainty about what lay ahead and a very short time frame for deciding on their futures, and they had to be in the metropolitan area, or ready to move on short notice.
Classes started on Jan. 21. Some arrived in the city unsure of their schedules. Less than a month before they started, it remained unclear whether Cornell would find housing for those traveling from other parts of the country (it did).
''For me, from hearing about the program to applying was less than a month, and from that to getting to New York City was just another couple of months,'' said Greg Tobkin, 27. A Williams College graduate, he had set out to earn a doctorate in computational biology at Cornell but left the program after three years and moved back to his hometown, San Francisco.
''I looked at biotech jobs, but it was a bad time to be looking, if you had zero actual biotech experience,'' he said. After a year, ''I started looking at master's programs that had really rigorous comp sci and would also give me a chance to explore industry, so it was as if the Cornell Tech program were written for me.'' He added: ''Each week, we go visit some new start-up that is (a) awesome and (b) looking to hire.''
Ted Krum, like Mr. Tobkin, turned a career roadblock into an opportunity, but his change of direction was more profound. Mr. Krum, 47, who lives in Garden City, Long Island, had a job in finance before being downsized last year. He had studied computer science at Yale -- he later got an M.B.A. at the University of Chicago -- and his early work in finance involved writing software. He considered applying to Cornell Tech for a job, but his wife, an executive recruiter, suggested he apply as a student.
''We spent many evenings after our son was in bed figuring out if this was right, if we could swing it financially,'' he said. Tuition comes to $43,185.
Mr. Krum's computing knowledge was out of date, and studying alongside students half his age, he would have some catching up to do: ''I thought, what's the bigger risk, staying put in financial services and swimming against the tide of tens of thousands of job cuts, or going back to my first love, computers, and a field that's actually growing?''
One thing the students have in common is being excited, not intimidated, by doing something so untested. Mr. Krum called it ''the hottest ticket to the hottest show in town.''
Building Cornell Tech is decidedly seat of the pants. Dr. Huttenlocher still does not have a good idea how many new students the school will enroll in September, how many professors it will have then, or what classes it will offer. Nor is anyone sure how fast the various programs will be designed by the professors and authorized by New York State. State approval for dual degrees with the Technion, which has not operated in New York before, is more complex -- one reason that, at the outset, the courses are Cornell's alone.
Though Cornell and the Technion are taking it further, the relationship between most engineering and computer science schools and the business world is already so fluid as to startle someone with a liberal arts background. Professors routinely take breaks from academia to go into business. Former students and professors create companies based on work done within university walls and reach back into them to collaborate and recruit talent. Universities often own pieces of new ventures.
This kind of cross-pollination helped create thriving tech sectors in the areas surrounding the Technion, Stanford, the University of Texas and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- something Mayor Bloomberg wants for New York. And it is of growing importance to universities, not just for their ability to draw top faculty and students, but also for their finances. ''Technology transfer,'' the private-sector use of university-born innovations, has become a multibillion-dollar source of revenue for schools.
When Mayor Bloomberg asked business leaders about the city's economic prospects, the complaint he said he heard most often was a shortage of top-notch talent in computer science and engineering. The hope was that a new graduate school could turn the tech sector into another pillar of the city's economy, like finance, medicine and media. In 2010, the mayor announced a contest, offering city-owned land on Roosevelt Island worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and up to $100 million worth of capital improvements.
Columbia, New York University, Carnegie Mellon and others submitted proposals, but only one, Stanford, proposed a project as big as Cornell's. Columbia and N.Y.U. already had engineering schools in the city and plans for expansion, while Stanford had a thriving relationship with Silicon Valley.
More than any other bidder, Cornell saw the contest as a potential game changer. An Ivy League university with highly ranked programs in computer science and engineering, Cornell had a geographic disadvantage. Ithaca, small and remote, was not likely to become the heart of a new Silicon Valley.
But New York City, with a growing lineup of tech businesses and a large contingent of Cornell alumni, was a second home to the university -- site of its medical school, part of its labor relations school and architecture school and other facilities. For years, Cornell has offered a bus service between the city and Ithaca, making the four-and-a-half-hour drive several times daily.
City officials said no university worked as hard as Cornell to accommodate and impress them, and in December 2011, Cornell's joint bid with the Technion was named the winner. Columbia and N.Y.U. were also awarded grants to expand tech offerings in what Mayor Bloomberg dubs Applied Sciences NYC.
Last month, plans for the 12-acre campus on Roosevelt Island won approval from the City Planning Commission and have gone to the City Council for final approval. When finished, in about 25 years, the campus is projected to have more than 2,000 students and two million square feet of space. The timetable calls for the first building to open in 2017.
David J. Skorton, Cornell's president, says that helping create one of the world's great tech environments may be the university's most important venture of the next generation. ''It's a terrific opportunity to create a model institution for 21st-century higher education in the applied sciences,'' Dr. Skorton said, ''and it boosts the visibility of the university as a whole.''
He also cites the rather old-school benefit of being in the thick of things.
''Interactions can occur at a very long distance now, but you still see that many, many serendipitous steps forward are based on the old concept of bumping into people, having lunch, that personal interaction,'' Dr. Skorton said. ''We're already seeing that in the temporary campus, in the Google space.
''Even with all our technology,'' he added, ''proximity still really matters.''

HEADLINE: A Matter of Ballast

BYLINE: By JEFFREY J. SELINGO

 BODY:
STUDENTS piling on debt to go to college might attract all the attention, but colleges have been on a borrowing spree as well, nearly doubling the amount of debt they've taken on in the last decade to fix aging campuses, keep up with competitors and lure students with lavish amenities.
In January, Moody's Investors Service put a negative outlook on the entire higher education sector, even at major research universities, which had been spared in previous forecasts. And that came after a year in which the agency downgraded the credit ratings of 22 colleges, including Alabama A&M, Wellesley College and Morehouse College. At the same time, Standard & Poor's Ratings Service downgraded 13 institutions, including Amherst College, Tulane University and Yeshiva University. Combined, both agencies upgraded only eight colleges in 2012.
Bond ratings aren't scoured like the U.S. News and World Report rankings. But if you're a parent preparing to start the college search with your son or daughter, the negative financial outlook raises plenty of questions to ask the college tour guide: Will outdated buildings be renovated? Will more part-time instructors replace retiring professors? Will classes get bigger or will students end up in partly online courses? Will the school even be in business by the time your child graduates in four years? 
''There is a major problem in that the industry has an inability to grow revenue in a way they have for the last 20 years,'' says John C. Nelson, managing director of the higher education and health care practice at Moody's, which examines the finances of more than 500 colleges and universities that issue bonds through public markets.
A handful of colleges have closed, merged or been bought by for-profit colleges in recent years -- mostly small, tuition-dependent private colleges, which remain at most risk. While few financial experts foresee mass closings in the years ahead, only 500 or so of the 4,000-plus colleges and universities in the United States seem to have stable enough finances to be truly safe. The remaining colleges, where a vast majority of Americans attend, can no longer hold off the technological, demographic and economic forces quickly bearing down on them.
One-third of all colleges and universities in the United States face financial statements significantly weaker than before the recession and, according to an analysis released last July, are on an unsustainable fiscal path. Another quarter find themselves at serious risk of joining them.
''Expenses are growing at such a pace that colleges don't have the cash or the revenue to cover them for much longer,'' says Jeff Denneen, head of the higher education practice at Bain & Company, the global consulting firm that, along with the private-equity firm Sterling Partners, performed the analysis. ''A growing number of colleges are in real financial trouble.''
Other forecasts are equally pessimistic. The number of higher education institutions on a Department of Education watch list, for instance, has grown by more than a third since 2007 to include institutions like Long Island University and Pace University.
''We're seeing prolonged, serious stress,'' says Karen Kedem, an analyst at Moody's. What is significant about the negative outlook is that Moody's typically rates only colleges and universities with strong balance sheets to begin with.
Reading a college's bond-rating report is like reading a person's credit report: it is a financial checkup that gives insight into strengths and weaknesses that you will never find in any college guidebook, but probably should.
Take this line from a Moody's report when it downgraded Drew University in New Jersey in 2012: ''The rating is based on persistent operating deficits and thin cash-flow driven by a decline in enrollment and net tuition per student coupled with rising debt service payments and transition of several key members of university leadership.''
Translation: the private college is operating in a hole (though, Moody's also notes, it's helped by having an endowment); it is discounting tuition too much, and it is not attracting enough students, especially those who will pay more in tuition.
Michael Groener, Drew's vice president of finance and business affairs, who arrived on campus last fall, says the financial decline is largely the result of discounting the $42,000 sticker price too often and too much -- sometimes by 50 percent. ''That is pushing it about as far as we can go,'' Mr. Groener says. In the years ahead, he says, Drew needs to bolster revenue through other means, mostly fund-raising, and look more closely at expenses by prioritizing what really matters in a good liberal-arts education.
In recent years, net tuition revenue -- what's left after grant aid is subtracted -- has either been flat or falling at 73 percent of colleges. But most colleges and universities, particularly private ones, lack the market power to raise their prices significantly in a down economy. Business and law schools are no longer the cash cows they once were for their parent institutions. Meanwhile, employees expect raises and other costs continue to rise.
''This is a perfect storm, where you have a number of challenges at the same time over a long period of time,'' says Ms. Kedem, the Moody's analyst.
For public universities, the big challenge is that states are getting out of the business of higher education. In 1987, states kicked in about three quarters of what public colleges spent on education; now they contribute about half. The rest has to come from tuition.
By some measures, state taxpayer support for higher education hasn't been this low since 1965, when there were 16 million fewer students in the system. As a result, public colleges have joined with cash-strapped private colleges on the hunt for more students who can pay full freight. That has led many schools to recruit foreign students and caused public colleges to look across state lines for students, who pay about twice as much as their in-state counterparts.
But the pool of students able to pay higher prices shows signs of running dry. The economic crisis has left the median American family with no more wealth than it had in the early 1990s. Experts predict a drop in the number of affluent, well-prepared high school graduates -- the type that every college is after. One analysis conducted by a small private college in the Northeast found that of the 4.3 million 18-year-olds in 2009, only 996 had above-average SAT scores, family incomes over $200,000 a year, and had indicated that they wanted to attend a small, private college in the mid-Atlantic or Northeast regions. Of course, hundreds of colleges are going after those same students.
Despite evidence to the contrary, some colleges still think the tough times are a temporary inconvenience -- that eventually they will again be able to pass on their additional costs to students or get more money from the state and federal governments. But the most informed and realistic of higher education leaders realize they are now living in a new normal.
The collapse of higher education's business model has been predicted many times before. Yet more colleges have opened their doors than closed them in the past 50 years. Perhaps the continued financial struggles indicate that there are just too many colleges for the marketplace -- or at least too many that, with their climbing walls, lazy rivers and five-star dormitories, look too much alike in the battle for prestige, and have lost sense of their mission. A thinning of the ranks might be long overdue.
Just because we believe that colleges are a public trust and shouldn't fail doesn't mean they won't.

HEADLINE: Vying for a Spot On the World's A List

BYLINE: By D. D. GUTTENPLAN

 BODY:
SO NOW we know. After months of hype and speculation, the winners were announced last month. These were not the Oscars, but the World Reputation Rankings, ''the world's definitive index of academic prestige,'' according to its publisher, Times Higher Education, a weekly magazine based in London.
Harvard had slipped to fourth place -- behind the California Institute of Technology, Oxford and Stanford -- in the magazine's World University Rankings last fall. Would it remain on top in the reputation results? It did.
Which was not exactly surprising. Nor, despite the best efforts of Times Higher Education to drum up excitement, were overall results. Although the precise order has varied, the same six names -- M.I.T., Harvard, Stanford, University of California at Berkeley, Oxford and Cambridge -- have filled the top six slots since the reputation rankings were first published in 2011. And while American dominance has slipped slightly, from 45 schools in the top 100 two years ago to 43 this year, no other country comes anywhere close. Second-place Britain fills just 9 of the top 100 places; Australia, in third place, has only 6. 
A good reputation, wrote Publilius Syrus, a first-century B.C. Latin wit, is worth more than money. For universities, reputation is money: more applications, more tuition dollars, greater levels of alumni giving.
Though academic rankings have existed for decades in the United States, international rankings are a more recent event. But like the influential U.S. News and World Report lists, they are increasingly impossible to ignore. The appeal of an arbiter of educational quality, however subjective, has spread across the globe as students become ever more mobile, and universities, including American ones, look even farther beyond their borders.
Also like U.S. News, international rankings have come under attack for their methodologies and impact. A report released on April 12 by the European University Association warns of the growing variety of rankings and their influence on universities and nations' educational policies. The report cites work by Ellen Hazelkorn, who in her 2011 book ''Rankings and the Reshaping of Higher Education'' found that in some countries rankings determine student eligibility for government scholarships, academic partners for collaboration, even immigration status. Dr. Hazelkorn, dean of the Graduate Research School at the Dublin Institute of Technology, cites statements by the governments of Mongolia, Qatar and Kazakhstan limiting scholarships to students admitted to the top 100 universities. Brazilian universities allow collaboration only with universities in the top 500, she says, and Singapore only with the top 100. In the Netherlands, immigration law favors foreigners who have graduated from the top 150 universities; in Denmark, graduates of the top 20 face easier entry requirements.
How did rankings acquire so much influence?
In 2003, when Nian Cai Liu, a chemistry professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, issued the first Academic Ranking of World Universities -- known as the Shanghai rankings -- the aim was simply to supply a benchmark to measure China's progress. The theory was that by measuring such objective factors as the number of faculty or alumni who win Nobel Prizes or Fields Medals in mathematics, or whose work is frequently cited by other researchers, the rankings would help Chinese policy makers decide which of the country's universities deserved more resources.
But if the intended audience was small, the effect on the academic landscape was like lighting a match to find your way out of a fireworks factory.
The absence of French or German universities in the top 20 shocked officials in those countries. With the University of Tokyo its only institution in the top 20 (at 19), Japan was not thrilled either. And as even Mr. Liu and his colleagues admitted, counting publications and prizes tends to slight social science and humanities, while the focus on research means liberal arts colleges don't figure at all.
Such criticism, however, was easily lost amid the clamor as governments urged their universities to improve their standings. Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan announced programs to lift at least one university into the top 100; Nigeria pledged to put two universities in the top 200. The ranking's biomedical bias makes it particularly influential in the developing world, where science, technology, engineering and math are seen as holding the key to economic prosperity.
The explosion of interest -- the Shanghai Web site gets thousands of visitors every day -- also prompted imitators.
The first was Quacquarelli Symonds, a London-based company that runs education events and publishes guides to postgraduate study. QS got into the rankings business in 2004, in partnership with Times Higher Education until parting ways in 2009 amid disagreement about how reputation was being handled.
Today, reputation accounts for 50 percent of a university's QS score. The Times Higher Education calculations, on the other hand, limit reputation to 33 percent of the overall score in its World University Rankings. And the survey is by invitation only, while QS allows any academic staff member to respond. The dangers of such an approach can be seen in a recent letter from Michael B. Murphy, president of University College Cork in Ireland, asking each faculty member to recruit three acquaintances at other institutions to fill out the survey to lift the university's QS ranking.
''The more reputational measures you have, the less accurate a ranking is,'' says Philip G. Altbach, the director of the Center for International Higher Education at Boston College. ''Reputational surveys privilege research. Academics might be able to judge departments in their own fields in terms of research prominence, but they have no way of judging teaching quality or learning.''
Several years after its split with QS, Times Higher Education spun off its own reputation ranking, based solely on opinion surveys and billed as a league of 100 ''global university super brands.'' Phil Baty, the magazine's rankings editor, acknowledges their subjectivity. ''But in a highly competitive global higher education market, reputation matters deeply,'' he says. ''Research has shown that a university's reputation is the No. 1 consideration for overseas students -- above fees and even course content -- and it is also a top priority for globally mobile faculty.''
A news release for last month's World Reputation Rankings quotes Paul Wells, a Canadian journalist, who calls the listing ''awesome because it skips objective criteria and goes straight to the stuff that makes people most insecure.''
Indeed, in a statement accompanying the ranking release, Mr. Baty did his best to stoke fears: ''New forces in higher education are emerging, especially in the East Asian countries that are investing heavily in building world-class universities, so the traditional elite must be very careful. In the three years that the World Reputation Rankings have been running, we have clear evidence that the U.S. and the U.K. in particular are losing ground.''
In fact, the United States lost only a single place in the top 100, and though British universities have lost ground, so have China's two flagships, Tsinghua (which dropped from 30th to 35th place) and Peking University (38th to 45th).
While multiple objective factors figure in the World University Rankings, whether they indicate quality is a matter of debate. David G. Blanchflower, a Dartmouth economics professor, has criticized the criterion -- also used by QS -- that counts the number of faculty members or students from abroad. He finds it biased against American institutions, which have fewer of them.
Times Higher Education has tweaked its methodology several times since splitting with Quacquarelli Symonds. In one well-publicized embarrassment, the relatively obscure Alexandria University in Egypt catapulted ahead of both Harvard and Stanford in the category of research impact, or citations, helping it land in the top 200 in the 2010-11 rankings. ''There was one mathematician, Mohamed El Naschie, who kept citing himself, and getting his friends to cite him,'' says Richard Holmes, a professor at Universiti Teknologi MARA in Malaysia, who pointed out the error on his blog, University Ranking Watch.
The model was revised once more, only to fall afoul of Mr. Holmes again this year, when the Moscow State Engineering Physics Institute came in first for its research impact -- tied with Rice University and ahead of M.I.T., Caltech, Harvard and Stanford. Mr. Holmes, the rankings equivalent of the baseball statistics maven Bill James, explains that someone at the Moscow campus was listed as co-author of a biannual review of particle physics -- a reference routinely cited by anyone publishing in that field. He also pointed out that because all the citations occurred within two years they had greater weight in the model. Impact is also benchmarked differently for each country, giving Russian publications greater weight.
''You can't say a given university in Malaysia is better than one in the United States just because universities in Malaysia aren't very good,'' Mr. Holmes says.
Noting that the impact of citations was just one of 13 performance indicators, Mr. Baty points out that the Moscow institute did not make the top 200 schools over all. By normalizing the results for subject areas and nationality, he says, ''we reward quality and not just sheer quantity, and smaller specialist institutions with highly focused research can do very well in this indicator -- we make no apology for that.''
QS, which supplies U.S. News with its 400 ''World's Best Universities,'' has also come under fire recently, for offering ''universities the opportunity to highlight their strength'' by paying a fee to be rated on a scale of one to five stars. The University of Limerick in Ireland did not make the Shanghai ranking's top 500 or the QS top 400. Yet after paying a one-time audit fee of $9,850 and an annual license fee of $6,850, Limerick is now able to boast that Quacquarelli Symonds has awarded it ''5-star ratings across the areas of infrastructure, teaching, engagement and internationalization.''
Ben Sowter, who oversees QS's ratings and rankings, refutes any suggestion that universities can buy stars: ''Just because accreditation agencies charge the universities, that doesn't mean they are biased.''
The influence of international rankings is likely to grow with the globalization of higher education. Countries whose universities rely on fee-paying foreign students to balance their books, or which see higher education as a potential earner of export income, are especially vulnerable to the vagaries of reviewers. Dr. Hazelkorn has written some of the harshest criticism of rankings and of companies that, she says, ''have seen a commercial opening and are going hell for leather.''
Yet even she says: ''When you are recruiting students, in many countries the first thing they ask you is, 'Where are you ranked?' Not being ranked makes you invisible.''

HEADLINE: The Van Dweller

BYLINE: By KEN ILGUNAS. 
Ken Ilgunas's memoir, ''Walden on Wheels: On the Open Road From Debt to Freedom,'' will be published by New Harvest on May 14. This article is adapted from the book.

 BODY:
COULD I live in a van? I looked over the Craigslist ads, took a bus to John's used car dealership in Raleigh, N.C., and scanned the rows of sedans, trucks and SUVs in search of my new home.
And there it was. A giant 1994 Ford Econoline coated with a burgundy sheen, the sun turning its black-tinted windows a blinding white. It looked out of place among the shiny, spotless SUVs, whose bumpers proudly faced away, as if exhibiting a juvenile disdain for their ponderous elder. Its distended underbelly hung vulnerably low -- so low I wondered if it would scrape its undercarriage when climbing up and over speed bumps.
It was big, it was beautiful and, best of all, it was only $1,500.
While the ad promised that the van ''drives great,'' it had more than enough problems to justify its price tag: one of the two side doors wouldn't open, there were large patches on the windows where the tint had peeled off, and the tires were bald -- so bald that, later on, when I went to buy a part at Sears, a couple of mechanics doubled over in laughter when I asked them if they thought the tires would pass inspection. 
''I'll take it,'' I told John anyway, unable to hold back my grin. Despite its deformities, it was love at first sight.
I HAD been accepted into Duke's graduate liberal studies program, but I couldn't afford it. I had just paid off my $32,000 undergraduate debt, I was nearly broke, and the prospect of taking out loans was unthinkable. Going back into debt made about as much sense as running out of a burning building just to run into another.
Today, the cost of higher education is ridiculous. Average tuition at a public university, in state, is $8,655. At a private, it's $29,056. My program would cost, in total, a reasonable $11,000 after grant aid. But it's not just tuition that puts students into debt; it's room and board. At Duke, where rates are similar to universities across the country, a non-air-conditioned dorm with two roommates costs $5,464 an academic year. The cheapest meal plan for freshmen is a ghastly $5,540, or $27 a day.
When I added up the costs of tuition, books, transportation, food, housing, not to mention car insurance, utilities and, dare I say, a date, I felt hopeless. I had only $4,000 to my name and no possessions except a backpack full of camping gear. But as desperate as I was, I was determined to go back to school.
Which brought me back to: Could I live in a van?
The van-dwelling lifestyle, I figured, would eliminate many of the costs. For Internet and electricity, I'd use the library. For showers, I'd buy a cheap campus gym membership. For food, I'd cook my own meals. For rent, well, I wouldn't have any rent. For dates, well, I probably wouldn't have any of them, either.
Seven and a half years before, when I had enrolled at the University at Buffalo as an undergraduate, I wasn't the sort of person who would have done something as bold and weird and possibly illegal as secretly living in a big creepy van on a college campus. But something had changed on my journey to get out of debt.
Along with owing $32,000, I'd graduated with an unmarketable degree in history and English. Naturally, I struggled to find work and wound up taking a $9-an-hour job as a tour guide and cook at a remote truck stop called Coldfoot in Alaska's Arctic. But while I took the job out of desperation, I'd accidentally placed myself in a near-ideal situation to pay off my debt. In Coldfoot, the nearest store was 250 miles away (eliminating all temptations to buy stuff), there was no cellphone reception (making a phone plan unnecessary), and workers got free room and board (no food, rent or utility costs). After a year, I had paid off $18,000. A year later, I got a better-paying seasonal job with the Park Service. After two and a half years of work, I was debt free.
But my journey wasn't just a financial awakening. I had learned about subsistence living in Arctic villages, and worked with a 74-year-old maintenance man who lived in his 1980 Chevy Suburban year-round. I began to bring into question what passed for ''normal'' down in the lower 48, especially when it often led to a lifetime of work, bills and Bed Bath & Beyond purchases. Out of debt, I felt for the first time that my life was my own, and that I could do whatever I wished with it.
And more than anything I wished to use this freedom to continue the liberal arts education that had put me into so much debt. While the cost of my education had chained my ankles to the steel balls of debt, the liberal arts had freed some other part of me. Between a Thor-eauvian van-dwelling experiment and studying the great thinkers, I thought Duke would help me become a better person. Living in a van wouldn't just be a way for me to afford school. It would be an adventure. It would be my ''Walden on Wheels.''
''Could I live in a van?'' I asked myself one last time. Why the hell not?
THE SPRING SEMESTER would start in just a couple of days, so I spent a day making the van as comfortable as I could. I removed the two middle pilot seats to create living space, brought in a plastic storage container to hold my possessions, neatly folded all my clothes into my suitcase, and bought a big black cloth to hang behind my driver and passenger seats so that no one could see me inside.
I knew I had the personality for van dwelling. I'd developed a comfort with tight quarters, a sixth sense for cheapness and a tolerance for squalor that was (I hate to brag) unequaled. I had the physical constitution for it, too: I was blessed with a high tolerance for cold temperatures, practically no sense of smell and a bladder (I hate to brag) the size of a football.
But the first few weeks didn't match up with my romantic vision of a Waldenesque life of ancient texts and quiet solitude. I was assigned to the Mill Lot, a parking lot in the middle of a busy shopping district, a mile from campus, in the heart of Durham. I parked in between a college bar and an apartment building within eyeshot of office windows where men and women in business attire, I worried, might discover me.
Although the lot was rarely visited, I was constantly paranoid about getting discovered. Because I didn't know what Duke would say if it learned of my experiment, I was determined to keep the van a secret. I wouldn't tell anyone. And to ensure ''stealth,'' as van dwellers call it (see the Yahoo message board ''VanDwellers''), each morning I lifted up the blinds and looked out the windows to make sure no one saw me leave the van, and I didn't re-enter until late at night. Whenever the subject of my home came up in conversations with fellow students, I lied my pants off.
My secret was making it impossible to make friends, I was sleeping in temperatures as low as 10 degrees, and as a bachelor living in tight quarters, I was constantly inhaling air riddled with strange odors. Worst of all, I felt a terrible loneliness settle deep into me. To compensate, I began to sing and talk to myself with unprecedented frequency.
My main concern, though, was my dwindling money supply. After my first week of purchases -- the van, books, school fees, car insurance, food and a cellphone bill -- I had less than $1,000 left in savings and $2,000 to pay in tuition. I had nothing else to cut back on, so I tried to eat as little as possible. Walking back from the library one night, I spotted a few mangled slices of pizza lying in a box on the lawn. A savage hunger roared in my belly. Has it already come to this?
My worries were temporarily alleviated when I became a paid ''study participant'' for Duke's neuroscience department. Several times a week, for $10 an hour, I was zapped by electrodes, pricked by needles and dazed by pharmaceuticals. Shamelessly, I donated three of my four primary bodily fluids. Later, I found out about studies that paid $20 an hour to perform cognitive tests inside an M.R.I.
Though the van-dwelling lifestyle had its share of hardships, I adapted. On my isobutane backpacking stove, I cooked lavish meals each night, usually some combination of vegetables, noodles and peanut butter. I had only one pot, so all my meals were stews: spaghetti stew, rice and bean stew, vegetable stew, with healthy, calorie-dense dollops of peanut butter mixed in. For breakfast, I'd have cereal with powdered milk, and for lunch I'd make sandwiches and carry them to campus. At the gym, I showered, shaved and brushed my teeth, and filled up large water bottles for cooking.
I washed my clothes every few weeks at a laundromat a short walk from my parking space, and I did all of my studying at the campus library, where I used the free Wi-Fi and charged up my electronics. The van offered no protection from the cold, but once I shivered into my thermal underwear and slipped into my sleeping bag, burritoed in my own body heat, I'd fall into a deep and peaceful slumber.
The van-dwelling lifestyle proved to be as affordable as I'd suspected. I was able to eat for $4.34 a day and I lived on $103 a week. My finances became even more manageable when I got a part-time job tutoring at an inner-city elementary school.
I didn't buy my first meal at a restaurant until more than halfway through the semester, on a weeklong trip to a field station for my ''Biodiversity in North Carolina'' class. The day before I was to go, my mother sent me an e-mail reminding me about my tax return. I'd get a refund! It was a $1,600 golden ticket that Uncle Sam was going to slip into my bank account. I was rich. This was a turning point, I realized. I had financial security for the first time in months. I'm not poor anymore, I thought nostalgically.
Knowing that my tax refund was coming, I slackened my Spartan standards: I bought a case of beer, I dined at a restaurant twice, and at the field station I slept in a heated room on a comfortable bed. But treating myself made me feel a strange sense of guilt, as if I'd cut some corner I promised myself I wouldn't cut. During my third night at the station, beleaguered with self-reproach, I dragged my sleeping bag outside and slept on the pavement under the stars.
I didn't need these things. The beer, the food or even the bed. I didn't even really want them. I was buying stuff simply because I could afford it. If you put a man in a country club, he'll feel the need for a yacht. But if you drop him in the wilderness, his desires will be only those essential to his survival. I had decided not to take out loans for graduate school in part because I knew that if I allowed myself access to easy money, I'd again fall victim to the consumerist trap. I'd be indiscreet with my money. I'd begin to pay for and rely on things I thought I needed but didn't. I'd lose perspective. I didn't want to once again be swallowed whole by the dominant culture, accepting its norms and values and desires as my own.
I knew what I was missing in my life. It wasn't things. It wasn't heat, plumbing, an iPhone or a plasma-screen TV. It was people. It was a community. It was a meaningful role to play in society. And these were things -- as much as I wanted them -- that I knew I could temporarily do without.
When not at work or in class, I would lie in bed for hours, reading, thinking, doing nothing, enjoying the solitude, staring at the ceiling, idly musing, unworried about feeling industrious or useful. I pondered everything from the Milky Way to the fallen crumb on my floor.
Oh, and the liberal arts. Studying liberal arts, after years spent working at far-flung camps that didn't have as much as a stack of used books, felt like vital fare for a famished soul. I read Rousseau and Diogenes and Thoreau, and my liberal arts education, as well as the education of living in a van, came together like two rivers meeting at a confluence and flowing together as one.
After the semester, I went back to Alaska for the summer, where I worked and filled up my depleted bank account. As the fall approached, I looked up rates of apartments around Duke. But I began to think of how my van had begun to feel less like an experiment and more like a real home. I remembered the half-dozen dogwood trees that shadowed my parking spot and bore branches heavy with thick, lustrous white flowers, and how they buzzed with a million bumblebees and smelled of a woman's hair. I'd remember how, on mornings, I'd awake to a medley of birdsong so loud and cheery you'd think my little hermitage was tucked away in a copse of trees at Walden Pond.
To me, Thoreau's cabin wasn't just a home; it was the reimagining of a life; it was the conviction that we can turn the wildest figments of our imagination into something real. And I knew that whether I'd come to live in a home on wheels or in one fastened to the ground, I'd in some sense be a van dweller for life.
That fall semester, I asked myself, ''Could I live in a van?''
Could I not?

HEADLINE: The Ghosts of Afghanistan's Past

BYLINE: By WILLIAM DALRYMPLE. 
The author, most recently, of ''Return of a King: The Battle for Afghanistan, 1839-42.''

 BODY:
ON March 10, Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, shocked Western leaders by declaring that recent attacks proved that the Taliban ''are at the service of America.'' The implication was clear: terrorists were colluding with the United States to sow chaos before America's planned withdrawal in 2014. American and European leaders, mindful of the blood and treasure they've expended to defend Mr. Karzai's government, were baffled and offended.
But to students of Afghan history, Mr. Karzai's motivation for publicly spurning foreign powers was quite obvious. A Taliban news release on March 18, which received little notice in the Western press, declared: ''Everyone knows how Karzai was brought to Kabul and how he was seated on the defenseless throne of Shah Shuja,'' referring to the exiled Afghan ruler restored to the throne by the British in 1839. ''So it is not astonishing that the American soldiers are making fun of him and slapping him on the face because it is the philosophy of invaders that they scorn their stooge at the end ... and in this way punish him for his slavery!'' 
The Taliban inadvertently put their finger on a key factor in understanding Mr. Karzai's psychology. After all, as an elder of the Popalzai tribe, Mr. Karzai is the direct tribal descendant of Shah Shuja ul-Mulk, Britain's handpicked ruler during the first Western attempt at regime change in Afghanistan in the mid-19th century.
And although few in the West are aware of it, as the United States prepares to withdraw from Afghanistan, history is repeating itself. We may have forgotten the details of the colonial history that did so much to mold Afghans' hatred of foreign rule, but the Afghans have not.
Today, Shah Shuja is widely reviled in Afghanistan as a puppet of the West. The man who defeated the British in 1842, Wazir Akbar Khan, and his father, Dost Mohammed, are widely regarded as national heroes. Mr. Karzai has lived with that knowledge all his life, making him a difficult ally -- always keen to stress the differences between himself and his backers, making him appear to be continually biting the hand that feeds him.
In 2001, top Taliban officials asked their young fighters, ''Do you want to be remembered as a son of Shah Shuja or as a son of Dost Mohammed?'' As he rose to power, the Taliban leader Mullah Omar deliberately modeled himself on Dost Mohammed, and, as he did, removed the Holy Cloak of the Prophet Muhammad from its shrine in Kandahar and wrapped himself in it to declare jihad, a deliberate historical re-enactment, the resonance of which all Afghans immediately understood.
The parallels between the current war and that of the 1840s are striking. The same tribal rivalries exist and the same battles are being fought in the same places under the guise of new flags, new ideologies and new political puppeteers. The same cities are being garrisoned by foreign troops speaking the same languages, and they are being attacked from the same hills and high passes.
Not only was Shah Shuja from the same Popalzai sub-tribe as Mr. Karzai, his principal opponents were Ghilzais, who today make up the bulk of the Taliban's foot soldiers. Mullah Omar is a Ghilzai, as was Mohammad Shah Khan, the resistance fighter who supervised the slaughter of the British Army in 1841.
The same moral issues that are chewed over in editorial columns today were discussed in the correspondence of British officials during the First Afghan War. Should foreign troops try to ''promote the interests of humanity'' and champion social reform by banning traditions like the stoning of adulterous women? Should they try to reform blasphemy laws and introduce Western political ideas? Or should they just concentrate on ruling the country without rocking the boat?
As the great British spymaster Sir Claude Wade warned on the eve of the 1839 invasion, ''There is nothing more to be dreaded or guarded against, I think, than the overweening confidence with which we are too often accustomed to regard the excellence of our own institutions, and the anxiety that we display to introduce them in new and untried soils.'' In this early critique of democracy promotion, he concluded, ''Such interference will always lead to acrimonious disputes, if not to a violent reaction.''
Just as Britain's inability to cope with the Afghan uprising of 1841-2 stemmed from leadership failures and the breakdown of ties between the British envoy and Shah Shuja, the strained and uneasy relationship of NATO leaders with Mr. Karzai has been a crucial factor in America's failures in the latest imbroglio.
Afghanistan is so poor that the occupation can't be financed through natural resource wealth or taxation. Today, America is spending more than a $100 billion a year in Afghanistan: it costs more to keep Marine battalions in two districts of Helmand than America is providing to the entire nation of Egypt in military and development assistance. And then, as now, the decision to withdraw troops has turned on factors with little relevance to Afghanistan, namely the state of the occupier's troubled economy and the vagaries of politics back home.
History never repeats itself exactly, and there are some important differences between what is taking place in Afghanistan today and what took place during the 1840s. There is no unifying figure at the center of the resistance, recognized by all Afghans as a symbol of legitimacy and justice: Mullah Omar is no Dost Mohammed or Wazir Akbar Khan, and the tribes have not united behind a single leader as they did in the 1840s.
Moreover, the goals of the conservative, defensive tribal uprising that brought colonial rule to an end were very different from those of today's Taliban, who wish to reimpose an imported Wahhabi ideology on Afghanistan's diverse religious cultures. And most important, Mr. Karzai has tried to establish a broad-based, democratic government, which, for all its many flaws and prodigious corruption, is still much more representative and popular than the regime of Shah Shuja ever was.
Mr. Karzai is keen to learn the lessons of his forebears' failures. When my book came out in India in January, he got hold of a copy and read it. ''Our so-called current allies behave to us just as the British did to Shah Shuja,'' he told me. ''They have squandered the opportunity given to them by the Afghan people.''
Mr. Karzai believes that Shah Shuja didn't stress his independence enough, and he made clear that in his own last year in office he is going to act in such a way that he will never be remembered as anyone's puppet.

HEADLINE: Happy Taxes!

BYLINE: By CASS R. SUNSTEIN. 
A former head of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and the author, most recently, of ''Simpler: The Future of Government.''

 BODY:
HOW many millions of hours do you think Americans spend on government paperwork every year?
The answer is staggering. It is measured not in the millions of hours, but in the billions -- 9.14 of them, to be exact. Suppose that we value one hour at $20 (a conservative estimate). If so, the government imposes an annual reporting cost of more than $180 billion on the American people.
That figure is more than 20 times last year's budget of the Environmental Protection Agency, more than seven times that of the Department of Agriculture, and more than six times that of the Department of State. 
Large as they are, the numbers do not capture the frustration experienced by countless individuals and small businesses, which are required to grapple with long, complex and sometimes barely comprehensible forms.
Dozens of government agencies impose significant paperwork burdens, but one stands above all others: the Department of the Treasury. That department accounts for 6.7 billon annual hours, which is nearly 75 percent of the total. No other agency accounts for more than 6 percent. The Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency impose big reporting burdens, but in each of these cases, we are speaking of millions of hours, not billions.
The Treasury Department is the national paperwork champion for one reason: It houses the Internal Revenue Service. As Congress starts to explore tax reform, it should begin with a project that ought to attract bipartisan support: a focused effort to slash the immense paperwork burden imposed by government in general and the tax system in particular.
There is reason to be hopeful. From 2009 to 2012, I led the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which oversees the Paperwork Reduction Act. (Yes, there is such a thing.)
As part of President Obama's continuing effort to streamline regulatory requirements, we took a series of quiet but aggressive steps to cut pointless red tape. In the last decade, the estimated paperwork burden peaked between 2007 and 2009, and while it remains far too high, we were able to chip away at it.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is not exactly famous for eliminating regulatory costs, but in 2011 it removed 1.9 million annual hours of unnecessary burdens imposed on employers. In 2012, the Department of Transportation saved truck drivers 1.6 million annual hours by eliminating a requirement to file redundant inspection reports. The Department of Education has undertaken a series of efforts to simplify the process for filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, removing 5.4 million annual hours of burdens imposed on students and their families.
More ambitiously still, government agencies recently identified more than 100 new paperwork-reduction initiatives, which are anticipated to eliminate some 100 million hours in annual burdens.
IN the area of taxation, Congress has imposed a lot of reporting requirements, sharply reducing the ability of the I.R.S. to streamline the system. And yet the I.R.S. has taken important steps to simplify the annual tax process. Its form 1040EZ allows people earning less than $100,000 to file their taxes with a straightforward one-page form.
The I.R.S. has also announced a far simpler way to assess the popular home-office deduction. More than three million taxpayers claim this deduction, which has long been time-consuming to calculate. The new approach is eliminating 1.6 million hours in annual burdens.
Moreover, the I.R.S.'s ambitious initiative to simplify reporting for capital gains and losses, recently announced though not yet implemented, will allow taxpayers to report summary information without providing unnecessary line-by-line details for each transaction -- saving 19 million hours in annual reporting burdens.
Still, the I.R.S. could do far more. It could encourage many more taxpayers to take advantage of its current efforts to allow them to substitute electronic filings for paper ones. It could increase the use of shorter, streamlined forms (some of these are already available), and it could coordinate and consolidate redundant or overlapping requirements.
Some economists, including Austan Goolsbee, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, have proposed a more ambitious plan: Tax authorities should allow automatic tax returns. They would use the information they already have to send eligible taxpayers fully filled out returns, asking for only a signature and the correction of any errors. California is already using such an approach with a program called Ready Return.
For all the talk about tax simplification, Congress has paid disappointingly little attention to paperwork burdens. But Democrats and Republicans should be able to agree that nine billion hours are far too many. Let's do something about it.

HEADLINE: What I-95 Hasn't Put Asunder

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
Drivers in general may be reduced to cursing -- silently or otherwise -- as they inch along Interstate 95 in parts of Connecticut during rush hour. But for many of the 2,500 or so residents of Saugatuck, a waterside slice of Westport 48 miles from Manhattan, the dislike is almost personal.
When the interstate was built in the mid-1950s to ease longer-distance traffic off local streets, it didn't skirt the working-class Italian community the way it did more affluent parts of Fairfield County. It cut straight through, like a battering ram.
Houses came down; so did a church. Blacktop replaced Turtle Pond, a favorite place to ice-skate. A rumbling overpass halved Franklin Street, a residential locus for Italian-Americans (who today account for about 20 percent of the population). 
''You know that progress has to happen,'' said Cathy Romano, whose childhood home, a porch-wrapped wood-frame house on West Ferry Lane, became a dorm for highway builders before being razed for a parking lot. ''But it was traumatic.''
But the community, determined to hold Saugatuck together, adapted. Some of the displaced took their dwellings with them; a few ended up on Dr. Gillette Place Circle, so that Victorians are interspersed around an area with Capes and ranches.
Ms. Romano relocated to a house on Saugatuck Avenue built by her grandfather, an Italian immigrant who worked as a gardener on nearby estates. Built in 1920 for $7,000, in an area that has since been zoned commercial, the shingle-sided colonial was a three-bedroom, though two other bedrooms have been added, said Ms. Romano, who is employed as the education director for the Church of the Assumption.
Even the nooks at the base of a column that holds up the highway across the Saugatuck River have been adapted for a handy purpose, as a spot for fishermen to store lobster pots, half a dozen to a stack.
Bustling and dense, with a number of restaurants and some shops, Saugatuck can feel almost urban, especially when compared with leafier, sleepier Westport areas like Coleytown, which has two-acre residential zoning. But there are plenty of people who would rather be squeezed in than spread out.
When Bette Demartini moved to Westport in the early 1980s, she and her husband, Paul, a surgeon, had a house just outside Saugatuck. She regularly shopped in the neighborhood, reached by a stroll across a bridge. It was a convenience reminiscent of Manhattan, where she had lived for years, she said.
Getting around easily by foot also informed her next house purchase: a contemporary with lots of glass and open space in the nautical Saugatuck Shores section. With views of Long Island Sound from its third-story deck, the four-bedroom house cost $875,000 in 1987, said Ms. Demartini, a retired anesthesiologist.
With its houses nearly touching on quarter-acre or smaller lots, Saugatuck Shores doesn't seem like a place to go to maximize privacy. That was precisely the point, said Ms. Demartini, explaining that trips to the beach at the end of her block usually involve stops to chitchat.
''We didn't want a suburban lifestyle,'' she said. ''We wanted something that maintained the air of being an active and social place.''
What You'll Find
The community is in the midst of an $18 million attempt to ease the effects of I-95's divisive presence: Saugatuck Center is a mixed-use four-acre redevelopment project undertaken by the Gault family, a local landlord whose roots date to the mid-1800s. (It also operates Gault Energy.) In addition to shops, restaurants and plazas at a Riverside Avenue site, there will be houses -- in other words, a residential presence in a longtime commercial district. Six apartments became available in 2011; all are leased, Gault says.
And 21 more, ranging from studios, for $3,000 a month, to two-bedrooms with decks for $5,500, are to be completed in the final phase this fall, said Jim Donaher, the project head, declaring, ''We're going to bring this area back to what it was.'' In a community with hardly any housing beyond single-family homes, 27 new apartments amount to a lot.
Recovery of another kind is on the minds of some homeowners in Saugatuck Shores, a low-lying, compressed area. Hurricane Sandy dealt it a punishing blow, as have other big storms. The houses perched atop carports seem to have come out unscathed. But more modest properties -- especially along Harbor Road, which is separated from Long Island Sound by a jumble of boulders -- seem hurt. On a recent visit, a few had plywood in their windows, and the storm had strewn oysters across lawns.
A ritzier enclave can be found near Saugatuck Harbor Yacht Club, from Ferry Lane to Duck Pond Road, along a strip of Saugatuck Avenue that has dead-end private lanes leading from it.
What You'll Pay
Though laborers once called the area home, they could probably ill afford it today.
In early April, 22 single-family homes were listed for sale, at an average of $2.72 million, according to data from the Greater Fairfield County Consolidated Multiple Listing Service prepared by Country Club Properties, a local brokerage. At the top end, a five-bedroom 2000 colonial on a two-acre waterfront lot with a tennis court, was listed at $10.99 million. The lowest price was $549,900, for a 1969 colonial near I-95.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, prices have swooned since the recession. In 2012, 29 single-family homes sold, at an average of $1.22 million, according to the data. In 2008 there were 19 such sales, at an average of $2.98 million.
That drop can be ascribed in part to weakness at the high end, which has been slow to recover, brokers say. In 2008, for example, a six-bedroom on the water with a pool sold at $9.83 million. In 2012, a comparable waterfront six-bedroom sold at $4.65 million. ''Yet we are now seeing a corner being turned,'' said Ruth Miner, Country Club's owner. ''Open houses have been busier in the last three months across the market.''
What to Do
The quaint streetscape along Railroad Place offers restaurants like Tarantino, which Ms. Demartini likes for its pumpkin ravioli, and Mario's Place. Both mainstays, they have been joined in recent years by businesses like Cocoa Michelle, which sells fair-trade coffee and plays soothing music, and is to open a 2,200-square-foot gourmet market in one of the new Saugatuck Center retail spaces this summer, Mr. Donaher said.
When restaurants shutter, they're rarely empty long. A place called Bonda, on Charles Street, closed in 2010; by the next year the site housed a Tarry Lodge, part of Mario Batali's chain.
The Schools
Saugatuck Elementary, the highly rated grade school for Saugatuck, sits just outside the neighborhood's boundaries; it is one of five in the district. Last year 100 percent of its third-graders met standards in math, 97 percent in reading, 98 percent in writing, versus 86, 83 and 83 statewide.
Bedford School covers Grades 6 through 8. Staples High School is one of the state's best; it has an Olympic-size pool and a radio station (90.3 FM). SAT averages last year were 589 in reading, 599 in math and 597 in writing, versus 506, 512 and 510 statewide.
The Commute
Saugatuck has one of Westport's two stations on the Metro-North New Haven line. It has eight trains on weekdays from 6 to 8 a.m.; the fastest takes 61 minutes to get to Grand Central Terminal. A monthly pass is $341.
Of the 1,365 parking spaces spread out across 8 lots, 1,064 are reserved; permits cost $325 a year. The waiting list for spots is about four years long. But according to Foti Koskinas, the deputy police chief in charge of parking, the town is planning an online effort to cull outdated names.
The History
For the first two centuries of its existence, ''Saugatuck'' was the name of the entire town; upon incorporation in 1835, ''Westport'' won out, in part because ''Saugatuck'' sounded too much like ''succotash,'' according to ''Westport, Connecticut: The Story of a New England Town's Rise to Prominence,'' by Woody Klein.

HEADLINE: Dark Roots Of a Pop Master's Sunshine

BYLINE: By BLAKE GOPNIK

 BODY:
Paying a visit to Claes Oldenburg, one of the last surviving giants of Pop Art, you'd be forgiven for expecting a wacky guy living in chaos. His crowd-pleasing masterworks -- a canvas hamburger the size of a couch, a rusting clothespin as big as a house, a lipstick tall as a tree -- can easily be read as giant guffaws at a pompous art world. His gorgeous sketches for those projects are as wild and woolly as could be. So yes, you'd be forgiven for expecting a scene from a shaggy New Yorker cartoon by Ed Koren -- forgiven, and mistaken.
Mr. Oldenburg's five-story studio, on the western edge of SoHo, is utterly tidy, its classic loft spaces furnished with rigorous Bauhaus classics and hard-edge Minimal pieces by Donald Judd. Mr. Oldenburg, who is 84, wears stylish round tortoiseshell glasses and receives his guest with more Old World gentility than New York pushiness. (He was born in Sweden, into a diplomat's household.) He reveals a sense of humor, joking about how a big newspaper ad for his forthcoming show at the Museum of Modern Art, opening Sunday, has been upstaged by one for a show about whales. But there's no trace of the clown, and there's plenty of orderly retrospection. 
''If you really want to be an artist, you search yourself, and you find a lot of it comes from earlier times,'' he said. ''I have pretty much built the work around my experiences. When I've moved from one place to another, the work has changed.'' He came to New York in 1956 from Chicago, where he was mostly raised, and settled on the Lower East Side, which he describes as New York's ''most creative and stimulating part.''
His first notable art found its inspiration there, he said, in ''garbage containers made out of burlap,'' in the neighborhood's nascent graffiti and in its competing Jewish and Latino cultures. And he was exposed to this street-smart energy at just the right time, when the showy abstractions of Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline felt old hat, but no one knew what was next. ''It was a moment waiting to happen,'' he said, listing all the artists ready to burst on the scene, like Red Grooms, Allan Kaprow and Jim Dine -- not to mention himself.
That is the moment being explored in the show ''Claes Oldenburg: The Street and the Store,'' named for two projects that jump-started his career. Recreating scenes from the grit of New York's urban fabric, originally as a backdrop for some of the first examples of performance art, Mr. Oldenburg's early installations show a frenetic, angry, even political side that has been lost in our concentration on him in his later, cheery Pop Art incarnation. And that early work is perhaps in better accord with current art trends, giving Mr. Oldenburg a renewed relevance.
He is probably best known for the soft sculptures he made in the later 1960s, like giant fans and Popsicles and telephones sewn from floppy vinyl. Or as the man behind the massive public sculptures of the following decades, like a monumental pair of binoculars off Venice Beach, Calif., made in collaboration with his wife, the Dutch art historian Coosje van Bruggen, who died in 2009. But more and more, Oldenburg scholars are realizing that all that bubbly Pop had at its root his very early, angsty, urban works, like those coming to MoMA, and that his playful sculptures have more power when those roots are understood.
Ann Temkin, the museum's chief curator of painting and sculpture and the coordinator of the Oldenburg exhibition -- a more focused version of a show first seen at Vienna's museum of modern art -- referred to ''The Street'' (1960), Mr. Oldenburg's first mature work, as ''an absolute masterpiece.'' It was an art installation before the term was current, shown for six weeks in a shabby basement gallery run by the Judson Memorial Church on Washington Square. Walls were covered with crude, barely legible cutouts of people, cars, bikes and guns -- basic ingredients of life on the Lower East Side -- made from found cardboard and slathered in black paint. The floor was awash in detritus picked off the pavements around Mr. Oldenburg's home, and the whole mess also functioned as a backdrop for some of the earliest happenings. For the one called ''Snapshots From the City,'' Mr. Oldenburg dressed in rags and writhed and jerked amid the trash, finally pulling out a cardboard gun and miming suicide. ''We were received in not too friendly a way,'' he recalled. ''We were changing the rules.''
Ms. Temkin said she detects an echo of Mr. Oldenburg's early work in the rise of garbage art and abject assemblage today, as well as in performance. ''I see a whole host of performances by artists in their 20s, and I'm convinced that they don't know about these precedents,'' she said. ''They shouldn't think they're inventing the wheel.''
Mr. Oldenburg said he remembers when that was precisely what he and his peers were doing. ''It all sort of coalesced as the '60s came. It was magical, when you think about it, because everything seemed to start all of a sudden.'' With the election of John F. Kennedy ''there was a feeling that the country was going to come to life.'' The artist's job, as Mr. Oldenburg saw it, was to plug into that energy and to ''engage our surroundings, to use the material around us in imaginative ways.'' That engagement is what some younger thinkers now see as Mr. Oldenburg's forte.
Joshua Shannon, 41 and a professor at the University of Maryland, is the author of an essay in a new volume on Mr. Oldenburg in the prestigious October Files series. He describes Mr. Oldenburg's earliest art as bearing crucial witness to a moment when New York's economy was shifting from the production of goods, as seen in the sweat shops of the Lower East Side, to financial services, advertising and other sponsors of the glass-and-steel skyscrapers that were leveling the old fabric of New York just as Mr. Oldenburg began to revel in it. (He said that he shuns skyscrapers to this day and pointed an accusatory finger at a rare one in SoHo that now fills the view from windows in his loft.)
''It's a lot more complicated than just, 'Hey, look, commercial stuff -- I'm going to mix that with high art,' '' Mr. Shannon said, which is the standard reading of what Pop Art is up to. Instead he said that Mr. Oldenburg was ''more in touch with the underside of that economic moment; he's around a fair amount of poverty and misery.'' Mr. Oldenburg took the anger of Abstract Expressionism and redirected it toward sorrows found in the real world.
After all these years Mr. Oldenburg doesn't reveal many traces of that earlier fire. He conducted an interview in a sweater vest and corduroys that would suit any retired professor. He talked, carefully, systematically, about the growth of his interest in color and consumer goods and about his lifelong insistence on form over content. (''I always say I'm not doing a hamburger, I'm doing a sculpture.'') But it seems almost certain that the methodical thinker of today has been in charge all along, even when his younger self was raging in rags or playing around with giant foodstuffs.
''The Store,'' first fashioned in 1961 and Mr. Oldenburg's second major project, was created as a mock shop at street level that he filled with funky plaster versions of his neighborhood's everyday goods: bow ties, a bra and dresses, a cash register, even two cheeseburgers. By the next September, now in a gallery setting, these objects had been joined by huge, soft versions of an ice cream cone, a hamburger and a slice of fudge cake. For Mr. Shannon this work is bound up with ''a basic bodily humanity'' that was being ''bulldozed'' in precisely the place and at the moment that Mr. Oldenburg was making his art -- that is, the old manufacturer's world of making things with your own sweaty hands was being replaced by the new, immaterial service industries.
Mr. Dine, Mr. Oldenburg's partner in art for some of the Judson happenings, sees another aspect to the story. Speaking by phone from his farm in Walla Walla, Wash., he noted his colleague's European skills and touch (''it was so clear that Claes was a Nordic draftsman'') and stressed that it was Mr. Oldenburg's origins abroad that gave him the distance to appreciate what was at stake on the Lower East Side. ''He was looking at American consumer culture and finding New World romance,'' Mr. Dine said.
This squares with memories called up by Mr. Oldenburg himself. He said he was happy to take on United States citizenship because ''I found America most interesting, challenging.'' Many of his sculptures refer to objects from the time of his arrival in America as a small child -- to bulbous 1930s cars, tubby vacuums, clothespins -- rather than to the brash world of 1960s consumerism that we associate with Pop Art.
Maartje Oldenburg, his daughter, cited a certain economic ''foreignness'' as a force behind her father's interest in the Lower East Side. Ms. Oldenburg recently edited many of her father's papers, and, aside from suggesting how fiercely disciplined and organized this presumably wild artist has always been (early diaries keep a daily record of his weight and diet), she said they show that, despite a pretty fancy upbringing -- his father was the Swedish consul in Chicago; his mother sang opera -- he has long been conscious of inequalities in wealth and power. ''In his notes he'll say, 'I really side with the underdog,' '' she said.
A visit to the Manhattan home of his younger brother, Richard Oldenburg, who retired as director of the Museum of Modern Art in 1995, gives some clue of how exotic New York's tenements must have seemed to Claes when he first began to live among them: the apartment is full of the elegant Swedish antiques that the boys grew up with. Richard Oldenburg said that, in immigrant New York, young Claes ''suddenly discovered that there was a whole world out there that he hadn't dealt with.''
''It may have been in some general way a boredom with the bourgeois world,'' he added.
So maybe now we're onto what accounts for the peculiar nature of Mr. Oldenburg's art and its longevity. He's not seeing America's popular culture through the eyes of someone born deep inside it, the way Andy Warhol did as a poor kid from Pittsburgh. Rather, Mr. Oldenburg came at that culture as a bit of an outsider, with a European's eyes, and always saw it as bigger than it was and more full of magic than such ordinary subjects had a right to be.
''There was a lot of criticism for a long time,'' Mr. Oldenburg said, recalling the pans of John Canaday, a critic for The New York Times, as especially harsh. ''I remember how for one show he had a headline that said, 'Oldenburg Is Back With a Few Bathroom Jokes,' '' (The actual headline was meaner than he's recalled: ''Gag Man Returns With A Few Bathroom Jokes.'')
But then, Mr. Oldenburg said, he thought to himself, ''O.K., say what you like, but you'll see.''

HEADLINE: Kerry in China To Seek Help In Korea Crisis

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON; Jane Perlez contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A more recent article about Secretary of State John Kerry's trip to Asia can be found here.
BEIJING -- Secretary of State John Kerry flew to China on Saturday and sought to elicit China's help in dealing with an increasingly recalcitrant nuclear armed North Korea by saying that American missile defenses could be cut back if the North abandoned its nuclear program.
Mr. Kerry's trip to China, his first since taking office, is part of an intensive three-day push to try to calm tensions on the Korean Peninsula that have threatened to spiral out of control and rattled world leaders.
In a news conference, Mr. Kerry suggested that the United States could remove some newly enhanced missile defenses in the region, though he did not specify which ones. Any eventual cutback would address Chinese concerns about the buildup of American weapons systems in the region. 
After back-to-back meetings between Mr. Kerry and China's top leaders, the two countries announced that they endorsed the principle of ridding the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons, though China did not state publicly what steps it might take to achieve that goal after years of reluctance to crack down on Pyongyang.
''We also joined together in calling on North Korea to refrain from provocations and to abide by international obligations,'' Mr. Kerry said.
Worries spiked last week as the South Koreans predicted the North could launch a new missile test any day and after the disclosure that an American intelligence agency concluded for the first time with ''moderate confidence'' that North Korea learned how to make a nuclear warhead small enough to be delivered by a ballistic missile. The administration has since said that it was premature to conclude that Pyongyang had a fully tested weapons system.
Mr. Kerry's stance on newly fortified missile defenses appeared to be a selling point to get China, the only country presumed to have any real influence over North Korea, to do what it has long resisted -- crack down hard enough that North Korea's leaders will give up an increasingly sophisticated nuclear program.
In recent weeks, the administration has dispatched two ships outfitted with Aegis antimissile defenses to the region and said it will speed up the positioning of land-based missile defenses on Guam to protect allies in the region after North Korea's threats to rain missiles on United States troops there and on South Korea.
Many Chinese believe the antimissile systems are part of a containment strategy against them at a time when the United States is pursuing a ''pivot'' to Asia.
In the past, China has been motivated by a different fear: that any move to destabilize the North would lead to a collapse of the regime and deliver the entire peninsula to the United States' sphere of influence, possibly bringing American troops in South Korea closer to its border.
On Sunday, Mr. Kerry met with Japanese leaders in Tokyo, where they agreed to keep working toward a nuclear-free North Korea and suggested that direct talks were possible under certain conditions..
North Korea has a clear choice available, Mr. Kerry said, according to The Associated Press, and will find ''ready partners'' in the United States if it follows through. The Japanese foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, was more specific, saying that Pyongyang must meet its commitment to earlier deals regarding its nuclear and missile programs and on returning kidnapped foreigners.
China's cooperation is essential to the Obama administration's strategy of holding a tough line on Pyongyang in an attempt to achieve the type of long-lasting solution on the nuclear program that has eluded a string of United States presidents. Previous administrations responded to North Korean provocations by eventually offering aid to tamp down tensions, only to see the North's promises to relinquish its nuclear program evaporate once the aid had been delivered.
Mr. Kerry said he explained to China why the United States felt it needed more missile defenses in the region.
''Obviously if the threat disappears -- i.e. North Korea denuclearizes -- the same imperative does not exist at that point of time for us to have that kind of robust forward leaning posture of defense,'' he said. ''And it would be our hope in the long run, or better yet in short run, that we can address that.''
Mr. Kerry's remarks in Beijing are likely to stir concern among staunch advocates of missile defense in the United States, who also see antimissile systems as a means of responding to China's growing military might. His aides say any changes would require the input of the Pentagon.
Even if China were to take a strong position with its longtime ally, possibly cutting back essential aid and fuel, North Korea might not fall into line. Under its new leader,Kim Jong-un, the North has snubbed China several times, including refusing Chinese entreaties to cancel the recent nuclear test that set off the war of words on the Peninsula.
At the core of the issue is the United States' inability to draw North Korea into a serious round of nuclear talks. North Korea's apparent determination to expand its nuclear weapons program and the American demand that it commit up front to eventually relinquishing those arms have raised the question of whether there is even any basis for negotiations. ''China has an enormous ability to help make a difference here,'' Mr. Kerry said on Friday in Seoul.
The Chinese stance on North Korea has never been a simple one. On one hand, the Chinese prize stability and are eager to avoid a crisis that would spawn a flood of refugees or prompt the United States to shift more forces to the Pacific. On the other hand, that same concern for stability has meant that it is reluctant to take steps that would undermine the North Korean government's hold on power and eliminate a friendly buffer between Chinese territory and South Korean and American forces.
In Beijing, Mr. Kerry met with the new president,Xi Jinping, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, PremierLi Keqiangand State Councilor Yang Jiechi.
Mr. Yang said at a dinner with Mr. Kerry on Saturday night that China was committed to ''the denuclearization process on the Korean Peninsula.'' But the Chinese state councilor also stressed that the ''issue should be handled and resolved peacefully through dialogue and consultation.''
To encourage the Chinese to deal with the North Korean nuclear problem, Mr. Kerry said that he had shared ''very in-depth'' information illustrating the danger of how a nuclear North Korea could promote the proliferation of nuclear arms in Asia and the Middle East.
Mr. Kerry said his aim was to find a way to revive the goals of the six-party talks on the North's nuclear program, which have been stalled since 2009 when North Korea withdrew. The talks have included North and South Korea, China, Russia, Japan and the United States.
He also portrayed cooperation on North Korea as just one element of a ''model partnership'' the United States hoped to build with China on diplomatic, economic and environmental issues.
Mr. Kerry said there would be additional discussions in the weeks ahead with the Chinese that would involve American intelligence experts including Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The two sides also called on North Korea to refrain from provocations, an apparent allusion to a potential missile test the South Koreans said could happen soon.
Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said China was very frustrated with Mr. Kim and was taking some action, like cracking down on the flow of illicit North Korean funds through Chinese banks. At the same time, she noted, the Chinese fear the United States' recent actions, including a test flight of B-2 bombers over South Korea, would further incite the North.
The United States ''keeps sending more fighter bombers and missile defense ships to the waters of East Asia and carrying out massive military drills with Asian allies in a dramatic display of pre-emptive power,'' the state-run news agency Xinhua said Saturday.

HEADLINE: Quietly, Indians Reshape Cities And Reservations

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
MINNEAPOLIS -- Nothing in her upbringing on a remote Indian reservation in northern Minnesota prepared Jean Howard for her introduction to city life during a visit here eight years ago: an outbreak of gunfire, followed by the sight of people scattering.
She watched, confused, before realizing that she should run, too. ''I said: 'I'm not living here. This is crazy,' '' she recalled.
But not long afterward, Ms. Howard did return, and found a home in Minneapolis. She is part of a continuing and largely unnoticed mass migration of American Indians, whose move to urban centers over the past several decades has fundamentally changed both reservations and cities.
Though they are widely associated with rural life, more than 7 of 10 Indians and Alaska Natives now live in a metropolitan area, according to Census Bureau data released this year, compared with 45 percent in 1970 and 8 percent in 1940. 
The trend mirrors the pattern of millions of African-Americans who left the rural South during the Great Migration of the 20th century and moved to cities in the North and West. But while many black migrants found jobs in meatpacking plants, stockyards and automobile factories, American Indians have not had similar success finding work.
''When you look at it as a percentage, the black migration was nothing in comparison to the percentage of Native Americans who have come to urban areas,'' said Dr. Philip R. Lee, an assistant secretary for health during the Clinton administration and an emeritus professor of social medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.
Recent budget figures show that federal money has not followed the migration, with only about 1 percent of spending by the Indian Health Service going to urban programs. Cities, with their own budget problems, are also failing to meet their needs.
One effect of the move toward cities has been a proliferation of Native American street gangs, which mimic and sometimes form partnerships with better-established African-American and Latino gangs, according to the F.B.I. and local law enforcement reports. Last month, a federal jury in Minneapolis convicted several members of the Native Mob, a violent gang, of racketeering and other crimes as part of one of the largest gang prosecutions ever undertaken in Indian Country.
The migration goes to the heart of the question of whether the more than 300 reservations in the United States are an imperative or a hindrance to Native Americans, a debate that dates to the 19th century, when the reservation system was created by the federal government.
Citing generational poverty and other shortcomings in reservations, a federal policy from the 1950s to the 1970s pressured Indian populations to move to cities. Though unpopular on reservations, the effort helped prompt the migration, according to those who have moved to cities in recent years and academics who have studied the trend.
Regardless of where they live, a greater proportion of Indians live in poverty than any other group, at a rate that is nearly double the national average. Census data show that 27 percent of all Native Americans live in poverty, compared with 25.8 percent of African-Americans, who are the next highest group, and 14.3 percent of Americans over all.
Moreover, data show that in a number of metropolitan areas, American Indians have levels of impoverishment that rival some of the nation's poorest reservations. Denver, Phoenix and Tucson, for instance, have poverty rates for Indians approaching 30 percent. In Chicago, Oklahoma City, Houston and New York -- where more Indians live than any other city -- about 25 percent live in poverty.
Even worse off are those living in Rapid City, S.D., where the poverty level stands at more than 50 percent, and here in Minneapolis, where more than 45 percent live in poverty.
''Our population has dealt with all these problems in the past,'' said Jay Bad Heart Bull, the president and chief operating officer of the Native American Community Development Institute, a social services agency in Minneapolis. ''But it's easier to get lost in the city. It's easier to disappear.''
Despite the rampant poverty, many view Minneapolis as a symbol of progress. The city's Indian population, about 2 percent of the total, is more integrated than in most other metropolitan areas, and there are social services and legal and job training programs specifically focused on them.
The city has a Native American City Council member, Robert Lilligren; a Native American state representative, Susan Allen; and a police chief, Janee Harteau, who is part Indian. But city life has brought with it familiar social ills like alcoholism and high unemployment, along with less familiar problems, including racism, heroin use and aggressive street gangs.
Lee Antell is the president of the American Indian Opportunities Industrialization Center, which provides job training and operates an alternative high school in Minneapolis. ''You can go down the list of all the urban problems -- homelessness, having no money, on probation,'' he said. ''We've dealt with all of that, and if we had a student with just one of those, we'd jump for joy.''
But Clyde Bellecourt, a co-founder of the American Indian Movement who lives in Minneapolis and continues to be involved in a number of social organizations in the southern part of the city, where most of the American Indian population lives, said that despite the poverty, cities tend to provide Native Americans with greater opportunities.
''It's not bad here,'' Mr. Bellecourt said. ''They come here and they get job training and don't want to go back to the reservation.''
At the heart of one experiment to halt the cycle of poverty here is Little Earth of United Tribes, a sprawling 212-apartment complex, the nation's only public housing project that gives American Indians preference. It offers a wide array of social services, from empowerment counselors and bike rentals to couples' therapy and a teen center that offers homework help, computers and board games. Houses are being built next to the complex to promote homeownership.
The typical resident is a single mother. The unemployment rate, more than 65 percent, is only marginally better than at impoverished reservations like Pine Ridge in South Dakota.
Bill Ziegler, the housing project's president and chief executive officer, said he came to Minneapolis from the Lower Brule reservation in South Dakota in 2004 with a wife and five young children. Within the first six months in the project, he said, there were five gang homicides, and from 2005 to 2007, only three students graduated from high school, a rate of about 5 percent.
During a community forum in 2007, he asked to see the hands of parents who believed that their children would graduate from high school. He said no one raised their hand. ''We expect boys to join gangs, girls to get pregnant,'' he said. ''I told them, 'Our kids are doing what they're expected to do.' '' His solution has been to offer programs that are widely used by residents and to install nearly two dozen security cameras around the complex, hire off-duty police officers and evict individuals who have committed crimes or other offenses.
Mr. Ziegler said the board was moving toward a requirement that every resident have a job, be enrolled in school at least part time or serve as a volunteer. Though unemployment remains high, he said, the complex now has more than 120 volunteers.
''When we're talking about change, we're not hunting vampires -- there's no silver bullet,'' Mr. Ziegler said. ''It's like the Lakota hunters bringing down a buffalo. It wasn't one shot. It was a series of arrows that led to success. And it's going to take a series of arrows to bring down the beast.''

HEADLINE: The Other Greenwich

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
Manuel Bonilla looked at me, confused. I had just asked him if he worried about entering his son into the Greenwich, Conn., public-school system. Greenwich, of course, is one of the wealthiest towns in America, home to hedge-fund billionaires like Steven A. Cohen, who has a world-renowned art collection and had a private ice rink. Bonilla is a handyman whose family struggles to make the rent. Wasn't he just a little concerned that his child would feel self-conscious?
No, Bonilla told me. In Greenwich schools, he said, ''they teach ice-skating.'' His wife, Veronica Llerena, who works as a housekeeper and a cashier at a Peruvian restaurant, added, ''They have everything -- music, sports, art, drama.'' She and Bonilla, who farmed a small plot in El Ejido in Andalusia, recently left because ''in Spain, he has no future,'' Bonilla said, pointing at their 4-year-old son, Manuel Jr., who was sleeping in his mother's arms. In Greenwich, they thought he did. 
The Bonillas were sitting with other low-income families in the immaculate Greenwich Head Start building. I had long known that Greenwich -- with its grand estates -- was ground zero for the 1 percent, but I was surprised to learn that nearly 4 percent of its residents live below the poverty line. ''It takes a lot of labor to run those estates,'' says Bob Arnold, president of Family Centers, a nonprofit social-service agency there. ''They need housekeepers, cooks, landscapers.'' I figured that many of those lower-income workers commuted from nearby places like White Plains, N.Y., or Stamford, Conn., where the rents are much cheaper. And many certainly do, but Arnold told me that the families who opt to live just on the Greenwich side of the New York border or in the apartments above the stores on Greenwich Avenue, fit a very specific profile: they pay the costs to have access to the schools that Greenwich's high property-tax base affords.
What Greenwich doesn't have is an abundance of affordable housing. Megan Sweeney, a director at Family Centers, explained that information about them is often guarded by family members or close friends. The Bonillas moved to Greenwich only because Veronica's sister, Mercy Llerena, a manager of a private estate, went there from White Plains after marrying a man in town. Another woman I met, Estella Rozende, an immigrant from Brazil, learned about Greenwich from a family friend who has helped dozens get started there.
The Bonillas and Rozende felt lucky to have children in Greenwich. But historically speaking, researchers haven't been so sure that it is beneficial to enroll low-income children in wealthier schools. A lot of sociological data, dating to the definitive Coleman Report of 1966, which studied the outcomes of 570,000 students, show that a child's success in school, more than anything, was determined by her parents' wealth and education level. So in the decades after the report was issued, attention was lavished on various reforms and integrating schools according to race, not economics.
New research, however, suggests that economic integration may be the answer. Recently, Heather Schwartz, a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, began studying the public-school system of Montgomery County, Md. The county, a suburb of Washington, has one of the most affluent populations in America and an innovative housing authority that allows low-income citizens to rent homes alongside wealthier neighbors at steeply discounted prices. The renters are randomly assigned to different parts of the county; some Montgomery County schools have many poor students, others have almost none. In 2009, Schwartz concluded that students from poor families did much better in predominantly wealthy schools than in predominantly poor ones. On average, the poorer children in wealthier schools cut their achievement gap in half compared with their peers in poorer schools.
The same thing is happening at Greenwich High. Around 13 percent of the school's students receive free or discounted lunches, a commonly used proxy for low income. And more than three-quarters of those students scored at or above proficiency on the most recent statewide 10th-grade performance tests. At nearby Stamford High School, where nearly 47 percent of students are on the lunch program, almost half the students failed to meet proficiency levels.
Schwartz still isn't exactly sure why poor kids do so much better when they are surrounded by wealthier ones, but the stability of wealthier districts probably plays a role. (''High-poverty schools are often lurching from crisis to crisis,'' she told me.) As such, there is now a small but fast-growing effort to integrate schools on economic lines. Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, says that 80 school districts, serving four million students -- or roughly 10 percent of all students in the country -- have some kind of economic-integration policy. (That's up from a single district in the late '90s.) The remarkable thing about economic integration, Kahlenberg says, is that it seems to improve outcomes for the poor without diminishing educational attainment among the rich. Christopher Winters, headmaster of Greenwich High School, says that the greater diversity of the population makes for a better educational experience for all students. The low-income population has nearly doubled in the past seven years at Greenwich High, and no parent, he said, has complained.
There is a tricky balance, however. If too many poor students are added to a high-income school, it would eventually become a low-income school; too few, and they may feel isolated. Schwartz says her research suggests that a possible solution is to encourage economic integration across school-district borders: students in the Bronx, say, could be invited to attend New Rochelle's public schools and bring its low-income population up to 20 percent. This is one of those rare occasions in which a policy might lead to a virtuous economic cycle: poor kids at wealthier schools could do better; low-income schools could focus on fewer students; wealthier schools could receive subsidies and benefit from diversity.
This could make life much better for millions of students. Which reminded me of a conversation I had with Estella Rozende, who was both worried about what her future in Greenwich had in store for her 4-year-old daughter and also not worried at all. ''When she is a teenager, she will want stuff I won't be able to give her -- trips, iPhones,'' she said. ''I can't give her what she wants. But I can give her a better life.''
Deep thoughts this week:
1. What's the best way to help low-income students?
2. It might be putting them in a school with rich kids.
3. Who knew Greenwich was a model of equality?

HEADLINE: Should You Be Paying Taxes on Your Baby Sitter?

BYLINE: JACOBA URIST


HIGHLIGHT: If you pay a nanny or baby sitter more than $1,800 a year, you are required to be paying employment taxes. 

 BODY:
If you want to hear a pin drop, ask a room of parents whether they report employment taxes for their baby sitter or nanny. My (admittedly unscientific) conclusion, drawn from four years of Manhattan motherhood, is that many families do not. In a 2011 discussion of nanny compensationon Park Slope Parents, most families reported paying their caregivers completely off the books, while very few said they paid the tax. Susan Fox, founder of Park Slope Parents, suspects the off-the-books number among her readers is well over half. 
For some reason, otherwise lovely and law-abiding citizens find nanny-tax withholding to be one of the most sensitive and perplexing household finance issues out there. When I was speaking recently at a legal workshop for parents, a pregnant woman raised her hand, and asked me rather incredulously, "Are we really expected to pay taxes on a nanny?" 
Legally, the short answer is, "Yes." It's also the right thing to do, as parents who want to teach our kids to play by the rules, and as taxpayers who want to pull our weight in society. And don't get too hung up on the word "nanny" either. You may be required to pay taxes on a person who you think is "only" a part-time or occasional baby sitter. 
The longer answer, of course, is why so many parents choose to hunker down and hope that their tax return never gets flagged for an audit, or that their relationship with their nanny never sours.

In my experience, many parents feel the threshold for nanny tax responsibility is too low. And in a place like New York, where the going rate for a sitter is $18 to $20 per hour, that's a pretty plausible perception. According to the I.R.S.'s Household Employer's Tax Guide(or Publication 926) for 2013, any family that paid a household employee $1,800 in cash wages over the year is required to withhold Social Security and Medicare, and to match that withholding with an employer contribution. Additional unemployment and state taxes may also be due. 
So some parents who pay a full-time caregiver's salary perceive an acute unfairness in having to withhold for not only their full-time nanny, but also for a more casual sitter. And the whole thing starts to seem a little silly. It's the kind of rule nobody is really meant to comply with fully anyway, and a tax law you can bend harmlessly. Even outside of big cities, at $12 an hour, about three Saturday "date nights" a month can make someone a household employee. Raising the dollar amount at which withholding kicks in to a more sensible level (say, $5,000) might actually lead to more compliance - by making the law seem more fair and reasonable. 
Susan Tokayer is co-president of the International Nanny Association, a nonprofit umbrella organization for the in-home child-care industry that compiles annual salary and benefits data as reported by child-care providers. 
"When it comes to nanny taxes, clients often say they feel they're being double-taxed," Tokayer said. "Here they are paying income taxes on their own earnings, paying their nanny's salary from their after-tax income, and then they have to pay their nanny's taxes." 
At the same time, parents who want to put a nanny on the books can't always find a caregiver who's willing to be paid legitimately. Despite the occasional sensationalistic story, 99 percent of nannies do not make six figures. For most of them, every dollar counts. 
And the feeling is often mutual. In a world in which child care can cost as much as college, parents want to maximize their dollars too. If the nanny who seems like the best fit for their family can't afford withholding, and the parents can't afford to gross up her pay (without losing hours they need to be at work), many choose their family's well-being over the I.R.S. 
There's also the issue of undocumented caregivers, which adds to the touchiness so many parents feel about nanny taxes. 
But Professor Peter Markowitz, director of Cardozo School of Law's immigration clinic in New York City, points out that a lot of undocumented workers do, in fact, comply with the tax law and file returns. A nanny without a green card or Social Security number can apply for an Individual Tax Payer Identification Number so she can pay her taxes, and an employer can withhold as if she were here legally. And while an undocumented caregiver may be extremely hesitant to put her name into the system, Professor Markowitz explains that the I.R.S. has every incentive not to be a gateway for the Department of Homeland Security, because the I.R.S. is just trying to create revenue. 
In the final analysis, it's most important to remember that withholding rules are designed to protect your nanny, by financing her Social Security and Medicare down the road - just as she tries to anticipate your child's needs each and every day.

HEADLINE: A Tax System Stacked Against the 99 Percent

BYLINE: JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ


HIGHLIGHT: The glaring unfairness of the United States tax system, with its myriad loopholes and special provisions for the wealthy, undermines not only economic growth, but the sense of shared purpose that is vital for democracy. 

 BODY:
LEONA HELMSLEY, the hotel chain executive who was convicted of federal tax evasion in 1989, was notorious for, among other things, reportedly having said that "only the little people pay taxes."
As a statement of principle, the quotation may well have earned Mrs. Helmsley, who died in 2007, the title Queen of Mean. But as a prediction about the fairness of American tax policy, Mrs. Helmsley's remark might actually have been prescient. 
Today, the deadline for filing individual income-tax returns, is a day when Americans would do well to pause and reflect on our tax system and the society it creates. No one enjoys paying taxes, and yet all but the extreme libertarians agree, as Oliver Wendell Holmes said, that taxes are the price we pay for civilized society. But in recent decades, the burden for paying that price has been distributed in increasingly unfair ways.

About 6 in 10 of us believe that the tax system is unfair - and they're right: put simply, the very rich don't pay their fair share. The richest 400 individual taxpayers, with an average income of more than $200 million, pay less than 20 percent of their income in taxes - far lower than mere millionaires, who pay about 25 percent of their income in taxes, and about the same as those earning a mere $200,000 to $500,000. And in 2009, 116 of the top 400 earners - almost a third - paid less than 15 percent of their income in taxes.
Conservatives like to point out that the richest Americans' tax payments make up a large portion of total receipts. This is true, as well it should be in any tax system that is progressive - that is, a system that taxes the affluent at higher rates than those of modest means. It's also true that as the wealthiest Americans' incomes have skyrocketed in recent years, their total tax payments have grown. This would be so even if we had a single flat income-tax rate across the board.
What should shock and outrage us is that as the top 1 percent has grown extremely rich, the effective tax rates they pay have markedly decreased. Our tax system is much less progressive than it was for much of the 20th century. The top marginal income tax rate peaked at 94 percent during World War II and remained at 70 percent through the 1960s and 1970s; it is now 39.6 percent. Tax fairness has gotten much worse in the 30 years since the Reagan "revolution" of the 1980s.
Citizens for Tax Justice, an organization that advocates for a more progressive tax system, has estimated that, when federal, state and local taxes are taken into account, the top 1 percent paid only slightly more than 20 percent of all American taxes in 2010 - about the same as the share of income they took home, an outcome that is not progressive at all.
With such low effective tax rates - and, importantly, the low tax rate of 20 percent on income from capital gains - it's not a huge surprise that the share of income going to the top 1 percent has doubled since 1979, and that the share going to the top 0.1 percent has almost tripled, according to the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez. Recall that the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans own about 40 percent of the nation's wealth, and the picture becomes even more disturbing.
If these numbers still don't impress you as being unfair, consider them in comparison with other wealthy countries.
The United States stands out among the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the world's club of rich nations, for its low top marginal income tax rate. These low rates are not essential for growth - consider Germany, for instance, which has managed to maintain its status as a center of advanced manufacturing, even though its top income-tax rate exceeds America's by a considerable margin. And in general, our top tax rate kicks in at much higher incomes. Denmark, for example, has a top tax rate of more than 60 percent, but that applies to anyone making more than $54,900. The top rate in the United States, 39.6 percent, doesn't kick in until individual income reaches $400,000 (or $450,000 for a couple). Only three O.E.C.D. countries - South Korea, Canada and Spain - have higher thresholds.
Most of the Western world has experienced an increase in inequality in recent decades, though not as much as the United States has. But among most economists there is a general understanding that a country with excessive inequality can't function well; many countries have used their tax codes to help "correct" the market's distribution of wealth and income. The United States hasn't - or at least not very much. Indeed, the low rates at the top serve to exacerbate and perpetuate the inequality - so much so that among the advanced industrial countries, America now has the highest income inequality and the least equality of opportunity. This is a gross inversion of America's traditional meritocratic ideals - ideals that our leaders, across the spectrum, continue to profess.
Over the years, some of the wealthy have been enormously successful in getting special treatment, shifting an ever greater share of the burden of financing the country's expenditures - defense, education, social programs - onto others. Ironically, this is especially true of some of our multinational corporations, which call on the federal government to negotiate favorable trade treaties that allow them easy entry into foreign markets and to defend their commercial interests around the world, but then use these foreign bases to avoid paying taxes.
General Electric has become the symbol for multinational corporations that have their headquarters in the United States but pay almost no taxes - its effective corporate-tax rate averaged less than 2 percent from 2002 to 2012 - just as Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee last year, became the symbol for the wealthy who don't pay their fair share when he admitted that he paid only 14 percent of his income in taxes in 2011, even as he notoriously complained that 47 percent of Americans were freeloaders. Neither G.E. nor Mr. Romney has, to my knowledge, broken any tax laws, but the sparse taxes they've paid violate most Americans' basic sense of fairness.
In looking at such statistics, one has to be careful: they typically reflect taxes as a percentage of reported income. And the tax laws don't require the reporting of all kinds of income. For the rich, hiding such assets has become an elite sport. Many avail themselves of the Cayman Islands or other offshore tax shelters to avoid taxes (and not, you can safely assume, because of the sunny weather). They don't have to report income until it is brought back ("repatriated") to the United States. So, too, capital gains have to be reported as income only when they are realized.
And if the assets are passed on to one's children or grandchildren at death, no taxes are ever paid, in a peculiar loophole called the "step-up in cost basis at death." Yes, the tax privileges of being rich in America extend into the afterlife.
As Americans look at some of the special provisions in the tax code - for vacation homes, racetracks, beer breweries, oil refineries, hedge funds and movie studios, among many other favored assets or industries - it is no wonder that they feel disillusioned with a tax system that is so riddled with special rewards. Most of these tax-code loopholes and giveaways did not materialize from thin air, of course - usually, they were enacted in pursuit of, or at least in response to, campaign contributions from influential donors. It is estimated that these kinds of special tax provisions amount to some $123 billion a year, and that the price tag for offshore tax loopholes is not far behind. Eliminating these provisions alone would go a long way toward meeting deficit-reduction targets called for by fiscal conservatives who worry about the size of the public debt.
Yet another source of unfairness is the tax treatment on so-called carried interest. Some Wall Street financiers are able to pay taxes at lower capital gains tax rates on income that comes from managing assets for private equity funds or hedge funds. But why should managing financial assets be treated any differently from managing people, or making discoveries? Of course, those in finance say they are essential. But so are doctors, lawyers, teachers and everyone else who contributes to making our complex society work. They say they are necessary for job creation. But in fact, many of the private equity firms that have excelled in exploiting the carried interest loophole are actually job destroyers; they excel in restructuring firms to "save" on labor costs, often by moving jobs abroad.
Economists often eschew the word "fair" - fairness, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. But the unfairness of the American tax system has gotten so great that it's dishonest to apply any other label to it.
Traditionally, economists have focused less on issues of equality than on the more mundane issues of growth and efficiency. But here again, our tax system comes in with low marks. Our growth was higher in the era of high top marginal tax rates than it has been since 1980. Economists - even at traditional, conservative international institutions like the International Monetary Fund - have come to realize that excessive inequality is bad for growth and stability. The tax system can play an important role in moderating the degree of inequality. Ours, however, does remarkably little about it.
One of the reasons for our poor economic performance is the large distortion in our economy caused by the tax system. The one thing economists agree on is that incentives matter - if you lower taxes on speculation, say, you will get more speculation. We've drawn our most talented young people into financial shenanigans, rather than into creating real businesses, making real discoveries, providing real services to others. More efforts go into "rent-seeking" - getting a larger slice of the country's economic pie - than into enlarging the size of the pie.
Research in recent years has linked the tax rates, sluggish growth and rising inequality. Remember, the low tax rates at the top were supposed to spur savings and hard work, and thus economic growth. They didn't. Indeed, the household savings rate fell to a record level of near zero after President George W. Bush's two rounds of cuts, in 2001 and 2003, on taxes on dividends and capital gains. What low tax rates at the top did do was increase the return on rent-seeking. It flourished, which meant that growth slowed and inequality grew. This is a pattern that has now been observed across countries. Contrary to the warnings of those who want to preserve their privileges, countries that have increased their top tax bracket have not grown more slowly. Another piece of evidence is here at home: if the efforts at the top were resulting in our entire economic engine's doing better, we would expect everyone to benefit. If they were engaged in rent-seeking, as their incomes increased, we'd expect that of others to decrease. And that's exactly what's been happening. Incomes in the middle, and even the bottom, have been stagnating or falling.
Aside from the evidence, there is a strong intuitive case to be made for the idea that tax rates have encouraged rent-seeking at the expense of wealth creation. There is an intrinsic satisfaction in creating a new business, in expanding the horizons of our knowledge, and in helping others. By contrast, it is unpleasant to spend one's days fine-tuning dishonest and deceptive practices that siphon money off the poor, as was common in the financial sector before the 2007-8 financial crisis. I believe that a vast majority of Americans would, all things being equal, choose the former over the latter. But our tax system tilts the field. It increases the net returns from engaging in some of these intrinsically distasteful activities, and it has helped us become a rent-seeking society.
It doesn't have to be this way. We could have a much simpler tax system without all the distortions - a society where those who clip coupons for a living pay the same taxes as someone with the same income who works in a factory; where someone who earns his income from saving companies pays the same tax as a doctor who makes the income by saving lives; where someone who earns his income from financial innovations pays the same taxes as a someone who does research to create real innovations that transform our economy and society. We could have a tax system that encourages good things like hard work and thrift and discourages bad things, like rent-seeking, gambling, financial speculation and pollution. Such a tax system could raise far more money than the current one - we wouldn't have to go through all the wrangling we've been going through with sequestration, fiscal cliffs and threats to end Medicare and Social Security as we know it. We would be in sound fiscal position, for at least the next quarter-century.
The consequences of our broken tax system are not just economic. Our tax system relies heavily on voluntary compliance. But if citizens believe that the tax system is unfair, this voluntary compliance will not be forthcoming. More broadly, government plays an important role not just in social protection, but in making investments in infrastructure, technology, education and health. Without such investments, our economy will be weaker, and our economic growth slower.
Society can't function well without a minimal sense of national solidarity and cohesion, and that sense of shared purpose also rests on a fair tax system. If Americans believe that government is unfair - that ours is a government of the 1 percent, for the 1 percent, and by the 1 percent - then faith in our democracy will surely perish.

HEADLINE: As Wall St. Soars in Tough Era, Company Size Is a Big Factor

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
It's tough to make sense of the economy these days.
The latest jobs numbers show hiring is down. Taxes are up, austerity reigns in Washington and consumers are skittish. Yet the stock market is defying gravity, marching ever higher in spite of it all.
Behind this seeming riddle lies a confluence of economic forces that is likely to continue to produce good times for the biggest American companies -- and the stock market -- even if growth, as expected, slows in the coming months.
By pumping hundreds of billions of dollars a month into the global economy, central banks like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have encouraged investors to put their money into stocks and other riskier investments, increasing their prices. Bullish traders now count on a supportive Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, much as their predecessors did in the 1990s when Alan Greenspan held that job.
At the same time, American giants are benefiting from productivity gains and renewed growth in China and other overseas markets, allowing them to increase profits even if business at home remains lackluster. 
''Big companies have found a way not just to survive but to prosper despite the broader economy and all the uncertainty,'' said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at Standard & Poor's. ''There's a disconnect between them and the rest of the world.'' Investors are also looking farther ahead, discounting what economists are calling a spring swoon, and focusing on prospects for healthier growth late this year and into 2014.
After finally achieving what experts estimate was a healthy 3 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter of 2013, the American economy is expected to slow to half that pace in the next two quarters as higher payroll taxes and automatic government spending cuts begin to bite.
Signs of that start-and-stop phenomenon have been mounting in recent weeks. After adding more than 200,000 jobs a month since November, the American economy created fewer than half that number in March, surprising some observers who thought the labor market had finally turned a corner.
And on Friday, new data on retail sales showed spending fell 0.4 percent last month while consumer sentiment sank to its lowest since last summer, according to a new survey by Thomson Reuters and the University of Michigan.
Despite that bearish data, the Dow Jones industrial average, made up of 30 of the biggest American companies, rose more than 2 percent last week to a record high, and stands within shouting distance of breaking the psychologically important 15,000 level.
Indeed, while the outlook among small-business owners remains stuck near recession levels, Wall Street is again expecting the largest companies to report strong results when they announce first-quarter earnings in the coming weeks.
That is especially true for the very biggest corporations. While analysts estimate profits for the 100 largest companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to rise 6.6 percent this quarter, earnings for the bottom 100 are expected to fall by 1.6 percent.
Of all the profits earned by the companies that make up the S.& P. 500, 22 percent will come from the 10 largest companies, up from 18 percent in 2010, according to Mr. Silverblatt.
The same phenomenon is playing out among privately owned firms as well. Over the last three years, sales at companies with revenue of more than $50 million have grown by an average of 15.3 percent annually, compared with 8.5 percent annual growth at businesses with less than $50 million in revenue, according to Sageworks, a financial information company.
Among the smallest privately owned firms, the mood is especially bleak.
''It's a bifurcated economy,'' said William C. Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents small-business owners. ''Corporate profits are at a record, but all the data we have say small business is dead in the water.'' Last week, the group reported that its Small Business Optimism index declined in March after rising for the previous three months.
Big companies also enjoy much easier access to credit than smaller companies, which still face wariness from banks nervous about lending to borrowers without sterling credit histories.
The fiscal tightening in Washington -- primarily the automatic budget cuts imposed by Congress that are now taking effect at government agencies and the increase in Social Security taxes this year -- is also poised to fall more heavily on smaller, domestically focused firms than on multinational giants.
''Smaller companies face greater headwinds,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors. ''Is it G.E. or Caterpillar who will be hurt? Of course not. It's Joe's Deli.''
In fact, the case of General Electric, which reports first-quarter earnings on Friday, neatly illustrates how overseas operations at many of the most familiar American companies have grown rapidly in recent years even as domestic activity has lagged. Total employment at the company dipped slightly to 305,000 in 2012 from 316,000 in 2005, but the number of workers it employs in the United States fell more sharply, to 134,000 from 161,000 in 2005. Over the same period, the proportion of sales that came from the United States fell to 47 percent from 55 percent.
The gains in the stock market have also been fueled by a sense, perhaps premature, that the American economy will start growing more robustly again once the shock from fiscal austerity begins to pass.
''The current slowdown will be the last for a while,'' said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He estimates that after growing by annual rates of only 1.3 percent in the second quarter and 1.5 percent in the third quarter, the economy will expand by 2.5 percent in the final months of the year and maintain that pace in 2014.
''We're getting closer to the end of chronically disappointing growth,'' Mr. Harris added. ''It's not like we're going to have a huge boom but something that feels sustainable.''
The austerity in the United States also threatens to slow, at least temporarily, sectors of the economy that have been more dynamic recently, like housing and autos. But over the long term, the rise in home values in many areas as well as the rally on Wall Street could produce something of a ''wealth effect,'' at least for wealthier households that feel they can afford to loosen their purse strings slightly.
Poorer households remain constrained, however, especially in the wake of the increase in Social Security taxes in January.
''For people who spend all of their take-home pay each month, the stock market has no impact,'' said Chris Varvares, senior managing director at Macroeconomic Advisers. ''Even if they felt better about the economy, they wouldn't be able to spend more.''

HEADLINE: In Europe, Tax Haven Effort Grows

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
DUBLIN -- Europe's effort to crack down on tax havens gained momentum during the weekend as the number of countries agreeing to share more bank information doubled.
Miroslav Kalousek, the Czech finance minister, pledged to join the push for more automatic exchanges of bank records that already had the backing of Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, a spokesman for the Czech representation to the European Union said Sunday.
The spokesman said the Czech minister made his overture on Saturday during a two-day meeting of European finance ministers where Poland, followed by Belgium, the Netherlands and Romania, also signed up, bringing the number of countries supporting the initiative to 10. The campaign is being strongly backed by the French finance minister, Pierre Moscovici. 
For France, the issue has taken on greater urgency since Jrme Cahuzac resigned as budget minister after acknowledging he had foreign holdings in Switzerland that he had previously denied.
''The surge in member states' appetite for progress and action in the fight against evasion is extremely welcome,'' Algirdas Semeta, the Union's commissioner for taxation, said Saturday after two days of meetings in which ministers discussed adoption of Europe-wide laws modeled on the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, a U.S. initiative to find hidden accounts overseas.
''The tools are already on the table, waiting to be seized,'' Mr. Semeta said, referring to plans in Europe to provide greater exchanges of information on interest earned on savings, including from trusts and foundations.
Mr. Semeta said that the European crackdown against tax evasion could eventually extend to dividends, capital gains and royalties, significantly expanding the revenue earned by national treasuries. He also encouraged countries to set an earlier date -- it is currently foreseen as 2017 -- for when those revenues are meant to fall under the microscope.
Europe is also being pushed toward greater transparency by the recent release of an investigative report on thousands of offshore bank accounts and shell companies, and by the prospect of a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 20 leading economies on Thursday in Washington, where tax transparency is expected to be discussed.
In the French case, the Socialist government of Franois Hollande was deeply embarrassed by the revelations that Mr. Cahuzac had foreign holdings at a time of economic hardship for many citizens, and Mr. Moscovici led the calls for reforms at a hastily assembled news conference on Friday evening.
Taking leadership on the issue of tax havens ''is very important for ensuring that citizens can trust the efficiency and fairness of our tax systems,'' Mr. Moscovici said, flanked by Wolfgang Schuble, the German finance minister, and George Osborne, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, and by ministers from Poland, Spain and Italy.
The initiative should eventually cover ''all kinds of revenues'' and would be similar to the American tax compliance act, Mr. Moscovici said.
One European tax haven, Luxembourg, bowed to such pressure on Wednesday and said it would begin forwarding the details of its foreign clients to their home governments.
Standing in the way is Austria, which has resisted agreeing to an automatic exchange of banking information between E.U. countries.
Chancellor Werner Faymann of Austria recently suggested that talks were possible, and European officials said they thought that Austria eventually would offer concessions. But the country's finance minister, Maria Fekter, has showed no signs of backing down.
''We will fight for bank secrecy,'' Ms. Fekter said on Saturday. ''We are no tax haven,'' she said. A day earlier she sought to portray Britain as one of the Union's biggest tax havens.
Mr. Osborne said on Friday that he was pushing for more transparency from the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands.
More European countries are expected to join the campaign in coming weeks after Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, said on Friday that the bloc's 27 leaders would discuss the issue at a summit meeting of leaders next month in Brussels.
Another focus of the meetings in Dublin was the bundle of initiatives known under the umbrella name banking union -- intended to break the vicious circle involving indebted sovereign governments and shaky banks that helped unleash a string of crises repeatedly threatening to sink the euro over the last three years.
Ministers made some progress by overcoming disagreements with Germany, which had raised demands for a change in the Union's treaty to ensure that the cornerstone of the project -- placing the European Central Bank in charge of regulating the biggest lenders -- would not lead to a blurring of lines between monetary policy and banking supervision.
The single supervisor must be in place before other elements of a banking union can be put in force including a system for euro area countries to share some of the burden of shutting down failing banks that would have a clearly defined hierarchy of creditors, including shareholders, bondholders, uninsured depositors and funds contributed by banks and governments.
During the finance ministers' meeting, the Germans conceded that supervision by the central bank could go forward during 2014 without the change, but they won agreement that there should be steps to lock in the separation of the two areas of responsibility the next time that the union's treaties are revised.
But Mr. Schuble, the German finance minister, insisted during a news conference on Saturday that setting up European institutions to share the burden of restructuring and closing banks ''will need a treaty change.''
Requiring a change in the treaties has alarmed some European officials, who fear such a step at a time when Britain's calls for significant changes to the pact have irritated other member states. They also are concerned that the prospect of a treaty alteration would jeopardize the legal basis of the banking supervision system once it goes into force next year.
Mr. Schuble also laid out conditions for the European Stability Mechanism to be tapped to recapitalize struggling banks, saying on Saturday that the country of a bank in financial difficulty must first inject fresh capital before receiving direct support from the bailout fund.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Cowboys and Eggheads

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
My Times colleague Mark Mazzetti has a new book out that is getting a lot of attention, including some cinematic excerpts published in The Times, here and here. ''The Way of the Knife'' recounts the recent transformation of the Central Intelligence Agency from a traditional spying shop into more of a man-hunting paramilitary -- custodian of lethal drones, sponsor of dark ops, employer of secret armies and shady contractors.
As an assassination bureau, the C.I.A. has had some spectacular successes. (The Navy Seal raid that killed Osama bin Laden was led by the C.I.A.) It has also come in for some fierce criticism from those who are uncomfortable with assassination in general, with the eerily impersonal methods of remote killing, with the civilian casualties, or with the timid oversight of an agency licensed to kill. And of course the demand for operational intelligence to aid these manhunts drove the C.I.A. into the practice of torture and rendition.
But Mazzetti's important thought is not that war is a dirty business; it is that by turning our premier intelligence agency into a killing machine, we may have paid a price in national vigilance. 
Alone among the many U.S. intelligence outfits (the number has grown to 16 or 17 depending on how you count) the C.I.A. has the job of supplying the president with the deep strategic intelligence that anticipates dangers and shapes American policy. The agency has always housed both covert operations and the more traditional gathering and analysis of information -- ''cowboys and eggheads,'' as one agency-watcher put it. The worry is that the eggheads have become so caught up in serving the cowboys tactical intelligence about high-profile assassination targets that they have less bandwidth to devote to longer-term threats.
''The C.I.A.'s raison d'tre is preventing big strategic surprises,'' said Amy Zegart, an intelligence specialist at the Hoover Institution. ''They do not exist to kill third-rate terrorists running around failed states.''
Gregory Treverton, a RAND Corporation expert who is a former vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council, said that as hundreds of analysts flood into the subject of the moment, they are assigned to narrower and narrower slices of the problem. There is less standing back and figuring out how it adds up, what might happen next. ''All the creativity is going to, can we identify, locate and take out the bad guys,'' Treverton said. But unless somebody is asking where the bad guys came from and what drives them, we are fighting the symptom rather than the disease.
We have learned, to our peril, how much it matters when intelligence lets us down. The C.I.A., having been hollowed out in the '90s after the end of the cold war, failed to see the signs of what would be 9/11. Then the C.I.A. got the ostensible Iraqi weapons threat terribly wrong, drowning out more skeptical voices in the intelligence units of the State Department and Energy Department, and paving the way to a colossal blunder of a war.
At least twice before in recent memory the C.I.A. has been consumed by secret warfare that had unhappy endings. In the 1980s the agency joined forces with mujahedeen fighters in Afghanistan against Soviet occupiers; the Soviets were routed, the Americans moved on, and the mujahedeen turned their jihad on us. At the same time, the agency was secretly, illegally backing the Nicaraguan contra rebels; that venture ended in defeat, indictments and embarrassment.
Jeffrey Smith, who has worked on intelligence issues as a Senate staffer, a State Department lawyer and the general counsel of the C.I.A., points out that it's not just the spy agencies that have their attention monopolized by these ventures, but their clients in the Pentagon, the State Department and the White House. ''The problem with these big covert action programs,'' a senior official once told Smith, ''is that they become the policy of the United States.''
''When you start these programs, everybody is enthusiastic about them,'' Smith said. ''But to run them right takes a huge focus of senior leadership.'' And other things get neglected.
By most accounts, including the assessment of intelligence insiders, academics and journalists who cover the subject, the conglomerate of intelligence agencies is in much better shape than it was before 9/11. That's a low bar, but credit where credit is due. The agencies are better staffed and better at sharing information. It's hard for an outsider to tell until something goes wrong, but high-priority topics like Iran's nuclear program and China's development of cyberweapons seem to be getting the emphasis they deserve.
Gary Samore, who worked in the Clinton Administration and then returned to oversee nuclear weapons-related intelligence for President Obama until January, said he felt well served by the agency's collection and analysis.
''Of course the C.I.A. missed all the revolutions in the Arab world,'' he said. ''But we always miss the revolutions. We missed the collapse of the Soviet Union, we missed the revolution in Iran, we missed the overthrow in the Philippines. ... It's a normal human condition. We all expect continuity -- until there's change.''
He's right, but when change does happen you hope the agency will be quick to catch up with unfolding events and provide the president with cleareyed reporting that will help position the U.S. to its best advantage. That requires the difficult, patient cultivation of sources on the ground, including the opposition. In the Muslim world, Mazzetti and some experts suspect, the C.I.A. had not acquired a wealth of sources in the opposition, and that may be partly because in places like Egypt and Libya the agency was focused on cozying up to the official spy agencies, hoping to tap into their information about Qaeda operatives.
The concern that essential intelligence has suffered from the paramilitary preoccupation is shared by some of the president's own advisers. According to a Washington Post report last month, the President's Intelligence Advisory Board warned in a secret report last year that spy agencies were paying insufficient attention to China and the Middle East and other potential trouble spots and should shift emphasis back toward traditional intelligence work. The panel included Chuck Hagel, who has since become secretary of defense.
''Who knows what you're missing?'' said Lee Hamilton, former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and another member of the advisory board (he emphasized he was speaking only for himself). Hamilton supports the president's power to authorize targeted killing, but he worries that ''the tail is wagging the dog.'' He points out that traditional intelligence analysis has become more urgent because in our digitized world the profusion of data is overwhelming.
In Senate hearings before his confirmation as the new C.I.A. director, John Brennan conceded that the agency's military focus is ''a bit of an aberration from its traditional role'' and promised ''to take a look at that allocation of mission.'' There is talk of transferring much of the killer drone program to the Pentagon, where it would be more accountable and better integrated with other military activities. But President Obama will almost certainly choose to keep some drone operations at the C.I.A., for those occasions when the mission requires secrecy or venturing into a sovereign country. (The C.I.A. ran the bin Laden mission because the military, on its own, would not be allowed to violate the air space of Pakistan without its permission.)
Rebuilding traditional intelligence collecting and analysis is not a simple matter of reassigning case officers. The expertise is not always transferable; the skills are not fungible. ''You've had a whole generation of intelligence people who have come into the C.I.A. now that have only worked on military operations,'' Hamilton said. Treverton says people in the clandestine service tell him of case officers who arrive at Langley after a few tours in Iraq: ''Their idea of meeting a source is with a Humvee and a military escort. They've never done real espionage tradecraft.''
Of course, reorienting the C.I.A. depends on the demands of its clients in the White House and its overseers in Congress. Much as policy makers insist they want smart, ''over the horizon'' intelligence, it's today's news that grabs their attention, and covert operations that excite them. I don't suppose many of the boys in Congress grew up playing egghead.

HEADLINE: The Antisocial Network

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Bitcoin's wild ride may not have been the biggest business story of the past few weeks, but it was surely the most entertaining. Over the course of less than two weeks the price of the ''digital currency'' more than tripled. Then it fell more than 50 percent in a few hours. Suddenly, it felt as if we were back in the dot-com era.
The economic significance of this roller coaster was basically nil. But the furor over bitcoin was a useful lesson in the ways people misunderstand money -- and in particular how they are misled by the desire to divorce the value of money from the society it serves. 
What is bitcoin? It's sometimes described as a way to make transactions online -- but that in itself would be nothing new in a world of online credit-card and PayPal transactions. In fact, the Commerce Department estimates that by 2010 about 16 percent of total sales in America already took the form of e-commerce.
So how is bitcoin different? Unlike credit card transactions, which leave a digital trail, bitcoin transactions are designed to be anonymous and untraceable. When you transfer bitcoins to someone else, it's as if you handed over a paper bag filled with $100 bills in a dark alley. And sure enough, as best as anyone can tell the main use of bitcoin so far, other than as a target for speculation, has been for online versions of those dark-alley exchanges, with bitcoins traded for narcotics and other illegal items.
But bitcoin evangelists insist that it's about much more than greasing the path for illicit transactions. The biggest declared investors in bitcoins are the Winklevoss brothers, wealthy twins who successfully sued for a share of Facebook and were made famous by the movie ''The Social Network'' -- and they make claims for the digital product similar to those made by goldbugs for their favorite metal. ''We have elected,'' declared Tyler Winklevoss recently, ''to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error.''
The similarity to goldbug rhetoric isn't a coincidence, since goldbugs and bitcoin enthusiasts -- bitbugs? -- tend to share both libertarian politics and the belief that governments are vastly abusing their power to print money. At the same time, it's very peculiar, since bitcoins are in a sense the ultimate fiat currency, with a value conjured out of thin air. Gold's value comes in part because it has nonmonetary uses, such as filling teeth and making jewelry; paper currencies have value because they're backed by the power of the state, which defines them as legal tender and accepts them as payment for taxes. Bitcoins, however, derive their value, if any, purely from self-fulfilling prophecy, the belief that other people will accept them as payment.
However, let's leave that strangeness on one side, along with the peculiar ''mining'' process -- actually a process of complex calculation -- used to add to the bitcoin stock. Instead, let's focus on the two huge misconceptions -- one practical, one philosophical -- that underlie both goldbugism and bitbugism.
The practical misconception here -- and it's a big one -- is the notion that we live in an era of wildly irresponsible money printing, with runaway inflation just around the corner. It's true that the Federal Reserve and other central banks have greatly expanded their balance sheets -- but they've done that explicitly as a temporary measure in response to economic crisis. I know, government officials are not to be trusted and all that, but the truth is that Ben Bernanke's promises that his actions wouldn't be inflationary have been vindicated year after year, while goldbugs' dire warnings of inflation keep not coming true.
The philosophical misconception, however, seems to me to be even bigger. Goldbugs and bitbugs alike seem to long for a pristine monetary standard, untouched by human frailty. But that's an impossible dream. Money is, as Paul Samuelson once declared, a ''social contrivance,'' not something that stands outside society. Even when people relied on gold and silver coins, what made those coins useful wasn't the precious metals they contained, it was the expectation that other people would accept them as payment.
Actually, you'd expect the Winklevosses, of all people, to get this, because in a way money is like a social network, which is useful only to the extent that other people use it. But I guess some people are just bothered by the notion that money is a human thing, and want the benefits of the monetary network without the social part. Sorry, it can't be done.
So do we need a new form of money? I guess you could make that case if the money we actually have were misbehaving. But it isn't. We have huge economic problems, but green pieces of paper are doing fine -- and we should let them alone.

HEADLINE: If Companies Are People...

BYLINE: By JAMES LIVINGSTON. 
James Livingston, a professor of history at Rutgers, is the author of ''Against Thrift: Why Consumer Culture Is Good for the Economy, the Environment, and Your Soul.''

 BODY:
HERE'S an idea: why not tax corporations as if they were natural persons, in accordance with their newly discovered rights of free speech? That move would solve any impending fiscal crisis.
Indeed, we used to do just that. For most of the 1950s, corporate income at large companies was taxed at 52 percent, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The federal government, meanwhile, collected about a third of its revenues from this source. Today, thanks largely to the ''reforms'' ushered in by President Ronald Reagan, the ostensible tax rate on corporate income is no higher than 35 percent -- and the corporate-tax share of federal revenue has fallen to about 9 percent.
For a view as to how this happened, consider General Electric. Back in the 1950s and early '60s, when Reagan was a company pitchman, G.E. was a manufacturer of consumer appliances. It employed hundreds of thousands of people, and it paid millions of dollars in taxes every year. Now, it makes jet engines, wind turbines and other kinds of capital equipment, but its real profit center is financing the sale of these products overseas -- because income generated here is tax exempt if it remains offshore. 
In 2010 G.E. employed more than 130,000 people in the United States, and earned $14.2 billion, $5.1 billion of which was generated in the United States. And yet its American tax bill for that year, according to a report by The New York Times, was zero. (G.E. said in a news release last year that its ''global tax rate'' in 2010 was 7 percent, but did not disclose how much of that went to the I.R.S.)
Meanwhile, federal spending steadily increased, in line with the growth of the welfare state. As corporations lobbied and learned to avoid taxes, the government began to close the revenue gap with payroll taxes. These were negligible before the creation of Medicare in 1965, but they now account for more than a third of federal revenue -- in effect, they replaced the income taxes once paid by corporations.
Personal income taxes (which have stayed at about 45 percent of federal revenues since 1950) and payroll taxes now provide the federal government with almost 80 percent of its yearly revenue.
Unlike personal income taxes, Medicare and Social Security taxes -- which are jointly known as FICA (for Federal Insurance Contributions Act), or payroll taxes -- are plainly regressive. Because of the payroll cap on Social Security contributions, the bottom quintile of income recipients pays a 7.3 percent FICA rate, while the top quintile pays a 6.8 percent rate and the top 1 percent of earners pay a rate of just 0.9 percent.
So, by slashing corporate income taxes and forcing a new reliance on payroll taxes to finance government spending, we have redistributed income to the already wealthy and powerful. Our tax system has actually fostered inequality.
The fiscal problem we face is not, then, a lack of revenue sources. We can finance any amount of transfer payments and ''entitlements'' by taxing corporations' profits in the same way we tax personal income, using a progressive formula. If necessary, give them a mortgage deduction -- they already get something like it in the form of accelerated depreciation allowances on their purchases of capital equipment -- but make them pay higher taxes on their income. Do that, and the federal deficit goes away.
The now-familiar objection to a tax increase on corporate profits is that it will discourage private investment and thus dampen job creation. The retort is just as obvious: since when have tax cuts on corporate profits led to increased investment, faster job creation and higher per capita consumption out of rising real wages? It didn't happen after the Reagan Revolution, it didn't happen during the Clinton boom of the 1990s, and it sure didn't happen under George W. Bush.
Nor is it happening now, as corporate profits soar and full-time job creation languishes. American corporations are now sitting on $4.75 trillion in cash, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
The other well-worn objection to an increase of corporate income taxes is that it would encourage companies to invest and hire overseas, where tax rates are presumably lower. Here, too, the retort is obvious: the tax code already works exactly this way by postponing taxes until profits from investment overseas are repatriated. American companies routinely avoid taxation by moving their idle cash offshore.
In view of these facts, there's no downside to replacing payroll taxes with increased taxes on corporate profits, wherever they're made or held. By doing so, we make the tax code more progressive, and mobilize capital that is otherwise inert. In other words, we can lay solid foundations for economic growth simply by going back to the tax principles we used to have. What could be more conservative than that?

HEADLINE: End of Palestinian Power Play Muddles the Peace Process

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER; Jodi Rudoren contributed reporting from Jerusalem, Khaled Abu Aker from Ramallah, West Bank, and Fares Akram from Gaza.

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Salam Fayyad, the internationally respected Palestinian politician and economist, is widely credited with ending the chaos in the West Bank and putting things in order in his six years as prime minister. But his resignation over the weekend, the result of internal power struggles, has left the Palestinian Authority suspended in political ambiguity and confusion.
Analysts said Sunday that by accepting Mr. Fayyad's resignation, the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, has put himself in a political bind just as the Obama administration has been trying to restart long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
That, many Palestinians say, is because the vacuum created by Mr. Fayyad's resignation presents an opportunity for renewed reconciliation efforts between Mr. Abbas's Fatah party and its bitter rival, Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza. While healing the rift would be a popular course of action among Palestinians, it could complicate peace efforts and cause some Western donor nations to consider withholding much-needed funds, fearing that they could be used by Hamas. The groups is classified as a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States and the European Union. 
Under previous accords with Hamas, Mr. Abbas had agreed to lead an interim government as prime minister in preparation for long-overdue elections in the West Bank and Gaza, and might do so now.
''My preferred path of action is that the president will form an independent and technocratic government for 90 days, then we will go to elections,'' said Saeb Erekat, a senior Fatah official and an aide to Mr. Abbas. In that case, Mr. Fayyad would remain a caretaker prime minister while the consultations took place, Mr. Erekat said, adding: ''How long will it take? Nobody knows.''
Munib al-Masri, a West Bank industrialist who has promoted Palestinian reconciliation, said: ''We hope the president will form the government and will hold elections as quickly as possible. This is what everybody is expecting. Without ending the division, we do not have a country.''
Israel opposes reconciliation between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas as long as the Islamic group refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist and will not renounce violence.
''We have always said that if the Palestinian Authority moves towards Hamas, it is moving away from peace and reconciliation with Israel,'' an Israeli official said on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss internal Palestinian affairs publicly. He added that calling a unity government ''technocratic does not solve anything.''
''Who controls the technocrats?'' he said.
Palestinian analysts said that in any case, real reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas seems a long way off and that Hamas is not likely to commit to a date for elections or to a common policy with Mr. Abbas.
In Gaza, Hamas welcomed the resignation of Mr. Fayyad but emphasized that the move was not related to reconciliation efforts. Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman, accused Fatah of being unwilling to carry out all aspects of the previous deals between the groups.
If Mr. Abbas is unable to reach an agreement with Hamas that would allow him to take over as prime minister, he will have to name a replacement for Mr. Fayyad. Possible candidates include another economist, Mohammad Mustafa, who was educated in the West and worked for 15 years at the World Bank; Rami Hamdallah, the president of a West Bank university; Mazen Sinokrot, a successful businessman; and Muhammad Shtayyeh, a Fatah official.
But by replacing Mr. Fayyad with someone other than himself, Mr. Abbas, analysts said, would be opening himself up to popular criticism that he is moving away from ending the Palestinian schism.
Under the circumstances, keeping Mr. Fayyad on for now may be ''the best of the worst solutions,'' Ahmed Awaida, the chief executive of the Palestinian Stock Exchange, said in an interview. ''I am convinced that he will remain the caretaker prime minister for the foreseeable future.''
Mr. Fayyad, a political independent, is said to have resigned largely because of relentless criticism of his policies by Fatah officials who resent his power and who blame him for the financial crisis that has plagued the authority for the past two years.
''The problem is not Fayyad and never was Fayyad,'' Mr. Awaida said. ''The problem is the Israeli occupation and a lack of any kind of political or diplomatic horizon.''
''No government in the world can plan economic development when it has no control over borders, lands, water resources and it cannot make trade agreements,'' he said. ''This is the reality.''
Mr. Fayyad is renowned for having introduced ''Fayyadism,'' a byword for the new norms of a well-run Palestinian government.
''Fayyadism is about Palestinians finding a new source of legitimacy -- one that is based on competence, not on a legacy of resistance or on religion,'' said Khalil Shikaki, director of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in the West Bank city of Ramallah. ''But given where the Palestinians are in pursuing their national goals, competence does not make national heroes.''
Mr. Fayyad's quest to build the Palestinian state from the ground up, ahead of a peace agreement with Israel, also ended badly. In 2009, he unveiled a plan to build the apparatus of a state within two years. But with peace talks stalled, the Palestinians are still no nearer to statehood.
''What people would fault him for is having had unrealistic expectations,'' said Nathan Thrall, Middle East analyst for the International Crisis Group.
People in the West Bank were not upset by Mr. Fayyad's resignation; they simply did not care, said Khalil Abu Arafeh, an architect and cartoonist in Ramallah. ''They lost hope in everything: there is no funding, no reconciliation and no horizon regarding a political settlement,'' he said.
Whatever happens next, Ehud Yaari, an Israel-based fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Mr. Fayyad's resignation signals ''a serious weakening of the Palestinian Authority.''
''We are going to see growing interference of the Fatah dinosaurs in running the budget and the distribution of donor money,'' Mr. Yaari said.
Martin S. Indyk, the director of the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institution and a former American ambassador to Israel, said, ''It's a very sad day for Fayyadism.''
Mr. Fayyad, he said, ''succeeded in building the state institutions, including an effective and responsible police and security force, and they will be his lasting legacy.''
''But the political process failed to create the state,'' he added, ''and unfortunately there was nothing Fayyad could do about that.''

HEADLINE: A Mill's Fate Weighs Heavy On a Washington Timber Town

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
HOQUIAM, Wash. -- On mornings with good weather, Jack Durney has coffee in the backyard of his house overlooking the town where he grew up and now presides over as mayor, and one of the first things he focuses on these days is the boiler stack at Harbor Paper. Is there steam coming from the mill?
But again last week, the all-important signal flare of economic life here showed nothing. The mill reopened late last year after closing in 2011, and that was cause for a huge party in this long-suffering old timber town in west-central Washington. The governor came, and people spoke of a rebirth, a corner turned in a place that had endured economic free fall. 
But bumps in the road came quickly. In February, the company said it was ''temporarily curtailing its operations.'' Last month, the mill's owners gave an update of its status to the community and its workers, saying operations, reorganized under new management, would resume this week. But last week, some workers received e-mails and telephone calls from managers saying the start-up organizational meetings would be rescheduled.
Uncertainty about what is to come -- how much of the mill's work force might come back, and when -- now hangs thick over Hoquiam, population 8,700. The owners of the mill, the town's largest private employer with about 180 workers at one point, have expressed optimism that steam will once again rise from the stack.
Residents and workers say they are hopeful, too. But having witnessed firsthand the timber industry's brutal decline here on the rainy Olympic Peninsula, as the mills that once lined the Hoquiam River blinked out of existence, many say they are not about to bet it all, either. Grays Harbor County, which includes Hoquiam, has the third-highest unemployment rate in the state, 13.9 percent in February, according to the most recent state figures.
''I think they'll have a good chance of success,'' said Mr. Durney, the mayor. ''But I don't know, with the world the way it is.''
The owners of Harbor Paper, Elliott Rust Companies, said in an e-mail on Sunday, ''Over the course of the last several weeks, we have been working diligently to identify a strategy that will provide for the long-term success of Harbor Paper.''
''Our priority is for Harbor Paper to provide secure employment and economic opportunity for families in the city of Hoquiam and the county of Grays Harbor,'' they said. ''We have delayed the planned restart of production operations at the mill as we continue to secure the best strategic solution for the mill. We are grateful for the commitment of our employees and support of our business partners during this challenging time.''
What compounds the stop-and-maybe-go anxiety for workers like Rob Harder, 44, a 19-year veteran of Harbor Paper who worked his way up to machine tender, is the ticking clock on his unemployment checks.
The mill was not in operation long enough, he said, from its reopening through February, to reset his state benefits, which began paying out in June 2011 with the initial shutdown. What that means, Mr. Harder said, is that if he does not go back to work within a few weeks, his unemployment compensation will be cut by more than 40 percent, to about $300 a week.
''It makes a guy a little nervous,'' he said in his garage, where he and Rob Leonard, a friend and co-worker, were putting a new engine in his pickup. ''I just wish there'd be more information,'' he said. ''I'm waiting for my next e-mail.''
Mr. Leonard, 47, said that in recent weeks, he and his family -- his wife, who does not work outside the home, and their four children -- have been fixated on April 15, a date most people associate with taxes. But to them, it has meant rescue, or at least the hope of it.
''I basically held onto that premise, that we were going back on the 15th,'' Mr. Leonard said. ''If something doesn't pop soon, I have to rethink.''
Uncertainty has been a chronic condition here in the Pacific Northwest woods for many years. The volume of timber being cut on public lands and in national forests was in decline long before the recession. President Obama's budget, released last week, proposed further reductions in timber sales by the federal Forest Service in 2014 and the cutting down of fewer acres of trees to reduce fire hazards as well, all of which would mean less raw product for the mills.
At the same time, housing construction -- the great engine of demand for the wood products industry -- has gathered steam. Lumber mills in Montana and Wyoming have restarted, added workers or announced plans to fire up. Here in Hoquiam, another surviving wood products company, Hoquiam Plywood Products, reopened last June after three and a half years of periodic shutdowns and has expanded to 93 workers from 38 since then.
''Business has picked up, but it's still not wide open,'' Mark McFeely, Hoquiam Plywood's plant manager, said as he showed this reporter around the shop floor. ''I don't see it taking off and being a business that is not going to have its ups and downs.''
Companies that make components for housing -- Hoquiam Plywood specializes in flooring -- often have an edge over foreign competitors since the beams and planks that builders need are so expensive to ship, said Tom Partin, the president of the American Forest Resource Council, a trade group based in Portland, Ore., that represents timber companies and manufacturers.
By cruel and perhaps paradoxical contrast, Mr. Partin said, many paper companies have been buffeted by increased competition, fueled by that same national recovery, as foreign producers try to expand in a strengthening United States market.
Tim Gibbs, the chief executive at Greater Grays Harbor Inc., an economic development group in Hoquiam that played a role in getting the mill restarted, said its owners have told him they would ''like to get back to where they were.''

HEADLINE: Students Face Tougher Tests That Outpace Lesson Plans

BYLINE: By KYLE SPENCER

 BODY:
At Public School 10 on the edge of Park Slope, Brooklyn, parents begged the principal to postpone the lower school science fair, insisting it was going to add too much pressure while they were preparing their children for the coming state tests.
On Staten Island, a community meeting devolved into a series of student stress stories, with one parent recounting how his son had woken up from a bad dream, mumbling that he had forgotten to fill in a bubble answer. 
And at Public School 24 in the Riverdale neighborhood in the Bronx, a fifth-grade teacher, Walter Rendon, has found himself soothing tense 10- and 11-year-olds as they pore over test prep exercises. ''Sometimes, I say: 'Just breathe.' ''
New York public school students and parents are, by now, accustomed to standardized tests. But a pall has settled over classrooms across the state because this year's tests, which begin Tuesday, are unlike any exams the students have seen. They have been redesigned and are tougher. And they are likely to cover at least some material that has yet to make its way into the curriculum.
The new tests, given to third through eighth graders, are intended to align with Common Core standards, a set of unified academic guidelines adopted by almost every state and goaded by grant money offered by the Obama administration. They set more rigorous classroom goals for American students, with a focus on critical thinking skills, abstract reasoning in math and reading comprehension.
New York is one of only a few states that have developed new tests to match the Common Core. Last year, Kentucky became the first to administer Common Core aligned tests and scores there plummeted, adding to the concern in New York.
When students sharpen their No. 2 pencils on Tuesday, they will find English tests that include more writing and more challenging reading excerpts, many of them culled from classical literature, or nonfiction sources. They will be asked to ''marshal evidence'' for thoughtful, sometimes lengthy answers, and analyze paired excerpts. In math, though there will be fewer topics, the test will include more complex equations, multistep word problems, and written responses.
But the standards are so new that many New York schools have yet to fully adopt new curriculums -- including reading material, lesson plans and exercises -- to match. And the textbook industry has not completely caught up either. State and city officials have urged teachers over the last year to begin working in some elements of new curriculums, and have offered lesson plans and tutorials on official Web sites. But they acknowledge that scores will most likely fall from last year's levels.
Officials defend the decision to switch tests now, saying that previous exams have gone from easy to easier, providing a poor indication of student competency. Saying that most New York high school graduates are not ready for college-level work, Merryl H. Tisch, the chancellor of the state Board of Regents, said the state could not wait any longer to see where its students were succeeding and where they needed help.
''Believe me, I relate to test anxiety,'' she said during a visit last week to the Academy of Arts and Letters in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, one of several schools that city and state education officials visited to express support for the new tests. ''We can't wait,'' she said. ''We have to just jump into the deep end.''
The sink-or-swim approach is of particular concern to students (and their parents) in the fourth and seventh grades, whose scores could determine where they go to middle or high school in 2014. ''It really makes me nervous,'' said Patrick Timoney, a seventh grader at Intermediate School 2, on Staten Island. ''It's a big deal and if you don't get a good grade, it's not the best.''
To cope, schools like Public School 3 in the West Village and Middle School 51 in Park Slope have begun intensive weekend and after-school prep classes, where students are briefed on how to perform math equations that might appear on the tests, in some cases using material they have not previously been taught. At other schools, they are plowing through practice booklets, dissecting Victorian-era poems, Japanese folk tales, and in some cases, instructional manuals at levels that teachers and parents say the students have not encountered.
Larry Larson, a Web developer with a fourth grader at Public School 58 in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, said he had started teaching his son concepts like long division. He said the new tests felt like someone ''changing the rules of the road overnight.''
''From now on, everyone is going to be driving on the left side of the road,'' he said. ''In the morning, there are going to be a lot of accidents.''
Recently, administrators at Public School 94 in the Bronx invested in 300 protractors when they realized the tests might require them. ''Now, we are teaching the kids how to use them,'' the principal, Diane DaProcida, said.
To her students, Ms. DaProcida was sympathetic, but blunt. ''To stay competitive in the global economy, you children need to be better prepared.''
Then she gave them a lesson in New York City bureaucracy. ''This is going to take some time.''
The preparation sessions also include anxiety relief. In Mr. Rendon's classroom in Riverdale, test drills are preceded by breathing exercises and ''modified yoga'' poses. Some schools, like Ms. DaProcida's, held pep rallies last week to raise students' spirits.
The city has spent $125 million on the Common Core, including teacher training sessions and the establishing of Common Core leaders who can teach and evaluate new practices. It also expects to spend more than $50 million on new Common Core-aligned textbooks.
Statistically speaking, city officials said, people should not worry too much about falling marks because everyone is taking the same new tests. Schools, students and teachers will be judged against one another.
As Shael Polakow-Suransky, the city's chief academic officer, told parents on Staten Island: ''Everyone is in the same boat.''

HEADLINE: Venezuela Gives Chvez Protg Narrow Victory

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN; Mara Eugenia Daz and Paula Ramn contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela -- In an unexpectedly close race, Venezuelans narrowly voted to continue Hugo Chvez's revolution, electing his handpicked political heir, Nicols Maduro, to serve the remainder of his six-year term as president, officials said late Sunday.
But the thin margin of victory could complicate the task of governing for Mr. Maduro, emboldening the political opposition and possibly undermining Mr. Maduro's stature within Mr. Chvez's movement.
His opponent, Henrique Capriles Radonski, refused to recognize the results, citing irregularities in the voting and calling for a recount.
Mr. Maduro, the acting president, narrowly defeated Mr. Capriles, a state governor who ran strongly against Mr. Chvez in October. Election authorities said that with more than 99 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Maduro had 50.6 percent to Mr. Capriles's 49.1 percent. More than 78 percent of registered voters cast ballots. 
''These are the irreversible results that the Venezuelan people have decided with this electoral process,'' Tibisay Lucena, the head of the electoral council, said as she read the result on national television late Sunday.
Mr. Maduro gave a defiant speech that suggested little willingness to make concessions. ''We have a just, legal, constitutional and popular electoral victory,'' he said.
Mr. Capriles was equally defiant. ''We are not going to recognize the result until every vote is counted, one by one,'' Mr. Capriles said. ''The big loser today is you, you and what you represent,'' he said, referring to Mr. Maduro.
Meanwhile, there were also signs that the strident, Chvez-style anti-American message that Mr. Maduro used during the campaign would now be set aside to improve Venezuela's strained relations with the United States.
Venezuela is a major oil supplier to the United States with immense reserves, and under Mr. Chvez it has also been a major thorn in Washington's side, wielding its oil and its diplomatic muscle to oppose American policy everywhere from Cuba to Syria. Mr. Chvez, who succumbed to cancer on March 5, built his political career on flaying the United States and its traditional allies in the Venezuelan establishment, and Mr. Maduro followed his mentor's script throughout the campaign with an acolyte's zeal.
He accused former American diplomats of plotting to kill him, suggested that the United States had caused Mr. Chvez's illness, and had his foreign minister shut the door on informal talks with the United States that began late last year. A senior State Department official in Washington said the harsh rhetoric had made the possibility of improved relations more difficult.
But over the weekend, with his election victory looking likely, Mr. Maduro sent a private signal to Washington that he was ready to turn the page. Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico, who was in Caracas as a representative of the Organization of American States, said in an interview that Mr. Maduro called him aside after a meeting of election observers on Saturday and asked him to carry a message.
''He said, 'We want to improve the relationship with the U.S., regularize the relationship,' '' Mr. Richardson said.
The foreign minister, Elas Jaua, met with Mr. Richardson on Sunday, and said Venezuela was ready to resume the talks that it had cut off, Mr. Richardson said.
Though Mr. Chvez's death raised the possibility of a realignment in the hemisphere, Mr. Maduro's victory would seem to extend the life of the leftist coalition of countries that coalesced around Mr. Chvez. Mr. Maduro seems certain to continue the lifeline of oil sales on preferential terms that Venezuela provides to Cuba, whose leaders were close allies of Mr. Chvez.
Yet even his supporters say that Mr. Maduro lacks his predecessor's sharp political instincts and magnetism, and many questions remain about how effectively he will lead at home and abroad.
At the voting booth on Sunday, Mr. Chvez was as much on voters' minds as the two candidates were. Mr. Maduro went all-out to associate himself with the dead leader and his idiosyncratic style of socialism, which remains broadly popular in Venezuela, especially among poorer voters. His image was everywhere in Mr. Maduro's campaign, and the candidate even told voters that Mr. Chvez's spirit had appeared to him in the form of a little bird. An awkward campaigner who struggled to connect with supporters, Mr. Maduro took to whistling like a bird at his rallies.
Voters seemed to respond on Sunday. ''The commander's legacy should continue, toward a better future,'' said Alejandro Rodrguez, 34, after casting his ballot at a school in a neighborhood known as Gato Negro, or Black Cat. ''I voted for the commander's son, Nicols Maduro,'' Mr. Rodrguez said, echoing the candidate who called himself ''the son of Chvez.'' Driving the point home, a large banner on a pedestrian overpass near the school entrance said, ''A vote for Maduro is a vote for Chvez.''
Just as he did when running against Mr. Chvez last October, Mr. Capriles managed to energize and inject hope into a fractious and battered opposition. He represented a coalition of groups from across the political spectrum. But it was not clear if the opposition's unity and momentum could be maintained after the defeat, in the face of a government that holds a virtual monopoly on power.
In the election last October, Mr. Chvez received nearly 8.2 million votes, or 55 percent, compared to nearly 6.6 million, or 44 percent, for Mr. Capriles.
But Mr. Maduro could also face pressure from within Mr. Chvez's movement, from competing leaders or groups in government and the armed forces who do not feel the need to obey him with the absolute loyalty they once gave to Mr. Chvez.
Just as Mr. Chvez did, Mr. Maduro sought to exploit the bitter divide between loyalists and opponents.
''The country is going to be more polarized, divided into two parts,'' said Rafael Huizi Clavier, a retired vice admiral who supported Mr. Capriles. ''There is more confrontation, because the campaign has been very hard and the differences have been exacerbated. There is more antagonism between the two sides.''
The new president will face a host of challenges as he serves out the rest of Mr. Chavez's term, which began in January. The economy suffers from high inflation -- just over 20 percent last year -- and from chronic shortages of many basic foods, medicines and other goods. Many economists predict that economic growth will slow significantly this year and some say the nation could slip into recession.
The government-owned oil monopoly, Petrleos de Venezuela, is a crucial source of government revenue, but it has been struggling with stagnant production and problems at its refineries. The country's electrical grid is plagued by blackouts, which are frequent in many areas of the country outside Caracas.
And violent crime is rampant. As recently as Thursday, four people were shot to death in three separate incidents at a sprawling election rally for Mr. Maduro in Caracas, according to local news media accounts.

HEADLINE: In Surprise, Recovery In China Loses Steam

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER and CHRIS BUCKLEY

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Chinese economic recovery lost some of its momentum during the first quarter of this year, official data released on Monday showed, surprising analysts who had expected growth to accelerate on the back of ample credit, strong infrastructure spending and firm exports. 
The economy expanded by just 7.7 percent during the first three months of the year, compared with a year earlier, short of the 8 percent that economists polled by Reuters had projected, and slower than during the previous three months, when gross domestic product rose 7.9 percent year-on-year.
Industrial output data for March also underlined the fading momentum. Growth dropped to 8.9 percent compared with March 2012, well below expectations.
The spokesman for the Chinese statistics bureau, Sheng Laiyun, played down the shortfall.
''Over all in the first quarter the economy had a steady start and has advanced in a stable way,'' Mr. Sheng said at a news conference in Beijing. ''Generally, it's operating within the range of 7.4 percent to 7.9 percent -- that is, steady growth.''
China's industrialization and urbanization would remain powerful engines for relatively rapid growth, Mr. Sheng said.
Analysts had widely expected China's economy, the world's second biggest after the United States, to have picked up more steam during the first months of the year, as a tide of credit flowed into the economy, and government-mandated investment in infrastructure projects picked up.
In fact, the growing scale of credit has begun to worry an increasing number of analysts, who warn that the resulting buildup of debt bears substantial risks, including asset price bubbles and potentially destabilizing defaults.
Fitch Ratings last week expressed concerns about the long-term consequences for China's financial stability over the country's huge buildup in debt, particularly borrowing by local governments.

HEADLINE: Rivals in the Showroom, Ford and G.M. Will Develop Transmissions Jointly

BYLINE: LINDSAY BROOKE


HIGHLIGHT: Ford and General Motors will jointly develop a new generation of 9- and 10-speed automatic transmissions. 

 BODY:
Ford Motor and General Motors announced on Monday that they would jointly develop new transmissions with 9 speeds for front-wheel-drive vehicles and 10 speeds for rear-drive cars and trucks. The new transmissions, with more forward gear ratios than either company now offers, are expected to reach the market beginning in 2016. 
The transmissions are considered vital components of the companies' efforts to meet upcoming standards for fuel efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions in the United States and Europe. The transmissions will "drive fuel economy improvements into both company's future product portfolios," said Jim Lanzon, G.M.'s vice president of global transmission engineering. 
The automakers' announcement had been anticipated last October but was delayed over protracted negotiations concerning intellectual property, according to sources familiar with the agreement. Reports of the pending alliance first emerged in an article in the Automobiles section in September 2012. 
The joint transmission development program builds on the companies' 2002 agreement that resulted in a 6-speed automatic for front-wheel-drive vehicles.
While Henry Ford couldn't have foreseen this cooperative venture with General Motors when he said, "Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success," the agreement does appear to fulfill his vision regarding manufacturing efficiency. 
By cooperating on design, engineering, and testing, the automakers are expected to save hundreds of millions of dollars and considerable development time, said Skip Nydam, an industry analyst with ND-Automotive and a former transmission engineer. It also saves the cost of licensing the design and production rights from a specialist transmission supplier like ZF of Germany or Aisin of Japan, which can cost up to $100 per unit, according to engineers at Ford and G.M.
"This collaboration provides sound economics and the flexibility both automakers need to meet the new fuel economy laws," Mr. Nydam said.
In the 2002 deal, considered a landmark in the highly competitive auto industry, Ford and G.M. invested a combined $720 million. They have since produced more than eight million transmissions - the model is known as the Ford 6F and G.M. 6T70 and 6T75 - for nearly 30 models, including the Ford Fusion, Edge, Escape and Explorer, and the Chevrolet Cruze, Malibu, Equinox and Traverse.
"We've already proven that Ford and G.M. transmission engineers work extremely well together," said Joe Bakaj, Ford's vice president of powertrain engineering. 
Based on their previous 6-speed experience, the automakers will share many common parts for the new 9- and 10-speed; manufacturing the transmissions will take place in each company's own plants. Software controls developed separately by the two automakers will tailor the units to specific G.M. and Ford vehicles, giving each its own performance and operating characterisitics.
The companies did not provide specific vehicle applications or technical details.
G.M. is understood to have contributed the basic design of the new 9-speed for front-drive vehicles, while the 10-speed's design comes from Ford. Jumping to 9- and 10-speeds from the 6-, 7-, and 8-speed transmissions currently used across the industry improves the ratio spread - the numerical relationship between lowest and highest gears.
A large overall ratio spread makes it possible to achieve both lively acceleration and quieter highway cruising without sacrificing either. The larger the number, the better: the new 9-speed, for example, is expected to have a ratio spread close to 10:1, compared with a typical 6-speed's ratio spread of about 6:1.
At the same time, the added gears make it feasible to use a smaller ratio spread between adjacent gears - for instance, fourth and fifth gears - to keep the engine revving at its best power level for a given road speed. 
The additional gear ratios are seen as critical for use with the smaller, high-torque turbocharged engines that are increasingly common in cars and trucks. Such engines are leading a trend known as downspeeding, which calls for lowering engine r.p.m. to reduce fuel consumption.
With the new 9-speed, G.M. and Ford are following ZF, which unveiled the first production 9-speed automatic in 2011. The ZF transmission will be introduced in the 2014 Jeep Cherokee and the Range Rover Evoque. The ZF 9-speed is expected to offer up to 16 percent better highway fuel economy than 6-speed automatics, according to ZF engineers.
Like its ZF counterpart, the joint G.M.-Ford 9-speed is expected to feature clever design of its internal mechanisms aimed at making the transmission as compact as possible. This will be critical for fitting the new gearbox into small cars like the Chevrolet Sonic and the Ford Fiesta. Currently these cars can fit only 6-speed transmissions because of the limited width between their front wheels. The 10-speed, because of its longitudinal installation in pickup trucks (where it is expected to be used in high volume), will not be as space-constrained as the front-drive 9-speed.
Despite the added complexity of additional gearsets and clutches in the new 9- and 10-speed automatics, those units are considered by many engineers to be more attractive than continuously variable transmissions. The C.V.T.'s appear mechanically simpler but lack the high torque capacity of conventional automatics and cost more to produce, say transmission experts.

HEADLINE: A Chat With the Boston Fed's Chief

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Eric S. Rosengren discounts the notion of a spring swoon, sees the economy gaining strength and says the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policies are helping. 

 BODY:
Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in an interview that he wanted to see the economy adding at least 200,000 jobs a month in addition to a declining unemployment rate before he would be ready to consider scaling back the Fed's efforts to stimulate the economy.
Other Fed officials have made similar statements in recent weeks, reflecting concern that the unemployment rate is declining because fewer people are looking for work, and not because faster growth is creating opportunities.
But Mr. Rosengren also expressed optimism that the economic recovery was gaining strength, and that growth could reach 3 percent this year. 
We spoke during a Boston Fed conference focused on the Fed's commitment to reducing unemployment. The transcript is edited for clarity.
 Q. 
 Do you believe in spring swoons? Are we swooning now?
 A. 
 I wouldn't put too much weight on any one data point. February, things seemed unusually strong. The unemployment report and some of the things we've gotten this week have been a little bit weaker. We'll have to see which of those two ends up being a more accurate projection of what's going to be happening. 
It's been a little bit of a surprise that it looks like we're going to get roughly 3 percent G.D.P. growth in the first quarter. That's certainly stronger than I think most people were expecting. It looks like we are going to be getting a little bit of a weakening in the second quarter. I'm expecting closer to 1.5 [percent growth]. Average those two and you get 2.25 [percent growth over the first half of the year]. I do think there's enough underlying strength in the economy that as we get into the second half of the year we're going to get much closer to 3 percent. 
We do have to get through this period where fiscal policy is removing some of the accommodation that we're trying to put into the market. Assuming we don't get any negative shocks, I think there's enough underlying strength that this won't look like a spring swoon. It will look like a little bit of a lull. I hope that I'm right.
 Q. 
 Consumer spending has been strong despite the higher payroll taxes that took effect in January. Do you think the predicted impacts were overstated? It is possible that the impact of the sequestration cuts also will fall short of expectations? 
 A. 
 I think it was a little surprising how strong consumption was in the first quarter. I do think it had some impact. If you talk to retailers, people that have restaurants, particularly that were more focused on low- and medium-income customers, they were seeing an impact from the payroll tax. But there was stronger underlying strength in the economy at that time. In the absence of fiscal austerity we would have seen some pretty good momentum in the first half of the year. Some things also don't happen immediately; people sometimes take time to respond. I'm reasonably confident that despite what's happening with government spending, we're getting modest growth. Otherwise, we'd be getting strong growth.
 Q. 
 Unemployment remains higher than you'd like - 
 A. 
 That's an understatement. 
 Q. 
 So why aren't you advocating for the Fed to do even more? 
 A. 
 I think ideally it would actually come from the fiscal side. My own forecast is we'll get to roughly 7.25 percent unemployment by the end of the year. I would continue our program and if we get to 7.25 and we're starting to see payroll growth that is north of 200,000, and it looks like we're getting a real self-sustaining recovery then I think you can make an argument [that it's time to curtail asset purchases].
I think we need to be careful about what kind of side effects we're having. My own sense is that the economy is picking up, the unemployment rate will be coming down. This is a fairly significant degree of accommodation. Long-term rates are quite low. We are seeing an impact from our policies. I think we're pushing the interest-sensitive sector about as far as we're going to be able to push it at this time.
The sectors that we can't control - federal, state and local spending - have been a drag on the economy. We've been having fiscal austerity, we have more now than we had before, so monetary policy is trying to offset some of the fiscal austerity.
 Q. 
 Are you concerned that the Fed's efforts to drive down borrowing costs, and to increase risk-taking, are reinflating speculative bubbles? 
 A. 
 I talked about this in a recent speech. If you look at prices, we're nowhere close to where we were at the peak. I think we're getting the economy more quickly to where it should be. I don't think in any way that the actions we've taken to date are creating the kind of financial instability that would offset the advantages of trying to push the unemployment rate down a little more quickly.
 Q. 
 If the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 percent, but only - or mostly - because fewer people are looking for work, is that good enough, or at least as good as it gets? Would the Fed declare victory and start to raise short-term interest rates? 
 A. 
 We do not want to get to 6.5 percent just by having people pull out of the labor force. We want to get to 6.5 because employment is expanding and we're adding jobs faster than labor force growth. If we end up at 6.5 percent and it was only because people pulled out of the labor force, that would not be substantial improvement in labor markets, that would mean that I would not be seeing the evidence that I would want to be seeing that we should be moving short-term rates.
 Q. 
 You spoke Friday about the importance of the Fed's dual mandate. But the Fed historically has behaved pretty much like every other major central bank. It seeks to control inflation and then it seeks to stimulate growth as much as possible, so long as inflation remains low. Where's the evidence that the dual mandate matters?
 A. 
 Look at the March statement. You would not see that kind of statement out of the Bank of England, the Riksbank or the European Central Bank because they do have only a single mandate. It's hard enough to explain monetary policy, but fairly unsophisticated people can understand that we're going to keep interest rates low until unemployment hits 6.5 percent. In terms of a communication device, that's a very clear difference. It's observable, it's credible, it's easy to see whether we're doing it or not doing it.
And you see the difference when you're tracking closer to 2 percent inflation and still willing to take accommodative policy. We haven't been near 2 percent in the last few years, but our willingness to maintain a pretty accommodative policy will be in some sense the test that we're actually putting weight on how high the unemployment rate is.
 Q. 
 Are you concerned about increased income inequality? Is there anything the Fed can do to address what appear to be increasingly entrenched inequalities? 
 A. 
 One of the biggest things that causes your wealth to go down is a spell of unemployment. You go through a spell of unemployment, it dramatically affects a variety of things: your earnings not only immediately but over the next 10 years. And the longer the duration of the unemployment, the bigger the effect. So I think the most direct way we can have a difference is to try to bring the unemployment rate down as quickly as we can.
 (Mr. Rosengren also noted that the Boston Fed is sponsoring a grant competition, the Working Cities Challenge, to improve economic conditions in the former factory towns that dot Massachusetts. The grants build on Boston Fed research showing that "industry mix, demographic makeup, and geographic location made less difference to success than the presence of a community leader and collaboration around a vision for the future.")

HIGHLIGHT: Venezuela elects Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s prot&#233;g&#233;; human genes patents; Google and European regulators make a deal; and an Australian golfer wins the Masters for the first time. 

 BODY:
 NEWS In an unexpectedly close race, Venezuelans narrowly voted to continue Hugo Chvez's revolution, electing his handpicked political heir, Nicols Maduro, to serve the remainder of his six-year term as president, officials said late Sunday. William Neuman reports from Caracas. 
Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that the United States was prepared to reach out to Kim Jong-un of North Korea if he made the first move to abandon his nuclear weapons program. Michael R. Gordon reports from Tokyo.
Reporters who joined students from the London School of Economics on a sight-seeing trip to North Korea did not disclose their true purpose and filmed an undercover documentary, the university said. Ravi Somaiya reports.
With less than six months to go before parliamentary elections in Germany, a new political party, Alternative for Germany, is calling for an end to the European currency union is gaining strength. Nicholas Kulish and Melissa Eddy report from Berlin.
The U.S. Supreme Court is poised to take up the highly charged question of whether human genes can be patented. But another question could trump it: Has the field of genetics moved so far so fast that whatever the court decides, it has come too late to the issue? Andrew Pollack reports.
Google has for the first time agreed to legally binding changes to its search results after an antitrust investigation by European regulators into whether it abuses its dominance of online search. Claire Cain Miller reports.
The Chinese economic recovery lost some of its momentum during the first quarter of this year, official data released on Monday showed, surprising analysts who had expected growth to accelerate on the back of ample credit, strong infrastructure spending and firm exports. Bettina Wassener and Chris Buckley report from Hong Kong.
 ARTS Sir Colin Davis, the magisterial conductor whose career with the London Symphony Orchestra spanned over half a century and included 11 years as its principal conductor, died on Sunday. Michael Schwirtz reports.
 SPORTS Adam Scott became the first Australian to win the Masters when he drained a 12-foot birdie putt on the second playoff hole Sunday and defeated ngel Cabrera of Argentina, whose birdie bid moments earlier had died on the edge of the cup. Karen Crouse reports from Augusta, Georgia.
It made for an exciting race full of sound and fury, with multiple pit stops, multiple changes of position and six different leaders. But the result of the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday signified very little, as the top three qualifiers also finished in the top three positions - albeit, in the reverse order of their starting positions. Brad Spurgeon reports from Shanghai.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Free Lunch?

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: A declining deficit? A global recession? Why some small businesses are hungry to hire. Do you expect to buy PCs this year? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
 The Politics: A Shrinking Deficit 
The president announces a $3.7 trillion budget with revenue-raising favorites and a tax credit for small businesses. Here is everything a small-business owner needs to know about the president's budget, and this is a quick guide to all of the budget proposals. Bill McBride says the deficit is shrinking rapidly. The International Monetary Fund says monetary easing is producing little risk of high inflation, and the Federal Reserve remains divided over when to end the stimulus. The Pentagon looks to cut 40,000 to 50,000 civilian jobs over the next five years, and Saturday postal deliveries will continue.
 The Economy: Global Recession?
 
Small-business confidence retreated last month, and Dave Gonigam offers one reason small-business owners are bummed out. But some small businesses are hungry to hire. Retail sales fell unexpectedly in March, but financial stress has returned to mid-2007 levels according to three Federal Reserve measures. Lumber prices are near a housing bubble high, and land becomes more expensive. Job openings increased in February, and machine tool orders show signs of strength. But wholesale sales and inventories had a very bad February, and restaurant operators' confidence in the economy is tenuous. The White House is projecting slow economic gains, and the World Trade Organization cuts its forecast. John P. Hussman expects the American economy to "join a global recession that is already in progress in much of the developed world."
 People: Free Lunch? 
Tech companies that offer free lunches are drawing attention from the Internal Revenue Service. This is why Margaret Thatcher inspired so many women. John Baldoni reports on why your least engaged employees might be your top performers: "It is not usual for good performers to feel lost in the system." Beware of these traps when hiring for your small business. Here's how to use a virtual assistant. If you've got a problem, you can now hire an "hourly nerd." Some 83 percent of American workers say they feel stressed by their jobs, up from 73 percent a year ago. A dog-friendly environment is just one of the perks your small business can afford, according to Suzanne Lucas. And here is why this guy's son is crying.
 Management: Jay-Z Sells 
A study finds that businesses owned by women have increased 59 percent since 1997. Jim Jacques says that one of the five things that set real entrepreneurs apart is "they don't try to be someone else." Jay-Z will sell his shares in the Brooklyn Nets. Alison Bradford explains why you need a compelling vision. Gregory Ciotti believes "external end-goal restriction" is a dangerous creativity killer. Consumerist names its worst company of the year. Brett and Kate McKay say that to succeed in work and life you need to be Mr. T. The firing of J.C. Penney's chief executive teaches a few lessons.
 Start-Up: Ridiculous Start-Ups 
Here are some ridiculous start-up ideas (that became successful). A seminar in Chicago this week will help you find investors for your start-up. A disabled veteran starts a barbecue-sauce business while another start-up can help you manage the death of a loved one. Gabrielle Karol asks whether location matters for a start-up. Two entrepreneurs start an "urban ventures" accelerator program that empowers entrepreneurs to solve urban problems. Andrew Chen wonders why we are so bad at predicting start-up success: "Be careful with what you think you know versus what you don't. I've found that my area of expertise where I can make good decisions is actually pretty narrow."
 Finance: Backing Away From Social 
It turns out that for many banks, the Small Business Lending Fund was nothing more than a way to get out of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Crowdfunding's tally amounted to $2.6 billion in 2012 - with projects like this one, which is seeking funds to film big rodents. Lending to franchises has reached the highest level since the recession. Venture capitalists are backing away from social businesses, and Chicago's venture capital financing plunges 42.6 percent. A global technology provider serving the financial services industry releases a consulting initiative to help banks improve the profitability and efficiency of commercial and small-business lending.
 Cash Flow: Canceling PayPal 
Heather Allard suggests three steps to build a business budget that works. Robert X. Cringely struggles to cancel his PayPal account. A bunch of celebrity entrepreneurs auction off their time. Ivan Widjaya lays out the process of protecting a trademark. Here are six legal steps to take when starting a business.

A poll of small-business owners reveals strong bipartisan opposition to corporate tax loopholes. Here's what you need to know about the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. John Goodman has advice for small businesses that do not know how to handle the Affordable Care Act's "suffocating cost," while Wendell Potter says small businesses that want a tax break should check out the A.C.A.

 The Week's Best Quote 
Edward Behr explains the benefits of a slow life: "You're living a slow life when you gather seashells along the shore, feed a campfire, visit a nearly empty museum on a weekday morning, talk late into the night, read an ink-on-paper book cover-to-cover without stopping to do much else, and, I would say, if you take the time to be bored. Part of being civilized is not just being slow but occasionally coming to a stop, establishing a point of reference for the moment when you start moving again. When you stop you aren't really stopping, of course, because that's often when good ideas rise to the surface."

HEADLINE: Citigroup's Earnings Rose 30% in First Quarter

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Citigroup reported first-quarter profit of $3.8 billion, or $1.23 a share, exceeding analysts&#8217; estimates, as the bank continued to reduce costs and unload troubled assets. 

 BODY:
 6:01 p.m. | Updated 
Citigroup beat earnings expectations on Monday as net income surged by 30 percent in the first quarter of 2013. But beneath the banner results, the bank is grappling with a sluggish economy and skittish American consumers who are still wary of shouldering fresh debt.
The bank, which has been aggressively working to slash costs and slog through a glut of soured assets, reported a profit of $3.8 billion, or $1.23 a share, for the first quarter. Revenue also rose by 3 percent to $20.5 billion.
Still, Citigroup's results were damped by largely stagnant revenue in the consumer banking unit and persistent difficulties in Asia and Latin America. One particularly vexing challenge: the United States consumer. 
Borrowers are still unwilling to take on new loans, even with interest rates hovering at near-record lows.
"I don't think we've got a real strong consumer driving the economy," John Gerspach, the bank's chief financial officer said on a conference call on Monday. He added that "we are seeing a certain amount of deleveraging."
For Stephanie Sanyour, 25, "deleveraging" felt like a tremendous relief. Ms. Sanyour, a television producer who lives in Des Moines, said she had devoted an entire paycheck this month to wiping out her debt on a Citigroup credit card. While the monthly payments were manageable, she said that the debt felt like a "chain on my ankles limiting my flexibility."
Across the nation, banking analysts say, consumers like Ms. Sanyour are working to pay off their bills and stay out of debt. Such a tepid appetite for loans underpinned Citigroup's results on Monday. While total loans inched up slightly in the first quarter to $539 billion, the bulk of the growth stemmed from demand among corporate clients beyond the United States. Consumer lending rose just 1 percent in the first quarter. In North America, revenue in the global banking unit stagnated, falling by 1 percent to $5.1 billion.
"The environment remains challenging and we are sure to be tested as we go through the year," Michael L. Corbat, the bank's chief executive, said in the earnings release.
Citigroup's quarterly earnings underscore broader challenges buffeting the United States banking industry. On Friday, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo reported declines in revenue, slowed in part by mortgage machines that are beginning to sputter. The refinancing boom, fed by federal largess that drove down interest rates and spurred a flurry of refinancings, is showing signs of petering out.
Combined with Citi's earnings Monday, the results are propelling worries that banks are floundering to offset income sapped by a spate of new financial regulations and a lackluster economy. Sluggish loan demand is renewing those concerns. Jamie Dimon, the influential chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan, called loan growth "soft" for the quarter when the bank reported earnings on Friday.
Beyond the banking results, other indicators of economic health have proved dispiriting as well. Retail sales in the United States fell by 0.4 percent in March. Even though unemployment is falling, consumers remain unconvinced.
Part of the wariness among consumers, banking analysts say, arises from broad skepticism about the housing market. Even though housing prices have been rising recently, the improvements won't rouse consumers until they remain steadily high for a longer stretch, according to analysts. "If housing prices start to stall even a little bit, then we are going to see an even greater retreat from consumers," said J. J. Kinahan, a strategist at TD Ameritrade.
Even bank executives are skeptical about the housing market in the United States. "I wouldn't say I am positive about the housing market," Mr. Gerspach said.
Citigroup has pinned some of its hope for future profitability on its vast international footprint, but some regions produced lackluster returns. Revenue from consumer banking in Asia fell in the first quarter to $2 billion, down 1 percent from the same period a year earlier. The bank is struggling to navigate the shifting regulatory landscape in Asia. In South Korea, for example, national officials placed a cap on the interest rates of a range of consumer loans. Mr. Gerspach said that there were "still headwinds" in the region.
Despite the challenges, Citigroup showed strengths in other parts of its business. A bright spot in the first quarter was the securities and banking group, which was bolstered by strong gains in investment banking, fixed income and equities.
Revenue in that unit surged 31 percent, to $6.98 billion, while net income was $2.3 billion, up 81 percent from the period a year earlier. For Citigroup, the unit has been a consistent focus. Mr. Gerspach reiterated that on Monday, saying the bank continued to make "steady progress" in its share of a "client's wallet."
Much of the gains in securities and banking came from Citigroup's investment banking unit, which was buoyed by increases in debt and equity underwriting. The unit's revenue increased to $1.1 billion, up 22 percent from the period a year earlier.
Over all, investors seemed pleased with the quarterly results. Citigroup's stock rose 9 cents to $44.87 on Monday, after trading in the morning above $46, on a day when there was wide selling in the stock market.
The quarterly report is the second under the leadership of Mr. Corbat, who took over after the abrupt ouster of Vikram S. Pandit. In October, Michael E. O'Neill, the bank's forceful chairman, pushed Mr. Pandit out in favor of Mr. Corbat.
Since taking over, Mr. Corbat has vowed to continue reorienting the bank toward its core business while shedding less-profitable units. Mr. Corbat has said he is willing to eliminate operations across the globe. That cost-cutting fervor began under Mr. Pandit, who helped return the bank to profitability after presiding over a turbulent chapter in its history when Citi received a $45 billion federal lifeline.
Citigroup has been aggressively whittling down a morass of soured loans and cutting less-profitable business lines in an effort to reduce costs. In December, it said it would eliminate 11,000 jobs worldwide. Within its Citi Holdings unit, Citigroup reduced assets by $60 billion in the first quarter.
Like other banks that have reduced reserves for mortgages and credit cards loans, Citigroup benefited from releasing some of its loan reserves. In the first quarter, Citibank emptied reserves by $652 million.
Citigroup continues to be haunted by its mortgage woes. Last month, it agreed to pay $730 million to settle claims that it had duped investors into buying securities backed by shaky mortgage loans. The bank did not admit any wrongdoing. Cautioning investors on Monday, Mr. Gerspach said that legal expenses remained "volatile."
An earlier version of this article misstated Citigroup's revenue performance in North America. Revenue fell to $5.1 billion from the period a year earlier, it didn't increase.

HEADLINE: Challenges Mount for China's President

BYLINE: BILL BISHOP


HIGHLIGHT: Reports of infections and deaths from the H7N9 bird flu virus grow, while the economy shows signs of sputtering. 

 BODY:
Whatever honeymoon President Xi Jinping of China may have been having appears to be over. If you think you are having a difficult Monday, consider his challenges. 
China has now reported 63 infections and 14 deaths from the H7N9 bird flu virus, and the flu has spread to Beijing and Henan Province. A 7-year-old girl, the daughter of Beijing poultry sellers, is in the hospital and recovering from the virus. A 4-year-old neighbor tested positive for the virus, although he has not yet shown any symptoms, and that may be worrisome, one expert told Bloomberg News:
"With asymptomatic cases around, I think everything changes," said Ian Mackay, an associate professor of clinical virology at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, in a telephone interview today. "There has been a spike in pneumonia cases that have drawn the health officials' attention, but the virus may have been going around as a normal cold." 
China hasinvited four foreign flu experts to visit the country to "offer technical advice ... to identify the source and mode of transmission of the H7N9 avian influenza." Chicken consumption is falling, and companies with exposure to Chinese poultry like Yum Brands may not see a quick recovery. 
Tensions surrounding North Korea are still high. Secretary of State John Kerry was in Beijing over the weekend, but left for Tokyowith no evident breakthrough on North Korea. 
The good news is that Kim Jung-un did not use the birthday celebration for Kim Il-sung, founder of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and his grandfather, to test fire a missile as some had expected. 
China's goal appears to be to lower the acute level of tension so the status quo can be maintained. Conflict, collapse or reunification are not in China's interest, but neither is regime change. The United States should not expect China to exert real, sustained pressure on North Korea, barring a real provocation from Pyongyang that might force Beijing's hand.
 THE ECONOMY MAY BE SPUTTERING, another headache for Mr. Xi's new administration. First-quarter annualized growth slowed to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, below the consensus forecast of 8 percent growth. 
In a research note on Monday titled "Hopes for sustained recovery fade," Mark Williams and Wang Qinwei of Capital Economics, who forecast 7.6 percent growth in first-quarter gross domestic product, wrote:
"Given that policy makers already seem concerned about the current pace of credit growth and excess investment in property, neither seems likely. 
Widely held hopes of a continued acceleration in growth into 2014 have taken a big knock today. Our 2013 G.D.P. forecast remains 8.0 percent with risks to the downside. Our 2014 forecast is 7.5 percent."
China's official G.D.P. growth target for 2013, reiterated last month by the departing premier, Wen Jiabao, is 7.5 percent. 
Mr. Xi, ina meeting last weekend with business leaders, reiterated that the era of "super-high or ultra-high-speed growth" was over, adding that the slowdown in 2012 was "partially due to our efforts to control the speed of growth."
One of the reasons so many analysts overestimated first-quarter G.D.P. growth was that total lending in the quarter surged to 6.1 trillion renminbi. The government has announced steps to reign in credit growth, but a significant drop in lending could cause painful short-term economic challenges.
The government says publicly that it is willing to absorb the pain as it grapples with ballooning debt, entrenched special interests and the difficult rebalancing of the economy from investment to consumption. A Chinese economist affiliated with the National Development and Reform Commission, speaking after Monday's G.D.P. release, said:
... using short-term stimulus to boost growth to back above 8 percent would be like "drinking poison to quench a thirst," arguing that moves to ease policy are seeing diminishing returns.
"They're having a smaller and smaller impact on boosting growth - first-quarter lending was quite strong but growth still wasn't that good," she said. "This is what people call overheating finance but a cooling economy."
Premier Li Keqiang hinted on Sunday at the possibility of short-term stimulus measures, though not if they would cause long-term damage, as the stimulus response to the 2008 financial crash so clearly did. While leading a seminar,the premier saidthat "if interim measures have to be carried out, they should not set up barriers for promoting market-oriented reform and development in the future."
Many analystsblame the disappointing quarterly growth in part on Mr. Xi's "Eight Rules" and the ongoing frugality and anticorruption campaigns. If the crackdowns really took a dent out of G.D.P. growth, then one has to wonder how much of the consumption over the last few years has actually been government spending. 
Those campaigns are set to continue. The People's Daily newspaper on Friday contained three supportive articles, and Saturday's CCTV Evening News featured an exposabout officials in Beijing satisfying their gluttony by quietly visiting private clubs instead of public restaurants. 
Mr. Xi's efforts to rein in corruption may "make cleansing the Augean stables simplicity itself," but he seems more determined than many expected. 
Frugality bites, for restaurants and investors.

HEADLINE: What Are Your Tax Dollars Buying?

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: As tax day arrives, the White House and research organizations are offering calculators to show how your federal income tax payment is distributed. 

 BODY:
Today - and I hope this does not come as a surprise to any of you - is tax day, when we are required to settle our bills with the federal government for the year 2012. Given how much we pay to Washington every year, it seems only fair that we ask for a receipt. 
The White House and research organizations including Third Way have made it easy to do just that: Go to their online widgets and input a little tax and income information, and they will tell you just what you bought with your federal tax dollars. The widgets all operate on the same principle. They take the amount you paid in taxes and then divide that money up into separate piles that are proportionate to the spending categories of the federal budget.
Let's say that you paid $20,000 in income taxes last year. According to the White House receipt, you would have spent about $7,000 on defense, including the military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The second-biggest category is health spending, on programs like Medicaid and Medicare. That accounted for about $6,400. After that comes "job and family security," which includes unemployment insurance and programs for the working poor, which you spent about $5,000 on last year. Net interest on the debt is also a major category, accounting for about $2,300. 
Then, there are many much smaller categories. Humanitarian aid, for instance, cost you only $228 out of your $20,000. You spent about $1,300 on programs for veterans and $190 on agriculture. Education and job training cost you about $940 and NASA about $170. Disaster response worked out to about $120.
There are a few things to note here. One is that "mandatory" spending - including government funding for Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and interest on the debt - and military spending together significantly outweigh "discretionary" spending. That is upside down to many Americans' perceptions of the budget. (It is also worth noting that the White House separates out tax revenue for and spending on Social Security and certain parts of Medicare.)
The second is that all those numbers add up to more than $20,000. If you go to the White House calculator and say you paid $5,000 in income taxes, it will break it down into an equivalent $5,000 in spending. But that doesn't really make sense. Last year, Washington spent far more than it took in - about $1.1 trillion more. That means that for every tax dollar it collected, it spent about $1.43.
By the same logic, your $20,000 in income taxes translated into about $28,600 in spending. In the numbers above, I corrected for that discrepancy, particularly given that you will end up paying for that deficit in the form of higher taxes, lower spending and higher interest payments in the future.

HEADLINE: Housing Trends, Short and Long Term

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: Though recent reports have indicated strengthening housing prices and an upturn in home building, the path seems to be a zigzag rather than a straight line. 

 BODY:
 4/16/13 | Updated to reflect new figures on housing starts and building permits.
 Home prices in the United States have been on a roller coaster ride for the last decade - soaring through 2005, then plunging in the steepest decline since the Great Depression. In 2012, though, prices began moving upward. 
 How solid is the incipient housing recovery, and what are the prospects for home prices in the decade ahead? 
Some fresh clues about the short-term trends began arriving this week. And an analysis of the long-term prospects for home prices in a three-part series of columns in Sunday Business by Robert Shiller, the Yale economist. 
 First, the short-term trend: based, at least, on a report on Monday morning, it appeared to be taking a zigzag path rather than a straight line upward. According to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market index, sentiment among home builders declined in April for the third consecutive month, to 42 from 44 the previous month. While that index climbed in 2012, it has not been above the neutral level of 50 since April 2006, when the market collapse was already under way. 
 In another report, on Tuesday - the tally of housing starts and building permits in March - Wall Street economists were expecting another set of strong numbers, but the picture was mixed. The Commerce Department said housing starts climbed to a 1.04 million annual rate, the fastest pace since June 2008, and up from a revised rate of 968,000 in February. But while construction surged for multifamily units - many intended as rentals - the building of single-family homes declined. And building permits over all fell 3.9 percent from the previous month. 
 Still, the short-term trend for the housing market seemed clear and strong enough for Michael E. Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, to conclude in a report on April 10 that residential investment - including home building, repairs, renovation and brokers' fees - would rise enough this year to add 0.5 percent to G.D.P. growth.
 As for home prices, no major reports were imminent. But in the fourth quarter of 2012, the latest home period included in the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller 20-city index, prices rose sharply, at the fastest rate since June 2006. 
 Professor Shiller, who helped devise the Case-Shiller index, says in his Economic View column on Sunday even if the upward trend for prices continues for a while, historical data shows that it's not necessarily meaningful over the long haul. 
 "One-year home price increases, after correcting for inflation, have had almost no statistical relationship to increases 10 years down the road," he writes. "Thus, the upturn last year is irrelevant to long-run forecasting. Booms are typically followed by busts, usually in far less than 10 years. In a decade, an entire housing boom, if there is one in inflation-corrected terms, is likely to have been reversed and completely washed away."
 In assessing long-term price trends, he says, prospective home buyers ought to emphasize fundamental factors like inflation and construction costs, which he discusses in his first column. While inflation creates the illusion that real home prices are increasing, rising productivity in the construction industry often drives down the cost of housing. 
Next Sunday's column will deal with real estate bubbles, and with the speculative effects of years of declining interest rates on housing and other markets. The third will consider cultural and demographic trends, including the stimulative market influence of a rising population - and the potential constraints on prices that could occur as America ages..

HEADLINE: Bush Welcomes Grandchild and Prepares to Dedicate Presidential Library

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: Over the weekend, George W. Bush welcomed his first grandchild into the world. And next week he will welcome the arrival of his other baby, a 226,565-square-foot presidential center. 

 BODY:
 DALLAS - For a former president, it does not get much better than this. Over the weekend, George W. Bush welcomed his first grandchild into the world. And next week he will welcome the arrival of his other baby, a 226,565-square-foot presidential center. 
 Mr. Bush, who has remained largely removed from the spotlight in the four years since leaving the White House, returned to television screens on Monday in a series of hospital snapshots with his new granddaughter, Mila, who was born to Jenna and Henry Hager on Saturday night. Next week, he will host President Obama and other dignitaries to dedicate the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum.
 The happenstance of timing served to underscore the dominant themes of Mr. Bush's postpresidential life here in Texas. Once a wartime commander in chief, he is now a doting grandfather as well as an amateur painter. With his eight years in power behind him, he is trying to frame what they added up to and still promoting causes important to him while staying out of what he calls "the swamp" of national politics.
 "One of the real challenges of life is that when you complete a chapter, you don't atrophy, that you continue to find ways to contribute," Mr. Bush told The Dallas Morning News in an interview published over the weekend. 
 Even before completing his presidential library, Mr. Bush has been working on issues like encouraging economic growth, promoting democracy abroad and fighting disease in Africa through his public policy institute. He spends a lot of time with war veterans, hosting long "wounded warrior" bicycle rides across Texas.
 Along the way, he raised more than $500 million for his presidential center, which will occupy 23 acres on the campus of Southern Methodist University here and will host the institute, library and museum. After an April 25 dedication ceremony, the library and museum will open to the public on May 1.
 In the interview, Mr. Bush expressed no regrets and said his record would stand the test of time. While "nobody likes to be criticized all the time," he dismissed the attacks that continue to this day. "I'm comfortable with what I did," he said. "I'm comfortable with who I am." He added, "Much of my presidency was defined by things that you didn't necessarily want to have happen."
 The library debut will follow shortly the debut of the next generation of his family. Margaret Laura Hager, named after her two grandmothers and called Mila, arrived at 6 pounds 15 ounces. The "Today" show on NBC, where Jenna Hager works as a correspondent, aired family pictures on Monday morning showing George and Laura Bush with the new baby and her parents.
 In one of the pictures, Mr. Bush, in a blue sweater over a light blue shirt, cradles Mila swathed in a baby blanket and wearing a baby cap as Mrs. Bush leans over with her arm around him.
 "We are elated," the former president said in a statement over the weekend.

HEADLINE: Price of Gold Takes a Flashy Fall; Other Markets Follow

BYLINE: NATHANIEL POPPER


HIGHLIGHT: Gold prices tumbled 9 percent on Monday, the sharpest drop in 30 years, as stocks and other commodities also felt the impact of a disappointing report on Chinese growth. 

 BODY:
 9:02 p.m. | Updated 
Gold prices tumbled 9 percent on Monday, the sharpest drop in 30 years, heightening fears that investors' faith in the safe haven has been shattered.
The steep fall in gold, after a slump on Friday, led a broader sell-off in commodities and stock markets. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 2.3 percent - its sharpest one-day decline since early November. Crude oil prices fell to under $90 a barrel, and copper dropped to a 17-month low.
 The catalyst was disappointment over Chinese growth, which has been a bright spot in a global economy marred by uneven recoveries and Europe's persistent debt problems. 
A report on Monday showed that Chinese economic growth unexpectedly slowed to an annual pace of 7.7 percent in the first months of the year, from 7.9 percent at the end of 2012, suggesting that China's demand for industrial materials would soften. 
Weak regional manufacturing data in the United States also weighed on the United States stock market, as did the explosions in Boston later in the day. 
Still it was gold that took the market spotlight on Monday. 
The price of the metal has been undergoing an extraordinary reversal from a decade-long rally. Since reaching a high of $1,888 an ounce in August 2011, gold has been on a downward slope. The decline picked up pace on Friday, when gold fell 4 percent, officially taking it into a bear market, which is defined as a 20 percent drop from its recent high. 
The damage worsened on Monday, when the price of an ounce of gold dropped 9.35 percent, or $140.40, to $1,360.60 for the April contract - the sharpest such one-day decline since February of 1983. 
A number of banks, including Goldman Sachs, have recently lowered their forecasts for gold. But the recent drop has been greater than even the most pessimistic predictions. 
"We've traded gold for nearly four decades and we've never ... ever... EVER... seen anything like what we've witnessed in the past two trading sessions," Dennis Gartman, a closely followed gold investor, wrote to clients on Monday. 
The shift in gold's fortunes presents a moment of reckoning for many so-called gold bugs, who had expected their financial lodestar to continue moving up in response to the Federal Reserve's effort to stimulate the economy through bond-buying programs. 
The assumption among gold bugs was that the flood of new money would cause inflation, making hard assets like gold more attractive. So far, though, there have been few signs of inflation taking root even as central banks in Japan and Europe have begun their own aggressive bond-buying programs. 
"Gold has had all the reason in the world to be moving higher - but it hasn't been able to do it," said Matt Zeman, a metals trader at Kingsview Financial. "The situation has not deteriorated the way that a lot of people thought it could."
The recent drop in gold prices has been partly attributed to signals from powerful members of the Fed that the central bank may begin to wind down its bond-buying programs. But the list of reasons to sell gold grows longer by the day. European politicians have indicated that Cyprus may need to sell off some of its gold holdings to pay for its bank bailout, which could lead other countries to do the same. 
The market decline, like the decade-long run-up, has also been attributed to the new financial instruments that have made buying gold easier for a wide array of investors. The most prominent products are gold exchange-traded funds, which can be traded on stock exchanges, and which together hold as much gold as all but a few of the world's largest central banks. 
Hedge funds have used gold E.T.F.'s to gain exposure to the precious metal, but have been selling them off en masse in recent weeks. The largest such exchange-traded fund, with the ticker symbol GLD, had its most active day ever on Monday. 
"The exits are only so wide and there are too many people trying to leave all of the sudden," said Bart Melek, a commodity strategist at TD Securities. 
Many gold analysts have said that the demand for physical gold is stronger than the demand for financial products linked to gold, like exchange-traded funds and futures contracts. But this has not been enough to prop up the market. 
On Monday, the most obvious catalyst for the carnage was the disappointing Chinese economic data that led to talk that China will no longer need the same physical resources to expand. 
In the commodities world, this did not hurt only gold. Silver dropped over 12 percent, platinum 5.6 percent and the benchmark oil contract was down 3.9 percent. Stock indexes fell 1.5 percent in Japan and 0.6 percent in England. 
The S.& P. 500 dropped 2.3 percent, or 36.49 points, to 1,552.36 on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 1.8 percent, or 265.86 points, at 14,599.20. The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.4 percent, or 78.46 points, to 3,216.49. 
In the bond market, interest rates fell as investors shifted their money to less risky assets. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 9/32, to 10226/32, while its yield dropped to 1.69 percent, from 1.72 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Nathan Azrin Dies at 82; Changed the Field of Behavioral Psychology

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
When Dr. Nathan Azrin was appointed director of treatment development at Anna State Hospital in Illinois in 1958, a majority of the patients he was expected to treat were schizophrenic, emotionally withdrawn and in many cases mute after years in institutions. Few bothered getting dressed, spending their days in hospital gowns.
Getting his patients to dress, Dr. Azrin decided, would be his first treatment. 
The system that he and a colleague developed for doing that -- a bartering process that they described as ''token economics'' -- not only persuaded Anna State's residents to get dressed every day, but also changed the way psychologists approached behavior-changing techniques across a wide spectrum of human experience. It has been used in treatments for autism, couples therapy, military training, employee supervision, prisoner management, special education, athletic coaching and consumer marketing.
Dr. Azrin, who died on March 29 in Pompano Beach, Fla., at 82, did not invent the principles that he and the colleague, Dr. Teodoro Ayllon, applied in their work at Anna State, in Anna, Ill. The ideas were developed by Dr. Azrin's mentor at Harvard, the behavioral pioneer B. F. Skinner, working mainly with rats. But he was among the first psychologists to show that human behavior could be changed in much the same way as Skinner had changed that of rats.
Dr. Azrin and Dr. Ayllon laid out their evidence in 1968 in ''The Token Economy,'' which is considered one of behavior psychology's foundational texts.
Dr. Azrin received far more attention for a book he wrote in 1974 with Dr. Richard M. Foxx, applying token economics to the behavior modification everybody has heard of. That book, ''Toilet Training in Less Than a Day,'' sold more than three million copies. Some of its advice about conditioning children was criticized as overly harsh.
In a review in The New York Times, the psychologist Eda LeShan wrote of the method: ''Although one is supposed to be kind and patient, it's all done by forcing fluids (with things like salty potato chips and orange soda) and conditioned reflexes, leaving out such minor considerations as fears and fantasies, love-hate feelings, dependency and rebellion -- the whole unconscious, which we have been struggling so hard to understand. It is an immoral book.''
But the less controversial, and less known, ''Token Economy,'' written for a professional readership, had the more profound influence.
''It would be difficult to name a population that wasn't affected by his work -- the young, the old, the professional athlete, the developmentally disabled,'' said Dr. Alan Kazdin, a former president of the American Psychological Association and a professor of psychology and child psychiatry at Yale.
In Dr. Azrin's token economy, people barter for rewards, or tokens, by modifying their behavior in incremental steps. He and Dr. Ayllon introduced the system to female patients at Anna State, giving them plastic tokens, each embossed with the words ''one gift.'' The reward system included a token-operated television and a token-operated turnstile installed at the entrance to the television room. Patients earned one or more tokens for dressing themselves, the number depending on the level of care they showed in their dress.
Eventually most patients were dressing themselves, some were doing simple household chores and a few were running a kind of token-exchange store on the ward, offering special items like lipstick and hair rollers.
''These patients had previously been regarded as deranged, incapable of learning,'' Dr. Ayllon said in an interview on Thursday. ''Yet they learned the system rather quickly.''
At first, some wore their undergarments over their clothing. By awarding more tokens for dressing properly than for dressing bizarrely, Dr. Ayllon said, those patients soon corrected their mistake.
Dr. Azrin believed that any behavior could be modified once it was understood as a chain of component parts. ''To get someone dressed, for example, requires putting on a shirt,'' Dr. Azrin said in a recent interview. ''But first, the person must reach for the shirt. And before that, the person must get up and go toward it. And even more basically, you need to say to the person, 'Look at me,' and get them to make eye contact.''
Nathan Harold Azrin was born on Nov. 26, 1930, in Boston, the son of Harry Azrin, a grocer, and the former Esther Alper. He graduated from Boston University in 1951 and received a Ph.D. in psychology from Harvard in 1956.
After beginning his research in Boston, he was appointed a professor of psychology at Southern Illinois University and research director in the Illinois Department of Mental Health. From 1958 to 1980 he was the director of treatment at Anna State Hospital, now known as Choate Mental Health and Development Center.
He was a professor of psychology at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., from 1980 until 2010, when he was named a professor emeritus. He retired last month. His son David said his death was caused by complications of cancer.
Besides David, his survivors include his wife, Victoria; a daughter, Rachel Azrin; two other sons, Michael and Richard; seven grandchildren; three sisters, Violet Baker, Dorothy Marden and Gertrude Drobnis; and a brother, Morris.
For all the scholarship behind the work -- he published scores of research articles and a half-dozen books, and edited many scientific journals -- Dr. Azrin said behavior modification was actually quite easy to achieve.
''It seems ridiculously simple, but once you're aware of how your habit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you're halfway to changing it,'' he said. ''It seems like it should be more complex. The truth is, the brain can be reprogrammed. You just have to be deliberate about it.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Justice? Try the Courtroom, Not the Line Outside

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Dale Carpenter wanted to see last month's pair of same-sex marriage arguments at the Supreme Court. He bought a plane ticket from Minneapolis, where he teaches law, and he turned up at the court a little after 3 o'clock on the morning of the first argument.
Professor Carpenter's first surprise on that cold night was that most of the people in front of him in line were not waiting to get in. They were ''line standers'' who had been paid to hold places for others. 
''Many of them seemed to be homeless or very poor,'' Professor Carpenter said. ''It seemed very shady to me.''
The going rate, he learned, was about $50 an hour, some of which went to a company that had made the arrangements. Such place holding is common at Congressional hearings and is on the rise at the Supreme Court, where seats for last month's arguments went for as much as $6,000.
Michael J. Sandel, a political philosopher at Harvard, said the phenomenon was disturbing.
''Allowing line-standing companies and scalpers to sell seats in the Supreme Court is yet another instance of letting money dominate democracy,'' he said. ''It's at odds with equal access and undermines the dignity of the court.''
There are two lines for Supreme Court arguments, one for the public and one for members of the court's bar. Professor Carpenter was a member of the bar, and so he chose the shorter line.
Membership in the Supreme Court bar sounds like a high distinction, but it is not. All it takes is a check for $200, three years of law practice and the endorsements of two current members of the bar.
More than 200,000 lawyers have satisfied those requirements. Vanishingly few of them will ever argue before the justices.
In effect, Professor Carpenter had joined a fan club little different from the ones that let you get good seats at a rock concert. At the Supreme Court, too, the best seats are set aside for members of its bar.
''I paid the $200 just to get into the line,'' Professor Carpenter said.
The scene outside the court troubled Suzanne B. Goldberg, a law professor at Columbia and member of the Supreme Court bar.
''I had never heard of paid line standers before, and I had been to all of the major gay rights arguments in the past two decades,'' she said, adding that she had reluctantly used a line-standing service to see the second of the two same-sex marriage arguments last month.
''Particularly for the public line,'' she said, ''allowing line standers privileges people who can pay or law firms and businesses that can. I wish the court would find better ways to handle the situation.''
Professor Carpenter made it into the courtroom for the first same-sex marriage argument, on March 26, but it was close. He got to court earlier for the second one the next day, arriving at 2:15 a.m. That time, though, he encountered a new phenomenon: Washington's toniest lawyers were cutting the line.
They would arrive in groups of two or three and take the place of a single line stander, Professor Carpenter said. ''We had no authority to appeal to,'' he said. ''It was a state of nature.''
For that second argument, Professor Carpenter made it only as far as a lounge reserved for lawyers, though it did have an audio feed. (There is no similar overflow room for the public.)
There are about 400 seats in the courtroom, but many of them are set aside for guests of the justices and for the news media. For the first argument, there were 105 seats available for members of the bar and about 70 for the public, said Kathleen Arberg, the court's public information officer. On the next day, there were 78 seats for members of the bar and about 70 for the public. Another 30 seats each day were set aside for people who rotated through for a three- to five-minute glimpse of an argument.
The demand for seats, in other words, far exceeded the supply, and the court basically let the marketplace allocate this scarce and valuable public commodity. What else might it have done?
One obvious partial solution would have been to allow live broadcasts of the arguments. That would have dampened but not eliminated the demand for seats. People still want to go to televised baseball games.
The second thing the court could have done is police the lines. ''Just having a uniformed person walk around would help,'' Professor Carpenter said. ''I don't think it would take a lot. Even just minimal monitoring would have an effect.''
Line cutting aside, many economists say the current system works just fine and allocates the available seats efficiently. In his book ''What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets,'' Professor Sandel wrote that line-standing arrangements might well be acceptable on libertarian and utilitarian grounds.
But he added that the arrangements also corrupt, in the broader sense of the word. ''To corrupt a good or social practice is to degrade it, to treat it according to a lower mode of valuation than is appropriate to it,'' he wrote.
Put another way: A Supreme Court argument over the meaning of equality is a grave and weighty moment in the history of the nation. It is not a Van Halen concert.
There are, of course, many steps the court could take to manage the lines. Lotteries, wristbands and nontransferable tickets linked to government-issued identification come to mind.
However it is accomplished, Professor Carpenter said, only people who actually stand in line should be allowed to sit in the courtroom.
I asked him if he would ever pay for a seat if the rules do not change. ''Depends on the price,'' he said.

HEADLINE: As Citigroup's Profit Surges, Skittish Borrowers Hurt the Consumer Unit

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
8:34 p.m. | Updated
Citigroup beat earnings expectations on Monday as net income surged by 30 percent in the first quarter of 2013. But beneath the banner results, the bank is grappling with a sluggish economy and skittish American consumers who are still wary of shouldering fresh debt.
The bank, which has been aggressively working to slash costs and slog through a glut of soured assets, reported a profit of $3.8 billion, or $1.23 a share, for the first quarter. Revenue rose by 3 percent to $20.5 billion. 
Still, Citigroup's results were dampened by largely stagnant revenue growth in the consumer banking unit and persistent difficulties in Asia and Latin America. One challenge: the United States consumer.
Borrowers are still unwilling to take on new loans, even with interest rates hovering at near-record lows.
''I don't think we've got a real strong consumer driving the economy,'' John Gerspach, the bank's chief financial officer said on a conference call on Monday. He added that ''we are seeing a certain amount of deleveraging.''
For Stephanie Sanyour, 25, ''deleveraging'' felt like a tremendous relief. Ms. Sanyour, a television producer who lives in Des Moines, said she had devoted an entire paycheck this month to wiping out her debt on a Citigroup credit card. While the monthly payments were manageable, she said that the debt felt like a ''chain on my ankles limiting my flexibility.''
Across the nation, banking analysts say, consumers like Ms. Sanyour are working to pay off their bills and stay out of debt. Such a tepid appetite for loans underpinned Citigroup's results on Monday. While total loans inched up slightly in the first quarter to $539 billion, the bulk of the growth stemmed from demand among corporate clients beyond the United States. Consumer lending rose just 1 percent in the first quarter. In North America, revenue in the global banking unit stagnated, falling by 1 percent to $5.1 billion.
''The environment remains challenging and we are sure to be tested as we go through the year,'' Michael L. Corbat, the bank's chief executive, said in the earnings release.
Citigroup's quarterly earnings underscore broader challenges buffeting the United States banking industry. On Friday, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo reported declines in revenue, slowed in part by mortgage machines that are beginning to sputter. The refinancing boom, fed by federal largess that drove down interest rates and spurred a flurry of refinancings, is showing signs of petering out.
Combined with Citi's earnings Monday, the results are propelling worries that banks are floundering to offset income sapped by a spate of new financial regulations and a lackluster economy. Sluggish loan demand is renewing those concerns. Jamie Dimon, the influential chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan, called loan growth ''soft'' for the quarter when the bank reported earnings on Friday.
Beyond the banking results, other indicators of economic health have proved dispiriting as well. Retail sales in the United States fell by 0.4 percent in March. Even though unemployment is falling, consumers remain unconvinced.
Part of the wariness among consumers, banking analysts say, arises from broad skepticism about the housing market. Even though housing prices have been rising recently, the improvements won't rouse consumers until they remain steadily high for a longer stretch, according to analysts. ''If housing prices start to stall even a little bit, then we are going to see an even greater retreat from consumers,'' said J. J. Kinahan, a strategist at TD Ameritrade.
Even bank executives are skeptical about the housing market in the United States. ''I wouldn't say I am positive about the housing market,'' Mr. Gerspach said.
Citigroup has pinned some of its hope for future profitability on its vast international footprint, but some regions produced lackluster returns. Revenue from consumer banking in Asia fell in the first quarter to $2 billion, down 1 percent from the same period a year earlier. The bank is struggling to navigate the shifting regulatory landscape in Asia. In South Korea, for example, national officials placed a cap on the interest rates of a range of consumer loans. Mr. Gerspach said that there were ''still headwinds'' in the region.
Despite the challenges, Citigroup showed strengths in other parts of its business. A bright spot in the first quarter was the securities and banking group, which was bolstered by strong gains in investment banking, fixed income and equities.
Revenue in that unit surged 31 percent, to $6.98 billion, while net income was $2.3 billion, up 81 percent from the period a year earlier. For Citigroup, the unit has been a consistent focus. Mr. Gerspach reiterated that on Monday, saying the bank continued to make ''steady progress'' in its share of a ''client's wallet.''
Much of the gains in securities and banking came from Citigroup's investment banking unit, which was buoyed by increases in debt and equity underwriting. The unit's revenue increased to $1.1 billion, up 22 percent from the period a year earlier.
Over all, investors seemed pleased with the quarterly results. Citigroup's stock rose 9 cents to $44.87 on Monday, after trading in the morning above $46, on a day when there was wide selling in the stock market.
The quarterly report is the second under the leadership of Mr. Corbat, who took over after the abrupt ouster of Vikram S. Pandit. In October, Michael E. O'Neill, the bank's forceful chairman, pushed Mr. Pandit out in favor of Mr. Corbat.
Mr. Corbat has vowed to continue reorienting the bank toward its core business while shedding less-profitable units. That cost-cutting began under Mr. Pandit, who helped return the bank to profitability after presiding over a turbulent chapter in its history when Citi received a $45 billion federal lifeline.
Citigroup has been aggressively whittling down a morass of soured loans and cutting less-profitable business lines to reduce costs. In December, it said it would eliminate 11,000 jobs worldwide. Within its Citi Holdings unit, Citigroup reduced assets by $60 billion in the first quarter.
Citigroup continues to be haunted by its mortgage woes. Last month, it agreed to pay $730 million to settle claims that it had persuaded investors to buy securities backed by shaky mortgage loans. The bank did not admit any wrongdoing. Cautioning investors on Monday, Mr. Gerspach said that legal expenses remained ''volatile.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Path to Growth Splits Europe, With Austerity A Central Issue

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY. 
Andrew Ross Sorkin, whose DealBook column normally appears on this page, is on vacation.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the last year, the International Monetary Fund has performed a major reassessment of how it thinks austerity harms a weak, financially troubled economy. But while warning of the perils of slow growth, it still often insists on austerity for just such economies.
The tension between those realities will be on full display in Washington this week, as top economic officials from around the world gather for the spring meetings of the monetary fund and its sister institution, the World Bank. Once again, sluggish growth in advanced economies, and in particular the unfurling economic and fiscal afflictions in the euro zone, will be the central topic of discussion. 
Political and economic officials agree that most countries, particularly in Europe, desperately need more growth. But they remain sharply divided on how to get it. Officials strongly influenced by the Great Depression thinking of John Maynard Keynes, including some from Europe, want an easing of austerity measures, more expansionary monetary policies and even some stimulus. But powerful northern European officials, including those from Germany, have argued that balanced budgets and fiscal consolidation are prerequisites for restoring sustainable growth.
In a somewhat dissonant posture, the monetary fund has split the difference: reassessing its views on austerity, pushing strongly for aggressive measures to bolster growth but all without repudiating its existing programs.
''We believe that for most European countries, fiscal consolidation is a must, simply given the level of debt,'' said Christine Lagarde, the monetary fund's managing director, speaking in New York this month. But she qualified that statement by saying that not all cuts need to be ''brutal or abrupt or massively front-loaded.'' She added, ''There is a balance to be had between how much is called for and how much is tolerable.''
Economic fortunes during the recovery from the Great Recession have diverged, with new estimates of growth by the monetary fund expected on Tuesday. But they will not change the basic picture, which Ms. Lagarde has taken to describing as a ''three-speed'' world. Developing and emerging economies are growing apace. Some advanced economies, including the United States, are gaining strength.
But a third category of countries remains mired in stagnation or recession. Japan has struggled with a stalled-out economy, but has recently engaged in an athletic campaign of fiscal and monetary stimulus. The true laggard is Europe, suffering from rising unemployment and another bout of economic contraction -- seemingly without the political consensus or economic mechanisms to tackle those problems.
''The European Union's precrisis growth performance was disappointing enough, but the performance has been even more dismal since the onset of the crisis,'' the European research group Bruegel concluded in a recent report, saying weak growth is undermining efforts to reduce debt and fueling bank fragility, all while skills erode for the unemployed. ''Low overall growth is making it much tougher for the hard-hit economies in southern Europe to recover competitiveness and regain control of their public finances.''
Bruegel concluded that a failure to turn things around might render Europe's social contract ''unsustainable.''
In light of that reality, the monetary fund and its European partners, the European Commission and the European Central Bank -- the so-called troika -- have come under continued criticism for the austerity measures imposed on countries including Spain, Portugal and Greece, where unemployment rates extend well into the double digits. The criticism has become louder since the fund said it had determined that austerity had a far worse impact on weak economies than it once thought.
That assessment came in the form of a highly technical analysis of what economists term ''fiscal multipliers'' -- essentially, a measure of how changes in a government budget affect growth at a given time. At the urging of the monetary fund's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, its research division last year started to investigate why the fund had overestimated rates of growth for some countries and underestimated them for others.
The researchers found that the multiplier used to forecast growth rates had not magnified the impact of government spending policies enough: Both austerity and stimulus had proved stronger-than-expected medicine.
''It was wrong, ex-post, but it was not crazy,'' Mr. Blanchard said of the multiplier the fund had used during the global recession. It ''might still be the right number in a normal environment,'' he said during an interview in late January. ''But in the past three years, and presumably the next two or three at least, we should use higher numbers.''
The fund's assessment stirred major controversy in the rarefied world of international economics. Believers in austerity derided the analysis and picked it apart. Other commentators argued it constituted a mea culpa -- an admission that the fund's own policies, deployed across the euro periphery, were wrong.
But Mr. Blanchard stood by the numbers, and dismissed that analysis. ''One of the unpleasant aspects of what happened is that we kept revising forecasts of growth in the euro periphery down,'' he said. ''Part of it, though not all of it, is due to the fact that we just underestimated the effect of fiscal consolidation.
''I don't like to be wrong systematically,'' Mr. Blanchard continued. ''But if we had better forecasts, would we have had very different programs? I suspect the honest truth is that, because of financing constraints, probably only at the margin.''
Political and financing constraints continue to plague the euro rescue plans. Moreover, the monetary fund is only one partner in the troika, experts noted.
''When you look at the I.M.F., you can't consider it truly a technocratic organization making decisions based only on the economics,'' said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the fund. ''You've got to see it working in a political setting, and it can't go in its own direction against the will of its major shareholders.''
But the monetary fund and its international partners, including some in Europe, have pushed strongly for more expansionary policies in the stronger countries of Europe to counter austerity in the periphery. The fund and the United States, among others, intend to continue that push at the coming spring meetings.
Policies have been proposed to help promote growth across the euro zone and thus around the world. They include more monetary stimulus, pushing for higher wages in Germany, and shaking up rigid labor markets.
''The best way to create jobs is through growth,'' Ms. Lagarde said in her New York speech, underscoring the human costs of the crisis. ''This must come first.''

HEADLINE: Price of Gold Takes Flashy Fall; Other Markets Follow

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
9:02 p.m. | Updated
Gold prices tumbled 9 percent on Monday, the sharpest drop in 30 years, heightening fears that investors' faith in the safe haven has been shattered.
The steep fall in gold, after a slump on Friday, led a broader sell-off in commodities and stock markets. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 2.3 percent -- its sharpest one-day decline since early November. Crude oil prices fell to under $90 a barrel, and copper dropped to a 17-month low.
The catalyst was disappointment over Chinese growth, which has been a bright spot in a global economy marred by uneven recoveries and Europe's persistent debt problems. 
A report on Monday showed that Chinese economic growth unexpectedly slowed to an annual pace of 7.7 percent in the first months of the year, from 7.9 percent at the end of 2012, suggesting that China's demand for industrial materials would soften.
Weak regional manufacturing data in the United States also weighed on the United States stock market, as did the explosions in Boston later in the day.
Still it was gold that took the market spotlight on Monday.
The price of the metal has been undergoing an extraordinary reversal from a decade-long rally. Since reaching a high of $1,888 an ounce in August 2011, gold has been on a downward slope. The decline picked up pace on Friday, when gold fell 4 percent, officially taking it into a bear market, which is defined as a 20 percent drop from its recent high.
The damage worsened on Monday, when the price of an ounce of gold dropped 9.35 percent, or $140.40, to $1,360.60 for the April contract -- the sharpest such one-day decline since February of 1983.
A number of banks, including Goldman Sachs, have recently lowered their forecasts for gold. But the recent drop has been greater than even the most pessimistic predictions.
''We've traded gold for nearly four decades and we've never ... ever... EVER... seen anything like what we've witnessed in the past two trading sessions,'' Dennis Gartman, a closely followed gold investor, wrote to clients on Monday.
The shift in gold's fortunes presents a moment of reckoning for many so-called gold bugs, who had expected their financial lodestar to continue moving up in response to the Federal Reserve's effort to stimulate the economy through bond-buying programs.
The assumption among gold bugs was that the flood of new money would cause inflation, making hard assets like gold more attractive. So far, though, there have been few signs of inflation taking root even as central banks in Japan and Europe have begun their own aggressive bond-buying programs.
''Gold has had all the reason in the world to be moving higher -- but it hasn't been able to do it,'' said Matt Zeman, a metals trader at Kingsview Financial. ''The situation has not deteriorated the way that a lot of people thought it could.''
The recent drop in gold prices has been partly attributed to signals from powerful members of the Fed that the central bank may begin to wind down its bond-buying programs. But the list of reasons to sell gold grows longer by the day. European politicians have indicated that Cyprus may need to sell off some of its gold holdings to pay for its bank bailout, which could lead other countries to do the same.
The market decline, like the decade-long run-up, has also been attributed to the new financial instruments that have made buying gold easier for a wide array of investors. The most prominent products are gold exchange-traded funds, which can be traded on stock exchanges, and which together hold as much gold as all but a few of the world's largest central banks.
Hedge funds have used gold E.T.F.'s to gain exposure to the precious metal, but have been selling them off en masse in recent weeks. The largest such exchange-traded fund, with the ticker symbol GLD, had its most active day ever on Monday.
''The exits are only so wide and there are too many people trying to leave all of the sudden,'' said Bart Melek, a commodity strategist at TD Securities.
Many gold analysts have said that the demand for physical gold is stronger than the demand for financial products linked to gold, like exchange-traded funds and futures contracts. But this has not been enough to prop up the market.
On Monday, the most obvious catalyst for the carnage was the disappointing Chinese economic data that led to talk that China will no longer need the same physical resources to expand.
In the commodities world, this did not hurt only gold. Silver dropped over 12 percent, platinum 5.6 percent and the benchmark oil contract was down 3.9 percent. Stock indexes fell 1.5 percent in Japan and 0.6 percent in England.
The S.& P. 500 dropped 2.3 percent, or 36.49 points, to 1,552.36 on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 1.8 percent, or 265.86 points, at 14,599.20. The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.4 percent, or 78.46 points, to 3,216.49.
In the bond market, interest rates fell as investors shifted their money to less risky assets. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 9/32, to 10226/32, while its yield dropped to 1.69 percent, from 1.72 percent late Friday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Dangerous Price of Ignoring Syria

BYLINE: By VALI NASR

 BODY:
President Obama has doggedly resisted American involvement in Syria. The killing of over 70,000 people and the plight of over a million refugees have elicited sympathy from the White House but not much more. That is because Syria challenges a central aim of Obama's foreign policy: shrinking the U.S. footprint in the Middle East and downplaying the region's importance to global politics. Doing more on Syria would reverse the U.S. retreat from the region.
Since the beginning of Obama's first term, the administration's stance as events unfolded in the Middle East has been wholly reactive. This ''lean back and wait'' approach has squandered precious opportunity to influence the course of events in the Middle East. There has been no strategy for capitalizing on the opportunity that the Arab Spring presented, or for containing its fallout -- the Syrian crisis being the worst case to date. The president rewarded Burmese generals with a six-hour visit for their willingness to embrace reform, but he has not visited a single Arab country that went through the Arab Spring. 
Obama sees Syria as a tragic humanitarian crisis without obvious strategic implications for the United States. ''How do I weigh tens of thousands who've been killed in Syria versus the tens of thousands who are currently being killed in the Congo?'' he asked in a New Republic interview in January. When the president visited the region last month he chose to focus on the Arab-Israeli peace process rather than Syria. The peace process is now at the top of Secretary of State John Kerry's agenda.
The plight of Palestinians is a perennial concern, but it is in Syria that the future of the region hangs in the balance. Choosing the peace process over Syria underscores not the administration's interest in the Middle East but its determination to look past it.
Washington has wasted precious time in using diplomatic, economic and military levers to influence the course of events in Syria. That neglect has allowed the conflagration to rage at great human cost, radicalizing the opposition and putting at risk U.S. allies across the region.
America cannot and should not decide the fate of the Middle East, but it should be clear about its stakes there, and not shy away from efforts to at least nudge events in more favorable directions as this critical region faces momentous choices. A ''lean back and wait'' posture toward unfolding events is dangerous.
The paroxysm of violence in Syria is expected to kill tens of thousands more and produce as many as three million refugees by the year's end. That is a humanitarian tragedy to be sure, but one with immediate strategic consequences. American insouciance in the face of that devastation is fomenting anti-Americanism. The waves of refugees will constitute an unstable population that will be a breeding ground for extremism and in turn destabilize the countries where they take refuge. Syria's neighbors are not equipped to deal with a humanitarian disaster on this scale.
The longer the devastation goes on the more difficult it will be to put Syria back together, and failing to do so will leave a dangerous morass in the heart of the Middle East, a failed state at war with itself where extremism and instability will fester and all manner of terrorists and Al Qaeda affiliates will find ample space, resources and recruits to menace the region and world.
Worse yet, the conflict in Syria could spill over its borders. Syria has become ground zero in a broader conflict that pits Shiites against Sunnis and shapes the larger regional competition for power between Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Syria's paroxysms if allowed to drag on could potentially spread far and wide and even change the map of the region. America may think it does not have any interests in Syria, but it has interests everywhere the Syrian conflict touches.
Lebanon and Iraq are each deeply divided along sectarian lines, and both countries teeter on a knife's edge as tensions rise between their ascendant Shiite populations who fear a setback if Bashar al-Assad falls, and the minority Sunnis in their own countries who support Syria's Sunni-led opposition. Sectarian tensions stretch from Lebanon and Iraq through the Gulf countries of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain and on to Pakistan where sectarian violence has exploded into the open.
It is time America takes the lead in organizing international assistance to refugees. America should not hide behind the Russian veto. It should pursue a concerted diplomatic strategy in support of arming the rebels and imposing a no-flight zone over Syria. That would not only hamper Assad's ability to fight, it would allow refugees to remain within Syria's borders, thus reducing pressure on neighboring countries.
It is time the U.S. took over from Qatar and Saudi Arabia in organizing the Syrian opposition into a credible political force -- failure to do that accounts for the chaos that has paralyzed the group. There are powerful economic sanctions that the U.S. could use to cripple the Assad regime.
Finally, America should build ties with the Free Syrian Army with the goal of denying extremist groups the ability to dominate the armed resistance and gaining influence with groups that will dominate Syria's future. It was failing to build those ties in Afghanistan that allowed the resistance groups who opposed the Soviet Union to disintegrate into the Taliban and Al Qaeda.
The Syrian crisis has become a Gordian knot that cannot be easily disentangled. As daunting as the crisis looks, there is a cost to inaction -- in human suffering, regional instability and damage to America's global standing. And as the Syrian crisis escalates, America and the world will only rediscover their stakes in the Middle East. If Obama truly wants to pivot away from the Middle East then he has to help end the bloodletting in Syria.

HEADLINE: Iceland and China Enter a Free Trade Agreement

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- In its first such agreement with a European country, China signed a free-trade deal with Iceland on Monday as Beijing reached out for allies at a time when many of its trading partners are wary of its increasing economic might. 
The accord, meant to eliminate most tariffs over the next few years, was signed by trade officials in Beijing during a state visit by Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir of Iceland. When completed, it will unite two hugely mismatched economies: Iceland's 2011 gross domestic product of $14 billion was little more than a rounding error in China's G.D.P. that year of $7.3 trillion.
Trade between the countries is small by global standards. Iceland's exports to China last year, mainly fish, totaled $61 million, while it imported Chinese goods and services valued at $341 million.
But while Iceland cannot offer much in the way of significant new market growth, it could help China in its quest for more influence in the Arctic, as global warming and polar ice retreat make that area increasingly accessible. China is seeking to join the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental body that promotes cooperation in the region, as a permanent observer.
Iceland, though not a member of the European Union, enjoys access to the single market through its membership in the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area. But China would not gain backdoor access to the European market through the trade deal. Iceland had been negotiating membership but suspended talks in January amid widespread domestic opposition. John Clancy, a spokesman in Brussels for the European trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht, said Iceland would have to terminate all of its bilateral trade deals were it eventually to join the bloc.
The two governments also issued a joint statement Wednesday calling for new bilateral cooperation on ''human rights, gender equality, labor issues, Arctic affairs, as well as cooperation on geothermal development, culture, education and tourism.''
With the Doha Round of talks under the World Trade Organization largely moribund, some nations have been seeking partnerships below the global level. At present, there are two giant trade deals under discussion, both pivoting on the United States: the Trans-Pacific Partnership being negotiated between Washington and a host of Asia-Pacific nations, and a comprehensive trade and investment agreement with the European Union.
China is party to neither the Trans-Pacific Partnership nor the negotiations between Europe and the United States, leading some officials and trade analysts to see the proposals as being meant to ''contain'' China's increasing power in global commerce.
The accord Wednesday also comes at a time when China's designs on its North Atlantic ally have been put under a microscope, after the construction of an outsize Chinese Embassy in Reykjavik, and the puzzling effort of a Chinese billionaire to build a luxury hotel and golf course in a vast Icelandic wilderness area.

HEADLINE: Wall Street and Gold Extend Decline

BYLINE: By VICTORIA SHANNON

 BODY:
The prices of stocks and gold appeared to chase each other sharply lower on Monday after a report said growth unexpectedly slowed in China.
The stall in the rise of the world's second-largest economy pushed Wall Street's broadest stock index down 2.3 percent by the close of trading and put heavy selling pressure on gold, oil and other commodities. 
The price of gold, which has been steadily drifting lower since the worst of the Great Recession passed, dropped another 9 percent Monday after a 5 percent drop on Friday. The market price of an ounce of gold ended trading in New York at a multiyear low; the April contract closed at $1,360.60, down $140.40.
Stocks, too, were continuing a pullback that began Friday after a report on falling retail sales for March. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slumped 2.3 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.8 percent -- more than 260 points -- and the Nasdaq composite index lost 2.4 percent.
''None of the economic data has been very good for the last couple of weeks,'' said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vt., told Reuters. ''I wouldn't say this is over yet, but there are enough indicators out there to really indicate that investors should approach this market with a degree of caution which doesn't seem to exist right now.''
China's economy expanded 7.7 percent in the first quarter, according to a government report. While that would be far above most industrial economies, it fell well short of forecasts for an increase of 8 percent and slowed from 7.9 percent during the final quarter of 2012.
Analysts described the data variously as ''a big disappointment'' and a ''truckload of unpleasant surprises.'' The Chinese economy finally began to pick up steam toward the end of last year. The data released Monday, however, suggested that the gradual recovery was proving more fragile than most analysts had expected.
Other preciious metals were hit by heavy selling: Silver fell to its lowest since October 2010, platinum to its weakest since August and palladium to a three-month low. And crude oil was off 1.8 percent in New York trading to $89.69 after a 2 percent drop Friday.

HEADLINE: To Reinvigorate Production, Alaska Grants a Tax Break to Oil Companies

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
Hoping to reverse two decades of declining oil production in Alaska, the State Legislature in Juneau has granted oil companies an estimated $750 million in annual tax relief to increase investment in the giant North Slope oil field.
The tax change, approved on Sunday, was a major victory for Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and BP, which had lobbied for years to repeal a tax system put in place by former Gov. Sarah Palin in 2007 that made state oil taxes among the highest in the nation. The companies have long claimed that high operating costs and taxes in Alaska encouraged them to move their investment dollars to other states with lower tax rates, like Texas and North Dakota, where oil and gas exploration and production have been booming in new shale fields.
The Alaskan economy runs on crude; about a third of employment is dedicated to the oil industry. The state receives so much royalty and other oil tax money that there is no need for a state sales tax or income tax, and residents receive checks from the Alaska Permanent Fund, a corporation largely financed by oil revenue, that roughly totals $5,000 a year for a family of four. 
But that largess is at risk. Since Alaska's oil production peaked in 1988 at 2.02 million barrels a day, the state's output has steadily dropped. Over the last two years, production has declined to 526,000 barrels a day, from 600,000, even as national production has risen by more than a million barrels a day.
The new tax will impose a flat 35 percent rate on the oil companies' net profits and establish a series of credits and incentives that drive the rate down. This replaces the previous 25 percent base tax, which rose progressively higher as oil prices increased. The new effective tax rate could be as low as 14 percent, according to state officials.
''We are signaling to the world that Alaska is back,'' Gov. Sean R. Parnell said in a statement, ''ready to compete and ready to supply more energy once again.''
Some energy experts caution, however, that it remains uncertain whether the tax change can lift investment and production since offshore exploration still faces regulatory hurdles and efforts to revive aging oil fields on the North Slope will be expensive.
The Alaskan Department of Revenue has projected that the legislation will lower oil taxes by at least $3.5 billion over the next five years, although changes in oil prices and production rates could push that figure up or down.
Most Democrats in the Legislature voted against the tax change, arguing that it would force the government to cut more than $860 million to balance the budget in 2014, when the tax change will take effect. The tax rate had produced a windfall for the state in recent years, because oil prices were high. While other states were struggling with tax shortfalls, Alaska was able to put away $17 billion in a rainy-day fund.
But oil companies argued that the system was not sustainable. In recent testimony before the Alaska Senate Finance Committee, Dan Seckers, Exxon Mobil's Anchorage-based tax counsel, said that the current tax structure ''creates a major disincentive to invest in the high-risk, high-cost opportunities available in Alaska.''
Mr. Seckers noted that even as the industry invested more than $1 billion a year in Alaska's fields, production had declined annually by more than 6 percent in recent years. He warned that ''absent that continued investment, the annual production decline would likely be in the range of 12 to 15 percent annually.''
The decline in oil production poses a serious problem for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, by reducing the velocity that oil flows through the pipeline and allowing water to gather in the system. Oil executives have warned that the water could lead to more corrosion, ruptures and oil spills on the tundra.
Future exploration in Alaska faced a serious setback last week when ConocoPhillips announced that it was suspending plans to drill in Alaskan Arctic waters in 2014 because of uncertainties over federal regulatory and permitting standards.
That decision came after Shell Oil's decision to put off drilling this summer in Chukchi and Beaufort Seas in Alaska after it was forced to remove its two drilling rigs from the area. The rigs were sent to Asia for repairs after a series of ship groundings, weather delays and environmental and safety violations during last summer's drilling operations.
Oil company geologists say they believe the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas may become the country's next great oil field, with billions of barrels of reserves, but exploration and production will be costly.
Shell has already spent more than $4.5 billion on its efforts, without completing a well.

HEADLINE: Production Of Opium By Afghans Is Up Again

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- For the third year in a row, opium cultivation has increased across Afghanistan, erasing earlier drops stemming from a decade-long international and Afghan government effort to combat the drug trade, according to a United Nations report released on Monday.
The report's findings raised concerns among international law enforcement officials that if the trend continued, opium would be the country's major economic activity after foreign military forces depart in 2014, leading to the specter of what one official referred to as ''the world's first true narco-state.'' 
Afghanistan is already the world's largest producer of opium, and last year accounted for 75 percent of the world's heroin supply. ''The assumption is it will reach again to 90 percent this year,'' said Jean-Luc Lemahieu, the United Nations' top counternarcotics official here.
The report, the Afghanistan Opium Risk Assessment 2013, issued by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and based on extensive surveys, found that opium cultivation had increased in 12 of the country's 34 provinces. Herat, in western Afghanistan, is the only province in which cultivation is expected to decrease, the report said.
The report suggests that Taliban insurgents took advantage of insecurity in several provinces to assist opium farmers and win popular support -- protecting an important form of income for their operations. Opium cultivation has increased the most wherever there has been insecurity.
Over all, the number of acres devoted this year to opium poppy cultivation is expected to top the figure in 2008, when poppy plantings reached a peak of 388,000 acres, Mr. Lemahieu said. After 2008, eradication efforts, as well as a cash incentive program for provinces that eradicated all opium poppy crops, helped reduce cultivation drastically through 2010.
This year three provinces -- Balkh, Faryab and Takhar in the north and west -- are in danger of losing their poppy-free status, according to the United Nations report. They are among 16 provinces that had been declared poppy-free; such provinces receive $1 million awards from the American Embassy, paid directly to the governor's office.
In February, the State Department announced that it was handing out $18.2 million in Good Performers Initiative Awards for reducing poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. A spokesman for the American Embassy emphasized that the awards were meant to be incentives for provinces to remain poppy-free.
Opium production has become particularly high in Helmand Province in the south, the country's major opium-producing area, and in Kandahar Province. In both places, the surge of American troops helped to beat back Taliban influence, but as those troops returned home last year, cultivation increased sharply. More than 70 percent of opium production now takes place in three provinces where the surge occurred.
''This country is on its way to becoming the world's first true narco-state,'' said one international law enforcement official, who did not want to be quoted criticizing the Afghan government. ''The opium trade is a much bigger part of the economy already than narcotics ever were in Bolivia or Colombia.''
But Mirwais Yasini, a former head of counternarcotics for the Afghan government and now a prominent member of Parliament, said, ''I wouldn't go that far.''
''But if it goes on like this in the future, I am worried about that happening,'' he said.
Mr. Yasini said eradication efforts had been countered by insecurity, compounded by corruption at local, provincial and national levels. ''I don't see anything tangible that has been done,'' he said. ''There is no meaningful crop substitution and no effective enforcement.''
The United Nations has estimated in the past that opium trafficking makes up 15 percent of Afghanistan's gross domestic product, a figure that is expected to rise as international military and development spending declines with the NATO withdrawal at the end of 2014.
The mining sector, the other big hope of economic self-sufficiency for Afghanistan, is still moribund as the Afghan Parliament continues to bicker over a mining law. A lack of security and legal clarity has also prevented the large-scale exploitation of mineral resources.
The increase in opium poppy cultivation is attributed mainly to historically high prices for opium, coupled with insecurity. Prices began rising in 2010 when a poppy blight severely reduced crop yields, but they have remained high since. Farmers earn as much as $203 a kilogram for harvested opium, compared with only 43 cents a kilogram for wheat or $1.25 for rice, according to the report.
Mr. Lemahieu praised the efforts of the Afghan Ministry of Counternarcotics, but said international donors had greatly underfinanced critical programs to combat trafficking, with only $300,000 of a requested $11 million pledged this year.

HEADLINE: As U.S. Seeks Security Pact, Obama Is Set to Meet Putin

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- President Obama has accepted an invitation to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin ahead of a Group of 20 conference in Russia this fall, officials here said Monday -- signaling a new opportunity to ease tensions even as the Kremlin continues to bristle over an American effort to punish Russian citizens accused of violating human rights.
The announcement of a ''bilateral summit'' meeting in Russia in September, and of the planned meeting between the two presidents on the sidelines of a Group of 8 meeting in Northern Ireland in mid-June, came as Mr. Obama's national security adviser, Tom Donilon, met in Moscow on Monday with Mr. Putin and other top officials to push for renewed cooperation on security issues. 
In a series of meetings, first at the Russian Foreign Ministry and then at the Kremlin, Mr. Donilon pushed for more cuts in the two nations' nuclear weapons stockpiles, for expanded cooperation in containing the threat of a missile strike from Iran or North Korea, and for stronger economic ties, Russian and American officials said. Mr. Donilon also delivered a letter to Mr. Putin from Mr. Obama that addressed many of those topics.
In numerous ways, the timing of Mr. Donilon's visit could hardly have been more awkward -- just three days after the Obama administration banned more than two dozen Russians from traveling to the United States or maintaining assets there, because of purported human rights abuses. Although the step, required under a law approved in December, was widely expected, it still drew outrage and swift retaliation from Russia, which published its own list of Americans to face similar sanctions.
Officials said that Russian displeasure was made clear at each of Mr. Donilon's four meetings, but that given the context, the overall outcome seemed rather positive and that his appearance in Moscow despite the simmering diplomatic contretemps also sent a loud signal that the White House was ready to get down to business with the Kremlin, and to look past the recent sour tone of their relations.
''National Security Adviser Donilon came here with some very concrete proposals about security and economic issues that we think are of common interest to Russia and the United States,'' said a senior administration official who attended the meetings but was not allowed to speak publicly because of the sensitivity of the discussions. ''From our perspective the reaction was constructive, especially given the context and the timing.'' The official said the agreement for two meetings between the presidents ''set in place kind of a work plan.''
Ties between the United States and Russia have taken one bad turn after another over the past year, beginning with a wave of anti-Americanism during Mr. Putin's presidential campaign in early 2012. After that came legislation and other steps to curb American and other influences here, including restrictions on nongovernmental organizations.
Russian fury over the American law aimed at punishing human rights abuses also led to legislation barring Americans from adopting Russian children.
Despite these differences, the Obama administration has sought Russia's help on security issues related to Syria, Iran and North Korea, and Mr. Obama cited his desire to achieve further nuclear weapons reductions in his State of the Union speech. His administration has made clear that it views nuclear nonproliferation as a ''legacy'' issue.
Mr. Donilon started his day by meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, then went to the Kremlin where he saw his Russian counterpart, Nikolai P. Patrushev, the general secretary of the Russian Security Council. About an hour into that session, Mr. Putin dropped in and stayed for about 45 minutes.
The White House confirmed that Mr. Donilon had delivered a letter from Mr. Obama, but officials would not discuss its contents. Mr. Donilon later met with Yuri Ushakov, a senior adviser to Mr. Putin on foreign policy and a former ambassador to the United States. Other officials who took part, included a Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, and the American ambassador in Moscow, Michael A. McFaul, as well as Rose Gottemoeller, an assistant secretary of state.
Mr. Ushakov told the Interfax news agency that Mr. Donilon's visit and the letter from Mr. Obama had sent ''positive signals.'' Mr. Ushakov said the letter from Mr. Obama ''covers military-political problems, among them missile defense and nuclear arsenals.'' He added, ''The Putin-Donilon conversation had a rather positive nature, same as the messages sent by the Obama administration.''
Samuel Charap, a Russia expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Washington, said the announcement of the meetings between the two presidents was important because it sent a signal to officials at all levels that they could engage. He said this was particularly important given the Kremlin's decidedly anti-American posture in recent months.
''To have that green light issued jointly in a very public way,'' Mr. Charap said, ''this is a step forward.''

HEADLINE: Raising Standards for Our Teachers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Teachers: Will We Ever Learn?,'' by Jal Mehta (Op-Ed, April 13):
Teacher effectiveness is the great enigma. Higher professional standards for classroom teachers (comparable to law and medicine), as advocated by Mr. Mehta, appear to be a good idea. But can we truly predict what makes pupils respond to teachers in the classroom? A teacher could brilliantly ace those professional licensing requirements and still fail at communicating in the classroom.
More emphasis should be placed on apprenticeship and mentoring at every level: novices apprenticing with proven master teachers, pupil-to-pupil mentoring, programs encouraging parental mentoring. 
The top countries cited for educational success have homogeneous populations for the most part. Our country is more diverse culturally, economically and socially. The melting pot requires a melting pot approach. A stronger apprenticeship-mentoring system is worth adding to that pot.
GLADYS SCHECHTER New York, April 13, 2013
The writer is a former high school teacher.
To the Editor:
The alarming conclusion of the 1983 report ''A Nation at Risk'' was, ''If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war.''
Sadly, three decades later our country has done little to improve the quality of education. We don't stress creative thinking, and we don't practice group problem-solving, a must in a world in which technology is changing at lightning-fast speeds. Instead we force our teachers to teach in lock step and make them teach to the test, pretending that tests are an accurate way to measure students' abilities.
A first step is to go back to a system based on meritocracy and away from self-serving politics.
RONALD KAPROV Bronx, April 13, 2013
The writer has been a public-school teacher for 27 years and worked on ''A Nation at Risk.''
To the Editor:
In recent years there have been several reports, such as that cited by Jal Mehta, of how our country's education system is performing at lower standards compared with many countries around the world.
It must be pointed out that urban education is a great challenge in America, depressing the rankings. The top high schools in America do not play second fiddle to those of any country. Standardized test scores and grade point averages are extremely high in these institutions, and so many of these children go to the most prestigious universities in the country. Our colleges are the most renowned in the world. In fact, foreign students clamor to gain admission to them.
In our socioeconomically diverse nation, teaching with a one-size-fits-all mentality is something we need to change.
SALVATORE J. BOMMARITO New York, April 13, 2013
To the Editor:
As a public-school teacher for 20 years, I wholeheartedly agree with a lot of what Jal Mehta says. I'd like to add that despite our intense teaching load, high class sizes and the complete spectrum of society's joys and challenges represented among our students, we are not compensated on a scale remotely related to those of doctors or lawyers.
Is it any wonder that we are not drawing enough new teachers from the top third of college graduates? Teacher education matters. So does teacher compensation.

HEADLINE: With Grandchild and Library, a New Chapter for Bush

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
DALLAS -- For a former president, it does not get much better than this. Over the weekend, George W. Bush welcomed his first grandchild into the world. Next week he will welcome the arrival of his other baby, a 226,565-square-foot presidential center. 
Mr. Bush, 66, who has remained largely removed from the spotlight in the four years since leaving the White House, returned to television screens on Monday in a series of hospital snapshots with his new granddaughter, Mila, who was born to Jenna and Henry Hager in New York on Saturday night. Next week, he will host President Obama and other dignitaries to dedicate the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum.
The happenstance of timing served to underscore the dominant themes of Mr. Bush's post-presidential life here in Texas. Once a wartime commander in chief, he is now a doting grandfather as well as an amateur painter. With his eight years in power behind him, he is trying to frame what they amounted to and still promoting causes important to him -- while staying out of what he calls ''the swamp'' of national politics.
''One of the real challenges of life is that when you complete a chapter, you don't atrophy, that you continue to find ways to contribute,'' Mr. Bush told The Dallas Morning News in an interview published over the weekend.
Even before completing his presidential library, Mr. Bush has been working on issues like encouraging economic growth, promoting democracy abroad and fighting disease in Africa through his public policy institute. He spends a lot of time with war veterans, hosting long ''wounded warrior'' bicycle rides across Texas.
Along the way, he raised more than $500 million for his presidential center, which will occupy 23 acres on the campus of Southern Methodist University here and will host the institute, library and museum. After an April 25 dedication ceremony, the library and museum will open to the public on May 1.
In the interview, Mr. Bush expressed no regrets and said his record would stand the test of time. While ''nobody likes to be criticized all the time,'' he dismissed the attacks that continue to this day. ''I'm comfortable with what I did,'' he said. ''I'm comfortable with who I am.'' He added, ''Much of my presidency was defined by things that you didn't necessarily want to have happen.''
The library debut will be only a few days behind the debut of the next generation of his family. Margaret Laura Hager, named after her two grandmothers and called Mila, arrived weighing 6 pounds 15 ounces. The ''Today'' show on NBC, where Jenna Hager works as a correspondent, showed family pictures of Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, with the new baby and her parents.
In one of the pictures, Mr. Bush, in a blue sweater over a light blue shirt, cradled Mila, who was swathed in a baby blanket and wearing a baby cap as Mrs. Bush leaned over with her arm around him.
''Our family is elated,'' the former president said in a statement over the weekend.

HEADLINE: What People Think About Taxes

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: People seem more concerned with how cumbersome the income tax process is and how their tax dollars are spent than with the amount they pay, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
For most people, the sum total of their opinion about taxes is very, very simple: they hate them - not just the tax payment, but the act of paying taxes: pulling together the information needed to do one's tax return, filing it, worrying about being audited for some small error and so on. 
These attitudes are confirmed in a new compendium of public opinion on taxes published by the American Enterprise Institute. The editors, Karlyn Bowman and Andrew Rugg, tell us: 
In 75 years of surveys, we can find no instance in which more than a tiny percentage of Americans said the amount they paid in taxes was too low. In most polls, pluralities or majorities say the amount is too high.
But the data do suggest that the percentage of people who think their taxes are too high has declined over time. Until the early 2000s, that figure was commonly in the three-fifths to two-thirds range, but it has since trended down to about 50 percent. Conversely, the percentage of people saying their taxes are about right has risen to where in some polls it sometimes exceeds the percentage saying that taxes are too high.
Conservatives like to argue that the greatest unfairnesses of the tax code are that the wealthy are taxed at higher rates and that close to half of those who file income tax returns have no tax liability. But polls indicate that most people believe that the greatest unfairness in the tax system is that the wealthy do not pay their fair share.

A poll in April 2003 sponsored by National Public Radio, the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Kennedy School of Government found that 57 percent of people believed that high-income families paid less than their fair share. A December 2011 Pew poll found the same percentage saying so. By contrast, it found that only 11 percent of people found that the amount of federal taxes they themselves paid was what bothered them the most, with 28 percent naming the complexity of the tax system.
Possibly the greatest dissatisfaction with the tax system is not with taxes per se, but the widespread feeling that the money is simply wasted. The American Enterprise Institute compendium shows that the percentage of people who believe that the government wastes a lot of their money has risen over time. Recent polls put the percentage in the 70 percent to 80 percent range, almost twice what it was in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
When asked what percentage of all federal spending is wasted, a variety of polls routinely put the figure around half. People also believe that wasteful spending has risen over time and that they themselves get little if any value from the taxes they pay. Overwhelmingly, people say that how their taxes are spent bothers them more than the amount they pay.
Not surprisingly, people prefer the idea of paying less in taxes and getting less from government over the idea of paying more in taxes and getting more services from government. It's hard to see how this could be otherwise given the distribution of federal spending. As the chart below from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows, the vast bulk of it goes to national military programs that no one actually sees, programs for the elderly and poor, or interest on the debt. Programs that average people might see in their own lives, such as education or transportation, are a tiny fraction of spending. Even over a lifetime, most people expect to get back less from government than they pay in taxes.
In terms of tax reform, people remain sympathetic to the idea of a flat tax despite their general sympathy for progressivity and the idea that government should actively narrow the distribution of income.
Almost everyone thinks the federal tax system is too complicated and in need of major overhaul. In principle, people are willing to give up deductions in return for lower rates, but when questioned about specific deductions they usually support the big ones. An April 2011 Gallup poll found 60 percent to 70 percent of people opposing elimination of the home mortgage deduction, the deduction for state and local taxes or the deduction for charitable contributions, either to reduce the deficit or in return for lower tax rates.
Politically, Republicans and those with high incomes tend to hate taxes and doing their taxes more than Democrats and those with low incomes. According to a new Pew poll, 60 percent of Republicans say they hate doing their taxes compared with 46 percent of Democrats; 63 percent of those with incomes over $75,000 hate doing their taxes compared with 50 percent of those with incomes below $30,000.
It's undoubtedly the case that one's decision to identify with the Republicans or Democrats in the first place has a lot to do with taxes.

HEADLINE: BlackRock Earnings Rise 10% as Investors Step Back Into Markets

BYLINE: NATHANIEL POPPER


HIGHLIGHT: The asset management giant BlackRock said on Tuesday that profit rose 10 percent in the first quarter on gains from renewed investor interest in the stock market. 

 BODY:
The asset management giant BlackRock reported on Tuesday that profit rose 10 percent in the first quarter on gains from renewed investor interest in the stock market.
Investors put $39.4 billion of new money into BlackRock products, with most of that going into stock-related investments. Along with rising markets, that helped BlackRock increase assets under management by 7 percent from the period a year earlier and by 4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2102. 
BlackRock's net income in the first quarter was $632 million, or $3.62 a share, slightly exceeding the $3.58 cents a share expected by analysts. The company said revenue and profit increased compared with the first quarter of 2012, though both were down slightly from record levels reached in the fourth quarter. 
 The chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, said in a statement that in the current atmosphere of low interest rates, Americans had been shifting away from the bond investments that used to be the most popular choice for many retirees. 
An economic recovery that appeared to be gaining a steadier footing broadly drove Americans to re-enter the stock market. At BlackRock, 86 percent of the inflows, or $34 billion, went into equity investments, with much of that going into BlackRock's iShares exchange traded funds, which are baskets of stocks, bonds and other assets that can be traded on a stock exchange. 
"Investors turned to iShares as a way to quickly and efficiently increase their exposure to equity markets," Mr. Fink said. 
BlackRock has been expanding its marketing effort for iShares to maintain its position as the largest provider of E.T.F.'s. BlackRock recently signed a deal with Fidelity to provide its investors with easier access to iShares products.

HEADLINE: Density

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A nation of Baltimores. 

 BODY:
There's an interesting discussion underway about whether rising population necessarily leads to rising land prices over time. Bill McBride of Calculated Risk says yes:
A key reason for the upward slope in real house prices is because some areas are land constrained, and with an increasing population, the value of land increases faster than inflation. 
Noah Smith disagrees, because land isn't really particularly scarce - when we see high land prices in some metro areas, it's all about the agglomeration effects, which could go in various directions over time.
My first reaction to Smith's comment was that it might not matter very much, because new metropolitan areas are very hard to create; there may be plenty of land around Lubbock, but nobody's going to move there, so a growing population has to squeeze into the metropolitan areas we have. But then I realized that this might not be the last word either; even if people want to stay in existing metro areas, they can hive off "edge cities" at the, um, edges of these metro areas, so that the relevant population density - the density that makes land in or near urban hubs expensive - might not rise even if the overall population of the metro area goes up.
And we have data! Via Richard Florida, new work by the Census (pdf) calculates "population-weighted density" - a weighted average of density across census tracts, where the tracts are weighted not by land area but by population; this gives a much better idea of how the average person lives.
As Florida points out, the new measure conveys a much better sense of how metros differ. For example, by the standard density measure Los Angeles is actually denser than New York, basically because LA is hemmed in by mountains, limiting how far the sprawl/commuting zone can reach. But New York has an urban core in a way that LA does not, and sure enough, it has a much, much higher population-weighted density.
What I wanted, however, was trends - and the Census has calculated this measure both for metros and for national aggregates for both 2000 and 2010. Here's what it looks like:
So, a couple of points. First, although America is a vast, thinly populated country, with fewer than 90 people per square mile, the average American lives in a quite densely populated neighborhood, with more than 5000 people per square mile. The next time someone talks about small towns as the "real America", bear in mind that the real real America - the America in which most Americans live - looks more or less like metropolitan Baltimore.
Second, however, although the US population and hence the population density rose about 10 percent over the course of the naughties, the average American was living in a somewhat less dense neighborhood in 2010 than in 2000, as population spread out within metropolitan areas. If you like, we're becoming a bit less a nation of Bostons and a bit more a nation of Houstons.
This is, I think, a picture of urban geography in which the link between overall rising population and land prices is likely to be diffuse at best. So I think I call this one for Smith - although McBride's point that actual real housing prices do seem to have an upward trend remains important, and needs explaining.

HEADLINE: What Would a Fighter Jet Buy 60 Years After Eisenhower's Speech?

BYLINE: JOHN ISMAY


HIGHLIGHT: In his famed 1953 Chance for Peace speech, President Dwight D. Eisenhower outlined what armaments cost in human terms. Applying his methodology toward today yields interesting results. 

 BODY:
Shortly after the death of Joseph Stalin, President Dwight D. Eisenhower believed a rare opportunity existed to reset United States-Soviet relations, and he announced it to the world 60 years ago Tuesday in his 1953 Chance for Peace speech.
With a new Soviet premier taking office, and newly inaugurated himself, President Dwight D. Eisenhower believed that Stalin's demise presented an opening to end the rapidly accelerating arms race between the two countries. Eisenhower directed his speechwriters to develop an address that clearly conveyed that desire to his Russian counterpart.
Eschewing the tired condemnations of the Soviet Union that had dominated recent presidential speeches, Eisenhower challenged his staff to present a new Pax Americana focusing on the idea of a future peace that unified Germany, removed occupying forces in Austria and talked in human terms of what both sides lost when spending so much of their wealth on armaments.
For this address, the president gave clear direction to the speechwriter Emmet Hughes. 
"Here is what I would like it to say:
That jet plane over your head costs three-quarters of a million dollars. That is more than a man earning $10,000 every year is going to make in a lifetime. What world can afford this sort of thing for long?"
At that time, Korean War spending had reached its height. United States defense spending accounted for 14.2 percent of gross domestic product. 
Eisenhower deliberately avoided giving this address to the United Nations because he did not want other delegates to immediately chop his words apart. Instead, he decided to deliver his message to the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Mr. Hughes and Paul Nitze collaborated on a new draft that included this section, perhaps the most remembered part of the address:
 "Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. 
It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. 
The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. 
It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. 
It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some 50 miles of concrete highway. 
We pay for a single fighter plane with a half-million bushels of wheat. 
We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.
This, I repeat, is the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking. 
This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron."
Unfortunately, there is no solid evidence as to how Mr. Hughes and Mr. Nitze came up with those figures. Historians at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene, Kan., could not determine how the numbers were assessed. But a quick spot check of one commodity does give some confidence that the quantities were not completely pulled out of a hat.
A look at an earlier draft of the speech shows that the "fighter jet" cited would buy 170,000 bushels of wheat, versus a half-million as stated in the final version. With wheat running about $2 a bushel then, a quick search of United States Air Force aircraft of the time shows that the earlier draft might have referred to the F-86 Sabre, which cost $211,111 at the time. However, the higher figure in the final draft might have referred to the new F-84F Thunderstreak, which cost $769,330.
With some idea that the speechwriters might have been using reliable data, it is worth seeing what a modern heavy bomber, a fighter jet and a destroyer would buy 60 years later.
 Modern Bomber 
Introduced in 1951, the B-47 Stratojet is probably the aircraft the president referred to as "a modern bomber." It cost $2,440,000 then. The most expensive bomber in use today is the B-2 Spirit, also known as the Stealth Bomber. Its price, adjusted for inflation, comes to $1,461,500,000.
The first item Eisenhower listed was a "modern brick school." The National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities places the national average for a 600-student elementary school at $14,800,000. A single B-2 would buy 99 of these schools.
Next on the list was electric power plants. Figures from the United States Energy Information Agency show that one megawatt of electricity will power 749 homes. That means about 80 megawatts are needed to meet Eisenhower's goal of delivering current to 60,000 homes. Constructing an 85-megawatt conventional combustion turbine power plant today costs $78,800,000. The B-2 would today buy 19 of these power plants after considering inflation.
Determining the cost of a hospital is difficult because of a wide array of variables, but Eisenhower left a clue in his early drafts by referring to a 400-bed facility. Given that, we can determine a national average for constructing, not equipping, a hospital of that size today would easily cost $231,000,000, according to the American Hospital Association. We could buy six of these hospitals with a B-2.
Building roadways is similarly subject to varied factors in cost. One thing that officials at the Federal Highway Administration ruled out right away was the president's choice of material. According to them, no one builds roads out of concrete anymore. With so many variables, I chose to price out two lanes rural interstate over flat terrain. Were the father of the Interstate Highway System to buy 50 miles of that roadway today, it would cost $222,400,000. The Air Force's current premier bomber would buy 328 miles of that kind of road.
 Fighter Jet 
A half-million bushels of wheat might have been enough to buy a fighter jet in Eisenhower's day, but that is not quite the case at present. Trading at roughly $7 a bushel today on the commodities markets, that half-million bushels costs $3,500,000 in 2013. Looking at the data on today's fighters, that much money would buy only spare parts at best.
On the high end of today's fighters, the F-22 Raptor has a range of prices depending if you choose unit cost or lifecycle cost. Officials at the Air Force's public affairs office put the price at $214,000,000 per plane. That would buy more than 29,500,000 bushels of wheat today. 
 Destroyer 
According to the National Association of Realtors, the national median price for a single family home (each houses four people) is $173,600, as of February 2013. Building enough of them to house 8,000 people would cost $347,200,000. Or put a different way, about a quarter of the cost of the Navy's current Flight IIA DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. The money spent on a single DDG, roughly $1.5 billion, would put durable roofs over the heads of more than 34,000 Americans. The proposed "Flight III" Burkes have an estimated delivery cost of $3 billion to $4 billion apiece. Or another way, it is enough to rebuild all the homes in New Jersey damaged by Hurricane Sandy.
 Conclusion 
Are there any parallels to present day? Osama bin Laden has been dispatched, but was he the same kind of existential threat that Stalin embodied? Are any politicians looking at the terrorist leader's demise as an opportunity for the United States to take a different path? Is it time for an American president to give a new speech?
In this comparison of the past 60 years, one important data point not yet discussed is the current total defense spending. For all the debate over the size of the defense budget, it represents 4.3 percent of G.D.P. Compared with spending in 1953, that is three times smaller - relative to the gross domestic product - than what Eisenhower dealt with. 
But while defense spending as a percentage of the G.D.P. has shrunk, the cost of each military item Eisenhower cited has grown enormously even after accounting for inflation.
As a former five-star general, Eisenhower had a keen appreciation for military thinking and strategy, and he often pushed back on requests made by his admirals and generals. This included proposals for new weapons systems.
In light of the continuing sequestration fight, the minutes of one National Security Council meeting in 1960, the last year of Eisenhower's administration, give an idea of what he might have thought of the current morass: 
"He believed it was the duty of military officers to get along with less if at all possible. He realized it was also the duty of military officers to ensure the military safety of the U.S., but he believed that no absolute assurance on this point could ever be given."
What Eisenhower shows us today is that while we cannot completely assure safety given any amount of spending, we can definitively show what that spending could otherwise accomplish. And that is valuable.

HEADLINE: Amazon Takes a Nibble Out of Apple iTunes Downloads

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: According to a new study released by NPD Group, the market research firm, Amazon&#8217;s share of paid music downloads rose to 22 percent from 15 percent a year earlier. 

 BODY:
Amazon is helping Apple celebrate the 10th anniversary of iTunes by gaining momentum on music downloads in the United States. 
According to a new study released by NPD Group, the market research firm, in 2012 Amazon accounted for 22 percent of paid music downloaded in the United States. This is up from 15 percent in 2011.
The report, "Annual Music Study 2012," found that Apple still dominates the music download world, with 63 percent of all paid downloads taking place through iTunes.
Amazon's rise seems to be attributed to updates of the company's color Kindle Fire tablets last year. These tablets are capable of playing music directly purchased from AmazonMP3, the online retailer's digital music service. The Kindle Fire provides access to more than 18 million movies, TV shows, magazines and books, according to Amazon.
Although Amazon does not share numbers about sales of its Kindle Fire devices, calculations by Forrester Research estimate that Amazon sold close to five million Kindle Fire tablets by the end of last year. In comparison, Apple has sold more than 100 million iPads.
Although there has been huge growth in customers using streaming music services, including Pandora, Rdio and Spotify, NPD Group reported that the number of music downloads in the United States has remained relatively unaffected by these new music outlets.
"NPD estimates that average per-buyer spending on music downloads increased 6 percent, year over year, due largely to increases in music purchasing by teens, along with an increase in the number of consumers purchasing both single song tracks and full albums," the company said.
The report said 44 million Americans purchased at least one song or album last year.

HEADLINE: Cyberwar: How Digital Threats Are Redefining National Security

BYLINE: TOM MARSHALL


HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students learn about the scope of recent cyberattacks and what is being done to counter such threats. Then they consider the broader practical and ethical consequences of preparing for cyberwar. 

 BODY:
 Overview | Can a nation's military or economic institutions be toppled with a few anonymous keystrokes? That's the fear being voiced by United States government officials and corporations, who have drastically ramped up their preparations in recent months to defend against attacks on computer networks.
In the activities that follow, students learn about the scope of recent attacks and what is being done to counter such threats. Then they consider the broader practical and ethical consequences of preparing for cyberwar.
 Materials | Markers and Post-it notes or index cards with tape for groups of four or five students; a computer with an Internet connection and a projector to display articles and video; computers with an Internet connection for individual students or groups to use online resources; copies of articles or primary documents as needed.
 Warm-Up | Tell students: 
 Today we are going to look at a type of conflict that is brand new. Some people call it a war, but it has nothing to do with guns and bullets, only computers. Any guesses what I'm talking about? 
Write student brainstorming on the board, focusing on terms like "cyberwar" and "hacking."
 How many of you have heard of a recent incident in the news in which someone maliciously used computers to harm someone else? Can you think of any examples? 
Record any incidents students may have heard of, like recent Internet slowdowns or attacks on corporate Web sites.
 Imagine, for a moment, if a malicious hacker or unfriendly government were able to create a computer virus that took down the world's computer networks for a day or even longer. What sorts of activities would suddenly become impossible? 
Help students to brainstorm a comprehensive list of computer-related activities in modern life, including not just things like shopping but essential functions like air traffic control, banking records, power grids, weather forecasting and satellite communications.
 Over the next couple of days we are going to take a close look at how we might protect ourselves from such attacks, while at the same time continuing to enjoy the amazing opportunities provided by computers and the Internet. But first, let's read a recent article that shows you just how seriously people are treating this problem. 
 Related | In "Security Leader Says U.S. Would Retaliate Against Cyberattacks," Mark Mazzetti and David E. Sanger write about how United States government officials are warning that a significant attack on the nation's computer systems could wreak havoc with basic services and the economy. Officials are preparing to fight back against attacks that are seen as potentially more pressing than the threat posed by global terrorist networks.
The chief of the military's newly created Cyber Command told Congress ... that he is establishing 13 teams of programmers and computer experts who could carry out offensive cyberattacks on foreign nations if the United States were hit with a major attack on its own networks, the first time the Obama administration has publicly admitted to developing such weapons for use in wartime. 
"I would like to be clear that this team, this defend-the-nation team, is not a defensive team," Gen. Keith Alexander, who runs both the National Security Agency and the new Cyber Command, told the House Armed Services Committee. "This is an offensive team that the Defense Department would use to defend the nation if it were attacked in cyberspace." 
 Background Vocabulary: Read the entire article with your class, then answer the questions below. You may wish to introduce students to the following words or concepts before reading: cyberattacks, cyberspace, infrastructure, espionage, utilities, rhetoric, propaganda.
 Questions | For reading comprehension and discussion:

        
What is the purpose of the 13 new Cyber Command teams?
        
What specific attacks have already taken place in recent years, and who seems to be behind them, according to the United States government?
        
What sorts of specific problems might a cyberattack cause, according to this article? 
        
How might defending against cyberattacks endanger ordinary citizens' privacy?
        
What did General Alexander say was the best defense against such attacks, and why do you think officials are also discussing offensive tactics?
 Activity | In this activity, student groups will read additional articles on recent cyberattacks and work together to construct a class "action-and-reaction timeline" (PDF).
 Part I: Reading a Times Article and Tracking Cyberattacks 
Set up a vertical timeline on a whiteboard, with the years 2007 through 2013 arranged on the vertical (left) axis from bottom to top, and the terms "action" and "reaction" on the horizontal (top) axis. Then divide students into mixed ability groups of four or five and give each group a small stack of Post-it notes or index cards with tape. 
Assign one of the articles about a cyberattack that has occurred in recent years from the list below to each group. In some cases, the article might mention more than one attack, and in some cases it might also say what happened next - what steps people took in reacting to the attack.

Bank Hacking Was the Work of Iranians, Officials Say (Note to students: exclude Estonia)
        
After Computer Siege in Estonia, War Fears Turn to Cyberspace
        
Cyberattacks Seem Meant to Destroy, Not Just Disrupt
Within each group, students should have different roles: a facilitator to lead the group's discussion, a recorder to take notes on what the group discusses and note takers who keep track of specific cyberattacks on Post-it notes or index cards.
For each cyberattack or incident a group finds in its article, students should fill out a note card. On the top they should write the country and approximate date in large letters (example, "fall 2012" or "September 2012"). Below, students should provide details describing briefly what happened. Groups should complete as many cards as they can. 
After groups finish taking notes, students should place their note cards in the appropriate spot in the "action" column on the timeline handout (PDF), the chalkboard or even via computer using Google Docs or other file-sharing programs.
 Part II: Group Discussion 
Next, students should discuss the cyberattacks they found as a group and try to figure out the consequences:

        
How did people react in response to the attacks? 
        
Did people face any concrete problems or hardships? 
        
Do you think they changed the mood in that country or damaged relations with another country?
Students should think creatively and list as many consequences as they can in the group's notes. They should also make sure they can also locate any countries mentioned on a world map (PDF).
 Part III: Class Presentations and Analysis 
In the final portion of class, ask each group to briefly present their findings - what happened and any consequences - and locate any countries mentioned on a world map. Teachers can jot down key points on the timeline in the "reaction" column as they speak. After all the groups have presented, ask the class to think once more about the cumulative impact or consequences of such attacks. How have they changed the global climate around cybersecurity and Internet use, and what should be done now?
 Going Further: Teaching About Cyberwar 
 1. Is the threat real or hyped? 
Last year, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned of a possible "cyber-Pearl Harbor" in which hackers or governments launched multiple, simultaneous attacks on the United States. Are you persuaded of the severity of that threat, or do you believe it is overstated? Read Mr. Panetta's account of the dangers, and then read these articles that critique the notion that the United States is on the verge of cyberwar. Write a personal response, citing evidence from articles you have read to support your position as well as countervailing views.

        
Why the U.S. Is Not in a Cyber War
        
Hype and Fear
        
The Great Cyberscare
        
Cyberwar Hype Intended to Destroy the Open Internet
 2. What are America's rules governing cyberwar? 
Under the United States Constitution, only Congress can declare war, and under the 1973 War Powers Act the president must consult with legislative leaders when emergencies make that impossible. Does that apply to cyberwar too? Read this article on the Obama administration's assertion of broad executive powers to strike pre-emptively or take other steps in cyberrelated emergencies. Then consider this response, which describes the government's position as a "power grab." Which position do you consider more persuasive? 
Write a scenario in which you describe how a cyberattack might unfold, explaining how Congressional involvement is either possible or impractical. Then propose a new federal law, the Cyberwar Powers Act, that spells out exactly how the government can protect itself from cyberthreats while remaining true to its democratic principles.
 3. Did the United States set a bad example? 
As early as 2006, the United States was taking active steps to use cyberwarfare tools against Iran, and in 2011 it contemplated launching a full-scale cyberattack against Libya. Do you believe some acts of cyberwar might be justified in order to prevent or limit the loss of life in a real war? Or will such acts come back to haunt the country that uses them first, leading to a cycle of retaliation and chaos that hurts everyone? Write a proposed international treaty governing cyberwarfare in which you spell out the conditions, if any, under which such tactics are justified.
 4. Are the United States and China cyberrivals? 
In February, a United States company and government officials implicated units of the Chinese Army in a broad range of cyberattacks, including some against The New York Times. How has the United States government responded, and has it acted forcefully enough? Read the articles below, listing the steps that have been taken to eliminate the problem. Then explain why United States officials are treading carefully and might be reluctant to go too far or start an overt cyberwar with China.

        
In Cyberspace, New Cold War
        
U.S. Demands China Block Cyberattacks and Agree to Rules
 5. What is the best response to cyberthreats: offense, defense or clever thinking? 
Imagine that President Obama has convened an emergency committee of representatives from the military, Internet businesses, other businesses like banks and power companies that rely on the Internet, bloggers devoted to maintaining Internet freedom and ordinary citizens. Assign students to take on one of these roles and, using the sources below or others from the archives of The New York Times, argue for the best long-term strategy for protecting the United States and other nations from cyberattack. Hold a formal debate with student presentations and a final class vote on the best strategy.

 6. What can the private companies or individuals do? 
Often it is private companies involved in the Internet business that notice and act on problems first. Now governments in both the United States and United Kingdom are taking active steps to increase cooperation with private industry. Do you think government, private companies and individuals would cooperate or come into conflict in the event of cyberwar? Make a prediction now, citing examples to support your view. Then track continuing coverage in the coming weeks, designing a poster that shows how the relationship between government and the private sector veers between conflict and cooperation on this issue.

HEADLINE: G.M. Enters the 3-Cylinder Engine Arms Race

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Ford and BMW developed turbocharged three-bangers for the North American market. Now General Motors has entered the fray. 

 BODY:
Once upon a time, General Motors was intent on making the biggest, most powerful cars humankind had ever seen. But times have changed since the era of cheap gasoline, and today's car buyers tend to be more interested in miles per gallon than miles per hour. Accordingly, automakers appear to be thinking small these days.
America has gone from "there's no replacement for displacement," to "fewer cylinders, more gears." 
The world has seen dramatic growth in hybrid- and electric-model offerings over the last several years, but highly efficient gasoline engines based on conventional technology seem to hold quite a bit of promise. G.M. has pledged that it will spend $332 million developing engine-efficiency upgrades, with $225 million of that money going into development of 3- and 4-cylinder engines.
Remember when Subaru offered the Justy and G.M. the Geo Metro back in the late 1980s and early 1990s? You may or may not have had a good chuckle about those minuscule 3-cylinder cars, which were derided by some as motorcycles with doors and roofs. 
Honda also got into the mini-engine game a few years later, putting a 67-horsepower 3-cylinder in the Insight hybrid in 1999. But the triple-pot mill is nothing even that new. Motorcycle companies undoubtedly had a hand in working out the balance issues inherent in a 3-cylinder design, with BMW, Yamaha, Triumph and Suzuki among manufacturers that have produced 3-cylinder bikes for decades.
It shouldn't come as a surprise that the Metro was a version of the Suzuki Swift; Suzuki was known for its water-cooled 3-cylinders. Other automakers that have used 3-cylinder engines in passenger cars include Saab, VM Motori (for Alfa Romeo), Volkswagen and Daihatsu - albeit mostly overseas. Americans haven't seen much of the 3-cylinder concept at all since the Metro faded from existence in 2001, but General Motors builds a 1-liter 3-cylinder turbodiesel at its factory in India. The technology is there, there just haven't been many prominent - or better yet, popular - examples of it in the States.
Now, tiny mills are cranking out enough power to propel the larger vehicles more suitable for the American market. One version of BMW's 3-cylinder engine will crank out more than 200 horsepower. Triumph's Rocket III Roadster motorcycle engine makes more than 140 horsepower, and Ford says its new EcoBoost 3-cylinder will produce up to 123 horsepower. Considering the displacement, those aren't bad numbers.
Three-bangers finally seem to be all the rage in the States as manufacturers work to meet both customer demand for less thirsty vehicles and the federal government's tightening fuel economy standards.
Using a variety of technologies - including direct injection, turbocharging and variable valve timing - automotive engineers have been able to extract surprising amounts of power from engines that would have been thought too small for service in American cars a decade ago. A few interesting contenders have emerged in the diminutive engine arms race, including Ford's 1-liter EcoBoost - which gained international attention when Ford stuffed an engine block into a carry-on suitcase and brought it through airport security - and BMW's 1- and 1.5-liter twin-turbo 3-cylinder engines.
General Motors said in a statement that the Ecotec layout would be the basis of a family of engines marketed worldwide, and that production could top two million engines a year by 2020. The company has already produced three million 4-cylinder Ecotecs.
Coupled with an 8-speed automatic transmission, G.M. expects its 3-cylinder's fuel economy to be impressive. Keep in mind, too, that 9- and 10-speed automatics are going to be available in Ford and G.M. cars soon. That means manufacturers will be able to squeeze every possible drop of power and efficiency out of very small engines.
The Ecotec 3-cylinder could appear in the refreshed 2015 Chevrolet Volt and the 2016 Cadillac ELR, both plug-in hybrids. What we don't have yet is a set of hard numbers about how much weight the new 3-cylinder would save, and how much fuel economy would improve.
In short, it's a new day; undoubtedly an exciting time in the lives of people who like doing more with less. It seems as if the Big Three have gone from trying to build the beefiest muscle car to seeing who can do the most with the smallest muscles. Who knows, perhaps the Big Three will become known for little threes.

HEADLINE: A New Sign of a Swoon

BYLINE: NELSON D. SCHWARTZ


HIGHLIGHT: March figures on industrial production were buoyed by utilities&#8217; output because of the cold weather. Manufacturing actually declined. 

 BODY:
 Don't be fooled by the headline number - there was more evidence of a spring swoon in new government data released Tuesday.
 While overall industrial production rose 0.4 percent, that increase was caused by a big 5.3 percent jump in production at utilities because of the cold weather in March. 
 Manufacturing output, which is a more telling indicator than the headline number, actually dropped by 0.1 percent. 
 Many analysts, like Barclays, were looking for manufacturing output to rise slightly last month, not fall, and the bank said it was one more sign the economy was entering a weak patch after stronger growth earlier in the year. 
 "This adds to the picture of a softening of activity at the end of Q1, relative to the start of the year, with weaker March data now seen across retail sales, employment and output," Barclays said in a note. "Alongside a likely softening of household sector demand (reflecting a lagged response to January tax hikes) this leads us to expect softer output growth in Q2 relative to Q1."
 Another firm, IHS Global Insight, was similarly downbeat. Still, IHS noted that auto production was one bright spot amid the overall gloom.
 "As expected, motor vehicle production increased again (+2.9%) and continues to be a bright spot in the economy, even as consumers face many headwinds," IHS said. "Vehicle production should continue to lead manufacturing higher over the coming months."
 If the economy does indeed slow, as is widely expected, many economists say the cause will be fiscal austerity in Washington. Besides the payroll tax increase at the beginning of January, experts are watching the fallout from the automatic cuts in government spending recently imposed by Congress. 
 More information about the broad state of the economy will be out Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve releases its Beige Book survey of economic conditions across the country.

HEADLINE: A Study That Set the Tone for Austerity Is Challenged

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: A 2010 paper argued that countries with heavy debt loads tended to experience slower rates of growth. A new study argues that the paper was flawed, in part because of calculation errors. 

 BODY:
 8:10 p.m. | Updated 
WASHINGTON - In recent years, policy makers in Europe and the United States have fastened on the notion that reaching a certain heavy burden of debt would threaten future economic health - often to justify austerity budgets that increased unemployment and sapped economic strength in the here and now.
But now some economists are challenging the very foundations of that idea, raising questions about whether such a debt threshold even exists and setting off a fierce debate that flared up on Tuesday across the Internet about whether potentially flawed research is at least partly responsible for the slow growth that has bedeviled most advanced industrial countries since the recovery from the financial crisis began in 2009. 
The debate comes at a particularly perilous time, as economic officials from the United States and other countries gather for the annual spring meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington, where many are expected to urge high-debt Europe to ease up on its commitment to austerity in the face of rising unemployment and new economic contractions.
The controversy stems from a provocative new paper by economists at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst that claims to have found some basic errors in one of the most pathbreaking and influential economic studies to come out in the last few years.
That was a 2010 research paper by Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard, also authors of a best seller, "This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly." The economists, analyzing 3,700 separate economic observations, found little relationship between growth and debt for countries with debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratios of 90 percent or less. But for countries with debt loads equivalent to or greater than 90 percent of annual economic output, "median growth rates fall by 1 percent, and average growth falls considerably more."
Many politicians interpreted the research as showing a direct relationship between debt and growth. If a country reached a debt burden of more than 90 percent of its annual economic output, the logic went, it would quickly fall into a debt trap that would leave it struggling to grow in the coming years. Prominent politicians - including Olli Rehn of the European Commission and Representative Paul D. Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee - cited it as a reason to try to impose major budget cuts.
The Harvard economists' research was always more nuanced about the causal relationship between debt and growth than the popular view. Some economists expressed skepticism of the "threshold" theory to begin with. And many others noted how hard it could be to draw straight lines between debt and economic growth, given the panoply of factors at work.
But now, Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in trying to replicate the Reinhart-Rogoff results, are challenging the conclusions for a different reason. They say they found some simple miscalculations or data exclusions that sharply altered the ultimate results. According to their rerunning of the figures, "the average real G.D.P. growth rate for countries carrying a public debt-to-G.D.P. ratio of over 90 percent is actually 2.2 percent, not -0.1 percent," they write. In other words, heavy debts were not associated with the malaise that Professors Reinhart and Rogoff - and much of the world's economic elite - thought that they were.
The new paper, released this week, has set off a storm within the economics profession, with some commentators even arguing that it undermines the austerity policies that have proved so prevalent in the last few years.
"How much unemployment was caused by Reinhart and Rogoff's arithmetic mistake?" asked Dean Baker of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, for instance.
But in interviews, several economic experts cautioned that it would take time to sort out the statistical implications of any problems in the highly technical research.
"I think it's totally fair to say it's embarrassing," said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan, who added that he had not had the chance to study the results and noted that debates over supposed statistical problems were common in the profession. "But the mistakes that are most embarrassing are the least consequential" to Professor Reinhart and Rogoff's conclusion, he added.
Other experts said that separate pieces of research had found similar results to the Harvard professors' paper, using alternative data sets and significantly strengthening the argument that higher-debt economies suffered from slower growth. Those include studies by the I.M.F., the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Bank for International Settlements.
"There's nothing about this that will change my view of the universe," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and prominent Republican economist. "The sun still rises in the east. It sets in the west. And a lot of debt is still bad."
In an e-mailed statement, Professors Reinhart and Rogoff did not directly address the assertions of mathematical errors, and noted that they had only just started to sift through the new paper. But they argued that the Amherst authors had also found lower growth rates when a country had debts equivalent to or greater than 90 percent of annual economic output. "It is hard to see how one can interpret these tables and individual country results as showing that public debt overhang over 90 percent is clearly benign," they wrote.
The seemingly esoteric debate within the economics profession has collided this week with a broader challenge to excessive budget-cutting in countries around the world. The I.M.F. cautioned Washington against cutting its budget too fast, too soon, even as it saw the American economy strengthening. And on Tuesday, Olivier Blanchard, the fund's chief economist, warned that Britain was "playing with fire" with its austerity policy.
Professors Reinhart and Rogoff "are right to say the basic structure of the result stands," Professor Wolfers said. "The authors of the critique are right to say its force is lessened."
The debate, he added, is far from over.

HEADLINE: Alighting on Staten Island, Democratic Mayoral Hopefuls Make Their Appeals

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: On Monday night, five Democrats running for mayor made their way to the College of Staten Island for a forum at which each pledged to help the island if elected. 

 BODY:
Staten Island does not get a lot of love in Democratic primary elections - only around one-sixteenth of New York City's residents live there, and its population is relatively conservative.
The Race for City Hall
But on Monday night, five Democrats running for mayor made their way to the College of Staten Island for a forum at which each pledged to help the island if elected, offering to do everything from lowering the toll on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to using a proposed giant Ferris wheel to attract tourists.
William C. Thompson, Jr., a former comptroller who grew up in Brooklyn and now lives in Manhattan, noted that Staten Islanders had often felt that theirs was "the forgotten borough." But he vowed that it "won't be forgotten under a Thompson administration." He said he would reduce the $15 toll on the Verrazano (it is $15 now, and set to go up to $20 in 2017) and offset the cost by reinstating a commuter tax and increasing automobile registration fees for heavy vehicles. 
Mr. Thompson also said he would create a new position, a deputy mayor of infrastructure, to oversee rebuilding areas damaged by Hurricane Sandy.
Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker and a Manhattan resident, said that rebuilding in response to the hurricane would be her first priority. Ms. Quinn said homeowners in areas of Staten Island hit by the storm should be eligible to sell their homes to the city or state if they did not want to return to them, and she proposed burying power lines.
She also said that she would spur the island's economy by creating a regional council charged with expanding New York City's volume of exports and guiding the new export business to Staten Island's waterfront.
John C. Liu, the current comptroller and a Queens resident, promised to build a public hospital on the island, which currently does not have one. He also said he would expand express bus service on the island, and move forward with a proposed light-rail project on the western shore that would connect it with Hudson-Bergen Light Rail system in New Jersey.
To prepare for future major storms, Mr. Liu said the city should consider building sea walls in New York Harbor to protect Staten Island. He also said that should he become mayor, he would visit Staten Island so much that "you'll think that I'm living here."
Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate and a Brooklyn resident, also expressed concern about the island's lack of a public hospital but said the best solution might be for the city to provide support to the borough's private hospitals to encourage them to expand services. He expressed cautious support for a proposal to build the world's largest Ferris wheel near the St. George Ferry Terminal, saying it could encourage tourism. He also proposed reviving a plan for a rail line along the island's northern shore, to connect with the ferry terminal.
And Sal F. Albanese, a former councilman from Brooklyn, also promised to address the toll on the Verrazano Bridge, which he likened to "being mugged without a gun." He personalized the toll issue with a slightly shaggy dog-like story about buying an elliptical machine at Dick's Sporting Goods on the island, and learning that the store was unable to deliver it to his Bay Ridge home on the appointed day; its truck had already made one trip to Brooklyn, and could not afford to pay the cost of the toll again.

HEADLINE: Nathan Azrin, 82, a Pioneer In Changing Behaviors, Dies

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
When Nathan Azrin was appointed director of treatment development at Anna State Hospital in Illinois in 1958, a majority of the patients he was expected to treat were schizophrenic, emotionally withdrawn and in many cases mute after years in institutions. Few bothered getting dressed, spending their days in hospital gowns.
Getting his patients to dress, Dr. Azrin decided, would be his first treatment. 
The system that he and a colleague developed for doing that -- a bartering process that they described as ''token economics'' -- not only persuaded Anna State's residents to get dressed every day, but also changed the way psychologists approached behavior-changing techniques across a wide spectrum of human experience. It has been used in treatments for autism, couples therapy, military training, employee supervision, prisoner management, special education, athletic coaching and consumer marketing.
Dr. Azrin, who died on March 29 in Pompano Beach, Fla., at 82, did not invent the principles that he and the colleague, Teodoro Ayllon, applied in their work at Anna State, in Anna, Ill. The ideas were developed by Dr. Azrin's mentor at Harvard, the behavioral pioneer B. F. Skinner, working mainly with rats. But he was among the first psychologists to show that human behavior could be changed in much the same way as Skinner had changed that of rats.
Dr. Azrin and Dr. Ayllon laid out their evidence in 1968 in ''The Token Economy,'' which is considered one of behavioral psychology's foundational texts.
Dr. Azrin received far more attention for a book he wrote in 1974 with Richard M. Foxx, applying token economics to the behavior modification everybody has heard of. That book, ''Toilet Training in Less Than a Day,'' sold more than three million copies. Some of its advice about conditioning children was criticized as overly harsh.
In a review in The New York Times, the psychologist Eda LeShan wrote of the method: ''Although one is supposed to be kind and patient, it's all done by forcing fluids (with things like salty potato chips and orange soda) and conditioned reflexes, leaving out such minor considerations as fears and fantasies, love-hate feelings, dependency and rebellion -- the whole unconscious, which we have been struggling so hard to understand. It is an immoral book.''
But the less controversial, and less known, ''Token Economy,'' written for a professional readership, had the more profound influence.
''It would be difficult to name a population that wasn't affected by his work -- the young, the old, the professional athlete, the developmentally disabled,'' said Alan Kazdin, a former president of the American Psychological Association and a professor of psychology and child psychiatry at Yale.
In Dr. Azrin's token economy, people barter for rewards, or tokens, by modifying their behavior in incremental steps. He and Dr. Ayllon introduced the system to female patients at Anna State, giving them plastic tokens, each embossed with the words ''one gift.'' The reward system included a token-operated television and a token-operated turnstile installed at the entrance to the television room. Patients earned one or more tokens for dressing themselves, the number depending on the level of care they showed in their dress.
Eventually most patients were dressing themselves, some were doing simple household chores and a few were running a kind of token-exchange store on the ward, offering special items like lipstick and hair rollers.
''These patients had previously been regarded as deranged, incapable of learning,'' Dr. Ayllon said in an interview on Thursday. ''Yet they learned the system rather quickly.''
At first, some wore their undergarments over their clothing. By awarding more tokens for dressing properly than for dressing bizarrely, Dr. Ayllon said, those patients soon corrected their mistakes.
Dr. Azrin believed that any behavior could be modified once it was understood as a chain of component parts. ''To get someone dressed, for example, requires putting on a shirt,'' Dr. Azrin said in a recent interview. ''But first, the person must reach for the shirt. And before that, the person must get up and go toward it. And even more basically, you need to say to the person, 'Look at me,' and get them to make eye contact.''
Nathan Harold Azrin was born on Nov. 26, 1930, in Boston, the son of Harry Azrin, a grocer, and the former Esther Alper. He graduated from Boston University in 1951 and received a Ph.D. in psychology from Harvard in 1956.
After beginning his research in Boston, he was appointed a professor of psychology at Southern Illinois University and research director in the Illinois Department of Mental Health. From 1958 to 1980 he was the director of treatment at Anna State Hospital, now known as Choate Mental Health and Development Center.
He was a professor of psychology at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., from 1980 until 2010, when he was named a professor emeritus. He retired last month. His son David said his death was caused by complications of cancer.
Besides David, his survivors include his wife, Victoria; a daughter, Rachel Azrin; two other sons, Michael and Richard; seven grandchildren; three sisters, Violet Baker, Dorothy Marden and Gertrude Drobnis; and a brother, Morris.
For all the scholarship behind the work -- he published scores of research articles and a half-dozen books, and edited many scientific journals -- Dr. Azrin said behavior modification was actually quite easy to achieve.
''It seems ridiculously simple, but once you're aware of how your habit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you're halfway to changing it,'' he said. ''It seems like it should be more complex. The truth is, the brain can be reprogrammed. You just have to be deliberate about it.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Izak Senbahar

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Senbahar, 54, is the president of the Alexico Group, a New York developer of luxury hotels and condominiums. The company also provides property management services for its buildings.
Alexico owns the landmark Mark hotel on the Upper East Side and is currently a developer of 56 Leonard Street in TriBeCa, a skyscraper condominium designed by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron.
Interview conducted and condensed by 
VIVIAN MARINO
Q. What's your main role at Alexico?
A. I just do everything: copy, paperwork, filing.
I'm very hands-on. It's a fault. I have a hard time delegating, but I'm working on it. I'm working on so many things in my personality -- by the time I expire I'll be perfect.
Q. How is business going so far this year?
A. Surprisingly well. We just started sales at 56 Leonard, and we already have a little over $500 million in sales.
Q. What percentage of the 145-unit building is that?
A. Almost 73 percent in a matter of eight weeks. As of April 16 there were 106 contracts.
I was very surprised by the velocity.
Q. What kind of prices are you getting per square foot?
A. It's a little over $3,000. We think it's a pretty good value play for the product. It's really a superior building.
Q. The building looks like a work of art in the renderings.
A. It's a Herzog & de Meuron stack of houses, and it's sitting in an Anish Kapoor sculpture, which is the first public work that he's doing in New York.
Q. Have you gotten much foreign interest?
A. I was expecting more international because there are a lot of architectural buffs. This building was in the making for six, seven years and people have been following it. But I'm seeing a lot of New Yorkers -- a lot of people from TriBeCa and downtown who want to upgrade and get more bedrooms. We have 4,000, 5,000 and 7,000 square feet, and we have 10 penthouses. There's interest from Wall Street executives -- those kinds of guys.
Q. The recession had derailed your earlier plans.
A. We bought the land in 2006. The foundation was completed by June 2008, and at that time we were getting our cranes ready. We opened up sales the day Lehman collapsed. In a few weeks we presumed our construction loan was not going to go through; we didn't think it's a good market to be in and we put it on hold. A year and a half ago we started to see the signals: the economy was changing. We're pouring the second floor.
Q. When do you expect the building to be complete?
A. July 2015.
Q. There were financial issues with your partnership in the Alex Hotel and Flatotel as well.
A. Those we gave back. Because of certain legalities it went through bankruptcy, but it was prepackaged bankruptcy. It was transferring the assets to the banks; it was a technical process. We decided to just walk away from them. It started three years ago and it was finalized last year.
Q. How are things at the recently renovated Mark hotel, particularly with the apartment sales?
A. A year and a half to two years ago we restructured with Deutsche Bank, and the Mark is doing amazing. We have seven more apartments to sell and that's about it. We had 42 at first and then we dropped it down to 12. You see, when we started, the hotel business wasn't that good either. But now the hotel business is so good that we had 31 studios to two-bedrooms, which were going to be part of our sales program, and we put it back into the hotel program.
We now want to expand the brand.
We're working on assemblages for a hotel and condo. We're trying to buy a hotel and rebrand it. It's between Midtown and uptown. I don't want to do hybrids anymore: either it's a condo or a hotel, and I enjoy luxury.
Q. I understand you recently sold your apartment at the Mark for $10.5 million
A. My wife decorated it. We never lived there. We live next to the Guggenheim.
Q. Would you ever consider moving to 56 Leonard?
A. I've been thinking about it, but my wife doesn't want to go downtown.
Q. Your wife, Sarah, is somewhat of a socialite. Would you consider yourself one, too?
A. No, no. I'm a workaholic.
Q. What do you do for fun?
A. I look at real estate. That's what I do.

HEADLINE: Accord Would Regulate Fishing in Arctic Waters

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- It was once protected by ice. Now regulation will have to do the work.
The governments of the five countries with coastline on the Arctic have concluded that enough of the polar ice cap now melts regularly in the summertime that an agreement regulating commercial fishing near the North Pole is warranted.
Talks are scheduled for later this month among diplomats and fisheries officials from Norway, Denmark, Canada, the United States and Russia. Most concern is focused on newly ice-free waters above the Bering Strait, above the exclusive economic zones of Russia and the United States, and now accessible to trawler fleets from hungry Pacific Ocean nations like China and Japan. 
An accord would protect the open water until the fish stocks there can be more fully studied.
Though supported by conservationists, the agreement's principal intention is not to conserve this new fish habitat, formed by the receding of polar ice as the world warms up. The intention of an accord, backed by fishing industries in the coastal nations, is to manage for commercial exploitation any stocks of fish that already inhabit the ocean but used to live under the ice, like Arctic cod, as well as fish that may migrate into the new ice-free zone from farther south, as the ocean warms.
Russia had been a holdout in the negotiations, started by the United States five years ago. But the upper chamber of Russia's Parliament, the Federation Council, signaled support for the agreement last year. Talks are scheduled to begin on April 29 in Washington, the State Department has confirmed.
If successful, it will represent the third such accord struck by countries in the far north to manage the commercial development and industrialization of the region, which is expected to increase with global warming.
The other two agreements reached so far regulate search and rescue, and the response to oil spills as new drilling acreage and shipping lanes open up near the coasts.
The fishing accord would regulate commercial harvests in an area farther offshore -- in the so-called doughnut hole of the Arctic Ocean. This is a Texas-size area of international water that includes the North Pole and is encircled by the exclusive economic zones of the coastal countries.
That the center of the Arctic Ocean was unregulated was hardly a concern when it was an icebound backwater. That is changing. Last summer, 40 percent of the central Arctic Ocean melted.
In fact, the agreement is unusual for protecting a huge area from human exploitation before people have had much chance to exploit it; before the last decade, scientists estimate, the doughnut hole was icebound for about 100,000 years
''Five countries are talking about solving a problem before it starts,'' Scott Highleyman, the director of Arctic programs at the Pew Charitable Trust, which supports the fishing moratorium, said in a telephone interview.
''How often do we look back at something and say 'Gee, if we'd only thought of that,''' he said. ''As somebody who works on natural resources issues, this is very refreshing. We are fixing something before it is broken.''
Dmitry M. Glazov, a whale biologist at the Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution and an authority on the marine ecosystem of the ice floes, said the waters teem with cod, herring, Greenland sharks, whales, walruses, seals and polar bears. It is unclear, though, whether the fish stocks are large enough to support a commercial fishery.
Advocates of a conservation agreement say that until the new ice-free area created by global warming is fully studied, it should be preserved. Diplomats agree that the region should be protected from fishing fleets until scientists have had a chance to assess its marine populations.
''We want any fishing that takes place there to be properly managed, to maintain it for commercial purposes,'' one diplomat from an Arctic nation involved in the talks said. ''Are there fisheries in the future that are moving north as the waters are warming and the ice is receding? The scientists cannot say with certainty now.''
The part of the doughnut hole that is thawing most quickly in the eastern Arctic, above Alaska and the Russian region of Chukotka, is well within the range of industrial fishing fleets in Asia.
Chinese trawlers fish for krill in Antarctic waters, about 7,500 miles from China. The Arctic Ocean international zone is only about 5,000 miles from the Chinese coast, according to maps prepared by a Russian fisheries journal, Rybnye Resorsi.

HEADLINE: Study That Set Tone for Austerity Is Challenged

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
8:10 p.m. | Updated WASHINGTON -- In recent years, policy makers in Europe and the United States have fastened on the notion that reaching a certain heavy burden of debt would threaten future economic health -- often to justify austerity budgets that increased unemployment and sapped economic strength in the here and now.
But now some economists are challenging the very foundations of that idea, raising questions about whether such a debt threshold even exists and setting off a fierce debate that flared up on Tuesday across the Internet about whether potentially flawed research is at least partly responsible for the slow growth that has bedeviled most advanced industrial countries since the recovery from the financial crisis began in 2009. 
The debate comes at a particularly perilous time, as economic officials from the United States and other countries gather for the annual spring meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington, where many are expected to urge high-debt Europe to ease up on its commitment to austerity in the face of rising unemployment and new economic contractions.
The controversy stems from a provocative new paper by economists at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst that claims to have found some basic errors in one of the most pathbreaking and influential economic studies to come out in the last few years.
That was a 2010 research paper by Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard, also authors of a best seller, ''This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.'' The economists, analyzing 3,700 separate economic observations, found little relationship between growth and debt for countries with debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratios of 90 percent or less. But for countries with debt loads equivalent to or greater than 90 percent of annual economic output, ''median growth rates fall by 1 percent, and average growth falls considerably more.''
Many politicians interpreted the research as showing a direct relationship between debt and growth. If a country reached a debt burden of more than 90 percent of its annual economic output, the logic went, it would quickly fall into a debt trap that would leave it struggling to grow in the coming years. Prominent politicians -- including Olli Rehn of the European Commission and Representative Paul D. Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee -- cited it as a reason to try to impose major budget cuts.
The Harvard economists' research was always more nuanced about the causal relationship between debt and growth than the popular view. Some economists expressed skepticism of the ''threshold'' theory to begin with. And many others noted how hard it could be to draw straight lines between debt and economic growth, given the panoply of factors at work.
But now, Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in trying to replicate the Reinhart-Rogoff results, are challenging the conclusions for a different reason. They say they found some simple miscalculations or data exclusions that sharply altered the ultimate results. According to their rerunning of the figures, ''the average real G.D.P. growth rate for countries carrying a public debt-to-G.D.P. ratio of over 90 percent is actually 2.2 percent, not --0.1 percent,'' they write. In other words, heavy debts were not associated with the malaise that Professors Reinhart and Rogoff -- and much of the world's economic elite -- thought that they were.
The new paper, released this week, has set off a storm within the economics profession, with some commentators even arguing that it undermines the austerity policies that have proved so prevalent in the last few years.
''How much unemployment was caused by Reinhart and Rogoff's arithmetic mistake?'' asked Dean Baker of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, for instance.
But in interviews, several economic experts cautioned that it would take time to sort out the statistical implications of any problems in the highly technical research.
''I think it's totally fair to say it's embarrassing,'' said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan, who added that he had not had the chance to study the results and noted that debates over supposed statistical problems were common in the profession. ''But the mistakes that are most embarrassing are the least consequential'' to Professor Reinhart and Rogoff's conclusion, he added.
Other experts said that separate pieces of research had found similar results to the Harvard professors' paper, using alternative data sets and significantly strengthening the argument that higher-debt economies suffered from slower growth. Those include studies by the I.M.F., the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Bank for International Settlements.
''There's nothing about this that will change my view of the universe,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and prominent Republican economist. ''The sun still rises in the east. It sets in the west. And a lot of debt is still bad.''
In an e-mailed statement, Professors Reinhart and Rogoff did not directly address the assertions of mathematical errors, and noted that they had only just started to sift through the new paper. But they argued that the Amherst authors had also found lower growth rates when a country had debts equivalent to or greater than 90 percent of annual economic output. ''It is hard to see how one can interpret these tables and individual country results as showing that public debt overhang over 90 percent is clearly benign,'' they wrote.
The seemingly esoteric debate within the economics profession has collided this week with a broader challenge to excessive budget-cutting in countries around the world. The I.M.F. cautioned Washington against cutting its budget too fast, too soon, even as it saw the American economy strengthening. And on Tuesday, Olivier Blanchard, the fund's chief economist, warned that Britain was ''playing with fire'' with its austerity policy.
Professors Reinhart and Rogoff ''are right to say the basic structure of the result stands,'' Professor Wolfers said. ''The authors of the critique are right to say its force is lessened.''
The debate, he added, is far from over.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: More College Applicants Aren't Welcome Till Winter

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER

 BODY:
Elizabeth Bricker of Rumson, N.J., was still half-asleep when her mother came into her room two weeks ago carrying an envelope from the University of Southern California. Even through the haze of spring break, she could see that the envelope was big -- big enough to mean she had gotten in. ''I was so excited,'' she recalled. ''Then I opened it and I read the letter and I was like, oh no! I started to cry.''
She had been admitted, but not for the fall of 2013. She was being offered a spot one semester down the road, in January 2014. ''I never heard of anyone being accepted in the spring,'' she said. 
Elizabeth was worried that accepting the offer would leave her out of sync with her peers, all of whom were gearing up to start college life in September. But as it turned out, her two best friends got the same offer from their first-choice colleges, too.
So did a lot of other students across the country.
Exact numbers are not available, but according to the National Association for College Admission Counseling, over the last few years more and more colleges have been sending out a new kind of acceptance letter, inviting some applicants to wait until the new year before showing up.
Back in 2001, when U.S.C. started doing it, Timothy Brunold, the director of admissions, said he assumed the university was a pioneer. Now the list includes, among others, Skidmore College, Hamilton College, Brandeis University, the University of Miami, Northeastern University, Elon University in North Carolina and Middlebury College (which actually beat U.S.C. to the punch by a few decades).
They all have their own variation on the theme. Some, like Middlebury, in Vermont, allow students to request second-semester admissions; some make the decision for the students. Hamilton, in Clinton, N.Y., does not enroll students until they arrive on campus in the spring; Skidmore, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and Northeastern, in Boston, enroll them right away but direct them to spend their fall semester at a designated program abroad.
But all are motivated by the same basic arithmetic: between freshman-year attrition and junior-year abroad programs, campus populations drop off after the first few months of college each year. ''With the economy the way it is, they need to be doing what they can to get tuition income,'' said Scott G. Chrysler Jr., a college counselor in Louisiana who is active in the national group's admissions practices committee. ''An empty seat is not generating any income.''
The arrangement may not be profitable for everyone, warns Tom Weede, chairman of the committee. ''Often the letter says, 'We encourage you to enroll in another school and take core-related classes,' '' he said. ''Well, at the other school, if you want financial aid you have to be a full-time student. The school that takes you doesn't know you're just going to be there for a semester. So it creates a built-in retention problem at a moment we're calling for more accountability and more numbers about outcomes like retention.''
As fast as the practice may be growing, it is still unknown to most college applicants, and even to many guidance counselors. At Brandeis University, which now enrolls 100 or so students for midyear arrival, the dean of admissions, Mark Spencer, said some applicants were so rattled by the offer that they begged to be placed on the fall waiting list instead. ''I say, 'Wait, you want me to un-admit you?' '' Mr. Spencer said.
To address students' concerns, many of these colleges set up special midyear open houses, or enlist former midyear arrivals to call their potential successors and talk about how it all works. And when that spring semester rolls around, these colleges generally offer midyear orientations, modeled on the welcome-to-campus events that greet most first-year students.
High school seniors looking to arrive at U.S.C. next spring are already chatting with one another on a Facebook page that the university set up for them. And at Hamilton, which last year enrolled about 10 percent of its incoming class for spring semester, everyone gets a Hamilton e-mail account and password, even those who won't arrive on campus for a few more months.
At Middlebury College, where one-sixth of the class arrives for the first time in February, Greg Buckles, dean of admissions, said, ''We kind of cast about for these 'Febby' qualities,'' like risk-taking, entrepreneurial spirit and a drive to lead.
Jessye Kass, a senior at Brandeis, said she was ''very upset'' when she was first offered admission for the spring semester. ''I called and demanded to be put in the fall class,'' she recalled. When that did not work she raised some money and went to volunteer in Ghana.
On the strength of that experience she has since started an organization to promote arts education in Ghanaian schools. In a few weeks she will graduate with dual majors -- anthropology as well as African and African-American Studies -- and dual minors in social justice and social policy as well as peace conflict and coexistence studies, as well as a Fulbright scholarship. She said none of it would have happened if it were not for that deferred semester.
Ms. Kass took extra courses along the way in order to graduate with a majority of her class. Other midyear arrivals use advanced placement credits from high school, or transfer credits from their fall semester at another college. But some who arrive midyear and then end up graduating midyear say that schedule has a hidden advantage: it gives them a few months' running start before the much larger mass of spring graduates hits the job market.
At Middlebury, midyear graduation brings another difference. Unlike their classmates who must sweat through their late-May ceremonies, sticky in an academic gown, the Febbies get to graduate in the middle of winter, at the top of a big hill. And then they zoom down it together, on skis.

HEADLINE: Economic Growth Is Seen as Weakening

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Consumer prices fell in March for the first time in four months and industrial production slipped, strengthening the argument for the Federal Reserve Board to maintain its monetary stimulus to speed up economic growth. 
Other data released on Tuesday suggested that the housing market recovery was losing momentum, even though builders started work on new homes at an annual rate of more than one million units for the first time since June 2008.
''For the Fed, it's business as usual,'' said Millan Mulraine, senior economist at TD Securities. ''There is not likely to be an acceleration in growth momentum that would cause them to shift their policy stance anytime soon.''
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index edged down 0.2 percent last month as gasoline prices tumbled, unwinding some of February's 0.7 percent increase. Economists expected a flat reading.
Underscoring the benign inflation environment, consumer prices rose just 1.5 percent in the 12 months through March -- the smallest increase since July. Prices increased 2 percent year-on-year in February.
Stripping out volatile energy and food costs, the so-called core C.P.I. was up only 0.1 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in February. That lowered the 12-month increase to 1.9 percent in March from 2.0 percent in February.
A separate report from the Fed showed that production at the nation's factories decreased 0.1 percent after advancing 0.9 percent in February. The decline was fairly broad-based, with output dropping for primary metals and electronics. Automobile assembly, however, increased.
Despite the factory weakness, overall industrial production rose 0.4 percent last month, mainly because of a jump in utilities' output.
Economic data for January and February have suggested growth accelerated in the first quarter after activity almost stalled in the final three months of 2012.
But in a replay of the previous two years, the economy appears to have hit a speed bump at the end of the quarter, with data ranging from employment to retail sales and manufacturing weakening significantly in March.
Much of the weakness is blamed on higher taxes and deep government spending cuts put in place in Washington.
''We definitely see the second quarter slowing from the first in terms of overall growth across many of the sectors. Obviously, the drag from fiscal policy is playing into this a little bit,'' said Erik Johnson, senior United States economist at IHS Global Insight.
A third report from the Commerce Department showed that housing starts rose 7.0 percent last month to a 1.04 million-unit annual rate, the highest in nearly five years.
The increase in home building was driven by the volatile multifamily sector, while groundbreaking for single-family units fell. In addition, permits for future construction tumbled 3.9 percent -- reversing February's gain.
That suggested a slowdown in housing activity, coming on the heels of a report on Monday that showed a third consecutive decline in homebuilders' confidence in April.
''The decline in single starts and permits is consistent with recent hints the housing recovery has lost some momentum,'' said David Sloan, senior economist at 4Cast Ltd.

HEADLINE: An Emphasis on Newton's Laws (and a Little Lawlessness)

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- During the years after the Exploratorium opened in 1969 in the ramshackle Palace of Fine Arts here, did it ever think that the world had passed it by? At first, it was a countercultural revelation to start a science museum in which every visitor was treated like a chalk-smeared genius carrying out experiments. There were no objects in display cases, no signs saying, ''Don't touch.'' Every exhibit was handmade on site and was meant to look it.
Since then, so much has changed. Interactivity in museums has become the rule. Science centers have proliferated. And, according to the Exploratorium, 80 percent of them ''use Exploratorium exhibits, programs or ideas.'' But they have also gone much further. Science centers are now engines of economic development, incorporating enormous Imax theaters into immense, environmentally savvy buildings, loudly proclaiming pop attractions and effects-laden displays.
Having influenced such a development, would the Exploratorium now be influenced in turn? It might have seemed that way when the Exploratorium announced that it was planning to move to Piers 15 and 17 along the Embarcadero, between the tourist meccas of Fisherman's Wharf and the Ferry Building. 
The new location would allow double the museum's annual half-million visitors. It would triple display space to 330,000 square feet. The new $220 million building, designed by EHDD architects, would be the length of three football fields. It would feature a fine restaurant overlooking the bay. It would set a goal of producing as much energy as it consumed, using bay water for heating and cooling, and solar panels for power. But was there anyone who cared for the old place who was not just a little nervous about what might be lost?
No need. The new home, with all of those characteristics (and a 200-seat cabaret), is opening on Wednesday, and while it doesn't deserve unalloyed acclaim, the achievement is remarkable. Under its executive director, Dennis Bartels, the Exploratorium has preserved and expanded what it was when the physicist Frank Oppenheimer created it. It remains the most important science museum to have opened since the mid-20th century because of the nature of its exhibits, its wide-ranging influence and its sophisticated teacher training program.
Yet the new Exploratorium remains eccentrically original. Technology is scarce. There are few video screens. There are fewer computers. There are circuits but no evident circuit boards. Woodworking and metalworking take place on the museum floor. There are more than 600 exhibits, but the emphasis remains on the laws of physics and motion, elementary principles of perception, and elegantly designed machines that conceal nothing.
You can still play with pendulums that were designed for the museum's original opening. You can spin disks atop a whirling wheel; you can try to get a bicycle's pedals to move using a sequence of buttons; you can gaze at the physicality of inverted reflections created by a finely polished parabolic mirror; you can position toy robots to create spinning animations.
And while Rob Semper, the director of programs, and Thomas Rockwell, the director of exhibits, have guided the Exploratorium into new areas inspired by the new setting, including a handsome glass-enclosed ''observatory'' offering a panoramic view of the bay; expanded its biological displays to include extensive details about plankton and plant life; and extended its terrain further into the social sciences, the museum remains as Oppenheimer first envisioned it: a playground of science and perception.
The science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke said that any sufficiently advanced technology was indistinguishable from magic. But this is totally counter to the Exploratorium's ambitions. Here, sufficiently well-understood science has nothing magical about it. Science is comprehended not through abstract principles but through concrete experience. It is revealed not through speculation but through manipulation. You learn by exploring.
Expectations for the new material, then, are high. The setting is dramatic, and 1.5 acres of public space surround Pier 15. (The museum eventually plans to expand into the adjacent Pier 17.) A series of free outdoor exhibitions also gives some sense of the museum's character. A ''Rickshaw Obscura'' allows visitors to climb inside a dark chamber mounted on a bicycle cart to see an upside-down outdoor vista projected against a wall; the image, produced by a pinhole, demonstrates the workings of a classic camera obscura.
Another effective display: a 150-foot-long bridge between the piers has been temporarily outfitted by the artist Fujiko Nakaya with almost 900 jets from which fog is occasionally propelled, creating an immersive mist; it is eerily provocative, emerging in midday sunlight.
But not everything is as inspired. The pier also contains four large transparent discs filled with water and samples of gravel and sand from the bay. Turn the discs, and swirling waves demonstrate the underwater motion of sediment. The results are not particularly revealing or engrossing.
And while it is intriguing to see projections on a 3-D relief model of the bay showing, say, changing salinity levels, this is routine science center stuff, offering none of the Exploratorium's participatory playfulness. The extensive explorations of plankton life could also appear nearly anywhere.
Most important, the expansion into some realms seems premature. A temporary exhibition, ''The Changing Face of What Is Normal: Mental Health,'' is mounted in the new gallery of human behavior. It includes the personal effects of patients from Willard Psychiatric Center in New York State, which was decommissioned in 1995. The show is partly pegged to the release of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The exhibition, we are told, ''explores the notion that normal is a subjective, dynamic, socially driven idea.''
We are clearly meant to find the institution unpleasant: artifacts are closed in behind chicken wire, and a reproduction of a Utica Crib -- a wooden, body-long restraint -- suggests one ''treatment'' used. We also seem to be expected to find some comfort in an apparently more enlightened contemporary vision of normality.
But many of the case histories lead in other directions. Lawrence M., an Austrian immigrant born in 1878, was hospitalized at Willard as a manic depressive for much of his life. But he apparently grew to live in contentment as the hospital's gravedigger and was described in 1965 as ''a well-liked, hard-working, quite original old man.''
Frank C., a West Virginian, was discharged from the Army in 1942 because of his ''mental condition'' and was diagnosed with ''dementia praecox.'' But today, we are told (without real explanation), his case suggests that ''he may also have been deeply affected by racism, isolation, poverty and perhaps uncertainty about his sexual orientation'' -- which here seems a bit like a list of contemporary diagnostic formulas.
We emerge from this exhibition saddened by the artifacts and the lives, but without any coherent interpretation or insight. The show seems incomplete and overly manipulative.
Perhaps the Exploratorium also overextended itself. It is not, after all, really a science center, obliged to survey fields of knowledge. Many disciplines -- computer science, particle physics, medicine, genetics, the history of science -- have little place here. And exhibits become uninspiring when they deliver information instead of spurring investigation. Look instead at two recently released free Exploratorium apps for iPads, one dealing with sound, the other with color. They show with compact simplicity how even commonplace sensations become sources of insight. Or look at the Exploratorium itself: drink deep from the water fountain shaped like a toilet. Sit in a chair holding a spinning bicycle wheel. See whether you and three other visitors with incomplete controls can collaborate on a game of Pac-Man. Wear a set of headphones that seems to swap your right and left ears. Climb into a kaleidoscope.
Perhaps any sufficiently simple principle, if vividly experienced, really is indistinguishable from magic.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Lowers Estimates for Global Economic Growth for 2013

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With economic leaders gathering in Washington for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund spring meetings this week, the I.M.F. has nudged down its estimates for world growth in 2013.
In a periodic update to its economic projections, the fund said on Tuesday that it expected global growth of about 3.3 percent this year and 4 percent in 2014. That is a reduction of 0.2 percentage point since its January estimate for 2013; it did not change its estimate for next year's growth.
Still, the report underscored that financial conditions had improved markedly since last year, in no small part because of aggressive monetary easing undertaken by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank. 
Recession continues to afflict Europe, and the world still struggles with high unemployment, but the greatest risks -- in particular from the threat of a country's leaving the euro zone and from fiscal policy uncertainty in the United States -- have faded.
''Global prospects have improved again but the road to recovery in the advanced economies will remain bumpy,'' said the report, called the World Economic Outlook. ''Policy makers cannot afford to relax their efforts.''
The fund cut its projections of current-year growth for the euro zone economies of France, Italy and Spain, as well as for Britain, which has also carried out austerity policies and entered a period of economic contraction. I.M.F. officials have urged stronger European economies with lower borrowing costs, like Germany, to do more to foster growth across the entire region and to move more aggressively to finish a cross-border banking union to shore up investor confidence. The fund and many international economic officials, including Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, are expected to press Europe on its plans for growth again this week.
''Policy should use all prudent measures to support sluggish demand,'' the report said. ''However, the risks related to high sovereign debt limit the fiscal policy room to maneuver. There is no silver bullet to address all the concerns about demand and debt.''
The fund warned that ''markets may have moved ahead of the real economy'' and noted that improved financial conditions had not, in many cases, translated to better access to credit for consumers and businesses, with lending standards remaining tight. In the euro area, indeed, credit continues to contract and lending conditions continue to tighten, the I.M.F. said, reflecting in part ''the poor macroeconomic outlook for the region as a whole.''
The fund lowered its estimate of United States growth this year to 1.9 percent, down 0.2 percentage point from its January forecast. While Washington had avoided falling over the ''fiscal cliff,'' the I.M.F. said that the United States had proved too aggressive in carrying out budget cuts, given its still-sluggish rates of growth and high unemployment levels. It said it anticipated that the across-the-board $85 billion in budget cuts known as sequestration would push down growth levels this year and beyond.
''The growth figure for the United States for 2013 may not seem very high, and indeed it is insufficient to make a large dent in the still-high unemployment rate,'' Olivier Blanchard, the fund's chief economist, said in the report. ''But it will be achieved in the face of a very strong, indeed overly strong, fiscal consolidation of about 1.8 percent of G.D.P. Underlying private demand is actually strong, spurred in part by the anticipation of low policy rates under the Federal Reserve's 'forward guidance' and by pent-up demand for housing and durables.''
The fund raised its estimate of growth for Japan, which has recently undertaken an aggressive round of fiscal and monetary stimulus to aid its slow-growing economy. Still, the I.M.F. expects an economic growth rate of only about 1.5 percent for this year and next for Japan.
Tokyo's assertive monetary easing -- which has pushed down the value of the yen, thus aiding the country's exports -- has reignited concerns about competitive devaluation, often referred to as currency wars. In the report, the fund acknowledged concerns over Japan's policy, but called the recent bout of currency complaints ''overblown.''

HEADLINE: When Dinner Has a Gleam in Its Eye

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Bundled up on a wind-whipped day, about 30 people lined up outside a restaurant takeout window here, waiting for rabbit heads.
For guests in the main dining room, a video explained how to eat the fist-size heads. Su Yong, the restaurant's enthusiastic chef and star of the video, demonstrated by pulling open the rabbit's mouth and separating the jaw from the skull before splitting the jawbone in two and sucking off the succulent meat. In case there was any confusion, brochures with diagrams rested on each table.
Mr. Su is a sort of rabbit head evangelist, drawing celebrities to his restaurant, Old Street Rabbit, to help drum up crowds. He holds aloft one half of a tiny jawbone, explaining that it can be employed as a pick, and then uses the incisor to scoop out an eye, window to the bunny's soul. 
Food fashions come and go, but perhaps the oddest and most obscure can be found in China. Scorpions and dogs made comebacks after the long culinary dry spell of the Mao years. Eating animal heads, preferably heavily spiced, is the latest repast to enjoy a growth in popularity. This isn't novelty food; rather, it's much-loved local street food with deep cultural roots, which has spread from the provinces into China's biggest cities.
Few things throw the differences between cultures into such stark relief as what people eat. Frogs and snails in France, offal-and-oat-stuffed stomachs in Scotland, pigs' feet in Germany -- latter-day Americans have long made fun of the specialties served by their European cousins. But in China, cat and rat and donkey penis can give the American palate pause.
Or even some Chinese palates. Thanks to China's decades-long economic boom, the increasingly cosmopolitan, educated and urban-bred young are drifting away from their rustic culinary roots. But that same boom is driving a culinary revival, with chefs rediscovering dishes that hadn't been seen for decades. Franchising, licensing and outright copycatting, meanwhile, have spread many regional specialties to the cities.
No one can pinpoint when the Chinese took a liking to eating animal heads. It began, no doubt, as peasant food. Meat was a rare and expensive treat, so people developed a taste for the bits that wealthier classes discarded. This, coupled with repeated famine, accounts for most of what Westerners regard as the odder dishes on Chinese menus. (Of course, people eat animal heads elsewhere, but they generally are rendered unrecognizable before they are delivered to the table.)
While pig heads, goat heads and even dog heads are eaten in China, the reigning triumvirate is fish, duck and rabbit, each of which has restaurants devoted to its preparation.
Fish heads have the longest history and widest acceptance, at least in part because they don't come from mammals. Restaurants offer regional seasonings ranging from the heavy soy-based sauces typical of China's northeast, to the fiery spices popular in Hunan and Sichuan provinces, to the milder ginger and scallion flavors common to the southern coast. These aren't narrow, bony fish faces, but the big, meaty front ends of fathead carp, which offer plenty to eat. One head is enough for two people.
Eating rabbit head, meanwhile, is a messy business, so much so that some diners are supplied with aprons and plastic gloves. Anecdotal accounts credit a woman named Chen from a suburb of the provincial Sichuan capital of Chengdu with popularizing spicy rabbit head in the 1990s, much as a pocked-face woman named Chen from a Chengdu suburb popularized spicy tofu (the now-ubiquitous mapo doufu) earlier in the century.
The more-recent Mrs. Chen, a factory worker in the Chengdu suburb of Shuangliu, opened a small hot-pot restaurant to supplement her income, and one day dropped some of the rabbit heads that her son loved to eat into the spicy soup. What came out has been called ''old mother rabbit head'' ever since.
So popular was the dish that she named her restaurant Old Mother Rabbit Head. It is now one of the most famous rabbit-head establishments in Sichuan. Imitators sprang up around the country, prompting the restaurant to put up a sign stating that it is the ''one and only'' Old Mother Rabbit Head restaurant and warning that there are no branches.
Mr. Su, the chef at the Old Street Rabbit restaurant in Beijing, said that he learned to cook rabbit head with Old Mother Chen herself, now in her 70s. A rabbit head connoisseur if ever there was one, Mr. Su says his restaurant serves 3,000 rabbit heads a day.
But rabbit heads are a niche dish compared with the popularity of duck heads, which spread from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the spicy heads are a local specialty. Duck-head restaurants range from full-service tablecloth establishments to simple shops where beer and a bowl of split duck skulls are the main fare. The chefs of Pang Xijing, who wears faux Chanel earrings and a fake-fur-collar parka, dish up 300 heads a day from the stark storefront furnished with red vinyl booths.
Ms. Pang buys cases of frozen heads from a local market, then has her chefs thaw them under running water for six hours to leach them of ''bad smells'' before simmering them in a spicy soup. The heads are split lengthwise and stir-fried in a mixture of dry herbs and spices. A bowl of seven heads costs 62 yuan, or about $10.
What does it all taste like? Fish heads are not fishy, but small bones abound. The brain and the eye, which some regard as treats, are acquired tastes. Rabbit heads, meanwhile, come in two flavors: numbingly hot and seasoned with five spices. The meat -- predictably -- tastes like the dark meat of chicken. The eyes, brain, tongue and soft palate, which are presented by Mr. Su as the most delectable morsels, are more about texture than taste.
Duck heads might be the most appealing to a Western palate. Eating one is not unlike eating a super spicy chicken wing (except for the beak and that accusing eye).
And for those who can't decide, the signature snack in Quzhou, a town south of Shanghai, is ''three heads, one foot,'' or a rabbit head, a duck head and a fish head served on one plate with two goose feet.

HEADLINE: The False Alarm Over U.S. Fertility

BYLINE: By DEREK S. HOFF. 
Derek S. Hoff, an associate professor of history at Kansas State University, is the author of ''The State and the Stork: The Population Debate and Policy Making in U.S. History.''

 BODY:
MANHATTAN, Kan.
AS a bipartisan group of senators prepares to release its plan for comprehensive immigration reform, a curious argument is emerging from across the political spectrum: the United States needs immigration to make up for its declining birthrate.
''Over the next three decades, annual population growth for the working-age population will be less than a third of what it was over the last 60 years,'' President Obama's economic adviser Alan B. Krueger told the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in March. ''Given current trends, nearly all of the growth of the nation's working-age population in the next 40 years will be accounted for by immigrants and their children.'' 
Conservatives, including the anti-tax activist Grover G. Norquist, have embraced the argument. Last week, the American Action Forum, led by the Republican budget expert Douglas Holtz-Eakin, found that immigration legislation could raise the annual rate of economic growth by nearly 1 percentage point, partly because it would help with ''low U.S. birthrates.''
In a new book on United States-Mexico relations, Shannon K. O'Neil of the Council on Foreign Relations writes: ''Desperate to close the gaps in America's work force, in the next decade we may be urging Mexicans to come to the United States. In another new book, ''What to Expect When No One's Expecting: America's Coming Demographic Disaster,'' Jonathan V. Last of The Weekly Standard warns of a ''population implosion'' that will doom the economy to Japan-style stagnation.
These fears are hogwash.
Unlike many wealthy nations that will see their populations stabilize or decrease in coming decades, the United States, the world's third most populous country, is expected to grow -- to to 420.3 million by 2060 from 315.7 million people today. Our fertility rate (1.9 births per woman, slightly below the ''replacement rate'' of 2.1) has dipped since the Great Recession but is still among the highest of rich countries' and ties or exceeds fertility rates in middle-income countries like Brazil, Iran, Thailand and Vietnam.
It was conservatives who largely invented the ''aging crisis,'' during their 1970s ascendancy. Postwar prosperity had lifted life expectancy, and birthrates had fallen from their record highs during the baby boom, but conservatives exaggerated these trends to call for welfare state retrenchment: reductions in Social Security and Medicare benefits. Meanwhile, corporations backed the last successful immigration overhaul, in 1986, for the reasons they do now: their desire for a large supply of low-wage labor.
The proposed solution to the fabricated fertility crisis -- more babies -- helped bury the movement for ''zero population growth'' that environmental activists advocated in the late 1960s and early 1970s. After Roe v. Wade (1973), support for a smaller, or at least constant, American (and global) population withered. Conservatives feared losing credibility on their staunch opposition to abortion, while liberals feared being branded anti-immigrant, particularly as Hispanics and Asian-Americans began voting heavily for Democratic candidates.
Conservatives and liberals alike generally assume that population growth drives economic growth. But until the triumph of the new laissez-faire economics in the 1970s and 1980s, most economists agreed that what mattered was not the size of a population but its human capital and its savings, investment and consumption practices. Indeed, many mainstream economists argued that a smaller but more productive population would enhance growth and lead to a more just society. It is strange that we talk on one hand about an innovation- and knowledge-based economy while still thinking about economic growth in terms of sheer body count. Moderate levels of immigration can help us maintain a highly skilled work force, but so, too, can investing more in educating our young.
Environmentalists need the courage to discuss national population growth. They would be harkening back to a bipartisan tradition, one that cites not only air and water pollution but also quality of life: recreational access to open space and our duty to protect wilderness.
Some 70 percent of Americans recognize that global warming is a serious problem, and nearly half agree that humans are the main cause. But debate has focused on the 11 million undocumented immigrants, not the environmental implications of sustained large-scale legal immigration to one of the world's most energy-hogging nations.
The Salt Lake City area, where I live part time, occasionally records air pollution worse than Beijing's, thanks to a fast-growing population and mountains that can trap stagnant air in the Salt Lake Valley. Residents are increasingly demanding better policies to reduce driving and cut emissions, but few mention our ever expanding national population.
There is a population crisis -- not in America, but on a planet that is rapidly losing its ecological integrity and facing a new age of human-caused extinction. Neither the elderly nor the world's rising middle class, who rationally choose to have fewer children as their economies become less labor-intensive and as women gain more control over their bodies and reproductive choices, are to blame.
Politics and policy, not only demography, will ultimately shape the future of American society. Shoring up the welfare state on the backs of immigrants, including guest workers, is neither rational nor just. There are many reasons to re-examine America's immigration policies. But cynical calls for expanding our population at any cost should no play no role in the debate.

HEADLINE: Hospitals Profit From Surgical Mistakes, Study Finds

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY

 BODY:
Hospitals make money from their own mistakes because insurers pay them for the longer stays and extra care that patients need to treat surgical complications that could have been prevented, a new study finds.
Changing the payment system, to stop rewarding poor care, may help to bring down surgical complication rates, the researchers say. If the system does not change, hospitals have little incentive to improve: in fact, some will wind up losing money if they take better care of patients.
The study and an editorial were published Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The study authors are from the Boston Consulting Group, Harvard's schools of medicine and public health, and Texas Health Resources, a large nonprofit hospital system. 
The study is based on a detailed analysis of the records of 34,256 people who had surgery in 2010 at one of 12 hospitals run by Texas Health Resources. Of those patients, 1,820 had one or more complications that could have been prevented, like blood clots, pneumonia or infected incisions.
The median length of stay for those patients quadrupled to 14 days, and hospital revenue averaged $30,500 more than for patients without complications ($49,400 versus $18,900). Private insurers paid far more for complications than did Medicare or Medicaid, or patients who paid out of pocket.
The authors said in an interview that they were not suggesting that hospitals were trying to make money by deliberately causing complications or refusing to address the problem.
''Absolutely not,'' said David Sadoff, a managing director of the Boston Consulting Group. ''We don't believe that is happening at all.''
But, he said, the current payment system makes it difficult for hospitals to perform better because improvements can wind up costing them money.
Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurance companies, said in an interview that the study illustrated that the entire health care system needed to move away from what she called ''the perverse incentives of the old fee-for-service system that emphasized quantity over quality, and toward methods of payment that reward better care.''
The researchers say that to help reduce complications, insurers not only should quit paying for substandard care, but also should reward excellent care with bonuses. In addition, hospitals should be required to disclose their complication rates, because patients will shun those with high rates and force those hospitals to improve or shut down.
Dr. Barry Rosenberg, an author and a managing director of Boston Consulting, said the study came about because his firm was working with Texas Health Resources to find ways to reduce its hospitals' surgical complication rates, which, at 5.3 percent, were in line with those reported by similar hospitals. Part of that work involved analyzing the costs, and he said the team was stunned to realize that lowering the complication rates would actually cost the hospital money.
''We said, 'Whoa, we're working our tails off trying to lower complications, and the prize we're going to get is a reduction in profits,' '' Dr. Rosenberg said in an interview.
The authors focused on one particular figure, called the contribution margin, which is an important measure of a hospital's income and ability to cover its costs. They said that when complications occurred, this measure tripled for patients with private insurance and doubled for those on Medicare.
Dr. Mark C. Lester, a study author and the executive vice president of Texas Health Resources, said its hospitals had begun to use a checklist system to help prevent complications. Dr. Atul A. Gawande, a Harvard surgeon who is a pioneer in using checklists and who took part in the Texas study, helped develop the system. Surgical checklists involve deceptively simple-sounding practices like double-checking the patient's identification and what part of the body is being operated on, and making sure that drug allergies have been noted and proper medications given.
Dr. Lester said it was not clear how low the complication rate could or should go. Zero would be great, but was not realistic, he said.
As to whether the hospital would lose money if more patients needed less care and went home sooner after surgery, Dr. Lester said, ''to us that doesn't have an impact.''
''Reducing complications and increasing safety is why we're there,'' he said. ''If in doing that, some payments don't come our way, it's not of consequence. What's of consequence is that people who come to us are in a safer environment.''
Dr. Robert M. Wachter, an expert on medical errors who was not involved in the study, said in an e-mail that Medicare and other payers had tried to encourage better care by refusing to pay for certain kinds of medical errors and cutting reimbursement if too many patients were readmitted or gave the hospital bad marks on patient-satisfaction surveys. But the new study ''shows that we still have miles to go,'' said Dr. Wachter, the associate chairman of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.
Ms. Pisano, of the health insurance group, said Medicare and private insurers were already using a ''never list'' of things they will not pay for, like leaving a sponge or instrument inside a patient, or operating on the wrong organ or wrong limb.
In an editorial, Uwe E. Reinhardt, an expert on medical economics from Princeton University, called the study's findings ''troublesome but not surprising.'' He called the current payment system ''untoward,'' adding that it ''can tempt otherwise admirable people into dubious conduct.''

HEADLINE: Great-Power Myopia

BYLINE: By NADER MOUSAVIZADEH

 BODY:
The narcissism of small differences is not usually associated with great-power politics. The pathology of turning minor disputes into major divisions between otherwise like-minded parties is presumed to pale in the shadow of the strategic disputes that separate Washington, Moscow and Beijing.
Step back, however, from the day-to-day diplomatic jousting among American, Chinese and Russian officials over what to do about North Korea, Iran and Syria, and it is difficult to arrive at any other diagnosis. 
Compare the actual -- and startlingly minor -- divergences in the desired outcome in each crisis with the severe consequences for each great power of failure to address them effectively, and the absence of sustained engagement at the level of government leaders becomes inexplicable.
Neither Tehran, nor Pyongyang nor Damascus is considered a reliable or remotely desirable proxy power; neither Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, nor Kim Jong-un nor Bashar al-Assad enjoys a relationship of trust or even regular dialogue with global leaders. The degree to which they're useful props in the great-power contest is negligible compared to the chaos they threaten.
North Korea presents the most urgent global security challenge of the three, with its series of escalating and increasingly unhinged threats to launch nuclear attacks on South Korea as well as the United States.
For Washington and Beijing, there is a simple, undisputed and critical common agenda in preventing open -- and possibly nuclear -- conflict on the Korean Peninsula, continuing to open the economy of the North and promoting a wider regional dtente. And yet the two capitals seem to remain, even now, on autopilot with their standard calls for de-escalation and condemnations of ''provocative'' behavior.
Where are the leader-to-leader phone calls, the military consultations, the urgent dispatch of senior envoys with explicit presidential authority to prepare summit-level meetings to catalyze a way out of the crisis?
The sheer humanitarian horror of Syria's civil war perversely disguises the degree to which that country's near-complete pulverization into a thousand brutalized pieces will have dramatic strategic consequences for decades to come. Already, it is clear that even if Assad were overthrown tomorrow, the country's social fabric has been lost to as toxic and mutually homicidal collection of militias as any the Middle East has witnessed.
Yet the international response is still stuck at the point of last summer's Geneva communiqu, which called for a negotiated political transition toward a broad-based representative government. It was known then that in the absence of a U.S.-Russian agreement at the highest levels on the process towards a new government in Damascus, Assad would be able to play one side off another. There is no guarantee that an Obama-Putin accord on the future of Syria would bring that country from the brink of disaster at this late hour; but without one, the worst-case scenario is virtually assured.
Finally, Iran, perhaps the issue of greatest lasting strategic significance. The most recent P5+1 (United States, China, Russia, France, Britain and Germany) negotiations with Iran in Almaty ended in predictable stalemate and calls for further meetings.
That negotiations of this significance have been entrusted to a European Union official with accidental powers and no strategic leverage is as damning an indictment of great-power abdication as any in global politics today.
Here, too Russia, China and the United States are in remarkable agreement on ultimate outcomes -- no war with Iran over its suspected nuclear weapons program; no Iranian nuclear-weapons capability; no long-term threat to the region's energy supply.
Yet if there have been intensive talks between Xi Jinping, Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin on how to achieve a settlement that removes the risk of major conflict in the Gulf, it has been a very well-kept secret.
One need have no illusions about the strategic divergence among Russia, China and the United States in areas ranging from trade to cyberwar to energy security and human rights to believe that more can and must be done in respect of these three crises.
Indeed, it is precisely because of the uncommon coincidence of great-power interests in Syria, Iran and North Korea that the vacuum of engagement is so perplexing -- and so dangerous. Russia has easily as much to lose from a jihadist-dominated Syria, and China has far more to loose from a Korean Peninsula set ablaze by Pyongyang.
There is no such thing as benign neglect when it comes to security threats of the magnitude of North Korea, Iran and Syria. Left to the occasional diplomacy of mid-level officials and E.U. functionaries, these crises will grow and metastasize with consequences damaging equally for the United States, China and Russia.
If nothing else, the current wave of nostalgia for Margaret Thatcher's leadership -- illustrated by images of the Iron Lady in consultations with the likes of Ronald Reagan, Mikhail Gorbachev, Deng Xiaoping or Helmut Kohl -- should remind Obama, Putin and Xi of what can be achieved when the leaders of great powers decide to meet, negotiate, and then act in concert when it is so evidently will serve national and global interests.

HEADLINE: Europe Says Tests Show Horse Meat Scandal Is 'Food Fraud'

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
LONDON -- Two months after a horse meat scandal first gripped Europe, tests conducted by European Union countries showed on Tuesday that France had found the most beef products containing horse DNA, while Britain had detected the most traces of a painkiller banned from the human food chain.
Results from more than 7,000 tests carried out by the 27 countries in the union found horse DNA in about 5 percent of samples, while phenylbutazone, the banned drug used as an equine painkiller, was discovered in about 0.5 percent of samples. 
The figures, published by the European Commission, gave the first detailed picture of the extent of the problem.
Tonio Borg, the European commissioner for health and consumer policy, said the findings showed that it was ''a matter of food fraud and not of food safety.''
But he added in an e-mail statement: ''Restoring the trust and confidence of European consumers and trading partners in our food chain following this fraudulent labeling scandal is now of vital importance for the European economy, given that the food sector is the largest single economic sector'' in the European Union.
Mr. Borg said the commission would propose new regulations in the coming months. The scandal led to products worth millions of euros being withdrawn from stores. It has also highlighted the inability of producers to guarantee the ingredients in processed meat products.
Because the statistics were supplied by food safety authorities in individual nations, which sampled different numbers of beef products, there was not sufficient data to make comprehensive comparisons.
France, however, tested 353 products labeled beef, of which 47 contained horse DNA; Greece tested 288 products and found horse meat in 36; and Germany tested 878 samples and detected horse meat in 29. Britain found the highest level of the equine painkiller -- in 14 of 836 samples.
About 20 percent of horse meat sold and used in Europe comes from horses imported from North America, and the Humane Society of the United States warned that testing only for phenylbutazone was inadequate to ensuring food safety.
The animal rights organization maintains a 29-page list of other drugs given to horses in the United States that either are a threat to or have not been tested for their impact on human health. The European Union, for example, bans from meat production animals treated with thyrostats, which are licensed for use in horses for respiratory infections but also to promote the growth of lean tissue.
Another example, Firocoxib, is specifically labeled, ''Do not use in horses intended for human consumption.'' Veterinarians in the United States recommend it to treat or prevent inflammation in horses.
''The European Union has failed to seek tests for a whole host of other banned veterinary drugs which are commonly administered to horses and is thereby failing the public by allowing meat from those animals to be sold in the European Union in contravention of its own food safety and consumer protection regulations,'' the Humane Society said in a statement.
The program of tests was agreed to after the discovery of horse meat in frozen lasagna in February. The maker of the lasagna, Findus, said it withdrew the product after Comigel, its French supplier, raised concerns about the type of meat used. Meatballs sold by Ikea were also withdrawn.
Over all, the European Commission said 7,259 tests were conducted. In all, 193 tests, or 4.66 percent, revealed traces of horse DNA, and 16 showed positive traces of the painkiller, equivalent to 0.51 percent of the samples, the commission said.
The findings increased pressure for tighter regulation of the food industry. Though rules require fresh beef to be labeled with its origin, these do not apply to processed products.
''We urgently need to put E.U. rules in place on 'country of origin' labeling for meat in processed foods,'' said Glenis Willmott, the food and health spokeswoman for the British Labour Party in the European Parliament.
''It's only this kind of regulation which will force manufacturers to get a grip on their supply chain,'' she said, adding that it was ''shocking to see how widespread the horse meat scandal is.''

HEADLINE: Democracy a Double-Edged Sword for Women

BYLINE: By SOUAD MEKHENNET

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts -- This column was supposed to explore my impressions of the Arab Spring after several months at Harvard as a Nieman Fellow. I had searched my memory when news of the Boston Marathon explosions broke. And although no one knows at this writing who is responsible, thoughts turned inevitably to the terror felt after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and, for me, to reporting from Afghanistan and Pakistan, and from Spain, Morocco and Britain as they were hit by bomb blasts.
The Boston bombings may have no connection to the Islamic world. 
But writing this column did bring into focus burning questions about the long-term implications of the instability in the Middle East and North Africa. How will this affect security over all, and women's rights in particular?
The economies in post-Arab Spring countries like Tunisia and Egypt are in decline and political and social tensions are increasing. In some regions of Libya, various tribes have taken command and do not heed the leadership in Tripoli.
The affected countries have several traits in common: Post-revolt leaders are more religious, women are more bound by tradition and militants with links to Al Qaeda are more visible, most notably perhaps in the civil war raging in Syria.
Jessica Stern, a fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health and a former member of the National Security Council, told me that the Arab Spring has been at most a mixed blessing for the people in the region. ''Democracy is not the panacea that many Americans imagine it to be,'' she said, noting that a transition from autocratic rule toward a system that accommodates a desire for more freedom is especially delicate and dangerous.
''Civil strife and terrorism tend to go up and, unless protections are put in place for minorities and women, things often get worse for these groups,'' Ms. Stern said. ''Women are particularly at risk in Syria, where rape has become a weapon of war and intimidation.''
The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has reported that rape, or the threat of rape, is often cited as one of the most important reasons prompting families to flee Syria -- as more than one million people now have.
Fotini Christia, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, recently traveled to Syria to interview women, many of them among the millions said to be displaced by two years of war.
Ms. Christia said many of the women she interviewed had participated in peaceful demonstrations against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad in 2011.
They know that they will probably have to wage another battle for their own freedom and rights, she said, in what they anticipate will be a much more conservative political space when the war finally ends.
''They are not nave or revolutionary romantics,'' Ms. Christia said. ''They have seen women get sidelined in post-Arab Spring Egypt, Yemen and Libya.''
Tawakkol Karman, who shared the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize for her co-leadership of the revolution in Yemen, is now staying out of the so-called national dialogue on the future of her country.
In Libya, women have seen the reinstitution of polygamy. In Egypt, women have lost more than 50 seats in Parliament, with just nine female deputies left.
Soha Bayoumi, a lecturer on the history of science at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard, called the situation of women in Egypt ''rather unsettling, with the rampant sexual harassment, sexual assault, and the erosion of women's rights and status in the Constitution.'' She referred to what she called ''the removal of historical figures of Egyptian feminism from school curricula.''
Mrs. Bayoumi, who has family members still in Egypt, said that she was struck by the sense of solidarity right after the revolution.
This changed, she said, with the mismanagement of the transition and the ascendancy of the Muslim Brotherhood to power.
''Their perceived incompetence, arrogance, authoritarianism and bullying, combined with the crushing economic situation, has definitely changed the mood,'' she said.
Her eyes welled up.
''The situation in Egypt is not sustainable,'' she said. ''A moment of explosion is bound to happen. I think sooner rather than later.''
One question now much discussed is whether democracy or universal suffrage is necessarily the right path for all societies in the Middle East and North Africa, where in some countries the attachment to tribal or religious leadership outweighs loyalty to political institutions, particularly new or weak ones.
''Actually, the question is: Does the West and especially the United States really want democracy in the Middle East, when free elections would lead to winners who hate the United States and Israel?'' Noam Chomsky, the linguist and political critic, told me in his office at M.I.T.
In countries like Bahrain, which has officially instituted a dialogue between the government and protesters, it is unclear whether the political process can overcome the keenly felt divide between the Shiites and Sunni Muslims.
This week, as the Formula One racing circuit was due to return to Bahrain for a Grand Prix, protests that have marked most of the past two years in the country again increased in intensity.
A Bahraini woman who is studying for her doctorate in the United States, and who said she did not want to be identified, shuddered at the sight of the Boston explosions, but then noted: ''Why is it when car bombs explode in Bahrain, like in the last days, people in the West call it a search for democracy, when it is the same as what has happened in Boston, an act of terrorism.''

HEADLINE: Security Experts Ponder Whether Any Long Race Can Be Completely Safe

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London, Ian Austen from Ottawa and Wendy Ruderman from New York.

 BODY:
Investigators in Boston are still sifting through evidence to determine who set the bombs that killed three people and injured scores on Monday.
But the explosions at the Boston Marathon have already raised a chilling and perhaps unanswerable question for organizers of other major road races: how to better police events that can include tens of thousands of runners and millions of spectators spread across miles of roads.
It is all but impossible to control every corner of a racecourse, especially for marathons in cities like Boston, London and New York that wind through and over narrow city streets and bridges, offering places to hide for bombs and snipers.
But the police can secure the most vulnerable parts of a course, including the start and finish lines and grandstands, to ward off would-be attackers, and use searches, bomb-sniffing dogs and other techniques to minimize the risks elsewhere, security experts said. 
''There's no way you're going to 100 percent protect an event like that, but you can come up with countermeasures,'' said Michael O'Neil, the president of MSA Security and the commanding officer of the New York Police Department's counterterrorism division from 2002 to 2007. ''What you're really trying to do is to create a hostile environment for them to carry out an attack.''
Race organizers, the police and security experts will have just days to prepare for their next major challenge, marathons in London and Hamburg, Germany, which will be run Sunday. Frank Thaleiser, who is organizing the race in Germany, said 400 police officers would be on duty guarding the 15,300 runners and diverting traffic.
In London, the police are on alert because of the funeral Wednesday of Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister. The city's marathon, which nearly 36,000 runners finished last year -- about a third more than in Boston -- winds through central London and typically attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators.
Hugh Robertson, the sports minister, said he was absolutely confident the course could be protected. Nick Bitel, the chief executive of the London Marathon, added that organizers had ''fairly detailed contingency plans which one hopes can deal with anything that occurs.''
The Tour de France, held in July, presents a much wider-ranging challenge, covering more than 2,000 miles.
While the French government does not publicize most of its security measures for the cycling race, the police presence approaches the scale of an Olympic Games. Last year, about 13,000 members of the Gendarmerie Nationale, the force that provides rural policing, helped protect the three-week race at various times.
When the Tour briefly entered Spain in 2007, ETA, the Basque separatist group, detonated two bombs along the road after the riders had passed.
New York City Marathon organizers and the city police have more time to prepare because that race is in November. But it is one of the largest road races in the world, with nearly 60,000 runners registered and about two million spectators.
Security experts expect the police to add security near the most susceptible parts of the course, including the starting line at the foot of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Staten Island and the finish line in Central Park, which are already heavily guarded. Spectators could see more random searches and displays of force by the police to keep would-be attackers off guard.
''It's a huge challenge and one that's virtually impossible to protect from start to finish,'' said Robert S. Tucker, the chief executive of T&M Protection Resources. ''This is like calling an audible in a football game. We're going to have to deal with it differently.''
The police in New York will face their first test this weekend when two smaller races will be run in Manhattan, including the 9/11 Memorial 5K in Lower Manhattan and a four-mile run in Central Park. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said Tuesday that his department would evaluate its security plan for patrolling the marathon and other road races based in part on what happened in Boston.
''We don't want to necessarily fight yesterday's war,'' Kelly said at a news conference with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. ''We want to take a fresh look at what we are doing. The marathon is 26 miles long so, you know, there are points of vulnerability by definition. There are going to be.''
The mayor underscored the difficulty in preparing for potential threats. ''The one thing that we can be reasonably sure of is, they are not going to do the same thing two times in a row, which makes protecting the public that much more challenging,'' he said.
While security experts are confident that the police can adjust, challenges remain. New York Road Runners and many other race organizations are nonprofit groups that lack the resources to vastly expand their security budgets. Last year the police in New York started to charge race organizers for the cost of their security details, which were passed on to runners in the form of higher entry fees. If police charges rise significantly, the number of entrants may decline, which could hurt the city's economy.
Mary Wittenberg, the chief executive of New York Road Runners, said in a statement that ''the safety and security of all New York Road Runners' races is and will always be our top priority. We will continue to work hand in hand with the City of New York and the N.Y.P.D. as we plan for upcoming events.''
Yet complications remain, especially the handling of the thousands of bags that runners bring to races. John Korff, who organizes the New York City Triathlon, said the police had asked participants to put their belongings in clear plastic bags to make it easier for them to be inspected, something that is also required at the marathon. He expected other requests from the police, who are likely to take other steps out of view.
''With any race, the police look at your security plan and they do what they have to based on what you're doing,'' Korff said. ''New York City is probably 10 steps ahead of everywhere else, and we don't know about nine of the steps.''
In some ways, the New York City Marathon is different from other races because the police here have been preparing for potential terrorist attacks on large sporting events for more than a decade. Before the marathon in November 2001, Road Runners was asked to give law enforcement officers a list of the participants that could be checked against lists of known criminals. Security checks were run on all volunteers, coaches, managers and reporters.
The Coast Guard patrolled the harbor, especially near the bridges that the runners pass over. Trash cans along the route were removed, and the police were placed on rooftops along the course. Many of these measures continue.
Unlike in Boston, where the finish line was largely open to the public, access to the finish line in Central Park is tightly controlled. Last year, Road Runners gave participants the choice of not leaving a bag at the starting line, an option that may have to be expanded this year.
''You're going to see a heightened diligence at sporting events because that's the hand that you've been dealt,'' said Patrick Brosnan, the president of a risk consulting firm that works with sports teams and venues. ''Each one is a Rubik's cube.''

HEADLINE: Earnings Data Brings the Bulls Back

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The stock market climbed more than 1 percent on Tuesday, a day after its worst decline since November, as gold prices stabilized after Monday's fall and earnings from Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson improved the outlook for first-quarter results.
A drop in the Consumer Price Index, which reinforced Wall Street's expectations that the Federal Reserve would keep its monetary stimulus in place, added to the bullish sentiment. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.3 percent on Monday, its worst one-day percentage loss since Nov. 7. Still, the S.& P. 500 is up 10.4 percent since the start of the year after enjoying a strong first-quarter run, partly as a result of the Fed's continued stimulus efforts.
''Yesterday I think was a bit out of line,'' said Brian Amidei, managing director at HighTower Advisors. ''But I think the trend is that the market is consolidating, that we're going to see a little bit of a pullback here over the next month and a half or so, and then we'll get on to greener pastures.''
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 157.58 points, or 1.08 percent, to close at 14,756.78. The S.& P. 500 gained 22.21 points, or 1.43 percent, to 1,574.57. The Nasdaq composite index rose 48.14 points, or 1.50 percent, to 3,264.63.
The price of gold gained $26.20, or 1.93 percent, to $1,386.80 an ounce on Tuesday, after Monday's sell-off, when it plunged 9.35 percent, or $140.40, its biggest one-day decline in more than 30 years. The steep drop in the prices of gold and other commodities helped set off the sharp sell-off in stocks on Monday.
Among the stocks moving higher on Tuesday, Coca-Cola rose 5.7 percent to $42.37, giving the Dow its biggest boost. In reporting earnings on Tuesday, Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft drink maker, reported a higher-than-expected profit and a deal to unload some distribution territory to five independent bottlers in the United States.
The stock of another Dow component, the health care company Johnson & Johnson, gained 2.1 percent, to $83.44, after it reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings.
Earnings for companies in the S.& P. 500 are now expected to have risen 1.8 percent in the first quarter, based on actual results from 42 companies and estimates for the rest, up from a recent estimate of 1.1 percent growth.
The Dow Jones Transportation Average, often an indicator of investors' perception of the economy, gained 2.2 percent.
After the closing bell, shares of Yahoo fell 4.9 percent to $22.62 in after-hours trading after the company reported earnings that were primarily bolstered by its investments abroad rather than its operations.
Among other earnings, Goldman Sachs reported higher quarterly profit but said revenue from client trading fell 10 percent, raising questions about the health of its biggest moneymaker. Goldman's shares fell 1.6 percent to $144.10.
Analysts' positive views on basic materials companies helped stocks in that sector. International Paper gained 4.7 percent, to $47.47, and Vulcan Materials jumped 6.8 percent, to $48.69.
In the bond market, interest rates moved higher. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 10/32, to 102 26/32, while its yield rose to 1.72 percent from 1.69 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: Democrats in Mayor's Race Make Time for Staten Island

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
Staten Island does not get a lot of love in Democratic primary elections -- only around one-sixteenth of New York City's residents live there, and its population is relatively conservative.
But on Monday night, five Democrats running for mayor made their way to the College of Staten Island for a forum at which each pledged to help the island if elected, offering to do everything from lowering the toll on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to using a proposed giant Ferris wheel to attract tourists.
William C. Thompson, Jr., a former comptroller who grew up in Brooklyn and now lives in Manhattan, noted that Staten Islanders had often felt that theirs was ''the forgotten borough.'' But he vowed that it ''won't be forgotten under a Thompson administration.'' He said he would reduce the $15 toll on the Verrazano (it is $15 now, and set to go up to $20 in 2017) and offset the cost by reinstating a commuter tax and increasing automobile registration fees for heavy vehicles. 
Mr. Thompson also said he would create a new position, a deputy mayor of infrastructure, to oversee rebuilding areas damaged by Hurricane Sandy.
Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker and a Manhattan resident, said that rebuilding in response to the hurricane would be her first priority. Ms. Quinn said homeowners in areas of Staten Island hit by the storm should be eligible to sell their homes to the city or state if they did not want to return to them, and she proposed burying power lines.
She also said that she would spur the island's economy by creating a regional council charged with expanding New York City's volume of exports and guiding the new export business to Staten Island's waterfront.
John C. Liu, the current comptroller and a Queens resident, promised to build a public hospital on the island, which currently does not have one. He also said he would expand express bus service on the island, and move forward with a proposed light-rail project on the western shore that would connect it with Hudson-Bergen Light Rail system in New Jersey.
To prepare for future major storms, Mr. Liu said the city should consider building sea walls in New York Harbor to protect Staten Island. He also said that should he become mayor, he would visit Staten Island so much that ''you'll think that I'm living here.''
Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate and a Brooklyn resident, also expressed concern about the island's lack of a public hospital but said the best solution might be for the city to provide support to the borough's private hospitals to encourage them to expand services. He expressed cautious support for a proposal to build the world's largest Ferris wheel near the St. George Ferry Terminal, saying it could encourage tourism. He also proposed reviving a plan for a rail line along the island's northern shore, to connect with the ferry terminal.
And Sal F. Albanese, a former councilman from Brooklyn, also promised to address the toll on the Verrazano Bridge, which he likened to ''being mugged without a gun.'' He personalized the toll issue with a slightly shaggy dog-like story about buying an elliptical machine at Dick's Sporting Goods on the island, and learning that the store was unable to deliver it to his Bay Ridge home on the appointed day; its truck had already made one trip to Brooklyn, and could not afford to pay the cost of the toll again.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Perfection Is the Enemy Of Reform

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Luis Magaa has been an advocate of the rights of immigrant farm workers for his entire adult life.
The son and grandson of migrants from the Mexican state of Michoacn who came to California as guest workers in 1917 and 1943, Mr. Magaa is a longtime friend. He has taken on every cause, from improving dismal working conditions in the sprawling farms of the San Joaquin Valley to extracting past-due compensation for aging migrants from the Mexican government.
He has a better grasp than most people of the most ardent wish of millions of immigrants working ''without papers'' across the American economy.
Last week I asked Mr. Magaa, who came to the United States as a child, about the renewed enthusiasm on Capitol Hill for a reform of the nation's immigration laws. What did migrants think, I asked, about the sudden good luck that might give them a shot at American citizenship? 
His simple, straightforward response contrasts with the complex set of finely balanced, interlocking provisions in the proposal for immigration reform unveiled on Tuesday by a group of eight Republican and Democratic senators. What the migrants want most, he told me, ''is to fix their papers,'' gaining an opportunity to move freely and work legally in the United States.
He cautioned against overreaching that could end up ruining the hopes for legislation. ''For migrants it's like being in the desert asking for a glass of water,'' he said, ''and suddenly here comes your savior and offers you all sorts of beverages.''
Mr. Magaa remembers the last, botched attempt at immigration reform.
In 2007, a plan championed by both the Republican president, George W. Bush, and the Democratic senator Ted Kennedy was sunk, in part, by Democrats who opposed creating a new visa for temporary guest-workers who would not have a shot at citizenship. The provision amounted to ''a shameful repudiation of American tradition that will encourage exploitation,'' said an editorial in The New York Times. If the deal couldn't be improved, ''it should be rejected as worse than a bad status quo.''
A couple of weeks later, an unusual coalition of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans -- not all of whom were concerned about the immigration rights of guest workers -- passed an amendment ending the guest-worker program after five years. At a stroke, businesses' interest in immigration reform evaporated. The effort was dead. Most illegal immigrants and guest workers would probably welcome the opportunity to become American citizens, eventually. It would open access to government programs like Medicaid. Most important, it would offer protection in case the good will toward immigrants in Congress these days were ever to sour.
But to the paperless immigrants of the San Joaquin Valley -- harvesting asparagus or lettuce; picking cherries or grapes -- the insistence on a path to citizenship for a few hundred thousand guest workers six years ago ended up blocking the achievement of their most important goal. The demand for perfection became the enemy of the good.
''Economic migrants don't come to become American,'' said Mr. Magaa, who became a United States citizen though his father and grandfather did not. ''They don't care about that, especially when they just arrived.''
Could the same thing happen again? Perhaps.
True, reform currently has the wind in its sails. Republicans are tired of losing Hispanic voters. The fear that immigrants will take jobs from native-born Americans has diminished as net illegal immigration has fallen to zero and arrests at the border have hit 40-year lows. And with stronger economic growth in Mexico even as the increase in its labor supply slows, says Douglas Massey, an expert on immigration at Princeton, ''the boom in Mexican immigration is over no matter what the U.S. does.''
Still, immigration reform remains vulnerable. Many Americans are ambivalent about granting citizenship to what they see as a vast, poor, brown, Spanish-speaking population with presumably divided loyalties. As the complex legislation hatched in the Senate is exposed to the klieg lights of public debate, lots of people are likely to flinch at the details.
Labor unions have come a long way in the last six years. Still, many remain skeptical about tens of thousands of cheap new guest laborers competing for jobs.
Some immigrant advocacy groups don't much like a provision to cull family-related visas.
Conservatives remain very uncomfortable with granting residence and citizenship to ''lawbreakers'' who might consume lots of public services and vote for Democrats once they are allowed to become citizens years down the road. Many insist that America must ''secure the border'' before anything else can happen -- an implausible goal that could stop the process in its tracks.
Yet as Americans consider the broad attempt at changing the nation's immigration laws, it is important to weigh any discomfort at specific provisions against the alternative of no reform at all.
In a world without reform, the border would not be any more secure, American workers would get no more protection from cheap immigrant labor and immigrants would certainly get no better shot at legal status and eventual citizenship. It is a world of nods and winks that legitimizes an illegal status quo.
In 1997, onion growers from Vidalia, Ga., withdrew their applications for temporary farmworker visas because they would have had to pay workers at least the prevailing wage of 80 cents a bag. When agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service raided Vidalia's onion fields the following year, not surprisingly they arrested a bunch of immigrants working illegally instead.
Rather than give the I.N.S. a pat on the back, the Georgia senator Paul Coverdell, a Republican, wrote a letter complaining about its ''indiscriminate and inappropriate use of extreme enforcement tactics'' against ''honest farmers who are simply trying to get their products from the field to the marketplace.'' The I.N.S. promised no more surprise inspections. And 15 years later about half of the immigrant workers hired on American farms are still working there illegally.
By immigrants' reckoning, the effort that failed in 2007 was not a bad shot. In some respects, its temporary guest worker program with no citizenship rights made it even better.
''The temporariness is a good thing, not a bad thing,'' wrote Dani Rodrik, an expert in development economics at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, in a blog post in 2007. ''It allows others to take advantage of the same opportunity, and it enables home countries to benefit from the newly acquired skills and resources of the returnees. It also alleviates some of the social problems caused by long absences of parents from home.''
Indeed, the program would have helped both the United States and the developing world. ''Even a minor temporary guest worker program would generate greater benefits to the developing nations than all of the Doha trade agenda taken in its entirety,'' Mr. Rodrik wrote, referring to long-stalled negotiations at the World Trade Organization intended to open up markets for goods from the poorest countries.
Today, reforming immigration law could achieve worthy objectives. Just granting the protection of law to 11 million people currently living in fear of the authorities would be a notable victory for the cause of human rights. It would be a pity if it were to be shot down, again, for being imperfect.

HEADLINE: Officials Urge Tight Security for London Marathon After Boston Bombs

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
LONDON -- With security forces in many cities on alert for copycat attacks after the Boston Marathon bombings, British officials on Tuesday urged a review of security measures for the London Marathon on Sunday -- the next big international race -- as the police and military here prepared to deploy for another major public event with the ceremonial funeral of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Wednesday.
The French authorities also ordered security forces to reinforce patrols in public places ''without delay,'' urging citizens to be on the alert for suspicious-looking packages or abandoned baggage but to avoid panicky reactions. In Berlin, the interior minister, Hans-Peter Friedrich, said German security officials were in constant contact with their American counterparts, but the Boston attacks would not change Germany's current assessment of a ''critical'' level of the threat from terrorism. 
''The security and threat situation has not changed for many years,'' he said. Organizers of the Hamburg Marathon, also set for Sunday, said 400 police officers would be on duty guarding the 15,300 runners or diverting traffic. ''At the moment there is no cause to change anything,'' said Frank Thaleiser, the head of the organizing body.
But Mark Milde, the race director of the Berlin Marathon to be held in September, said organizers would review security arrangements and the Boston bombs ''will be forever in the back of our minds.'' Even the 600 police officers assigned to patrol the event would have to improvise in the event of a similar attack in Berlin, he said. ''You never know where something's going to happen,'' Mr. Milde added in a television interview. ''We're prepared for the worst, but of course you can't secure an entire 42-kilometer route.''
In London, both the funeral and the marathon are likely to bring crowds of people onto the streets, as the Boston event did on Monday when two bombs near the finish line killed at least three people and wounded scores.
There had already been concerns that radical foes of Mrs. Thatcher's wrenching, market-driven social and economic changes would seek to disrupt her funeral, during which her coffin is to be borne on a horse drawn gun-carriage through central London along a route lined by 700 military personnel leading to St. Paul's Cathedral. Some of the city's most important thoroughfares, including Whitehall, Trafalgar Square, The Strand and Fleet Street, are to be closed to traffic from early morning until midafternoon.
Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip are to attend the ceremony along with hundreds of dignitaries, including former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.
As a mark of respect, lawmakers have ordered the chimes of Big Ben to be silenced during the funeral, while artillery rounds boom from the Tower of London as the funeral procession moves toward St. Paul's with a mounted escort of nine police officers on black horses.
Draped in the Union flag, Mrs. Thatcher's coffin was transported in a hearse on Tuesday to Parliament, where it will remain overnight in the 13th-century Chapel of St. Mary Undercroft in preparation for Wednesday's funeral.
British news reports said officials were debating whether the most likely threat to the ceremonial occasion came from disruption by domestic protesters or from terrorists. Either way, said former Home Secretary John Reid, the calculation would be that ''we will be more resilient than any terrorist in the long run.''
Last year, the city girded itself against potential terrorist threats during the London Olympics and Paralympics, fearful of any effort to reprise the London bombings of July 2005.
''Everyone will have been appalled at the terrible events in Boston,'' Mr. Reid said in a radio interview. ''While the culprits and motivation behind the U.S. terror attacks are still unclear, this will obviously entail a review of security arrangements for both Lady Thatcher's funeral and the London Marathon.''
He continued, ''In light of the awful attacks in Boston, they will require extra vigilance from everyone involved and it is also to be hoped that everyone recognizes the added responsibility of cooperating with the police and the authorities at both events.''
The London Marathon is among the world's biggest and usually attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators. It starts in southeast London and ends on The Mall near Buckingham Palace, passing locations including the Houses of Parliament.
David Lowe, a specialist in security at sports events, told the BBC, ''I think you are going to find a lot of surveillance on the crowds.'' Among spectators, ''there could be people looking elsewhere for totally different reasons; I can imagine that the security will be stepped up.''
He added, ''We have the two events where we have got to make sure, certainly the security services and the police, have got to make sure it is as tight as possible.''
But the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, said that the marathon should definitely go ahead and that he was ''absolutely confident'' it could be protected.
''These are balance of judgments, but we are absolutely confident here that we can keep the event safe and secure,'' he said. ''I think this is one of those incidents where the best way to show solidarity with Boston is to continue and send a very clear message to those responsible.''
Mayor Boris Johnson of London said that ''given events in Boston, it's only prudent for the police and the organizers of Sunday's race to re-examine'' security arrangements.
Nick Bitel, the chief executive of the London Marathon, echoed that sentiment, saying, ''The London Marathon, in common with most sports events in the world, have got fairly detailed contingency plans which one hopes can deal with anything that occurs. But when something of this nature does happen, you obviously want to review them and see if changes need to be made.''

HEADLINE: Migrant Bill Seems to Fit Tech Sector Wish List

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- This could be Silicon Valley's biggest win yet in Washington.
The proposed overhaul of immigration law contains much of what the technology industry wished for: An easier green card route for foreigners educated at American universities in math and science; a new visa category for entrepreneurs; and more guest workers to be deployed on short-term projects. 
Beyond the specific provisions, which are likely to be debated extensively once legislation is introduced on Capitol Hill, a summary released Tuesday by a bipartisan committee of eight senators is a clear nod to a prospering and more politically powerful technology industry.
It shifts the emphasis in immigration policy from one that prioritized family ties to one that will prioritize professional degrees, making it easier for people with math and science skills to settle here. ''That major reorganization tells me this Congress recognizes that the knowledge economy is going to drive the overall economy,'' said Robert Hoffman, a longtime Washington lobbyist and vice president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a group of some of the largest technology employers, including I.B.M. and Microsoft.
''The devil is in details,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''We've got to look under the legislative hood, which is what we'll do when we get the bill.''
The summary contains an important nod to critics of the temporary employment visas, known as H-1Bs. It makes it significantly more expensive for the mostly Indian outsourcing companies that supply engineers and other computer specialists to American companies for short-term projects and that are accused of depressing wages in the industry.
The summary released by the so-called Gang of Eight would raise fees for those companies with United States work forces made up mostly of guest workers.
In effect, a company like Tata Consultancy Services, of India, which brings computer workers from abroad to work temporarily at American companies, would pay a surcharge to import guest workers.
By contrast, a company like Microsoft would not, because although it imports thousands of guest workers, a majority of its employees are United States citizens or residents. Eventually, companies with a preponderance of guest workers would be ineligible to bring in more, according to the summary.
It also proposes to raise wages for all guest workers here on an H-1B visa and requires employers to advertise job openings to prospective American workers. It would raise the total number of H-1B visas to 110,000 a year, from the current 65,000, with a provision for as many as 180,000 during years of demonstrably high demand.
''From my read of it, it has Silicon Valley with protections for American workers, if indeed all of this is eventually passed,'' said Neil Ruiz, an associate fellow at the Brookings Institution.
The summary also seeks to reduce the wait for math and science graduates who apply for green cards, regardless of their home country. Today, because every country is eligible for the same share of employment-based green cards, applicants from China and India wait far longer than virtually anywhere else.

HEADLINE: Student Loan Rates

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Loan Rate Set to Rise, Despite Lack of Support'' (news article, April 9): 
As president of a college and university system with 19,000 students, I am keenly aware of the need to rein in tuition costs, which average upward of $36,000 a year at many four-year private institutions.
I am also concerned about adding an extra burden to students if Congress fails to act by July 1 and the interest rate on Stafford loans is doubled to 6.8 percent from 3.4 percent. That would add an average of $1,000 a year to the cost of a higher education.
As educators, we constantly grapple with ways to make college accessible to all, not just enclaves for the privileged. Our elected representatives in Washington must do their part to keep student loan costs down.
It is incumbent upon our lawmakers, Democratic and Republican alike, to stop playing politics with the cost of the Stafford loans and do the right thing for students by keeping the rate at 3.4 percent or lower.

HEADLINE: Victims, Ages 8 and 29, Remembered for Kindness and Laughter

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM and JOHN ELIGON; Kitty Bennett and Michael Roston contributed research.

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Martin Richard and Krystle Campbell, two of three people killed Monday at the Boston Marathon, shared something in common with most of those injured by the blasts. They were there to watch others. They were not supposed to be the subjects of a newspaper story.
Ms. Campbell, 29, who went almost every year to watch the runners cross the finish line, was standing with a friend. Martin, 8, was standing with his family. 
On the campus of Boston University, administrators said Tuesday afternoon that the third person killed was a graduate student. The Chinese Consulate in New York said that the victim was a Chinese citizen but that it was not disclosing her name at the request of her family. The university said she was watching the race close to the finish line with two friends, one of whom was in stable condition at Boston Medical Center.
On Tuesday, mourners dropped flowers on the front steps of the gray two-story Victorian home where Martin lived with his family in the Dorchester section of Boston.
Martin's mother, Denise, and sister, Jane, 6, were badly injured by the blast. His older brother Henry, 12, and his father, Bill, also survived the explosions, said a spokesman for the family.
It was a shockingly sad turn for a family that was well-liked and active in the community -- one that ate four-cheese pizza and meatballs several nights a week at a local Italian restaurant. They attended St. Ann Parish Neponset, a Roman Catholic church. Bill Richard was president of the board of St. Mark's Area Main Street, a community revitalization organization.
The operator of a clock at the center of the neighborhood froze the hands at 2:50 on Tuesday, the time of the first blast.
''Bad things happen, I understand that,'' said Suzanne Morrison, a close friend of the family. ''But why three times over that family endured what they endured yesterday, that's something I'll never be able to process.''
Martin was kindhearted and had an ''infectious smile,'' Ms. Morrison said. She said he had spent a school year in the same class as one of her daughters.
''He was the one boy that all the girls had a crush on,'' Ms. Morrison said. ''He didn't shun the girls. He would play with them. He was just a great, great kid.''
Mr. Richard released a statement, thanking ''our family and friends, those we know and those we have never met, for their thoughts and prayers. I ask that you continue to pray for my family as we remember Martin.''
Martin was a third grader at Neighborhood House Charter School. He was frequently in front of his house playing sports with his brother and sister, whom a neighbor described as a tomboy. A red bicycle helmet sat on the front lawn on Tuesday and there was a basketball hoop and hockey goal in the driveway.
''Very active, very normal American kids,'' said a neighbor, Jane Sherman, 64, describing the Richard children.
Martin would always tell her hi, Ms. Sherman said, but he was afraid of her Rottweiler, Audra Rose.
About 10:30 on Monday night, Ms. Sherman said, she saw Mr. Richard walking into his house, looking ''white as a sheet.'' She asked him what was wrong but he did not answer. She then went to his house and asked a family friend who was at the Richard home what had happened.
''He said, 'Martin is dead.' ''
Ms. Campbell's family initially was told that she was merely injured, according to her grandmother Lillian Campbell. Her identity was confused with that of a friend who had been standing with her. Ms. Campbell's parents learned their daughter had died only when they entered the other woman's hospital room, Lillian Campbell said.
''We're heartbroken at the death of our daughter,'' her mother, Patty Campbell, who could barely be understood through her tears, said in a statement she read on the porch of the family's Medford home on Tuesday afternoon. ''She was a wonderful person. She was sweet and kind and friendly and she was always smiling.''
Ms. Campbell worked long days and nights as a restaurant manager, most recently for Jimmy's Steer House in Arlington, but friends said she never lost her sense of humor.
''She made everyone feel special, and in her line of work, it's really hard,'' said Laurie Jackson Cormier, who ran a park where Ms. Campbell managed a restaurant for a number of years. ''They work so damn hard, and you don't often come across everyone who has that attitude.''
Ms. Campbell grew up in Medford, graduating from the local public high school in 2001. She started working as a waitress in high school, and worked her way up to a job as the manager of Hingham branch of the Summer Shack, a popular chain of Boston seafood restaurants.
At the end of the summer season at the Summer Shack in 2009, she organized a hot dog eating contest to rid the restaurant of hundreds of unsold sausages.
''I figured it's the last weekend of the season, so why not have some people come out and stuff their face?'' she told The Boston Globe.
Ms. Campbell lived with her grandmother for almost two years, caring for her after a medical procedure, before moving recently to Arlington and taking a new restaurant job on the other side of the surf and turf divide.
Lillian Campbell said her granddaughter called several times a week and came to see her most weeks. They had a cup of tea and ''lots of laughs about foolish things.''
''Every time she comes in the house to see anybody it's a hug and a kiss, and that's how she left,'' Lillian Campbell said.
'' 'Love you, Nana,' that's what she said.''
Cate Seely, who met Ms. Campbell once in the past, ran the marathon on Monday. On Tuesday, wearing her marathon jacket, she walked up to the Campbell family home with the red rose she received after finishing the race and left it on the front steps.

HEADLINE: As Las Vegas Evolves, Boutique Hotels Gain

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
In the last two decades, Las Vegas has become synonymous with colossal hotels where checking out can take longer than a leisurely lunch. But a new lodging prototype is coming to town: the branded boutique hotel, which is typically small and intimate, offering patrons more personalized service.
The first of these brands appeared in February in an updated tower in Caesars Palace: the 181-room Nobu Hotel, which has the world's largest Nobu Restaurant and Lounge and was created by the chef Nobu Matsuhisa and Nobu Hospitality, with Caesars Entertainment.
Caesars is also working with the Gansevoort Hotel Group to update another older property. Bill's Gamblin' Hall and Saloon, in the heart of the Strip, will be transformed into the 188-room Gansevoort Las Vegas, with clubs run by the club owner Victor Drai and a small 40,000-square-foot casino. The hotel is expected to open in early 2014. 
Two other Las Vegas hotels will open under well-known boutique brands, although they will have thousands of rooms in more typical Vegas fashion. MGM Resorts International and Morgans Hotel Group will open the Delano Las Vegas late this year in an existing property owned by MGM: THEhotel at the Mandalay Bay resort. And in 2014, under its SLS brand, the hospitality company SBE will open a mixed-use resort and casino at the former Sahara Hotel and Casino on the northern end of the Strip.
Developers have turned their sights toward boutique hotels for several reasons. The convention business, which demands big-box hotels, has fallen off since the 2008 economic downturn, and smaller hotels have become a logical alternative. At the same time, the changing demographics of visitors to Las Vegas have made fine dining -- a crucial component in most boutique hotels -- a more important part of the Las Vegas travel experience.
Las Vegas visitors seem to have taken well to the boutique aesthetic. At Nobu, rates start at $249 a night, though they fluctuate depending on hotel occupancy. Occupancy has been in the low- to mid-90 percent level since its soft opening in February, said Gary Selesner, a regional president for Caesars Palace. In general in Las Vegas, which has added about 17,500 hotel rooms since the financial crisis of 2008, citywide occupancy has dropped to 84 percent, while rates have plunged even further, from $132.09 a night at their height in 2007 to $108.08 a night in 2012.
Several branded boutique hotels were planned even before the recession, though those projects succumbed to the economic malaise and were stalled, said Thomas P. McConnell, an executive managing director of the global hospitality group at Cushman & Wakefield Equity, Debt and Structured Finance.
Elsewhere in the country, boutique hotels have been opening in the central business districts of larger cities, but Las Vegas may be particularly ripe for them as food and beverages have become more important to the way visitors -- especially younger visitors -- experience the city.
''Going back 20 years, for a long time, Vegas was all about the gaming floor,'' said Scott Berman, the United States hospitality and leisure practice leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers. ''The majority of revenues came from the gaming floor, but over time, you've seen retail, and food and beverage, and obviously hotels become more important to the overall economic equation.''
With megaclubs like Hakkasan Las Vegas and Light opening this month, the city's club scene has also grown exponentially. And boutique hotels are part and parcel of that type of social scene, Mr. Selesner said.
''The demographics in Las Vegas continue to change,'' he said. ''There are more younger people coming for other than the traditional reason to come to Las Vegas, which used to be gambling. They're coming for nightclubs, restaurants, and bar and pool experiences, and when they travel, they tend to stay in these boutique hotels.''
The two boutique hotels created by Caesars, the Nobu and the Gansevoort, are quite a different product from the Delano and the SLS, said Rick Mazer, a regional president for Caesars Entertainment. While the Nobu and Gansevoort are closer to the traditional 50- to 75-room boutique size, the Delano and the SLS will have many more rooms.
The SLS, which will have more than 1,600 rooms, and the 1,100-room Delano ''are trying to move into the resort world,'' he said. ''When you get into the hundreds let alone thousands of rooms, it's really tough to create a boutique hotel experience.''
In fact, the Delano will not be managed by Morgans at all, but by MGM, and is really a boutique rebranding of a large hotel, Mr. McConnell, of Cushman & Wakefield, said.
Chuck Bowling, the president and chief operating officer of Mandalay Bay, the resort offering the Delano, said the hotel would try to strike a balance between attracting trendy leisure travelers, particularly those from South America, and continuing to attract the conventioneers.
''We wanted to make sure we protect the existing experience, so not make it so trendy and boutique that people wouldn't enjoy it from a professional experience,'' Mr. Bowling said.
Though boutique hotel operators might not agree, it is possible to expand a successful boutique hotel without losing its character, Mr. Berman, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said. ''That's about facility planning and layout,'' he said. ''Once you've got the formula, it's pretty easy to replicate.''
The location of the SLS at the former Sahara, which is far north of the Strip proper, necessitates the creation of a self-sufficient resort, Mr. McConnell said.
''You have to create something unto itself, and you don't rely on the Strip as much,'' he said. ''So the economics and real estate are a little different, but it's still a recognizable lifestyle brand that has certain touch points.''
Mr. McConnell said that the state of the economy might explain why none of the new boutique hotels were being built from the ground up. ''They're recycling these buildings instead of knocking them down,'' he said. ''If it were a more robust market, a lot of these boutique hotels would still be happening, but you'd see more rebuilds.''
Smaller hotels within larger hotels are not new in Las Vegas, where places like Sky Suites at Aria and Sky Lofts at MGM Grand are unbranded attempts at boutique hotels. What is new is the use of established boutique brands to revive older properties, Mr. McConnell said.
Michael Achenbaum, co-founder and president of the Gansevoort Hotel Group, said that the unbranded boutique hotels might not compete very directly with the new branded boutiques. The unbranded hotels enable the casinos to attract high-level gamers who have very little brand loyalty, he said. ''Those Sky Suites just are not readily available'' to conventional tourists, he said. ''There are times when it doesn't matter what you'll pay, if you're not a gambler, you're not getting them.''
But while the Gansevoort will honor the Total Rewards programs, Caesars' rewards system for its resorts and casinos, it will always have rooms available to travelers who are not high-stakes gamblers, Mr. Achenbaum said.
By broadening the attraction of the Las Vegas market, all four new boutique hotel properties should be able to pull in a nightly rate higher than what was charged previously at the properties, Mr. McConnell said. ''I think all of these are higher-end than what they're being recycled from,'' he said. ''I would think all four of them would get a premium rate.''

HIGHLIGHT: Advice from a foreign investor, as P. Chidambaram, India&#8217;s finance minister, travels to North America to stump for investment. 

 BODY:
This week, India's finance minister, P.Chidambaram is headed to stump for foreign direct investment in the United State and Canada. This comes after a recent similar run through Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong and Britain. His messages are familiar: the India growth story, reducing fiscal deficits and an admission that 5 percent growth is uninteresting. 
But he may be missing the point: investors (including small-time ones like me) already know the sales pitch and want to believe it. But they're not buying: foreign direct investment into India dropped by $5 billion in 2012, to $27 billion. What is holding back foreign investment decisions are the risks associated with investing in India, which Mr. Chidambaram needs to address head on. 
Here are the top five things he should tackle to convince foreign investors to put money into India: 
1. Exchange rate stability: The Reserve Bank of India reference rate for Indian Rupee versus U.S. dollar exchange was 40 in April 2008 and lately has been hovering around 54. Investments made in 2008 via F.D.I. need to generate 35 percent returns just to break even after repatriation. Instead of generating a risk premium for having believed in the emerging market story, most investors will not make money on these investments. 
India's current account deficit hit a record level of $32 billion in the December 2012 quarter, up 46 percent from a quarter before, and is approaching 7 percent of GDP. At these levels investors will likely have no confidence in the currency, so the finance minister should be looking to present a credible plan to cut this deficit without focusing purely on promoting exports.
2. Taxation predictability: The timing and extent of GAAR (General Anti Avoidance Rules, proposed by Mr. Chidambaram's predecessor) is an unpredictable overhang that will keep investors at bay. How does an investor model returns when the tax burden is unknown? And please, let us not bring up "retroactive" taxation in any context (with the exception perhaps of fraudulent transactions). 
Most investment vehicles are ephemeral and pooled at many levels, so claw-backs of gains or coughing up historical tax expenses are unfair to the last person left holding the figurative bag. 
3. Progressive regulation: There are certain sectors where the regulator has changed the rules after sizeable foreign investments were made. Imagine acquiring a license to operate, investing billions of dollars in operations and then having the license revoked, or having the fees you can charge your customers changed, or the commissions you can pay your distributors decimated. Overtly investor-friendly regulatory regimes are the need of the hour.
4. Impediments to entry: To begin with, let us remove sector limits on F.D.I. and year-long approval processes as these are anachronistic in a competitive market for capital. When allowed, a number of well-meaning valuation guidelines on transactions involving Indian counterparties make free market investment decisions slow and cumbersome. 
5. Hurdles to exit: Restrictions on overseas listings destroy significant investor value - certain sectors, especially technology, are not well understood in retail equity markets in India. Nothing will drive F.D.I. more vigorously to India than a string of IPOs that attain stratospheric valuations on global exchanges. 
Even without all these risks, investors do not have it easy in the Indian market. They face operational challenges ranging from corporate governance to high valuations. In listed markets, India's return on equity spreads (the additional return relative to the global indexes) have narrowed recently, so returns no longer justify the risks in the near term. 
Especially when capital flows have many options, it behooves India to highlight reforms that allow investors to focus on generating returns instead of fighting the system. India sorely needs F.D.I. to return to 8 percent-plus growth. So dear Mr. Chidambaram, we are happy to hear the sales pitch, but please linger on the risks as well this week.

HIGHLIGHT: The investigation into the Boston Marathon bombing continues; protests in Venezuela after the election; Europe votes to cap banker bonuses; and reviews of London theater and Zurich opera productions. 

 BODY:
 NEWS The explosives that killed three people and injured more than 170 during the Boston Marathon on Monday were most likely rudimentary devices made from ordinary kitchen pressure cookers, except they were rigged to shoot sharp bits of shrapnel into anyone within reach of their blast and maim them severely, law enforcement officials said Tuesday. Katharine Q. Seelye reports from Boston, and Scott Shane and Eric Schmitt from Washington. 
A letter sent to a Mississippi senator tested positive for the poison ricin, federal authorities revealed Tuesday, adding to security concerns in the Capitol after the Boston Marathon bombing. Jonathan Weisman reports from Washington.
Tensions escalated in Venezuela on Tuesday as the newly elected president, Nicols Maduro, and his opponent blamed each other for the violence that the government said had left seven people dead, and Mr. Maduro accused the United States of being behind that violence. William Neuman reports from Caracas.
The authorities in Belgium raided 48 homes nationwide on Tuesday and detained six men implicated in what prosecutors described as a jihadist recruitment drive for the insurgency in Syria, where an increasingly international array of rebels is fighting to topple President Bashar al-Assad. James Kanter reports from Brussels, and Rick Gladstone from New York.
Wednesday's funeral rites for Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, have become a matter of dispute in Whitwell, where many lost their jobs during the 1980s coal battles. John F. Burns reports from Whitwell, England.
European lawmakers voted on Tuesday to cap banker bonuses at the region's largest institutions, as part of a major set of reforms designed to curb the financial industry's risky behavior. Mark Scott and James Kanter report from Brussels.
Italian officials on Tuesday broadened their investigation into whether the Japanese investment bank Nomura had helped hide losses at the troubled lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena by ordering the police to seize assets worth $2.35 billion. Jack Ewing reports from Frankfurt and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.
Focusing on immediate economic concerns over future environmental ones, the European Parliament narrowly rejected a proposal to cut the number of pollution permits. Fewer permits would have raised companies' costs to emit greenhouse gases, which scientists have linked to global warming. Stanley Reed reports from London.
 ARTS The galloping success of the play "Once" is set to continue in a London production whose quietest moments are its most piercing, while another, "Narrative," takes getting used to but rewards the audience in the end. Matt Wolf reviews from London.
Time will tell how the Zurich Opera House fares under the new leadership of Andreas Homoki, but judging from his fascinating staging of Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk," it is in good artistic hands. George Loomis reports from Zurich.
 SPORTS Francesco Totti was born a Roma fan and probably will die an idol in the city where, for 20 years now, his profile has been higher than that of any rock star or politician. Totti is 36 now, but age cannot wither his desire to go on playing for his club, and maybe even for country. Rob Hughes writes from London.

HEADLINE: Daily Report: A Plan to Ease Immigration for Math and Science Graduates

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: A proposed overhaul of immigration law gives Silicon Valley much of what it has been longing for, including an easier green card route for foreigners educated in math and science, a summary released on Tuesday reveals. 

 BODY:
A proposed overhaul of immigration law gives Silicon Valley much of what it has been longing for, including an easier green card route for foreigners educated in math and science, Somini Sengupta reports in The New York Times. 
Beyond the specific provisions, which are likely to be debated extensively once legislation is introduced on Capitol Hill, a summary released on Tuesday by a bipartisan committee of eight senators is a clear nod to a prospering and more politically powerful technology industry.
It shifts the emphasis in immigration policy from one that put a priority on family ties to one that focuses on professional degrees, making it easier for people with math and science skills to settle here. "That major reorganization tells me this Congress recognizes that the knowledge economy is going to drive the overall economy," said Robert Hoffman, a longtime Washington lobbyist and vice president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a group of some of the largest technology employers, including I.B.M. and Microsoft.
"The devil is in details," Mr. Hoffman said. "We've got to look under the legislative hood, which is what we'll do when we get the bill."
The summary contains an important nod to critics of the temporary employment visas, known as H-1Bs. It makes it significantly more expensive for the mostly Indian outsourcing companies that supply engineers and other computer specialists to American companies for short-term projects and that are accused of depressing wages in the industry.

HEADLINE: The Wealthy Keep the Tax Man Guessing

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Just when the wealthy will pay their taxes is something of a mystery and complicates Treasury planning, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
Although wealthy people are a small fraction of the population, their behavior is of great practical interest to Treasury officials.
Every year, the United States Treasury receives extraordinary amounts of personal income tax revenue in April as individuals file their returns and reconcile the taxes they owe with the taxes that were withheld from their paychecks during the previous calendar year. Most people do not owe much, if anything, when they file their return but a small group of taxpayers has large balances to settle.
The chart below shows the inflation-adjusted amount of individual income tax receipts by the Treasury in April of each year since 1998, as reported by in the Daily Treasury Statement. The amount has fluctuated wildly, from a low of $122 billion to a high of $235 billion. The standard deviation of these April receipts is $36 billion.
The general state of the economy in the calendar year helps to predict the amount the Treasury receives in following April. At the same time, additional fluctuations in April receipts derive from the situations and behaviors of a small segment of the population not well represented in the unemployment rate and other measures of the business cycle: the wealthy.
First of all, taxes are withheld less often from asset income like dividends and capital gains than they are withheld from wages. The wealthy receive a larger share of their income from assets than from wages, not to mention that by definition the wealthy have more of both types of income. Second, much of the population does not owe any income tax - let alone owe extra in April - and the wealthy pay a disproportionate share of income taxes.
The wealthy have become an even more important driver of tax revenues in recent history, as an increasing share of the nation's income has accrued to them. Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez have compiled decades of data for the United States (and other countries). They find, for example, that the very wealthiest of America's households - the top one-tenth of 1 percent - recently received about one-thirteenth of the nation's income, while they received only one-fiftieth in the 1960s and 1970s.
The wealthy are sometimes idolized and other times envied, and for these reasons alone their behavior is of interest. But Treasury officials have another reason to stay abreast of the wealthy: their activities are an important determinant of the amount of revenue received by the Treasury, and when it is received.
If you have special insights into how the wealthy behave, consider applying for a job at the Treasury.

HEADLINE: Beyond Profit: A Talk With Muhammad Yunus

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: The founder of the microfinance discusses his fight to protect the Grameen Bank and the future of social business. 

 BODY:
 Today, in a ceremony at the United States Capitol, Congressional leaders will present the founder of the Grameen Bank, Muhammad Yunus, with the Congressional Gold Medal in recognition of his "efforts to combat global poverty." The award places Yunus in the company of a small group of people - including Norman Borlaug, Martin Luther King, Jr., Nelson Mandela, Elie Wiesel, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and Mother Teresa - who have received this award, as well as the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Nobel Peace Prize. 
Yunus is best known for his work pioneering and spreading microfinance. Today, microfinance providers reach about 200 million clients globally. In Bangladesh, the Grameen Bank has 8.4 million borrowers, 96 percent women. Yunus has also developed many other enterprises that offer an array of products and services to the poor, including Grameen Phone, the largest cellphone operator in the country. Over the past two years, his work has come under attack by the government of Bangladesh, which we have reported on here, here and here in Fixes. Below, in an interview conducted a few days ago, Yunus reflects on his life, the role of social business, and the importance of imagination in creating a poverty-free world.
Q: There is much debate about microfinance today - when and how and whether it works. How would you describe the state of the field? 
A: Long before the crisis of 2008, when financial institutions were crumbling all over the world, many of us had been saying that we need to redesign the financial system [which] only serves the top one-third of the world; two-thirds are left out. Microcredit has shown how you can reach out to people that conventional banking cannot. It has demonstrated that it's a doable proposition.
When we designed microcredit, the purpose was to help people get out of poverty, but some people moved away from that motivation. Grameen is still the same. It reaches out to the poorest - the women - and has demonstrated that despite disasters it can work. The next generation of children in the Grameen Bank have education and health. The Grameen Bank now has nearly a $1 billion in savings accounts of the borrowers, and the institution is 97 percent owned by borrowers.
If others have tried to imitate it in a flawed way, it doesn't mean the whole idea of noncollateralized lending to the poorest people is flawed. The challenge is to get it right. You can debate which parts of it have impacted on this, and which parts have impacted on that.
You often speak about the emergence of a new kind of business, you call it social business, which is different from what we usually think of as socially responsible business. Can you explain what you mean?
Capitalism has been interpreted as an exclusively profit-centric human engagement. Some have been saying to bring people and planet into the picture. This can be a good change, but it is still not fully operationalized. Are you putting people, planet and profit at the same level?
What I have been trying to promote is different. I dismiss personal profit, and focus exclusively on people and planet. That's what I call social business: a nondividend company dedicated to solving human problems. You can go all the way, forgetting about personal profit, being single-minded about solving problems. The company makes profit, but profit stays with the company. The owner will only get back the original investment. Nothing more.
I'm not saying to get away from profit-making businesses. I'm saying keep these separate, run them in parallel. There is a toolbox to solve the problems of poverty, unemployment, the environment. All I'm doing is adding one more tool to the box. It's simply enhancing the capability of people to express themselves in another way to address the problems we have.
Is it realistic to expect people to pursue this kind of business?
When we started microcredit, people asked if it was realistic to lend money without collateral. We demonstrated that it is.
The profit orientation is only one orientation of a person. The same people who are interested in profit making are also selfless. I am not saying that capitalist theory is wrong. I am saying that it has not been interpreted and practiced fully. The selfless part of human beings has not been allowed to play out. As a result, we created a concept of business based on money-centric, one-dimensional human beings. But real human beings are multidimensional.
What do you say to people who say that business needs the profit incentive?
People climb to the top of Mount Everest. What's their incentive? Making money is an incentive. But making other people happy is a super incentive. We haven't explored that part of it. I'm inviting you to have a taste of it. If you like it you'll make your own decision. I tasted it and I found it an exciting thing to do - more exciting than making money.
Do you think people will evolve from being profit-focused entrepreneurs to social business entrepreneurs as they go through their lives?
You're looking at what exists. Suppose as you went to preschool and school, teachers were telling you that there were two kinds of businesses, one to make money for yourself, another to solve the problems we see around ourselves. And you can use your creative power either way. So you would have grown up with the idea that there are two kinds of businesses. You would make your decision what kind of business you would like to get involved with, and how much of each, if you want both.
We've used our creative power to focus on making money - and we've done it like it's the only game in town. It's not. There's a more exciting game in town.
What makes you confident the idea will grow?
There's a whole generation of young people coming up with social business ideas. Profit making doesn't interest them as much as it interested people before, particularly the postwar generation. Their main question is: What am I going to do with my life. What is the purpose of my life?
Where will the investment come from?
Individuals, companies have foundations, charity organizations. There are billions of dollars locked up in them. We can reserve a portion of charity money for social businesses. It's a reorientation of the whole idea of charity, and in the process you can build self-sustaining companies and initiatives. Once people like the idea of social money they'll start diverting their business money into social business.
What would you say to a person who asks, 'Where should I start?'
What are the problems you see around you? Sit down and make a list. Then put them in order of priority, [starting with] the things you hate the most. Then start with one and see if you can find a business approach to solve it. Suppose you put down unemployment. O.K., why don't you create a social business to solve the problem of five unemployed people?
With microcredit, all I was trying to do was help a few people in one village so that they didn't have to go to loan sharks and lose everything in the process. That's how social business begins. Everything starts with solving a very tiny slice of a problem.
What's the situation today with the Grameen Bank and government of Bangladesh?
Two years back, a very aggressive campaign began against me, against Grameen Bank, and against microcredit. It looks like the government's objective is to take over Grameen Bank.
A commission has been appointed. They have proposed that the shares of the borrowers, who own 97 percent of the bank, do not give them actual ownership of the bank. It is owned by the government. I don't understand how it corresponds to reality, but this is the position they have taken.
Legally, the bank's board has the power to make decisions for the bank. It has three representatives of the government and nine representatives elected by the borrowers. But the commission is saying that the board election rule is flawed, so the nine elected members should be dismissed. We don't know what will happen.
What do you expect will happen?
Grameen Bank is owned by the people, and my faith is that the people will ultimately win. With eight and a half million borrowers, with five people on average in a family, it's over 40 million people involved. I don't think 40 million people will be beaten. They will prevail.
\xBCThe implementation of the recommendations of the government commission has not yet taken place, so Grameen Bank is still O.K. But if the government suddenly starts to implement the recommendations, it will cause fundamental damage to the institution.
Looking back on your life, what's the best decision you made?
I jumped at what I felt was right. I was just a university teacher. I had no business getting involved with the poor people in the village next door. But I jumped in at solving the problem. I had no idea if it was going to work or not. I wasn't worried about being a failure. I started lending money from out of my own pocket. And the whole world was telling me that it won't work. It's a utopian idea; it won't survive long. But I didn't listen to them. I listened to myself. That I think is very important. And I stayed on my course.
What would you have done differently?
When people from other countries invited us to help them set up microcredit, we encouraged them, provided advice, sometimes we supported them financially, without getting closely involved. I think if I did it today, I would have gotten more involved. All the mission drift - people moving away from the concept of microcredit as a tool to help poor people to making money for themselves - that might not have happened as much if we had stayed more involved.
What's something you would like to see happen in education?
The creation of departments that offer social M.B.A.'s.
What would they teach?
How do you solve problems in a business way? What types of problems are there to be solved? How do you address them? How do you monitor it? How do you measure it? How do you report on it? How do you lower costs and make it more efficient? How to bring in technology in social problem solving? Can we improve on existing social businesses? When you do a partnership between a social and conventional business, what are the dos and don'ts? How to make sure that you don't drift away from your mission? All these questions.
How do you feel about receiving the Congressional Gold Medal?
\xBCIt's very emotional. It's not only an endorsement, but it's an inspiration for everybody who has supported us - colleagues and friends, all the staff and borrowers of the Grameen Bank, all the people who participate in social businesses. I'm grateful to the U.S. Congress that it paid attention. Many people do good things that are never recognized. I'm very blessed that way.
What do you imagine will happen with poverty in the coming decades?
People dreamt of going to the moon when they couldn't even fly. They put the idea in science fiction. People always love science fiction. Look at the popularity of TV shows like "Star Trek"; it lets you feel the sensation of going to other galaxies. Then science always followed science fiction. Although it was fiction, somehow it inspired people. So I encourage people to write social fiction: imagine society where all our present problems remain totally unknown. All the impossible things of today's world are routine there. At this moment that society looks impossible. It seems there is no way we will ever get there. But our minds will open. If we can imagine, it will happen. If we cannot imagine, it will never happen.
Removing poverty is one of those social fictions which can be visualized now. Already with the Millennium Development Goals, the world has promised to reduce poverty by half by 2015. And many countries (pdf), including Bangladesh, will achieve it. If we can reduce poverty by half by 2015, when will be the time to reduce poverty to zero in Bangladesh? I say by 2030. 
With the creative power we have today, this is a doable proposition. We can create a world where poverty doesn't exist. In order for the next generation to see poverty, we'll have to create poverty museums. That's where poverty belongs, not in human society.
So let's put this on the list of impossibilities that we want to make possible within the next 20 years. That's the way change takes place.
What would you say to a young person today who wants to change the world?
First, you have the creative power, alone yourself, to change the whole world. Start believing in it. When you believe in it, you start finding out how you're going to make it happen. And always start small. Nothing will change overnight. But you start the process. In order to solve global problems, you have to solve the problems of individuals. If you bring it down to the individual, you'll see how doable it is to solve it. We always think of global problems, and we get stuck. It's overwhelming. So this is the way to proceed. Solve one person's problem, then five people's problem.
What would you like to see in the next five years?
\xBCAt least 1 percent of the world economy be made up with social business. If we can make that 1 percent happen, I think the world will be completely different. People will see how exciting it is, and soon the level will rise from 1 to 5 percent. Pave the way to get to 50 percent.
How to begin?
One: Create social business funds in each country and city. Banks can create them, governments can create them, foundations can create them, individuals can create them. Two: Encourage young people, businesspeople, retired people to come up with business ideas to solve problems, so social business funds can invest in them. And three: Show how it works.

HEADLINE: Blame The Pundits, Too

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Not just the economists. 

 BODY:
Still Reinhart-Rogoffing; I think it's important to be clear that R-R aren't the only ones at fault here. In particular, the people who cited their work don't have the right to claim innocence, because how could they know that they were being given bad data? 
The fact is that R-R was controversial right from the beginning; and very early on, although we didn't know about the coding error, we knew that they had made a major blooper by citing the US contraction after World War II as an example of debt overhang, when it was actually just postwar demobilization. That should have made everyone suspicious from the start.
Yet the VSPs not only grabbed hold of the alleged result, they wrote again and again as if this highly disputed claim was a known fact. Thus just a few months ago the Washington Post, attacking those who wanted to reduce the focus on deficits, wrote,
If [debt projections are] even slightly off, debt-to-GDP could keep rising - and stick dangerously near the 90 percent mark that economists regard as a threat to sustainable economic growth.
Not "some economists", let alone "some economists who have been sharply criticized by other economists with equally good credentials", but "economists". 
This is deciding what you want to believe, finding someone who tells you what you want to hear, and pretending that there are no other voices. It's deeply irresponsible - and you can't blame Reinhart-Rogoff for that mistake.

HEADLINE: Arctic Nations Seek Common Management of Fishing as Open Water Spreads

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Facing an opening Arctic Ocean, nations opt to mange any new fishing effort cooperatively. 

 BODY:
Humanity has long had a two-pronged reaction to environmental change - girding against risks but also probing for opportunities. The spread of ice-free Arctic Ocean waters in summer is eroding shorelines and may be affecting Northern Hemisphere winter weather (the jury is out). But of course this change has also prompted enterprising shippers to test new trade shortcuts and led to projections of bountiful new fisheries. 
Luckily, the nations ringing the Arctic are recognizing the importance of going slowly on any new fishing effort in northern waters. They are meeting later this month with the aim of crafting an agreement to manage the living resources in waters around the North Pole. Here's the core notion as described by Andrew E. Kramer in a news article today in The New York Times: 
The fishing accord would regulate commercial harvests in an area farther offshore - in the so-called doughnut hole of the Arctic Ocean. This is a Texas-size area of international water that includes the North Pole and is encircled by the exclusive economic zones of the coastal countries.
That the center of the Arctic Ocean was unregulated was hardly a concern when it was an icebound backwater. That is changing. Last summer, 40 percent of the central Arctic Ocean melted.
In fact, the agreement is unusual for protecting a huge area from human exploitation before people have had much chance to exploit it; before the last decade, scientists estimate, the doughnut hole was icebound for about 100,000 years. 
"Five countries are talking about solving a problem before it starts," Scott Highleyman, the director of Arctic programs at the Pew Charitable Trust, which supports the fishing moratorium, said in a telephone interview. [Read the rest.]
The decision to seek an agreement echoes the wise move in 2009 by the United States North Pacific Fishery Management Council, which decided (industry included) to close a vast stretch of American waters to fishing that has never been fished actively. As I wrote in 2009:
[The move] is aimed at avoiding big ecological disruptions as the expanding summer retreats of sea ice on the Arctic Ocean expose virgin waters.
Many biologists and fisheries experts say it's vital to leave the region alone because big, poorly-understood ecosystem shifts are under way. Here's the news story on the Arctic fishing closure. Here's the draft fisheries management plan (PDF) for the region.
It seems that, at least sometimes, humans are capable of taking advantage of the gift of foresight. The capacity for proactivity is only the start. Translating a goal into an agreement is no easy task.
 Related: Paul Arthur Berkman, a biological oceanographer at the University of California, Santa Barbara, has focused on such questions in a recent book and elsewhere. To get his central ideas, read this Op-Ed article and review this recent presentation by Berkman. Here's a relevant talk:

HEADLINE: Letdown for Bank of America

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Bank of America posted first-quarter earnings of 20 cents a share. | A judge approved a settlement between SAC Capital Advisors and regulators, but with reservations. | Fairway hopes the investing public will aid in its expansion after its I.P.O. | A provocative new paper challenges the relationship between growth and government debt. 

 BODY:
Bank of America said on Wednesday that it earned 20 cents a share in the first quarter, falling short of analysts' expectations of 23 cents a share. Still, the first-quarter results compared with earnings of 3 cents a share in the period a year earlier. The bank also posted revenue of $23.5 billion. In a statement, Brian T. Moynihan, Bank of America's chief executive, said, "Our strategy of connecting our customers to all we can do for them is working." The question now is whether the earnings will add to the recent optimism surrounding the bank, DealBook's Peter Eavis writes. The bank's shares were down in premarket trading. Bank of America is holding a conference call at 8:30 a.m. to discuss the results.
SAC SETTLEMENT GETS TENTATIVE APPROVAL | A judge signed off on the $602 million settlement between SAC Capital Advisors and securities regulators to resolve a civil insider trading case, but said he had serious concerns about the language that allowed the hedge fund to "neither admit nor deny" wrongdoing. Judge Victor Marrero of Federal District Court in Manhattan conditioned his decision on a pending ruling from the Federal Appeals Court, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports. 
That language is a common feature of settlements by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But Judge Marrero, in an opinion released on Tuesday, said he would await guidance from a pending appellate case involving Citigroup. In that case, Judge Jed S. Rakoff has rejected a $285 million settlement that allows Citigroup to resolve a fraud case without saying it had done anything wrong. Judge Rakoff suggested the agreement was not in the public interest.
Judge Marrero suggested the "neither admit nor deny" boilerplate was out of place in today's world. "In this age when the notion labeled 'too big to fail' (or jail, as the case may be) has gained currency throughout commercial markets, some cynics read the concept as code words meant as encouragement by an accommodating public - a free pass to evade or ignore the rules, a wink and a nod as cover for grand fraud, a license to deceive unsuspecting customers," he wrote.
FAIRWAY TAPS PUBLIC MARKETS | Until recently, Fairway was not much more than a popular market on Manhattan's Upper West Side, where residents went for goods like smoked salmon, medjool dates and cheeses. Today, it is a fast-growing 12-store grocery chain with ambitions of opening 300 outlets across the country. On Wednesday, Fairway hopes the investing public will aid in its expansion after its stock starts trading for the first time. Its initial public offering got off to a strong start on Tuesday evening, with Fairway pricing its shares at $13 each, above the expected range, according to a person briefed on the matter. It raised $177.5 million, valuing the whole company at $536.1 million.
Driving Fairway's growth is Sterling Investment Partners, a private equity firm that acquired an 80.1 percent stake in the company in 2007 and will continue to control it after the I.P.O. But fresh risks have come with the expansion. The company lost $11.9 million in the fiscal year that ended in April 2012, even as sales increased 14 percent, to $554.9 million.
ON THE AGENDA | Abbott Laboratories and Mattel report earnings before the market opens, while American Express and eBay announce results on Wednesday evening. The Federal Reserve releases its so-called beige book report on the economy at 2 p.m. A Senate Banking subcommittee holds a hearing at 10 a.m. about foreclosure reviews. Bart Chilton, a Democratic commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is on Bloomberg TV at 10:30 a.m.
RESEARCH ON GOVERNMENT DEBT IS CHALLENGED | A 2010 research paper by Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard, which found that countries with debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratios above 90 percent experienced slower growth, is often cited to justify policies of austerity. But a provocative new paper by economists at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, claims to have found basic flaws in the research. The findings set off a heated debate across the Internet on Tuesday. "The debate comes at a particularly perilous time, as economic officials from the United States and other countries gather for the annual spring meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington, where many are expected to urge high-debt Europe to ease up on its commitment to austerity in the face of rising unemployment and new economic contractions," Annie Lowrey writes on the Economix blog.

HEADLINE: Efforts to Revive the Economy Lead to Worries of a Bubble

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: Through its unconventional policies, the Federal Reserve is trying to alleviate the crisis. Instead, it has kindled speculation. 

 BODY:
Are we moving from the crash to the bubble, dispensing with that pesky economic recovery thing altogether?
The Federal Reserve is well into its third round of "quantitative easing," in which it buys longer-term assets to bring down long-term lending rates. We are about five and a half years into the Fed's extraordinary monetary policies (its out-of-the-box lending programs began before the crash, in late 2007).
The effect the central bank hopes to produce hasn't materialized. Despite modest growth, the economy remains a wellspring of misery, with mass unemployment, wage stagnation and factories going unused. In March, a smaller percentage of working-age people were actually working than at any other time since 1979. 
Through its unconventional policies, the Fed is trying to ease the crisis. It has succeeded in driving down lending rates. Ben S. Bernanke and company would also like to kindle inflation expectations, spurring people to buy and companies to invest today instead of waiting until tomorrow. Supposedly, all of this will drive a self-sustaining economic recovery.
Instead, the Fed has kindled speculation. Investors are desperate for yield and are paying up for riskier assets. In areas like real estate, structured finance and equities, the markets are ahead of the fundamentals. It doesn't look to me like a bubble yet. But I would call it the Dysplasia Stage, abnormal growth that looks precancerous.
It's not just an economic or financial issue, it's cultural and psychological. We seem to have unlearned what real growth is and simply substituted speculative bubbles. Policy makers are either paralyzed or barrel forward because this is all they know how to do.
Let's first take the stock market. On the standard measures of looking at estimated earnings, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index isn't particularly high. But that's misleading. Corporate earnings are extremely high as a percentage of the gross domestic product. Margins are high. Is that sustainable?
There are more reliable measures of stock market value, and they look frothy. One gauge, the price of stocks based on the past decade of earnings, is named after the Yale economist Robert J. Shiller. Using that, stocks are too expensive by 65 percent. Alternatively, many investors look at something called the Q, devised by the economist James Tobin, which compares stock prices with corporate net worth. The nonfinancial companies are overpriced by 57 percent. The stock market is not at 1999 or 1929 levels, but it has reached other previous peaks of 1906, 1936 and 1968, according to Smithers & Company, a London-based research shop.
To make stocks correctly priced, "either earnings have to explode heavenward for 10 years or else stock prices have to come in a lot," said Scott Frew, who runs Rockingham Capital Partners, a small hedge fund. He expects earnings to fall.
It's not just stocks. Investors are bidding up junk bonds, commercial mortgage-backed securities and bundles of corporate loans called collateralized loan obligations. Last month, investors were paying morefor such loans than at any time in the last five years. They are snapping up billions of dollars in securities made up of subprime auto loans.
And the housing market isn't just rising, but roaring back so fast you can feel the G-force coming off the reports. Home prices in Phoenix went up 23 percent over the last year, according to the latest Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller index. More than one in four homes in Phoenix was purchased by an investor who bought more than five homes, up from 16 percent a year earlier.
"I am now starting to become less skeptical" about the worries over a new housing bubble, said Christopher J. Mayer, a real estate economist at Columbia University. When local money is on the sidelines and outside buyers come in to snap up real estate, that typically ends badly, he added.
So what's going on?
The Fed is engaged in "trickle-down monetary policy," said Daniel Alpert, managing partner of Westwood Capital, an investment bank. "This type of monetary policy is making the wealthy wealthier and hoping that it trickles down to the shop floor."
But "trickle down has never worked," he said. "The wealthy don't need to consume. And when there is oversupply of capacity, the wealthy don't need to invest in new capacity."
Has the Federal Reserve monetary policy reached the average American? To a certain degree, yes. Many Americans have been able to refinance their homes. Those auto loans may be helping people get to and from work.
But the economic effects are modest for the size and scope of the effort. Investors glory in the asset inflation. The most pronounced effect of low mortgage rates has been to allow people with good credit and low debt to refinance multiple times over the last few years. Stock ownership is concentrated among the wealthy; junk bonds and collateralized loan obligations only more so.
Mr. Alpert says the first round of quantitative easing was necessary to ease the liquidity problem in the markets - the unwillingness of investors to conquer their fears and buy up assets. But the third round is "unnecessary," he said.
Others disagree. Dean Baker, an economist from the liberal-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research who warned about the housing bubble much earlier than most, doesn't see a bubble yet. He advocates continuing quantitative easing.
Mr. Baker adds a note of caution, however. Regulators should move to high alert; Federal Reserve officials should start speaking out to signal that they are paying attention to the abnormalities. Eric S. Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, gave a recent speech raising areas of concern, only to dismiss them as not overly worrisome yet.
At least he was thinking about the issue. As with cancer, the key is to intervene early.

HEADLINE: More College Applicants Aren't Welcome Until Second Semester

BYLINE: TANYA ABRAMS


HIGHLIGHT: The practice, which colleges and universities consider an economic benefit, comes as a shock to students. 

 BODY:
As part of an admissions practice that seems to be on the rise, many of this year's admitted college applicants have learned that they must wait until spring 2014 to enroll, my colleague Ariel Kaminer reports: 
Back in 2001, when U.S.C. started doing it, Timothy Brunold, the director of admissions, said he assumed the university was a pioneer. Now the list includes, among others, Skidmore College, Hamilton College, Brandeis University, the University of Miami, Northeastern University, Elon University in North Carolina and Middlebury College (which actually beat U.S.C. to the punch by a few decades).
They all have their own variation on the theme. Some, like Middlebury, in Vermont, allow students to request second-semester admissions; some make the decision for the students. Hamilton, in Clinton, N.Y., does not enroll students until they arrive on campus in the spring; Skidmore, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and Northeastern, in Boston, enroll them right away but direct them to spend their fall semester at a designated program abroad.
But all are motivated by the same basic arithmetic: between freshman-year attrition and junior-year abroad programs, campus populations drop off after the first few months of college each year. "With the economy the way it is, they need to be doing what they can to get tuition income," said Scott G. Chrysler Jr., a college counselor in Louisiana who is active in the national group's admissions practices committee. "An empty seat is not generating any income." 
Some students have made the best of their second-semester admissions, as Ms. Kaminer reports, but a thick envelope with delayed gratification is also sure to cause some disappointment.
 What are your thoughts about the practice? Do you know someone who has received such an offer? Please join the discussion in the comments box below.

HEADLINE: Why So Little Terrorism?

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Three possible explanations for the relatively rarity of domestic terror campaigns. 

 BODY:
With ricin-laced letters suddenly showing up in Washington D.C., I worry a little that I'm tempting fate by writing about the rarity of organized terrorism in early 21st century America. But hopefully one more post won't hurt. So, picking up where my last one left off, here are three theories about why our culture seems to be producing relatively few people with the combination of ideological commitment, organizational competence and zeal that has sparked and sustained terrorist campaigns in other times and places: 
1) We've just gotten lucky. That's the case Will Saletan made for Slate yesterday, after running through the F.B.I.'s list of cases involving explosives going back to the beginning of 2012. He found plenty of intercepted plots against soft targets (malls, synagogues, restaurants, etc.), several cases where only a last-minute break prevented the plot from going forward, and plenty of plotters canny enough to cobble together their devices out of ordinary household materials. "When you look at the 20 cases," Saletan writes, "you realize that Boston is just the tip of the iceberg. What's surprising isn't that the marathon bombing succeeded, but that so many other plots failed." And given the combination of an expanded target list and the ongoing innovations of bombmakers, he suggests, we should expect more of them to succeed in the future.
2) We don't have any nationalist movements inside our borders. Call this the Robert Pape theory, after the University of Chicago professor famous for arguing that suicide bombing is best understood as a rational strategy for nationalists seeking political liberation rather than a lunatic strategy for religious fanatics seeking martyrdom. The Pape thesis fits well enough with the suicide attacks that America has faced: We've endured sustained suicide campaigns inside countries that we've occupied (Iraq, Afghanistan), and the only major suicide attack within our borders was carried out mostly by citizens of a country (Saudi Arabia) where we have a controversial military presence. And from both a psychological and logistical perspective, it makes sense that suicide attacks against U.S. interests abroad would be more common than domestic attacks: You're more likely to want to strike a blow against an occupier (whether real or perceived) if you actually live under their occupation, and it's vastly easier to strike the occupier in your own country (and to sustain networks capable of repeated strikes) than to cross an ocean for the same purpose. If Iraq were just across the Rio Grande or Saudi Arabia across the Saint Lawrence, or if we were re-running Reconstruction somewhere in the 50 states, then you might expect more domestic suicide attacks. But not enough people inside our borders or in our immediate vicinity feel like victims of U.S. occupation, so suicide terror remains (mostly) far away.
3) It's the End of History. This is an argument I've made myself: Namely, that with the collapse of grand ideological alternatives to liberal democracy one would expect terrorism to become mostly the province of madmen and nihilists and eccentric loners, rather than more purposeful movements and organizations. Call it the Christopher Nolan thesis, if you don't care for Francis Fukuyama: In a world where the major ideological debates have either been resolved or set aside, terrorism becomes the province of people who, Joker-style, "just want to watch the world burn," which means that we have lots of one-off horrors and senseless-seeming massacres but fewer agenda-driven terror campaigns.
I find all of these ideas persuasive, but they still feel a little bit incomplete. Like Saletan I fear that we'll see more Boston-style atrocities in the near future, but even his examples of failed and foiled plots don't add up to anything like the kind of sustained campaign that everyone feared we'd face, understandably, after 9/11. The Pape thesis explains why America would face more suicide attacks overseas than domestically, but in a nation with so many immigrant communities it's easy to imagine the logic of suicide terrorism taking hold among groups with ties to Iraq or Saudi Arabia or Palestine in ways that happily haven't actually happened.
And yes, the collapse of Communism as both a reality and an ideal has removed one of the most powerful drivers of revolutionary violence. But there are still plenty of issues that inspire deep, near-irreconcilable disagreements in ways that are directly linked to matters of life and death. The debates over American wars and foreign policy, abortion, and (at least from the vantage of some greens) environmentalism all fall into this category, and these issues have all inspired some sort of violent fringe either today or in the relatively recent past. Yet on all of them the center has mostly held of late: There was no Iraq-era equivalent of the Weathermen, the number of abortion-related murders spiked in the 1990s and then fell, and eco-terrorism remains a fairly minor phenomenon despite the recent political setbacks for mainstream environmentalism. Similarly, the Great Recession led to spasms of populism and protest ... but no real organized violence, whether on the left or on the right.
This is all a blessing, obviously. Given human nature and human history, though, I still think it's a bit of a surprise.

HEADLINE: Nine Massive Humans Move Into Rockefeller Center

BYLINE: JAMES BARRON


HIGHLIGHT: &#8220;Human Nature,&#8221; an installation by the Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone that features statues weighing 17&#189; tons, is &#8220;the ultimate combination of art and engineering.&#8221; 

 BODY:
It is double-take time for the blas New York types who do not pay much attention to what is in front of 30 Rockefeller Plaza the rest of the year - that is, the 10 or so months between when one tree comes down and the next one goes up.
The streetscape has changed drastically in the last few days with the arrival of massive stone statues by the Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone. They are part of an art installation called "Human Nature" that had to be maneuvered into place by cranes in the middle of the night. Each statue weighs 17\xC2 tons, which is 7\xC2 tons more than the tree. 
But there is only one tree. There are nine statues. 
"It's the ultimate combination of art and engineering," said Keith M. Douglas, the managing director for Rockefeller Center at Tishman Speyer, the real estate firm that controls Rockefeller Center.
He said the plaza could hold 300 pounds per square foot, and the installation brought the load to only about 250 pounds per square foot, even with several layers of concrete that are being poured to anchor the statues, with their towering legs, massive torsos and block-shaped heads.
Over the years, Rockefeller Center has been the setting for other large art displays: Jeff Koons's giant terrier, fashioned from 70,000 flowering plants; Louise Bourgeois's nine-ton bronze spider; and Takashi Murakami's 30-foot Buddha-like figure with multiple arms. "Human Nature" is the first since 2008, when the recession was closing in. It is also the first to be spread out in front of the G.E. Building. 
"Seventy-six hundred square feet of sculpture," said Nicholas Baume, director of the Public Art Fund, which helped organize the project. 
Mr. Douglas said he remembered the moment when Mr. Rondinone first described what he had in mind: A large-scale transformation of the plaza.
"My first thought was how big," Mr. Douglas said. "He was saying 'huge colossal sculptures,' and I'm thinking, 'In comparison to what?' and multiplying times nine." He said that when Mr. Rondinone delivered renderings, the scale and shape were "exactly right." 
Mr. Rondinone made the sculptures of bluestone from a quarry in Pennsylvania and left the stone surfaces rough and then cut them into slabs and blocks, forming primitive-looking figures that proved unexpectedly sturdy: "Ugo had one standing at the quarry during Sandy," Mr. Douglas said, referring to Hurricane Sandy last fall. "Didn't move a muscle."
Mr. Baume said that Mr. Rondinone has a country house "five minutes away" from the quarry, "but until this, had never worked with bluestone." He said Mr. Rondinone was "gifted at coming up with site-specific designs," and Mr. Rondinone said he went to the plaza every day for a couple of weeks last November. "Before the tree," he said.
He said the huge, coarse figures stand in contrast to the 70-floor building. "This is the most highly developed part of America, Midtown," Mr. Rondinone said. "To bring in something so basic is very powerful."
He said he made 50 miniature statues and named them before deciding which to choose for the full-scale treatment. He said the statue closest to 50th Street was "Joy," and he pointed to "Excitement," "Glad" and "Uplifting."
"I don't remember them all," he said. "But it's not an intellectual work. It's a work you have to feel."

HEADLINE: With Debt Study's Errors Confirmed, Debate on Conclusion Goes On

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: Two Harvard professors acknowledge that some data was flawed in their study of the relationship of debt and growth, but say the fundamental findings remain sound. 

 BODY:
The Harvard economists Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff have acknowledged that their groundbreaking 2010 study "Growth in a Time of Debt" includes statistical errors that significantly alter its results. 
Three economists at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, uncovered those errors in a bombshell paper released this week, which has prompted a huge debate in the economics blogosphere and resonated with policy makers gathered in Washington for the spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. (The paper is all the talk in Foggy Bottom.) 
In an e-mailed statement, Professors Reinhart and Rogoff admit their mistakes but argue that they do not change the ultimate lessons of the paper, originally published in The American Economic Review. "We are grateful to Herndon et al. for the careful attention to our original 'Growth in a Time of Debt' AER paper and for pointing out an important correction," they write. "We do not, however, believe this regrettable slip affects in any significant way the central message of the paper or that in our subsequent work." 
Both the University of Massachusetts and the Harvard authors now find that countries whose debt loads are 90 percent or more of their annual economic output tend to experience slower growth than countries whose debt loads are lighter - though the effect is much smaller than previously thought. 
The debate now centers on how to interpret those muddier results - and how the incorrect results influenced public policy in the post-crisis years. 
The debate over interpreting the new results has centered on the thorny question of causation. Does low growth cause high debts, or do high debts cause low growth? Can the Reinhart-Rogoff data set shine any light on that question? For their part, Professors Reinhart and Rogoff do not make a causal case in their paper, though they have in subsequent public comments. 
For more on this question, read Jared Bernstein, a former Obama administration economist, and Dean Baker of the left-of-center Center for Economic and Policy Research, as well as Tyler Cowen, Justin Fox and Mark Thoma. 
A broader question is how influential studies like Reinhart-Rogoff were in persuading countries to adopt austerity budgeting. My sense is that for deeply indebted countries with no way to finance themselves on the international markets - Greece being the central example - the answer is that it had little to no influence. 
That is because by 2010, when the Reinhart-Rogoff paper came out, Europe had already committed to austerity. Powerful policy makers including Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Schuble of Germany as well as Jean-Claude Trichet of the European Central Bank saw fiscal consolidation as necessary, full stop. That meant countries like Greece were boxed into it. 
The International Monetary Fund might have preferred a slower pace of fiscal adjustment, and in the past six months or so it has admitted that it greatly underestimated the impact that austerity budgets would have on weak economies. But in an interview, Olivier Blanchard, the fund's chief economist, said that even if it had better understood the damage that budget cuts might cause, it probably would not have meant different policy agreements. The problem was that nobody wanted to put up any more money for countries like Greece. 
"One of the unpleasant aspects of what happened is that we kept revising forecasts of growth in the euro periphery down," he said. "Part of it, though not all of it, is due to the fact that we just underestimated the effect of fiscal consolidation. 
"I don't like to be wrong systematically," Mr. Blanchard continued. "But if we had better forecasts, would we have had very different programs? I suspect the honest truth is that, because of financing constraints, probably only at the margin." 
A better question is what effect studies like Reinhart-Rogoff might have had in countries that elected to start the process of fiscal consolidation without much pressure from the bond markets or other external financiers. 
Britain and the United States are the big question marks there. The Cameron government in Britain - over the protestations of the opposition party and the monetary fund and other groups - has slashed the country's budget. But it still has not met its own deficit-reduction targets, because the economy has remained mired in recession and automatic spending on social programs has increased. The country still could reverse course and engage in an effort to improve growth rather than an effort to hold down its debts. But thus far it has chosen not to. 
The United States has also embarked on a campaign of deficit reduction, though a more modest one. Thus far, the Obama administration and Congress have raised taxes on the wealthiest Americans and agreed to trillions in budget cuts. With the aggressive actions taken by the Federal Reserve, the economy has continued to grow - which will greatly aid the country's fiscal situation in the long run. How important were academics like Professors Reinhart and Rogoff to that process? My sense is not very, as well, even if policy makers pushing for deficit reduction cited them.

HEADLINE: Rising Bank Profits Tempt a Push for Tougher Rules

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Steady earnings growth on Wall Street could embolden the lawmakers and regulators who want to overhaul the banking system. 

 BODY:
Banks have been reporting steady growth in earnings since soon after the financial crisis. With the latest reports rolling in, analysts think the banks' first-quarter profits will be their best ever.
But as welcome as such profits are to the banks, they may also become a source of discomfort. The ballooning bottom lines could embolden the lawmakers and regulators who want to introduce additional measures to overhaul the banking system.
After the financial crisis, many officials involved in the regulatory revamp feared that tougher rules, like caps on bank assets, could destabilize the financial system and harm economic growth. It is a view that prominent bankers and lobbyists have also voiced.
Despite industry opposition to new rules, the buoyant bank profits could add to the ammunition that influential figures in Washington are using to advocate for more radical ideas to overhaul the banks. 
"I hope the regulators move forward with tougher regulations," said Sheila C. Bair, a former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a primary bank regulator, and now a senior adviser at the Pew Charitable Trusts. "This wouldn't endanger the economic recovery."
Much has been done to strengthen banks since the financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank legislation, which Congress passed in 2010, and international banking standards known as the Basel III rules are forcing banks to hold safer assets, curtail trading activities and set aside more capital to absorb potential losses.
Even so, there is bipartisan support to do more. Most recently, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, said that they planned to introduce a bill that would require banks to hold considerably more capital. If passed, such a requirement is likely to prompt the largest banks to shrink in size. While a draft of the legislation does not stipulate a maximum size for banks, it requires financial firms with more than $400 billion of assets to hold additional capital. Big banks like Citigroup and Bank of America well exceed that amount, as do Wall Street firms like Morgan Stanley, but regional lenders would fall under that threshold.
The restlessness over the big banks extends beyond Congress.
Daniel K. Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor who oversees regulation, floated an idea last year for limiting bank size. And Thomas M. Hoenig, vice chairman at the F.D.I.C., has been pushing the overhaul of large, complex banks as well as more rigorous capital standards.
The banking industry might be able to bear more regulations, given how it has fared under earlier measures. In some ways, the banks have thrived despite the added costs of all the new rules and demands since 2008.
Dick Bove, a bank analyst at Rafferty Capital Markets, estimates that F.D.I.C.-insured banks will earn $39 billion in the first quarter of this year, which would be a record quarterly showing. "No one can argue that banks were hurt from a profit standpoint by regulation," he said.
The financial overhauls of the last four years don't appear to have held banks back from indulging in activities that facilitate economic growth. Helped by Wall Street financial firms, American companies have raised huge amounts in capital markets since the crisis. Last year, corporations issued $940 billion of bonds, a record amount, according to Dealogic, a data provider. This has happened even as investment banks scaled back their operations to get ready for regulations they vocally oppose, like the so-called Volcker Rule.
The overhaul doesn't appear to have hurt the housing market, either. Large lenders like Wells Fargo have profited well from the recent boom in mortgage refinancing. That activity has also helped consumers, through sharply lower borrowing rates for millions of homeowners.
Banks are also making significantly more loans to companies, which bolsters the economy and job growth in many parts of the country. There is even evidence that the overhaul may have helped the banks become better run. Citigroup, which was subject to much regulatory pressure, is more streamlined and reported strong first-quarter earnings this week.
Little of this might have been expected after hearing past warnings from bankers. In 2011, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said that the proposed rules to overhaul derivatives, a commonly used financial instrument, "would damage America." He also said that the Basel rules were "anti-American." Comment letters filed by lobbyists with regulators used sophisticated-looking models to show how rules could hold back the economy.
"As far as the banks are concerned, there is never a good time to raise capital or increase regulation," Ms. Bair said. "When times are bad, they say it could hurt things, and when times are good, they say they don't need it."
Some analysts, however, caution against reading too much into the banks' strong profits.
Though banks have been preparing for new rules for months, many of them have not been fully executed, which means the true costs of the measures will not be known until later.
Mr. Bove says that, while bank profits have hardly suffered from new regulation, their customers have. Lenders have simply passed on many of the costs, mostly in the form of new fees, he said. "The government aimed a Stinger missile at the banking industry and missed and hit the consumer instead," said Mr. Bove, who also notes that loans to small business are still weak.
In addition, bank profits may not be as strong as they look, say some analysts. Earnings appear less impressive when taking into account the new capital that banks have to hold. This can be seen when applying a metric called return on equity, which reflects the extra capital.
Financial companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had a 7.9 percent return on equity last year, according to data from S.& P. That's below the 10 percent return for utilities last year, also a regulated industry. And the banks' return is down from the 16 percent return that they achieved in 2006.
That is why some analysts argue that it would be a mistake to force banks to hold even more capital than they already will under Dodd-Frank and Basel III. They argue that it would depress returns on equity and therefore prompt banks to exit certain businesses, reducing credit in the economy. In a research note last week, a Goldman Sachs bank analyst estimated a Brown-Vitter bill could remove $3.8 trillion of credit from the United States banking system.
But considering that past dire forecasts haven't materialized, advocates for tougher rules may be tempted to press on.
Phillip L. Swagel, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, sees risks in adopting higher capital reserves, but he says he thinks the industry's gloominess can be overdone.
"I do understand the frustration of the bank critics when they see pieces like the one from Goldman Sachs saying that the world will end under Brown-Vitter," said Professor Swagel, who served as assistant secretary for economic policy under Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.
Despite the sharp debate, he says he thinks there is growing agreement among policy makers, and even banks, that more capital might be needed. "I see consensus on the top-line issue of more capital," he said.

HEADLINE: Are the Good Jobs Gone?

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: If &#8216;middle-skill&#8217; jobs are slipping away from the middle class and the poor, what can President Obama do about it? 

 BODY:
Among those paying serious attention to the economic dilemmas facing the United States and other advanced nations, uncertainty is the only constant.
President Obama faces powerful forces not under his control. The susceptibility of these forces to governmental action is hard to fathom, and in any case many of the best ideas appear to be politically impossible. What can he do? He will have to gamble more on the adaptability of American workers and their employers to achieve the core of his agenda than on his constrained ability to legislate.
Instead of attempting to win approval of a massive overhaul of public and private sector practices, Obama is likely to use the bully pulpit to try to establish a climate of public opinion more favorable to major public intervention.
Obama outlined his goals in his second inaugural address: 
For we, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it. We believe that America's prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class. We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work; when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship.
Economists are of many minds on the question of whether government policies can reverse negative trends.
David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., argued in an email to The Times that "we're not going to rapidly reverse the tide with any conceivable policy that a mainstream political party or even a mainstream economist would adopt." Autor believes that "middle-skill jobs," the source of employment crucial to lessening inequality and enhancing economic and social mobility, "are not," as some argue, "slated to disappear." 
In a paper, "The Task Approach to Labor Markets: An Overview," Autor writes:
To take one prominent example, medical paraprofessional positions-radiology technicians, phlebotomists, nurse technicians, etc.-are a numerically significant and rapidly growing category of relatively well-remunerated, middle skill occupations. While these para-professions do not require a college degree, they do demand one to two years of post-secondary vocational training.
The middle-skill jobs that are likely to grow, Autor says,
will combine routine technical tasks with the set of non-routine tasks in which workers hold comparative advantage-interpersonal interaction, flexibility, adaptability and problem solving. Medical para-professions are one leading example of this virtuous combination, but this example is not a singularity. This broad description also fits numerous skilled trade and repair occupations-plumbers, builders, electricians, HVAC installers, automotive technicians-marketing occupations, and even modern clerical occupations that provide coordination and decision-making functions rather than simply typing and filing.
Along similar lines, Lawrence Katz , an economist at Harvard, wrote in response to an emailed inquiry from The Times:
This is not the first wave of (wage) polarization (resulting from) technological change. Economic history suggests educational and institutional advances can allow for balanced prosperity in the face of such changes in labor demand. Of course, it is less clear today whether economic history is a better guide to the future than science fiction stories about robots and new technologies that range from Star Trek positive to a world of dystopian futures. I would probably bet on economic history but it will require new educational advances on the scale of inventing the modern high school in the early 20th century, providing universal access without tuition and rethinking labor market institutions to support "high road" strategies by firms.
Adaptation to market pressures is a common theme today among economists. Michael Spence, an economist at N.Y.U. who won a Nobel Prize in 2001, recently wrote in a Project Syndicate column:
In fact, it is possible that we are entering a period in which major adaptations in employment models, work weeks, contract labor, minimum wages, and the delivery of essential public services will be needed in order to maintain social cohesion and uphold the core values of equity and intergenerational mobility.
In response to a follow-up inquiry, Spence wrote that he is 
pessimistic and uncertain in the short term because the adaptations are large. Public sector investment is likely to be lower than it should for a considerable period because of fiscal constraints and problems. Longer term, I think values will shift, people will invest in being better prepared for the new work environment.
Kenneth Rogoff, also an economist at Harvard, places his faith in the restorative power of market forces, acknowledging that 
until now, the relentless march of technology and globalization has played out hugely in favor of high-skilled labor, helping to fuel record-high levels of income and wealth inequality around the world.
Rogoff goes on to argue, however, that technology may work in the future to reduce income inequality, especially in the field of education: 
Surely, higher education will eventually be hit by the same kind of sweeping wave of technology that has flattened the automobile and media industries, among others. If the commoditization of education eventually extends to at least lower-level college courses, the impact on income inequality could be profound.
In addition, Rogoff writes:
Many commentators seem to believe that the growing gap between rich and poor is an inevitable byproduct of increasing globalization and technology. In their view, governments will need to intervene radically in markets to restore social balance. I disagree. Yes, we need genuinely progressive tax systems, respect for workers' rights, and generous aid policies on the part of rich countries. But the past is not necessarily prologue: given the remarkable flexibility of market forces, it would be foolish, if not dangerous, to infer rising inequality in relative incomes in the coming decades by extrapolating from recent trends.
Changes forced by market pressures, according to Rogoff, will not be easy to take:
Many (if not necessarily all) central banks will eventually figure out how to generate higher inflation expectations. They will be driven to tolerate higher inflation as a means of forcing investors [to put their money] into real assets, to accelerate deleveraging, and as a mechanism for facilitating downward adjustment in real wages and home prices.
The reduction in the number of mid-range jobs - a reduction that restricts mobility and increases inequality - results from factors now deeply ingrained in the marketplace which do not lend themselves to obvious remediation.
In an article that will soon be published in the American Economic Review, "The Growth of Low Skill Service Jobs and the Polarization of the U.S. Labor Market," Autor and David Dorn, at the Center for Monetary and Financial Studies, show the continuing decline in mid-skill mid-pay jobs, and the growing segmentation of the employment marketplace into high and low-end jobs.
Fig. 1
Panel A shows the growth in the number of high and low end jobs, in contrast to the decline or stagnation in the growth of middle-range jobs. Panel B shows that pay has increased substantially at the high end, moderately at the low end and very little in the middle.
These workforce developments are now a worldwide phenomenon. This suggests that adaptations to the current asymmetry in wage distribution will be challenging.
Andrew McAfee of M.I.T. provided me with new data and charts showing sustained productivity gains accompanied by declining manufacturing employment in countries as diverse as the United States (Figure 2) and China (Figure 3).
 Fig. 2. 
The red line tracks the number of employees in industrial production in the United States from 1972 to the present, and the blue line tracks productivity (output per hour) gains.
Fig. 3
The blue line tracks manufacturing employment in China from 1990 to 2008 and the red line tracks gains in manufacturing value added in billions of dollars.
Figure 4 illustrates how productivity (blue line) and real G.D.P. (grey line) have steadily outpaced increases in employment (red line) and median household income (green line) over the six decades from 1953 to 2011.
 Fig. 4. 
Obama's assault on inequality and on the lack of employment growth has encountered stubborn resistance and has failed so far to meaningfully address the divergence between the top .01% and everyone else.
Annie Lowrey pointed out in The Times last week that despite Obama's legislative successes, inequality has worsened during his administration. His successes include winning passage of the Affordable Care Act, which will provide health care to some 30 million largely poor men, women and children; legislation raising the top income tax rate from 35 to 39.6; an increase in the tax rate on unearned income that flows largely to the affluent; and an extension of the earned income tax credit for the working poor.
To those who say Obama has not done enough for the poor, his current budget proposal calls for:

        
A minimum wage increase from $7.25 to $9 an hour indexed to inflation.
        
Creation of a "preschool for all" that would provide education to low and moderate income 4-year-olds.
        
An end to the "carried interest" tax provision benefiting hedge fund operators.
        
Making the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which helps people pay college tuition, permanent.
Nonetheless, the measures Obama has seen enacted, and those he has proposed, are inadequate to deal with the forces driving the gap between rising productivity and the stagnant or falling standard of living of the majority of American workers.
Despite the president's efforts, Lowrey writes, "the plight of the middle class has gotten worse since Mr. Obama took office." Real median income is eight percent below pre-recession levels and middle-class jobs continue to be replaced by low-wage jobs. Research by the National Employment Law Project shows that "low-wage occupations account for 21 percent of job losses during the recession and 58 percent of job growth during the recovery" while "middle-wage occupations account for 60 percent of recession losses and only 20 percent of recovery growth." At the top, research updated on Jan. 23, 2013 by Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, "shows that the real income of the 99 percent has fallen during the recovery, but surged 11 percent for the top 1 percent of earners."
Obama is unlikely to achieve top-rank historic status based on his legislative agenda. What he does have is a shot at using the platform of the presidency to jumpstart the process of economic adaptation by strengthening public awareness. People need to understand that the economic problems facing the country - wage polarization, inequality and lost middle class jobs - are structural, not just cyclical.
As consciousness of the depth and scope of the difficulties facing this country and other developed countries grows, their populations will be more receptive to exploring and testing the kind of institutional changes in education, fiscal policy and corporate employment practices that have the potential to restore and widely distribute the benefits of growth.
Obama's legislative record may not be on the scale of the New Deal or of the Great Society. After his success with health care legislation, his mark will rest instead on shifting the national mindset. As a political candidate, Obama has played a crucial role in the creation of a solidified progressive coalition. As president, he has more power than anyone else to set the terms of the national debate. He can nurture greater empathy for workers, encourage majoritarian opposition to the conservative anti-regulation-anti-tax agenda, and reactivate dormant instincts of self-determination among the previously marginalized. It won't be the first time he has faced long odds.

HEADLINE: Does High Debt Cause Slow Growth?

BYLINE: VIKAS BAJAJ


HIGHLIGHT: Or does slow growth cause high debt? 

 BODY:
The debate over whether government spending hurts or helps growth has again taken center stage this week because of a new research paper by two professors and a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Their study critiques the methods and conclusions of a 2010 paper by Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart, both professors at Harvard, showing that countries with high debts also have lower growth rates.
The original paper is important because many Republicans as well as European policy makers cited it as evidence that if governments did not dramatically reduce debt they would consign their economies to years or decades of stagnation. Recall Mitt Romney's admonition during the presidential debates that the United States was "heading towards Greece."

The specific details of the debate have been covered extensively elsewhere, but broadly speaking the Amherst team - Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin - focused on whether Mr. Rogoff and Ms. Reinhart overstated the relationship between high government debt and economic growth because of incomplete data and questionable analytic methods. Mr. Rogoff and Ms. Reinhart said the average growth rates in countries with debts of more than 90 percent was 0.1 percent, but the Amherst team said it should have been 2.2 percent. 
While it is important that economists get the numbers right, this debate has not really addressed the larger issue at stake here: the sequence of events. In other words, does high debt cause slow growth? Or does slow growth cause high debt? Or, to really complicate the discussion, do they both feed on each other depending on the specific circumstances of each country and how its policy makers respond?
Let's just look at recent evidence. In the United States, the economy started slowing sharply in 2007 and 2008 because of the financial crisis, which let's remember was caused by debts taken on by banks and the private sector, not the government. In fact, American government debt in 2008 was just 54 percent of GDP, according to International Monetary Fund data, comfortably below the 90 percent threshold cited in the Rogoff-Reinhart paper. Government debt has been climbing since, but most of the increase cannot be blamed on excessive spending; the fiscal stimulus package Congress approved in early 2009 amounted to less than 1 percent of GDP. So what has caused the surge in debt? The recession, mostly, which reduced government revenue by nearly 17 percent in 2009.
For more evidence questioning the idea that government debt causes growth to slow one can turn to Britain. In that country, Prime Minister David Cameron has been trying to cut spending and raise some taxes in an effort to bring down fiscal debt. Yet, far from achieving a lower debt, Britain's debt as a percent of GDP has been growing, hitting 82.8 percent in 2012, up from 72.9 percent when Mr. Cameron took office. Why would that happen? The government's effort to cut spending has served to depress rather than stimulate the economy, making it virtually impossible for the country to reduce its debt.
None of this is to say that governments can borrow and spend without a care. Eventually the United States and Britain, not to mention the rest of Europe, will have to pay down their debts. But real-world experience suggest that it's counterproductive to try to reduce debts while the economy is still struggling.

HEADLINE: London To Harlem Via Chelsea

BYLINE: By GEORGE GURLEY

 BODY:
On a recent afternoon, the longtime society caterer Serena Bass was having lunch at Lido, the Italian restaurant in Harlem where she has been the executive chef since last fall, and reading a text message. ''There is a book just out called 'Best Chefs America,' and I'm in it,'' she said. ''I'm quite surprised. So that's good.''
After sharing a grilled kale salad, Ms. Bass stood up. Her cherubic looks (white platinum bob, bright red lipstick) and crisp English diction bring to mind Judi Dench's younger sister. ''People say that all the time,'' she said. ''It's the biggest compliment.''
She was wearing a Ronaldus Shamask dress, a black mohair sweater, earrings bought on the street, Trina Turk leggings and ''undemanding'' kitchen shoes. Driving to an afternoon meeting in her Subaru station wagon, Ms. Bass admitted to being ''shamelessly aggressive'' on the road. In the middle of a crowded intersection, she hit the brakes and made a sudden illegal U-turn, executed so brazenly that it left the other drivers too stunned or too impressed to honk. 
The older of her two sons, Joe Shaffer, recently bought a town house for his mother in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and she is worried about noise on her block. ''I need my quiet time, I need silence,'' Ms. Bass said. ''I can't have extraneous noise or I will shoot myself.''
This is, perhaps, a corrective measure for a life spent largely in the bustling center of everything. For years, Ms. Bass has been a go-to caterer for the glittery set, doing events for Sarah Jessica Parker, Julia Roberts, Keith Richards, Andrew M. Cuomo, Marc Jacobs, the New York City Ballet, Este Lauder, Vanity Fair and Miramax. At the turn of the millennium, she presided over a successful nightclub in the basement of the Chelsea Hotel.
But now, she appears to be done with downtown. She said that she finds it increasingly impossible walking along the street in Manhattan. ''People stop me no matter where I am,'' she said. ''On airplanes. At Yankee Stadium. It's just that I've been around in New York life for so long.''
It is not clear if Ms. Bass's clientele will follow her up to Harlem (she said Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis, Susan Stroman, Neil Patrick Harris and Jane Krakowski have already been to Lido), but nor is it clear that she cares. At 67, she is in the mood to take stock of a remarkable life in night life.
Ms. Bass, the youngest of four sisters, was born in London (according to family lore, she was conceived at a party celebrating V-E Day). Her father, Frank Millington, was a publisher and minor watercolorist. Her mother, Constance, was 22 years younger: a former secretary and a good cook.
Serena was ''very naughty'' growing up, according to one sister, Beth Millington, a psychologist. ''Lunch would be being prepared, the table being laid, and Serena would climb on the table and start doing a tap dance in front of all the guests,'' Ms. Millington said. ''Showing her knickers, anything, it didn't matter. And I don't think she's changed since then, quite honestly.''
Constance Millington died of cervical cancer at age 43 and the girls were not allowed to attend the funeral. Their father remarried three weeks later, and the daughters did not get along with his new wife. Serena was sent to an expensive boarding school in Brighton. There, she said, she became ''a little porky'' from eating shepherd's pie, cauliflower cheese, chocolate bars and lemon sherbet.
She went on to live in a boardinghouse run by a Mrs. Rosling. ''Very Dickensian,'' she said. On the first night, Mrs. Rosling became distracted while cooking Serena a steak dinner and nearly cut off a finger.
Her sisters Beth and Gaynor (who went on to be Minnie Driver's mother) had become fashion models in London. One of Beth's boyfriends was the comedian Peter Cook, who was then performing in the hit revue ''Beyond the Fringe.'' He brought his co-stars Dudley Moore and Jonathan Miller for a drink with the Millington girls. Mr. Miller was friends with a young doctor, David Shaffer, who hit it off, first with Beth, then Serena, whom he took to the Fenwick department store on Bond Street, where he bought her a pink baby-doll nightie and a camel-hair coat.
She was 16, he was 26. They came home very late from Ronnie Scott's jazz club in Soho and he asked her to make him some scrambled eggs. She had never cooked before, only watched her sisters. ''These are the best eggs I've ever eaten,'' Dr. Shaffer said. ''Why don't we have a dinner party?''
He bought her Elizabeth David's ''French Provincial Cooking'' and she read it cover to cover. ''Cooking was easy,'' she recalled in her 2004 cookbook, ''Serena, Food, & Stories: Feeding Friends Every Hour of the Day.'' She wrote, ''And since at sixteen I looked about twelve, when all this fancy food was delivered to the table, it produced such cries of astonishment and delight (not to mention the praise) that I determined to cook a great deal in the future.''
At 20, she married Dr. Shaffer. She attended Saint Martins College, writing her thesis on American Indian costumes.
Her husband encouraged her to start a wholesale clothing company. She ran the business, her friend Frances did the designs, and an editor at British Vogue, Grace Coddington, assigned a huge article about their first collection, ''Blueprint,'' which referred to the indigo dye fabric they used. ''It was a bit of a disaster,'' Ms. Bass said. ''Because unless you washed it two or three times first, all your underwear turned blue.''
At the height of Swinging London and into the 1970s, the Shaffers were a happening couple. One night, ''David was dancing with somebody and I decided he was dancing too intimately, and I cut in, and I bit him,'' Ms. Bass recalled. ''I drew blood. I was furious. But it's amazing what tequila will do.''
In 1977, Dr. Shaffer accepted an offer to be the head of Pediatric Psychiatry at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. Moving to New York was difficult for Ms. Bass, with her husband working long hours. But there were advantages: When the dishwasher broke at their apartment on West 11th Street, it was fixed right away, as opposed to what would have happened in England. ''Now, now, now! I love now,'' Ms. Bass said.
In 1980, she went to see a manufacturer of women's clothing named Curt Bass. He was nine years younger and wore T-shirts, bluejeans, polyester clothes and a belt with his name on it bought by his mother. After a passionate two-year affair, she left Dr. Shaffer.
In 1982, someone asked Ms. Bass to cook for an art gallery party after the caterer backed out. She was stunned to receive $250 later. ''I couldn't believe that somebody would pay me for doing what I absolutely loved to do,'' she said. ''It seemed ridiculous.''
The next morning, the socialite and author Brooke Hayward called. She had been at the party, loved the food, got on well with Ms. Bass, and asked her to cater a dinner for her. A few hours later, the literary agent Lynn Nesbit made the same request.
In 1984, with the divorce finalized, Dr. Shaffer married Anna Wintour and his ex-wife became Serena Bass.
Ms. Bass said Mr. Bass turned out to have a huge clothing business and a lot of money. (''Not true,'' he said in a phone interview. ''It was a small family business and I was working hard to get us financially ahead.'')
They bought an apartment on West 13th Street and a house in North Salem, N.Y.
Ms. Bass decorated, exercised, gardened. But she was bored. After she went over budget constructing another home, on Tortola in the British Virgin Islands, she and Mr. Bass had a dispute. They divorced in 1996, but she kept his surname, liking the way it sounded.
In 1999, she and her younger son with Dr. Shaffer, Sam, who had studied economics at Tufts University, started a lounge called Serena in the basement of the Chelsea Hotel that quickly was competing with Lot 61 and Lotus. Stella McCartney and Oprah Winfrey gave parties there. Madonna, Sean Penn, Lou Reed, Gwen Stefani, Shannen Doherty, Heather Locklear and Johnny Lydon made the scene, too. Ethan Hawke, who lived upstairs, was a regular. One night Robert Smith of The Cure fell asleep on a sofa at 7 p.m. At 8:30, Salman Rushdie arrived for a book party. Later Monica Lewinsky walked in.
At the time, Ms. Bass described herself as cross between Marie Antoinette and Lady Macbeth. ''Unfortunately, I learned at the bar that ability when your eyes flicker over the person you're talking to, over their shoulder if they're a little boring, and you kind of say: 'Sorry I'll be right back, I have to go now.' '' she said.
She liked playing a lot of Brazilian music, interspersing it with African and Cuban music, Eminem, Jay-Z or her favorite song, ''I Will Survive.''
''I was a very good D.J.,'' Ms. Bass said. ''It's a very powerful thing, because you can make everybody get up and dance if you feel like it and then when they're too wild, you can calm them down, and they will go trailing back to their seats.''
Ms. Bass didn't have a cabaret license and started racking up ''terrible fines'' for all the dancing. She was also spending thousands of dollars on Napoleon ivy (which she now wants to sell on eBay), ''interesting'' china, furniture, cashmere blankets, chartreuse pillows, good linen sheets from London and a house in Fairfield, Conn.
In August 2001 the lounge was raided and cited for having an inadequate fire exit (by two inches, Ms. Bass said). In a lead Page Six item, Ms. Bass was quoted comparing the authorities to ''the Gestapo.'' A Chelsea Hotel resident called the club a ''deathtrap.'' The new exit cost $94,000. The bar reopened in October, but in 2004, Ms. Bass accepted an offer to sell it. The new owners changed the name, and it soon went out of business. The space is empty now.
''Every now and then I do I miss it,'' Ms. Bass said.
She sold her country house in Connecticut, paid off her debts and moved from the meatpacking district to Fort Greene.
''I'm a kind of Brooklyn Buddhist now, in that I like walking around, meeting everybody's eyes,'' she said. ''In Brooklyn, everybody looks at you, and up in Harlem, what I particularly like is they comment on what you're wearing. 'Love your pants!' ''
In 2007 Ms. Bass was given a diagnosis of endometrial cancer. Before every round of chemotherapy, she had the chefs in her kitchen make brownies and cakes and cookies for the nurses. She remembers waking up after a dose of Benadryl and seeing four nurses standing in front of her. ''It was a bit like Busby Berkeley, because they were arranged in height, the tallest on the right, down, down, down,'' she said. ''They saw my eyes open, and the main nurse said, 'Those cupcakes are better than sex.' ''
She is not dreading old age.
''I'm going to do well when I'm finally, completely incapacitated and I'm in a nursing home, because presumably I'll be surrounded by people who are trying to help and look after me,'' she said. ''It's exactly the same as being in the restaurant business.''

HEADLINE: Report Urges White House To Rethink Iran Penalties

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A panel of former senior American officials and outside experts, including several who recently left the Obama administration, issued a surprisingly critical assessment of American diplomacy toward Iran on Wednesday, urging President Obama to become far more engaged and to reconsider the likelihood that harsh sanctions will drive Tehran to concessions.
In a report issued by the Iran Project, the former diplomats and experts suggested that the sanctions policy, rather than bolstering diplomacy, may be backfiring. As the pressure has increased, the group concluded, sanctions have ''contributed to an increase in repression and corruption within Iran'' and ''may be sowing the seeds of long-term alienation between the Iranian people and the United States.'' 
The critique comes as both Israel and Congress are urging the administration to go in the opposite direction, to put a sharp time limit on negotiations and, if necessary, to go beyond the financial and oil sanctions that have caused a tremendous drop in the value of the Iranian currency and sent inflation soaring.
''I fundamentally believe that the balance between sanctions and diplomacy has been misaligned,'' said Thomas R. Pickering, who was one of the State Department's highest-ranking career diplomats and whom the department has called on to head up important investigations, including one into the death last fall of the American ambassador to Libya.
In an interview, Mr. Pickering also contended that Mr. Obama should review the covert program against Iran -- which has included computer sabotage of its nuclear facilities -- to ''stop anything that is peripheral, that is not buying us much time'' in slowing Iran's progress. The report itself, however, says nothing about the sabotage effort, which has been a major element of the American strategy.
Mr. Pickering, who is such a towering figure in the State Department that a major program to train young diplomats is named for him, is not the only prominent signatory of the report. Others include Lee H. Hamilton, who was a leader of the commission on the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and serves on Mr. Obama's intelligence advisory board; Anne-Marie Slaughter, the director of policy planning during Mr. Obama's first term; and Ryan C. Crocker, who served in many prominent ambassadorial positions. Former Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, an early mentor to Mr. Obama in the Senate, was among the Republican signatories.
At the core of the difference in strategy are these questions: Are the increasing sanctions likely to harden Iran's position and convince its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that the president's real goal is overthrowing the current government? Or are they likely to convince the Iranians, eventually, that the price of continuing the country's nuclear program is simply too high, as Mr. Obama has argued?
So far, there is plenty of evidence that the sanctions are hurting Iran, but none that they are changing the course of the country's nuclear program. Still, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted this week to bolster sanctions, if necessary, and Israel has argued that the stalling of the most recent round of talks has offered only more proof that the Iranians are playing for time, seeking to expand their nuclear enrichment capacity while keeping the talks limping along.
Mr. Obama and his diplomats have insisted that the sanctions they have imposed are in support of diplomacy. A State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said in a statement that the administration was sticking with its approach.
''We just completed a series of diplomatic talks'' with America's allies in dealing with Tehran, Ms. Psaki said, ''including three recent rounds of meetings that included Iran.'' She said that ''a dual track approach of rigorous sanctions and serious negotiations is the right approach. However, the onus is on Iran to take the next steps and move the process forward.''

HEADLINE: Housing and Auto Sales Lifted Economy, Fed Says

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- A strengthening housing recovery and robust auto sales contributed to moderate economic growth across the United States in late February and March, according to a Federal Reserve survey released Wednesday.
Growth was moderate or modest in all of the Fed's 12 banking districts, and it accelerated in two -- New York and Dallas -- from January and early February.
The survey suggested that the economy performed better in March than some government data on hiring and consumer spending had indicated. That could mean the economic weakness might have been temporary. 
The Fed survey, which is based on anecdotal reports, found that hiring was unchanged or improved slightly compared with the previous report. And it noted that consumer spending -- which drives most of the economy -- grew modestly. But the report also said higher taxes and a spike in gasoline prices had slowed sales.
By contrast, the Labor Department said earlier this month that job growth slowed sharply in March. And retail sales declined in March by the most in nine months, a separate report said last week.
Dana Saporta, an economist at Credit Suisse, said the survey was ''consistent with the larger picture of steady if unspectacular growth.''
''We get caught up in the monthly volatility of the data, and we need to step back,'' she said.
Zach Pandl, an economist at Columbia Management, an investment firm, said the rosier tone of the survey was probably a reason that several Fed policy makers recently expressed optimism despite sluggish economic data.
The Fed survey said the recovery in home construction was gaining momentum and creating more construction jobs. It is also increasing factory output of housing-related goods, like lumber.
The report did note some weak spots. Several districts said manufacturers of military-related goods had cut jobs in response to government spending cuts that started taking effect March 1.
Still, it said that overall growth was moderate, an upgrade from the ''modest to moderate'' pace in the previous two reports.
The Fed report, called the beige book, provides an overview of economic conditions from Feb. 22 through April 5. The information will be discussed along with other economic data during the Fed's next policy meeting on April 30 and May 1.
At that meeting, most analysts expect the Fed to maintain its low interest rate policies but take no new steps. The Fed is expected to stick with its plan to keep short-term interest rates at record lows at least until unemployment falls to 6.5 percent. And it will most likely continue buying $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage bonds to try to keep long-term rates low and encourage borrowing, spending and investing.
Debate has heated up among Fed policy makers about when to start curtailing the bond-buying program, which began last fall. At their last meeting March 19-20, a majority of Fed officials said they favored continuing the bond purchases at least through the middle of this year. But many members indicated that they want to start winding down the program before the end of the year, as long as hiring and the economy continued to improve.
Since that meeting, some government reports had suggested that the economy weakened in March. Employers added only 88,000 jobs in March, a sharp slowdown from average gains of 220,000 in November through February. And consumers cut back on spending at retail stores and restaurants last month, a sign that higher Social Security taxes might have made more Americans cautious about spending.

HEADLINE: House Hunting in ... Costa Rica

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA C. McGUIRE

 BODY:
A FIVE-BEDROOM CONTEMPORARY ON A GOLF COURSE IN COSTA RICA
$1.6 MILLION
This boxy white house in the gated community of Parque Valle del Sol in Santa Ana, a suburb of San Jos, was completed in 2007. The front door opens into a large foyer tiled in cream-colored marble, with a rectangular pool and fountain built into the floor. The living/dining room, entered at the far end, has sliding glass doors opening onto a covered patio. A swinging door in the dining area leads to the kitchen, which has black granite countertops and cabinets by the Italian company Febal. The family room, the servants' quarters and a two-car garage are all behind the kitchen.
The foyer also connects to one of two master bedroom suites, which has a door to the patio, as well as a bathroom with cream-colored marble floors, brown marble sinks and a spa tub. The rest of the private living space -- with its bamboo floors and ultraviolet-blocking windows -- is upstairs. The second master suite has a walk-in closet, a bar and a bathroom, as well as a balcony overlooking the community's 18-hole golf course. The three additional bedrooms all have en-suite baths. 
The back of the house, with a swimming pool and a sun-bathing patio, faces the rolling grassy hills of the golf course.
The Parque Valle del Sol development is about 10 minutes from downtown San Jos and 15 minutes from the Juan Santamara International Airport. The nearest shops, restaurants and hotels are five minutes away at Lindora Plaza. The beaches at Playa Herradura are an hour and 15 minutes away.
MARKET OVERVIEW
Demand for luxury homes in the San Jos area is getting stronger, said John Wieland, the president of Coldwell Banker Costa Rica, adding that a number of multinational corporations had recently opened offices in Costa Rica.
Federico Vega, a commercial manager at Secure Title of Latin America, a title insurance company in San Jos, said prices were lower in coastal resort areas, which relied heavily on foreign buyers. ''These areas are still recoving from the financial crisis that began in 2008,'' he said.
New homes in Santa Ana cost $149 to $204 per square foot ($1,600 to $2,200 per square meter). Resales are less expensive, at $111 to $149 per square foot. The house profiled here is priced at $201 per square foot because of the quality of its building materials, according to Jeff Cane of the San Jos-based Karen Real Estate, the listing agent.
WHO BUYS IN COSTA RICA
Many foreign buyers come from other Latin American countries, especially Colombia, Venezuela and Panama, said Mr. Vega. But he added: ''The No. 1 is still the United States. You're still getting a lot of people wanting to come and settle down here in Costa Rica.''
BUYING BASICS
''Any foreigner can own real estate just as well as a Costa Rican,'' Mr. Vega said. In the past, many foreigners chose to set up Costa Rican corporations to be the official owners of their property, but the government recently closed the tax loophole that made this option attractive. Mr. Vega says that individual buyers have always paid a 2.5 percent transfer tax when property changes hands, and that corporate owners will now have to pay the same amount. Aside from the transfer tax, transaction costs include a notary fee of 1.25 percent, and title insurance costing about 1 percent.
''High-end properties are always priced in U.S. dollars,'' Mr. Cane said.

HEADLINE: More Children In Greece Start To Go Hungry

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN; Dimitris Bounias contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ATHENS -- As an elementary-school principal, Leonidas Nikas is used to seeing children play, laugh and dream about the future. But recently he has seen something altogether different, something he thought was impossible in Greece: children picking through school trash cans for food; needy youngsters asking playmates for leftovers; and an 11-year-old boy, Pantelis Petrakis, bent over with hunger pains.
''He had eaten almost nothing at home,'' Mr. Nikas said, sitting in his cramped school office near the port of Piraeus, a working-class suburb of Athens, as the sound of a jump rope skittered across the playground. He confronted Pantelis's parents, who were ashamed and embarrassed but admitted that they had not been able to find work for months. Their savings were gone, and they were living on rations of pasta and ketchup.
''Not in my wildest dreams would I expect to see the situation we are in,'' Mr. Nikas said. ''We have reached a point where children in Greece are coming to school hungry. Today, families have difficulties not only of employment, but of survival.'' 
The Greek economy is in free-fall, having shrunk by 20 percent in the past five years. Unemployment is more than 27 percent, the highest in Europe, and 6 of 10 job seekers say they have not worked in more than a year. Those dry statistics are reshaping the lives of Greek families with children, more of whom are arriving at schools hungry or underfed, even malnourished, according to private groups and the government itself.
Last year, an estimated 10 percent of Greek elementary- and middle-school students suffered from what public health professionals call ''food insecurity,'' meaning they faced hunger or the risk of it, said Dr. Athena Linos, a professor at the University of Athens Medical School who also heads a food assistance program at Prolepsis, a nongovernmental public health group that has studied the situation. ''When it comes to food insecurity, Greece has now fallen to the level of some African countries,'' she said.
Unlike those in the United States, Greek schools do not offer subsidized cafeteria lunches. Students bring their own food or buy items from a canteen. The cost has become insurmountable for some families with little or no income. Their troubles have been compounded by new austerity measures demanded by Greece's creditors, including higher electricity taxes and cuts in subsidies for large families. As a result, parents without work are seeing their savings and benefits rapidly disappear.
''All around me I hear kids saying: 'My parents don't have any money. We don't know what we are going to do,' '' said Evangelia Karakaxa, a vivacious 15-year-old at the No. 9 junior high school in Acharnes.
Acharnes, a working-class town among the mountains of Attica, was bustling with activity from imports until the economic crisis wiped out thousands of factory jobs.
Now, several of Evangelia's classmates are frequently hungry, she said, and one boy recently fainted. Some children were starting to steal for food, she added. While she did not excuse it, she understood their plight. ''Those who are well fed will never understand those who are not,'' she said.
''Our dreams are crushed,'' added Evangelia, whose parents are unemployed but who is not in the same dire situation as her peers. She paused, then continued in a low voice. ''They say that when you drown, your life flashes before your eyes. My sense is that in Greece, we are drowning on dry land.''
Alexandra Perri, who works at the school, said that at least 60 of the 280 students suffered from malnutrition. Children who once boasted of sweets and meat now talk of eating boiled macaroni, lentils, rice or potatoes. ''The cheapest stuff,'' Ms. Perri said.
This year the number of malnutrition cases jumped. ''A year ago, it wasn't like this,'' Ms. Perri, said, fighting back tears. ''What's frightening is the speed at which it is happening.''
The government, which initially dismissed the reports as exaggerations, recently acknowledged that it needed to ''tackle the issue of malnutrition in schools.'' But with priorities placed on repaying bailout funds, there is little money in Greek coffers to cope.
Mr. Nikas, the principal, said he knew the Greek government was laboring to fix the economy. Now that talk of Greece's exiting the euro zone has disappeared, things look better to the outside world. ''But tell that to the family of Pantelis,'' he said. ''They don't feel the improvement in their lives.''
In the family's darkened apartment near the school, Themelina Petrakis, Pantelis's mother, opened her refrigerator and cupboards one recent weekend. Inside was little more than a few bottles of ketchup and other condiments, some macaroni and leftovers from a meal she had gotten from the town hall.
The family was doing well and was even helping others in need until last year. It was able to afford a spacious apartment with a flat-screen TV and a PlayStation.
Then her husband, Michalis, 41, was laid off from his shipping job in December. He said the company had not paid his wages for five months before that. The couple could no longer afford rent, and by February they had run out of money.
''When the principal called, I had to tell him, 'We don't have food,' '' said Ms. Petrakis, 36, cradling Pantelis's head as he cast his eyes to the ground.
Mr. Petrakis said he felt emasculated after repeatedly failing to find new work. When food for the family ran low, he stopped eating almost entirely, and rapidly lost weight.
''When I was working last summer, I even threw away excess bread,'' he said, tears streaming down his face. ''Now, I sit here with a war running through my head, trying to figure out how we will live.''
When the hunger comes, Ms. Petrakis has a solution. ''It's simple,'' she said. ''You get hungry, you get dizzy and you sleep it off.''
A 2012 Unicef report showed that among the poorest Greek households with children, more than 26 percent had an ''economically weak diet.'' The phenomenon has hit immigrants hardest but is spreading quickly among Greeks in urban areas where one or both parents are effectively permanently unemployed.
In rural areas, people can at least grow food. But that is not enough to eradicate the problem. An hour's drive northwest of Athens, in the industrial town of Asproprigos, Nicos Tsoufar, 42, stared vacantly ahead as he sat in the middle school that his three children attend. The school receives lunches from a program run by Prolepsis, the public health group. Mr. Tsoufar said his children desperately needed the meals.
He has not found work for three years. Now, he said, his family is living on what he called ''a cabbage-based diet,'' which it supplements by foraging for snails in nearby fields. ''I know you can't cover nutritional basics with cabbage,'' he said bitterly. ''But there's no alternative.''
The government and groups like Prolepsis are doing what they can. Last year, Prolepsis started a pilot program providing a sandwich, fruit and milk at 34 public schools where more than half of the 6,400 families participating said they had experienced ''medium to serious hunger.''
After the program, that percentage dropped to 41 percent. Financed by an $8 million grant from the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, an international philanthropic organization, the program was expanded this year to cover 20,000 children at 120 schools.
Konstantinos Arvanitopoulos, Greece's education minister, said the government had secured European Union financing to provide fruit and milk in schools, and vouchers for bread and cheese. It is also working with the Greek Orthodox Church to provide thousands of care packages. ''It is the least we can do in this difficult financial circumstance,'' he said.
Mr. Nikas, the principal at 11-year-old Pantelis's school, has taken matters into his own hands and is organizing food drives at the school. He is angry at what he sees as broader neglect of Greece's troubles by Europe.
''I'm not saying we should just wait for others to help us,'' he said. ''But unless the European Union acts like this school, where families help other families because we're one big family, we're done for.''

HEADLINE: New-Car Sales Fall 10.2% in Europe, Continuing Slump

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- European new car sales contracted in March for an 18th consecutive month, led by declines in Germany and France, industry data showed on Wednesday.
New vehicle registrations in the European Union fell 10.2 percent from a year ago, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported from Brussels, slipping to 1.3 million vehicles from about 1.5 million. 
Over the first three months of the year, sales in the 27-nation bloc totaled slightly fewer than three million units, 9.8 percent below the level of a year ago, making the worst start to a year since the association began collecting the data in 1990, when only 15 nations' sales were considered.
Quynh-Nhu Huynh, statistical director for the association, said that it had predicted a 5 percent decline in 2013 sales from the 12 million units sold in 2012, but that the forecast might have to be revisited soon because of the poor start.
Economic stagnation continues to depress demand in the European Union long after auto sales in the United States have rebounded and while emerging markets have continued to register growth. Across Europe, more than 26 million men and women are unemployed, according to official data, and the overall economy is expected to contract in 2013 for a second straight year.
The car industry directly accounts for more than two million jobs in Europe, including some of the best-paid manufacturing jobs, and another 10 million ''indirect'' jobs, according to the association. But many of the Continent's ailing carmakers are trying to reorganize, cut their work forces and, in some cases, close plants, medicine that may make the economy sicker in the short term.
Peter Fuss, who follows the market at the Ernst & Young Global Automotive Center, predicted that 2013 European car sales would decline by as much as 7 percent from 2012. But carmakers will have to continue discounting prices even to hold the decline to that level, Mr. Fuss said, putting further pressure on profits.
The course of the German and British economies will help to determine the industry's fortunes, he said. ''We expect the French, Italian and Spanish markets to continue their decline over the rest of the year in the absence of any major government intervention to encourage vehicle buying or replacement,'' he said.
The data released on Wednesday showed that sales in Germany, the largest economy in the European Union, fell 17.1 percent. Economic sentiment among Germans declined sharply in the last month, according to a report on Tuesday from the ZEW research institute.
In France, hobbled by a weak economy and 10.8 percent unemployment, sales fell 16.2 percent.
The only expansion among major markets was a 4.9 percent increase in Britain, which is outside the euro zone.
Sales for Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker, slid 9 percent, with the biggest decline at its namesake brand. Sales at PSA Peugeot Citron, No. 2 in Europe, plunged 16 percent. Ford Motor's sales slid 15.8 percent, while General Motors' tumbled 12.6 percent.
The data confirmed that the high-end market, which had held up even as the mass market withered, has also begun to lose steam.
Sales at Daimler, which warned last week that its 2013 profit forecast was beginning to look shaky, fell 1.2 percent, while its rival, BMW, posted a 4.7 percent drop in sales.

HEADLINE: Europe Faces a Crisis in Energy Costs

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED

 BODY:
LONDON -- The signs are everywhere. Britain has been unable to reach a deal for its first new nuclear power station since the 1990s. Spain, once a clean-energy enthusiast, has slashed its backing for wind and solar power.
Even the European Union's flagship environmental achievement of recent years, its Emissions Trading System for carbon dioxide, is beset by existential doubts. On Tuesday, the European Parliament batted away an effort to bolster anemic carbon prices on the E.T.S. 
Prices for permits to emit greenhouse gases, which have fallen as low as &#x20ac;3 per metric ton, are just a fraction of what they were a few years ago, meaning that they are no longer doing their intended job of inducing utilities and manufacturers to invest in new technology and switch to cleaner fuels.
Evidently, members of the European Parliament were more concerned about any further raising of energy costs that some European companies already say are putting them at a competitive disadvantage.
Europe is lurching through an energy crisis that in many respects parallels its seemingly unending economic crisis. Across Europe, consumer groups, governments and manufacturers are asking how their future energy needs can be met affordably and responsibly.
It is a question that is far more acute than in the United States, where the shale gas revolution has done wonders to ease energy angst. ''Europeans are getting increasingly concerned about energy,'' said Corin Taylor, an analyst at the Institute of Directors, a British business group. ''Manufacturers are looking at U.S. energy prices with envy, and if they can, they are making investments in North America.''
European countries have yet to demonstrate that they can or in some cases even want to exploit their own potential shale gas troves. At the same time, most of Europe's indigenous sources of oil and natural gas are in decline, making increased dependence on imports almost inevitable.
In some ways, Europe is a victim of its own success. It has made remarkable progress in switching to a future beyond oil and natural gas. For instance, last year, a hefty 23 percent of European power demand was met by electricity generated by renewable sources like wind and solar, compared with just 13 percent in 2002. This shift was ''driven primarily by generous support policies for renewables,'' said Susanne Hounsell, an analyst at the energy research firm IHS CERA in Paris.
But achievements like that have also brought problems. Most green electricity sources cannot compete with coal and natural gas on their own and require subsidies that are passed on to industry and consumers. The more power they generate, the higher those costs. Direct charges for renewables add about 18 percent to German household electric bills, with indirect costs putting on more.
In Britain, climate charges add 19 percent to the electricity prices that large manufacturers pay, according to Jeremy Nicholson, director of the Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents heavy industry. That helps make industrial processes that are heavy users of electricity, like aluminum smelting or steel making, endangered species in Britain.
Europe's energy policies were conceived in a very different era, the early to mid-2000s and even before, when economic growth was robust and there seemed to be lots of leeway to add a few euros onto the cost of electricity, if that might help combat climate change.
In Europe today, to take only a couple of examples, steel production is down about 30 percent since before the financial crisis, and new car sales hit their lowest level last year since 1995. It is hard not to conclude that economic activity like manufacturing is decamping and moving to places like Asia and, increasingly, the United States.
European energy policy makers do not seem to have figured out that the world has changed. Britain, for instance, has just instituted a carbon tax on top of E.U.-wide carbon charges. The effort to raise the carbon price on the E.T.S. while Cyprus was melting down is another sign of tin-eared European policy making.
The vote against the changes to the E.T.S. could prove a wake-up call. Europe is probably going to achieve its objective of cutting greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 -- mainly because the recession has cut industrial production and even driving. Now comes the harder part: cutting emissions 90 percent or so by 2050. Baby steps like a mini carbon tax are not going to get Europe there, analysts say.
A real debate on energy may be in the cards for the first time in years. ''We are in the realpolitik of climate change now, where costs and competitiveness do matter,'' said Fabien Roques, another analyst at IHS CERA.
''Our whole energy policy needs to be rethought. We don't need to go for hell for leather in one go to meet targets,'' said Ann Robinson, head of consumer affairs at uSwitch, a British company that provides consumer advice.
Ms. Robinson argues that instead of rushing huge investments into largely unproven and enormously expensive technologies like offshore wind, a phased approach would be preferable and would leave time for scientific advances that might produce cheaper and more effective solutions. Britain, where the average annual household energy bill has doubled to about 1,335, or $2,040, since 2006, is approaching a ''tipping point'' where large numbers of people decide to ''switch off heat permanently,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Succession at Huawei Offers Glimpse Into Secretive Firm

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
PARIS -- Huawei, the Chinese maker of telecom network equipment, rose from obscurity to heavyweight on the vision and sweat of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, a highly secretive former engineer with the People's Liberation Army.
But with Mr. Ren, now 68, appearing to make plans to retire, the patriarch of one of China's biggest international enterprises is undergoing an unusual, American-style effort to decentralize Huawei's management, including a high-profile, public search for his successor.
On Wednesday at a hotel in central Paris, the next generation of Huawei, the world's No.2 maker of telecommunications network equipment, took the form of Ken Hu, the company's rotating and acting chief executive and one of three candidates testing for the job. 
Mr. Hu, 45, an engineer from central China, joined Huawei in 1990 as the 41st employee at a firm that now employs 150,000 serving more than 140 operators around the world.
''I really don't know,'' Mr. Hu said about the succession process during a meeting with a handful of journalists. ''It is quite a new system. We are in the pilot stage.''
Huawei, with sales of $35.4 billion last year, trails only Ericsson of Sweden, the global market leader, in selling network equipment to phone operators, a business with solid growth prospects propelled by the Internet economy's transition to mobile devices. Gear sold to telecom operators made up almost three-quarters of 2012 sales, but Huawei is also the world's third-largest maker of smartphones, according to IDC, with a 5 percent global market share at the end of last year, trailing Samsung and Apple.
Six percent of Huawei's revenue came from selling equipment to big companies. In the past decade, the company, based in Shenzhen, has leapfrogged its rivals Nokia Siemens Networks and Alcatel-Lucent in selling equipment to operators, but it remains shut out of the U.S. market, where a congressional committee last year warned operators not to buy the Chinese company's equipment because of security concerns, which Huawei disputes.
Convincing U.S. political leaders to open the market -- which could catapult Huawei over Ericsson -- will be a key challenge for Mr. Ren's successor. Mr. Hu, who speaks English well, played high school baseball in China and served as chairman of Huawei's U.S. board operations, declined to predict if Huawei would gain access to U.S. operators.
Geopolitical obstacles are beyond his control, he said.
''There are rumors about the security of Huawei's networks, but these are only rumors,'' Mr. Hu said. ''There is no evidence. The reality is we cannot harm the U.S. because the government is not a customer and the operators are not customers. We cannot build any infrastructure there. The U.S. is an important market, but it is as important as Europe for us.''
But in the absence of a political thaw, Huawei is focusing on Europe, one of its fastest-growing markets, where it employs 7,500 workers, mostly in Germany, Poland and England. By 2017, Huawei plans to increase its European work force to 13,000, Mr. Hu said, and is seeking Europeans to fill many of the positions.
European operators have not been as reluctant as U.S. operators to buy from Huawei, which supplies gear to Vodafone, Telefnica, Deutsche Telekom and Orange. Last week, Huawei signed a deal with Wind, one of Italy's three-biggest mobile carriers, which is owned by the Russian carrier group VimpelCom.
The Wind deal, Huawei's largest yet, is worth $1.3 billion in revenue over five years.
Whether Mr. Hu will get the chance to oversee Huawei's European expansion is unclear. In October he will hand over the rotating chief executive job to Eric Xu, who has run Huawei's strategy, marketing, products and solutions businesses. Mr. Hu succeeded Guo Ping, the third contender, who ran Huawei's devices business, among other senior posts.
Kevin Wang, an analyst at IHS in Shanghai, said the details of Huawei's succession process were, not surprisingly, shrouded in secrecy. Mr. Ren, the founder, has not said when he plans to retire, Mr. Wang said, and there is no guarantee he will choose one of the three candidates now vying to succeed him.
Another unknown is what Mr. Ren's two children, who also work for Huawei, might do. Mr. Ren's daughter, Cathy Meng, is Huawei's chief financial officer. A son, Ren Ping, works for a subsidiary that provides hotel and ticket reservations and trade show support.
Ms. Meng could emerge as a successor to her father, Mr. Wang said, but the son apparently has no interest in leading Huawei. But even to a Chinese analyst, the company can be opaque. ''It is very hard to see who will be the next person to lead Huawei,'' Mr. Wang said. ''There is just no visibility at this point.''
As recently as four years ago, Huawei was even more of an enigma, a fast-growing global company where the names of the top leaders were not known -- even to midlevel managers.
''We didn't even know who was making the decisions at the top of the company,'' said one former Huawei executive, a European who has since left for a rival. ''All we had were some names, but there was no real disclosure, no confirmation, of who was in charge.''
That began to change in 2010, when Huawei first revealed the identities of its board members. Regular financial reporting followed. In February at an industry conference in Barcelona, two top Huawei executives gave their first interviews to Western media outlets.
An American who has worked as an investor in China for more than 20 years said Mr. Ren, the company founder, was a demanding boss who wielded virtually unchecked power and had been known to upbraid even some of his own board members.
''He is a man who likes to keep his own counsel,'' said the investor, who did not want to be identified because he has business interests in China. Aside from Mr. Ren, the Chinese government is likely to play some kind of role -- advisory or more direct -- in choosing Mr. Ren's successor, the investor said, because the company was a flagship of China's global growth.
''While they are not a state enterprise, the Chinese state has a lot of influence in that company because company has a lot of influence on the state,'' he said. ''China has a great deal of pride riding on the success of Huawei.''

HEADLINE: Serbia and Kosovo Near Deal, Official Says

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

 BODY:
Serbia and Kosovo were edging toward a deal on Wednesday aimed at overcoming ethnic enmities in the former Serbian province, a senior Kosovo official said, in what would be a seminal moment in relations between former enemies that could help clear the way for each eventually to join the European Union.
Petrit Selimi, Kosovo's deputy foreign minister, said in a telephone interview from Pristina, Kosovo's capital, that the two countries had agreed in principle on a text under which Serbs in northern Kosovo would gain more powers in return for tacitly recognizing the authority of Kosovo's government. He said the aim was to sign the agreement in Brussels on Friday, but cautioned strongly that the talks could still fall apart. 
''There is no deal yet but the chances to get one are very high,'' he said. ''A deal would usher in a new period of stability in the entire Balkans and help both countries to put the past behind them.''
Serbian officials close to the talks declined to comment.
An agreement would mark a turning point in relations between Serbia and its former province. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on Feb. 17, 2008, almost a decade after NATO intervened against Slobodan Milosevic, then the Serbian strongman, to halt an ethnic civil war with Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians.
Serbia, which has long considered Kosovo its medieval heartland, has steadfastly refused to recognize Kosovo, arguing that the declaration of independence was a reckless breach of international law. Kosovo's independence has been recognized by the United States and a majority of the European Union's countries. But countries including Russia and Spain have refused to recognize it, fearing separatist movements in their own territories.
Any accord will fall short of Belgrade's recognizing Kosovo's independence. But analysts said an agreement would nevertheless herald a new reconciliation after the Balkan wars of the 1990s which broke up the former Yugoslavia.
At a time when the European Union is mired by crisis in the euro zone, it would also mark a vindication of the bloc's soft power, its ability to use the incentive of membership in the world's biggest trading bloc to press countries that want to join to make difficult compromises.
Trying one last push to talks that had collapsed earlier this month, the Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, invited Serbia and Kosovo back to the negotiating table on Wednesday, delaying a report on Serbia's readiness to start accession talks that had been scheduled for Tuesday.
At stake is how much autonomy Pristina is willing to cede to Kosovo's Serbian minority. Belgrade has retained de facto control over a small Serb majority area in northern Kosovo, where until now the Serbs have lived in isolated enclaves that do not recognize Pristina's authority and have been administered and financed by Belgrade.
Under a potential agreement, municipal structures in Serb-majority northern Kosovo would attain greater autonomy -- over everything from health care to education -- in return for Belgrade's recognition of Pristina's authority there. But the talks collapsed earlier this month as Pristina insisted it would not countenance any Serbian legislative body within Kosovo and Belgrade insisted that it wanted an association with real executive power, including control over the judiciary and the police.
It is a sign of progress by each side that the leaders of Kosovo and Serbia, both former arch nationalists, even sat at the same table. Kosovo's prime minister, Hashim Thaci, is reviled by many Serbs as a guerrilla commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which fought the war in the 1990s. His Serbian counterpart, Prime Minister Ivica Dacic, was the wartime spokesman of Mr. Milosevic, who was overthrown in 2000 and died in jail in 2006 while being tried for crimes against humanity.
An agreement would pave the way for Serbia to get a date to begin E.U. membership talks. It would help it to rejuvenate its struggling economy and cement its links to the West, an important psychological and geopolitical landmark.
It would also enhance regional harmony by further integrating the western Balkans into Europe. Slovenia, a former Yugoslav republic, joined the European Union in 2004. Croatia is set to join the bloc in July. A deeply divided Bosnia remains the regional laggard, though analysts predicted that a Kosovo deal could help focus minds there.
For Kosovo, a desperately poor, predominantly Muslim landlocked country of two million, warmer ties with Serbia would help buttress its standing and lift a beleaguered economy. Unemployment in Kosovo is about 40 percent; lawlessness and corruption are rife.
Kosovo's security is guaranteed by about 5,000 NATO troops, and the international community hopes that the potential calming of ethnic tensions engendered by any agreement would tip the scale decisively toward peace.
But vocal critics on both sides have expressed visceral anger and skepticism, underlining the challenges to enforcing any deal. The Kosovo opposition movement Vetevendosje -- self-determination in Albanian -- said it planned mass protests if any deal emerged.
Shpend Ahmeti, the vice president of Vetevendosje, insisted by phone from Pristina that a deal would reinforce rather than overcome ethnic divisions. Giving further autonomy to Kosovo's Serbs, he said, would effectively make Kosovo ''another Bosnia,'' where a decentralized institutional structure, and ethnic rifts, make it difficult to govern.

HEADLINE: As Cancer Rates Rise in China, Trust Remains Low

BYLINE: By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Living in China these days, we're bombarded with scary accounts of rising cancer rates that are partly linked to some of the world's worst pollution.
The slogan this year for National Cancer Prevention and Care Week, which began Tuesday, spells it out: ''Protect the Environment, Keep Cancer Away.''
That even the Chinese state is highlighting a link between the poor environment and cancer reflects an atmosphere of deep concern, verging on panic, over public health, as more and more people ask: Is China killing itself in the pursuit of spectacularly fast, very dirty, economic growth? 
Of course, there are other, important reasons for rising rates, like an aging population and changing diet and lifestyles, as the Shanghai cancer specialists Guo Xiaomao and Long Jiang recently wrote in The Xinmin Evening News.
And China's cancer rate is still below that of the United States. About 3.5 million people are diagnosed with cancer yearly, the Zhejiang Science and Technology News Net reported Tuesday, citing a 2012 report by the National Cancer Registry. (Other news accounts put the figure at 3.12 million. Statistics in China often vary.) In the United States, with a population less than a quarter of China's 1.35 billion, more than 1.6 million people are expected to receive a diagnosis of cancer in 2013, according to the American Cancer Society.
But cancer rates in the United States are falling, whereas in China they are rising, doctors and officials say. And China's death rate from cancer is far higher -- about 2.5 million people yearly, compared with the 580,350 expected to die in the United States this year. Complicating things further, some doctors are wondering: Is China facing a double health whammy as rising disease rates challenge a troubled medical system?
At the top of the list of reasons China may be facing a cancer crisis is the crucial issue of mistrust between patient and doctor. A new article in the Journal of Oncology Practice, published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, illustrates this problem.
The lack of trust, reflected in regular accounts in the Chinese news media of patients and their families venting anger or even physically attacking physicians, is rooted in a perception that doctors are out for personal gain and may be incompetent or corrupt.
But according to the article -- written by two oncologists, Dr. David H. Garfield of the United States and Dr. Harold Brenner of Israel, and a Chinese oncology nurse, Lucy Lu (who in 2011 were in a group that set up the first of several planned outpatient cancer centers in China, the article said) -- doctors are afraid of being blamed by hospital administrators for ''bad outcomes,'' or deaths, and may act in ways that may protect themselves but may not be in the patient's best interests.
In ''Practicing Western Oncology in Shanghai, China: One Group's Experience,'' Ms. Lu wrote: ''We are attempting to serve a huge population with limited resources, and the system to protect Chinese physicians remains a big issue. If there are bad results, the physicians are guilty unless they can prove themselves to be right.''
Curiously, for a one-party state obsessed with control, in medical treatment ''There is no culture of 'the captain of the ship,''' they wrote. ''Thus, we cannot control what other treatments patients are simultaneously receiving.''
Ms. Lu says in the article: ''Our Western physicians take difficult cases as challenges, whereas Chinese physicians first assess risk to themselves and hesitate in helping patients.''
All too often, the human touch is lacking. ''Hospitals are reluctant to have patients die on their premises. Lack of hospices for dying patients'' is a problem, the authors wrote.
The article is spreading fast among Chinese oncologists, some of whom are dedicated practitioners. They say its criticisms are broadly accurate. Their recognition of the problem is attended by mixed feelings of regret, ''for the patients, for the physicians, for the government,'' as one doctor said. (The doctors asked not to be identified because they work in the military medical system, which forbids interviews with the news media.)
The article's conclusion is being especially hotly discussed -- and acknowledged -- by Chinese doctors. Ms. Lu's summary says: ''The speed of advancement of the whole country is so fast that we may have missed something that is important, and we need to think about it. We need to learn more from the West than just importing these fabulous machines.''
The Western doctors called their time in Shanghai ''a challenging experience,'' explaining that ''Respect for and knowledge of Chinese culture and an attempt, as difficult at that may be, not to be judgmental are required.''
There's that. Then there's this: As news accounts, often backed by official reports, multiply of cancer villages, of rivers and wells running milky -- or orange, or red, or black -- with pollution, of rising cancer rates among young people as well as old, the Chinese doctors' reactions are the most telling: They care deeply about their patients and they love their country, they say. Yet they know there are serious questions as to whether the system allows best practice. And they don't see easy solutions.

HEADLINE: Restoring Iraq's Garden of Eden

BYLINE: By ERICA GIES

 BODY:
LONDON -- Azzam Alwash says he remembers the reeds towering above his head, lining cool corridors in the Iraqi heat as he sat with his father, the district irrigation engineer, in a small boat plying the waters of the ancient wetlands between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers.
That was the early 1960s, and the marshlands covered as much as 20,000 square kilometers, or 7,700 square miles. ''I have very warm memories of those times,'' Mr. Alwash, a 54-year-old, Iraqi-born, U.S.-educated civil engineer, said in an interview here last month.
Biblical scholars say this massive oasis in the desert may have been the Garden of Eden. For more than five millennia, tribal groups of Marsh Arabs lived sustainably in this water world, using the dominant plant, a giant grass called Phragmites australis, for housing, animal feed, fuel, and commerce. Under their ministrations, the marshes teemed with life, serving as one of the world's most important stopovers for migratory birds and as breeding habitat for Persian Gulf fisheries.
But in Mr. Alwash's lifetime, those waters nearly ceased to be. 
Now, however, they are experiencing rebirth, thanks in part to Mr. Alwash, who this week received the Goldman Environmental Prize, which honors grass-roots environmental activists.
In the 1970s upstream dam projects began to reduce water levels; and in the early 1990s Saddam Hussein ordered the construction of massive diversion canals and dams that drained more than 90 percent of the original marshlands. His motive was to retaliate against the Marsh Arabs for a Shiite uprising and to destroy rebel hideouts. After siphoning away the water, Hussein ordered the land poisoned and burned, leaving the wetlands a cracked, dusty salt pan.
According to a 2011 U.N. paper on managing change in the marshlands, some 175,000 people were forced to flee. From the United States, Mr. Alwash watched, aghast.
Mr. Alwash had left Iraq in 1978 and landed in the United States, where he ultimately earned a doctorate, got married, and had two daughters.
In response to the attack on the marshlands, Mr. Alwash and his wife Suzanne Alwash, an environmental geologist, founded the Eden Again Project in 2001, the seed for a nongovernment organization, Nature Iraq, which works to protect Iraq's environment. Mrs. Alwash has written a book about the restoration effort, ''Eden Again: Hope in the Marshes of Iraq,'' due out in July.
Seeing opportunity in the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, Mr. Alwash left his family for the war zone, to see what he could do about restoring the wetlands. When he arrived, he found that some Marsh Arabs had already begun to break holes in the levies to reflood the land. He set to work to support them, leading a team of scientists to develop a master plan to restore the marshes.
Mr. Alwash has since worked through Nature Iraq teaching Iraqis and Iraqi institutions -- governments, universities, nonprofit organizations -- about environmental awareness and stewardship. That has included meetings with government officials to convince them of the environmental, social and economic benefits of restoring the marshes and the promotion of community-based environment clubs. To support this work, Nature Iraq has hired its own scientists and worked with researchers at Basra University to build a database of Iraq's environmental conditions and trends, focusing particularly on water resources, ecology and biodiversity.
Today the wetlands are in recovery. The Goldman Prize says that about half the historical area is now reflooded. Water levels fluctuate due to seasonal changes, drought and upstream water diversions but fish, birds, animals and people are returning.
A subspecies of otter, Lutrogale perspicillata maxwelli, thought to be extinct, was recently sighted in the marshes. ''The warbler is back in good health,'' Mr. Alwash said. ''We've seen the Euphrates soft-shelled turtle in abundance.''
Mr. Alwash hopes to see the marshes become the country's first national park this spring.
But is it enough to just let in the water? Is the ecosystem healthy? A 2010 study by Iraqi and Canadian scientists found that most plant species had reappeared -- but not all. Plant quantities and diversity were low, it said.
Still, Joy Zedler, a University of Wisconsin wetlands restoration biologist, is optimistic. ''If I had to restore a wetlands with a gun pointed to my head, I'd pick the Mesopotamian wetlands,'' she said in a phone interview last month. That's because the dominant tall reed there, Phragmites australis, is an aggressive invader in restoration efforts elsewhere. ''That's the kind of native plant you want in a restoration site,'' said Ms. Zedler, who was a co-author of the Mesopotamian marsh restoration plan.
The ecosystem is resilient, having been modified by human hands for millennia, she added.
A key concept in restoration is adaptive management, in which scientists conduct research as wetlands are rewatered and change course if needed. But adaptive management was not possible with the rapid reflooding in Iraq.
''People really needed the food,'' Ms. Zedler said. ''They were not going to wait to test the fish for contaminants if their kids were starving.''
In fact, water quality is an ongoing problem. According to the 2011 U.N. report on the region, marshland water is generally not safe for human consumption and is potentially unsafe for agriculture and other economic uses. A Nature Iraq scientist found declines in fish species that require clean water.
While traces of chemical weapons used to destroy the marshes are a concern, a quotidian issue is a bigger problem. ''The Tigris and Euphrates are open sewers,'' said Mr. Alwash.
The bigger barrier to successful restoration, however, is water quantity. The headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers are in Turkey, Syria and Iran. Upstream dams, particularly in Turkey, have reduced flows.
In 1977-78, the lowest flow in the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers was 990 cubic meters, or 35,000 cubic feet, per second, according to Ms. Stevens. By 1993-94, that figure was 550 cubic meters per second. In 2008-09, the latest data available, it was less than 100 cubic meters per second. Yet dam building continues.
Turkey's Southeast Anatolia Project includes more than 30 major upstream dams, the majority of which are completed, said Mr. Alwash.
''My next challenge is to try to help Iraq, Turkey and maybe even Syria and Iran to reach agreement on the equitable distribution of the water,'' said Mr. Alwash, who is building partnerships among regional nonprofit organizations and universities to study the issue and propose solutions. He is also planning a floating demonstration down the Tigris River to publicize the problem.
With reduced water flows comes a companion problem: too much salt. Regional farmers still use the ancient practice of flood irrigation, Mr. Alwash said, which brings salt to the surface. Historically, annual floods washed away the salt and deposited new silt and nutrients. For thousands of years, ''farmers didn't need fertilizer,'' he said.
''But the last major flood in Iraq was in 1968,'' he said, citing the dams as a cause. ''If the Iraqi government doesn't address this problem, agriculture will die in the land where it was born.''
One answer is drip irrigation. Using less water would reduce saline runoff to the Tigris and Euphrates, he said. He has proposed that Iraq capture and sell gas currently flared during oil production to raise money for drip irrigation systems. It could then either sell the systems at a subsidized rate to both Iraqi and upstream farmers, or give them away as part of a watershed management agreement.
The Goldman Prize administrators recognize that the Mesopotamian marshes are not fully restored. The deputy director of the prize organization, Lorrae Rominger, said, ''What Azzam has done to date is remarkable, and we hope that winning the prize will help support the work he has in front of him.''
As for Mr. Alwash, he said he dreams of the day when the marshes become a national park and ecotourism destination. Then he will at last be able to share the landscape of his boyhood with his daughters.
Missing his daughters' birthdays, spelling-bee wins, and first dates was very hard, he said. ''But I cannot give up Iraq. I found my calling.''
A couple of months ago, his daughter sent him a speech she'd given to her class. ''In the middle of that letter, I started sobbing,'' he said, his voice breaking. ''She understands. I'm forgiven.''

HEADLINE: Lebanon Pins Economic Hopes on Oil and Gas

BYLINE: By JOSH WOOD

 BODY:
BEIRUT -- As Lebanon prepares to move toward exploring and developing its potential offshore oil and gas resources, the prospect is being dangled that hydrocarbon revenues could fix many of its problems.
In Lebanon's exclusive economic zone, the offshore area in which it retains rights over any resources, there is a high probability that a significant amount of gas and perhaps some oil could be found, according to Spectrum, a company that carried out a three-dimensional seismic survey of a 3,000-square-kilometer, or 1,160-square-mile, zone off the country's coast.
''In terms of the 3-D area that we surveyed, we believe there could be as much as 25 trillion cubic feet of gas,'' said David Rowlands, Spectrum's chief executive, referring to 710 billion cubic meters.
But he noted that ''you never get to prove anything until you actually start drilling'' and that drilling was not going to begin until 2015 or 2016, at the earliest. 
A 2010 U.S. Geological Survey report estimated the presence of 1.7 billion barrels of oil and 122 trillion cubic feet of gas in the 83,000-square-kilometer area off the coasts of Lebanon, Israel, Syria and Cyprus, which is known as the Levant Basin.
So far, Lebanon has lagged behind its neighbors in the search for hydrocarbons beneath the Eastern Mediterranean's seabed.
The Tamar gas field, discovered off the coast of Israel in 2009, came online at the end of last month, while the country's larger Leviathan gas field is scheduled to begin production in the coming years.
Cyprus, hobbled by recent financial troubles, has signed deals with a number of international oil companies to drill for gas within its own economic zone.
After delays caused by political disagreements, Lebanon formed its Petroleum Administration late last year, enabling it to start negotiating. Major energy companies, including the U.S. giants ExxonMobil and Chevron and Total of France, are among 52 to enter prequalification talks. The companies that qualify are expected to be announced Thursday, and the bid process is scheduled to begin next month.
Yet even without further delays, drilling and eventual production are still years away.
From an economic perspective, things can seem bleak in Lebanon. Shaky infrastructure irritates residents and dissuades foreign investment. Lebanon also has one of the highest ratios in the world of debt to gross domestic product; it is estimated to be about 128 percent for 2012, according tothe C.I.A.'s World Factbook. Furthermore, growth has been stalled by the civil war in neighboring Syria and by Lebanon's own bouts of instability.
Within that backdrop, potential oil and gas revenues are being touted by some as a possible magic bullet.
Across the country, billboards sponsored by the Ministry of Energy and Water have appeared along highways in recent weeks, promising a better future.
''Our country now has oil -- for the development of the transportation network'' reads one billboard, depicting a high-speed train marked with a cedar tree, Lebanon's national symbol. Lebanon has not had an operational rail network since the outbreak of the country's civil war in 1975.
Other signs suggest that energy revenues could bolster the country's army and health care system. The message is that hydrocarbons can bring modernization.
But without any actual discoveries yet, and without knowledge of how difficult extraction will be or whether Lebanon can export hydrocarbons, analysts say it is too early to count heavily on oil and gas.
''It's way too premature to start spending the money and start daydreaming about Lebanon becoming a hydrocarbon exporter, having fiscal surpluses like Kuwait and writing off our debt as some politicians have suggested,'' said Nassib Ghobril, the head of economic research at Byblos Bank, which is based in Beirut.
''They're just raising the expectations of people unnecessarily without any concrete evidence at this stage,'' he added.
Producing natural gas could potentially fix some problems, like Lebanon's chronic electricity shortage. Lebanon's power plants are so stretched that even Beirut's more upscale neighborhoods see government-supplied electricity cut for three hours a day. Outside the capital, power is even more sporadic.
Lebanon's power plants currently run on imported fuel. The state electricity company operates at a loss and blames its failings on empty coffers.
''The electricity deficit is costing the Treasury at least $2 billion every year, and in 2012 it was much more, almost $3 billion,'' Mr. Ghobril said. ''We shouldn't be complacent about this.''
A domestic supply of natural gas could alleviate Lebanon's electricity woes, although the country would first have to convert its power plants to use liquid natural gas and build an infrastructure to handle gas products, an expensive process.
But there are potential obstacles to exploring and developing the resources.
For one, Lebanon is in a period of transition after Najib Mikati stepped down as prime minister last month. Consultations are under way to form a new government, but the process has been slow as Lebanon's divided politicians have continued to bicker.
A map delineating 10 offshore blocks to be bid on was submitted to Mr. Mikati's cabinet for approval before he resigned. Now, approval of the blocks will have to wait for a new cabinet.
''There needs to be some assurances on the political level that there is going to be stability regardless of the change in governments,'' Malek Takieddine, a Beirut lawyer who specializes in oil and gas, said.
There is also a fear that Lebanon's raucous politics could find its way into the development program.
''I hope that the oil and gas sector will not be politicized, but I fear that this is likely going to be the case in Lebanon,'' said Carole Nakhle, an energy economist based in London. ''After all, most of our political figures have business interests in the country.''
The formation of the Petroleum Administration highlighted some of the inherent realities of Lebanese politics. Placating sectarian interests, the six seats of the Petroleum Administration were parceled out to Lebanon's six largest religious groups, a reflection of the power sharing agreements underpinning the country's governance.
Lebanon, meanwhile, has an undemarcated maritime border with Israel, a country it is technically at war with, and there is a sliver of sea that both countries claim as their own. If Lebanon offers to take bids on blocks that fall within the disputed zone, ''it could seem aggressive to Israel and international parties,'' Mr. Takieddine said. ''So it's a delicate decision that they need to make.''
Instability from the war in neighboring Syria, which has led to repeated bouts of violence in Lebanon and deepened the political divide here, could also affect the development of oil and gas resources. Analysts noted that many oil companies were used to working in unstable environments. Still, ''some of the oil companies are more conservative than others because of the security situation in the region,'' said Mr. Rowlands, the Spectrum chief executive, ''and I'm sure some oil companies aren't going to play the bid round.''
The uncertain security and political situation could mean better terms for oil companies wishing to explore and develop offshore hydrocarbons, though.
It is possible that ''the Lebanese government is going to have a lot of difficulty getting good terms for Lebanon because of these unknown factors,'' Mr. Takieddine said.''

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Warns of Risk as Company Debt Grows

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Easy monetary policy in the United States has led to looser standards for corporate borrowing as company debt continues to grow, posing a risk to financial stability, the International Monetary Fund warned on Wednesday. 
Over all, finances around the world have improved in the last six months, and there were few clear signs of asset bubbles, the monetary fund said in its annual Global Financial Stability Report. But it also said that governments must remain vigilant and ensure they are continuing structural and banking improvements, or risk sinking into a chronic financial crisis.
In addition to companies, pension funds and insurance companies may also be taking on more risk than they should as they search for higher-yielding assets to fill a funding gap, which for pension funds stayed at 28 percent at the end of last year.
All of this is happening while the United States is still only one-third of the way through the current credit cycle, the Washington-based global lender said. Usually, looser borrowing standards emerge only in the later parts of the cycle, as happened in 2007, the I.M.F. said.
''In the United States, corporate debt underwriting standards are weakening rapidly,'' Jos Vials, the director of the I.M.F.'s monetary and capital markets department, said in a briefing on the report.
''This is a cause for concern that needs to be monitored.''
The appetite for riskier assets is also spilling over into emerging economies as investors search for higher yields, making these countries more vulnerable to volatile capital flows.
The I.M.F.'s analysis could add to questions about the side effects of aggressive monetary easing, which are likely to dominate meetings of finance ministers and central bankers from the world's top economies in Washington this week.
The Bank of Japan earlier this month pledged to inject $1.4 trillion into its economy to shock it out of stagnation, fanning concerns about currency wars, rising asset prices and speculative buying.
The United States Federal Reserve's expansive policies have also prompted worries about asset bubbles, though its easing program is in part meant to push investors to take on more risk to spur economic growth.
While the I.M.F. says it believes it is appropriate for advanced nations to keep up monetary stimulus for now -- while inflation remains low and unemployment high -- it is also urging policy makers to start thinking about the consequences of ending ultra-loose policies.
''I think when the patient is still under treatment, you should not suspend the medicine,'' Mr. Vials said about monetary policies. ''But you should always be vigilant for the side effects of the medicine.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Infant Mortality Rate Fell Steadily From '05 to '11

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The nation's infant mortality rate fell by 12 percent from 2005 through 2011, a promising pattern that researchers say may be due in part to a decline in premature births.
The decline came after a period of stalled progress. Although the infant mortality rate dropped significantly over the 20th century, it remained static from 2000 to 2005, according to a report released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
By 2011, however, the rate had dropped to 6.05 deaths of babies less than 1 year old per 1,000 births, down from 6.87 in 2000. Some of the most striking improvements were in Southern states, which still have higher infant mortality rates than most of the country. 
The rate of infant deaths declined the most among black mothers -- a drop of 16 percent from 2005 to 2011. Historically, infant mortality rates among black women have been more than twice those among white women.
''We are seeing a slight narrowing in the gap, and that's very encouraging,'' said Marian F. MacDorman, a senior statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics and an author of the report. ''But the gap is still really big.''
The states with the steepest declines in infant deaths -- Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina and South Carolina -- have long been plagued with some of the nation's highest infant mortality rates, Dr. MacDorman added. In all four states the rate dropped by more than 20 percent from 2005 to 2010, the latest year for which state data are available. The District of Columbia, which has expanded a home-visit program for poor pregnant women and stepped up other efforts to keep mothers and their babies healthy, saw the biggest drop: from 14.05 deaths per 1,000 births in 2005 to 7.86 in 2010.
The states with the highest infant mortality rates are Mississippi and Alabama, according to the report. But even Mississippi saw its rate drop by 15 percent from 2005 to 2010.
Dr. MacDorman said the nation's rate of premature births -- babies born before 37 weeks of gestation -- peaked at 12.8 percent in 2006 and had dropped every year since then. That is a likely factor in the decline of the infant mortality rate, she said. In 2009, the latest year for which C.D.C. data is available, two-thirds of all infant deaths in the United States were among preterm babies.
Another possible factor is a recent emphasis on preventing planned early deliveries. A growing number of hospitals are not allowing mothers to schedule births before 39 weeks without a medical reason. In 2011, the March of Dimes started a public education campaign, Healthy Babies are Worth the Wait, to reduce medically unnecessary deliveries before 39 weeks of gestation. The Department of Health and Human Services began a similar effort, Strong Start, last year.
''It's been going on for a few years now and I think it has had an impact,'' Dr. MacDorman said of concerted efforts to discourage early deliveries. ''It's maybe leading to just a little change in the culture.''
Infant mortality dropped in four of the five leading causes of death from 2005 to 2011: congenital malformations, short gestation/low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome and maternal complications. The death rate from unintentional injuries rose slightly.
The decline in deaths attributed to sudden infant death syndrome was particularly striking -- the rate went down by 20 percent -- but that could have resulted from changes in the way SIDS is diagnosed and reported, Dr. MacDorman said.
While improving, the nation's infant mortality rate is still high compared with the rates in a number of other developed countries. In 2008, the United States ranked 27th in infant mortality among the 30 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
Janice A. Freedman, executive director of the North Carolina Healthy Start Foundation, a nonprofit group focused on reducing infant death and illness, said that it was difficult to pinpoint reasons for the 20 percent drop in her state's infant mortality rate from 2005 to 2010, but that better education about preventing SIDS was probably one factor.
At the same time, Ms. Freedman said she was concerned that state budget constraints would hamper continuing efforts to curb infant deaths.
''We are cutting budgets and so we are concerned that babies don't get lost in the politics,'' she said. ''Numbers can bump up and down, and there are still racial disparities. So there's still a lot of work to be done.''
Dr. Kevin Ryan, chief of the women's and children's health section of the North Carolina Division of Public Health, said a particularly important goal was to improve the health of women before they become pregnant, focusing on diet, exercise and prevention of chronic diseases like diabetes.
''In years past, the key was access to early, high-quality prenatal care,'' Dr. Ryan said. ''We're looking more and more at addressing the whole life cycle of girls and young women, not just focusing on the period of pregnancy. That's going to be critical to our success in continuing to improve birth outcomes.''

HEADLINE: Couple Held in the Killings Of Two Texas Prosecutors

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ and SERGE F. KOVALESKI; Manny Fernandez reported from Kaufman, Tex., and Serge F. Kovaleski from Boston.

 BODY:
KAUFMAN, Tex. -- The mystery of who shot and killed two prosecutors this year clouded life in this rural county southeast of Dallas for more than two months, with investigators delving into possible leads that led to white-supremacist groups and Mexican drug cartels.
But in the end, it apparently came down to a bitter local grudge. A former justice of the peace whose legal and political career collapsed in a hard-fought legal battle was accused Wednesday of killing the two prosecutors, who had been his courtroom rivals. And his wife not only named him as the gunman, but also confessed to having been the driver in both shootings as part of her role in the vendetta, the authorities said.
The shootings had alarmed elected officials and government employees across Texas, but on Wednesday afternoon, the couple -- Eric Lyle Williams and his wife, Kim Lene Williams, both 46 -- were behind bars at the Kaufman County jail.
''I find it hard to believe that someone could have written a novel with all these twists and turns in a small rural county in Texas,'' said Bruce Wood, the county's top elected official. ''People are relieved but still stunned.'' 
The two prosecutors that the authorities say the couple conspired to kill had helped convict Mr. Williams last year on burglary and theft charges in a dispute about three computer monitors worth less than $1,500. The Williamses -- he a portly, diabetic lawyer who volunteered with the Texas State Guard; she his ailing yet supportive wife of 15 years -- were accused of pulling off what even ruthless criminal organizations have rarely dared in modern times: the executions of two prosecutors, and the wife of one, to avenge a guilty verdict.
Mr. Williams was already being held at the Kaufman County jail on $3 million bond, accused of sending an anonymous e-mail threatening another attack, when law enforcement officials announced Wednesday that they had arrested his wife. She was charged with capital murder in connection with the slayings of the district attorney, Mike McLelland, 63; his wife, Cynthia McLelland, 65; and another prosecutor in Mr. McLelland's office, Mark E. Hasse, 57.
Ms. Williams joined her husband at the jail about 3 a.m. on Wednesday and was in custody on a $10 million bond.
According to an affidavit filed by the authorities, Ms. Williams confessed to her involvement in the shootings in an interview with investigators on Tuesday, and told them that her husband had been the one who shot Mr. Hasse in January and Mr. McLelland and his wife in March.
During her interview, she supplied investigators with details of both shootings that had not been made public. One law enforcement official confirmed that Ms. Williams was not a gunman in the murders, but had been the driver, and had also used the storage unit where Mr. Williams had kept a car and more than 20 guns.
The authorities had not yet formally charged Mr. Williams with the three murders, though officials said they were preparing to and had called a news conference for Thursday afternoon. Before his arrest on Saturday over the e-mail, both Mr. Williams and one of his lawyers had repeatedly denied he had any involvement in the shootings.
Mr. Williams had been a sought-after lawyer, a member of the chamber of commerce and a newly elected justice of the peace when he was accused of stealing the computer monitors from a county building in May 2011. Mr. McLelland and Mr. Hasse handled the case, and helped persuade a jury to find Mr. Williams guilty in March 2012.
He was removed from office and his law license was suspended. His state-issued peace officer license -- Mr. Williams had nearly two decades of law enforcement training -- was revoked.
He and his lawyers were convinced that evidence used to convict him had been tampered with and that Mr. McLelland had prosecuted him to settle a political grudge, according to court documents. Without a county salary or the ability to practice law in the state, he was unemployed and under financial stress, the documents state, so much so that the couple had tried to sell some of their old wedding gifts, including china and silverware, at a garage sale a few months ago.
Both Mr. Hasse and Mr. McLelland started to regularly carry handguns after Mr. Williams's trial in March 2012, because they believed Mr. Williams was a threat to their personal safety, the affidavit filed by the authorities stated. Mr. McLelland had told associates and those close to him before his death that he thought investigators should focus on whether Mr. Williams had killed Mr. Hasse or had someone do it, and he made no secret of his suspicions.
As a result, Mr. Williams's emergence as a suspect shocked few here. But the news of the murder charge against his wife did.
''The part about Eric's wife being involved was a shocker,'' said Bruce Bryant, the chief investigator in the district attorney's office and a close friend of the McLellands'. ''But it does feel like closure. I think I'll probably sleep better tonight than I have in a long time.''
The Williams lived in a beige brick house in Kaufman down the street from Ms. Williams's elderly parents. Though many in Kaufman had found Mr. Williams to be eccentric or even disturbing -- a witness testified in his theft case that Mr. Williams once became so angry with another lawyer that he threatened to kill him and burn down his house -- his wife was known as a shy, reserved woman who had stood by her husband and had even testified on his behalf in his theft case. A neighbor said she had rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue and other ailments.
Shortly before he was sentenced last year in the theft case, Mr. Williams spoke of the turmoil the charges had caused his wife and her parents in a pre-sentencing report prepared by the state prison agency.
''My life has taken a drastic turn,'' he said in the April 2012 report. ''My wife of 14 years is ill and on disability. My father- and mother-in-law are elderly and in need of medical attention; they moved to Texas so I could be a resource to them. If I do jail time they and my wife will be the ones being punished.''
For weeks, investigators had failed to turn up any evidence to tie Mr. Williams to the murders, and they explored a host of theories that led them nowhere, including the possible involvement of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas prison gang. But a turning point came late Saturday afternoon, when the authorities arrived at a self-storage business a short drive from Kaufman.
There, investigators say, they found a large storage unit where Mr. Williams had kept the car and the guns. He had tried to conceal the existence of the shed, the car and the guns from investigators, law enforcement officials said.
The car, which he had bought under a different name, was a white Ford Crown Victoria that resembled an unmarked police car and was similar to the description of the car that witnesses said they saw fleeing the scene after the shooting of Mr. Hasse in January. The firearms discovered included handguns and assault rifles. The weapon used to kill the prosecutor in January was believed to be a revolver, while the gun used in the shootings of the district attorney and his wife was an assault rifle.
The shed itself had been rented by an associate of Mr. Williams's, at Mr. Williams's request, law enforcement officials said. That person was not Ms. Williams, they said, but another person close to him. It was unclear Wednesday whether that person would face any charges.

HEADLINE: No Deal Yet in Serbia and Kosovo Talks to Reduce Strife

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Talks aimed at overcoming ethnic enmities between Serbia and its former province, Kosovo, ended Wednesday without an agreement, senior Kosovo officials said, as the two countries struggled to negotiate a deal that would enhance regional stability and help clear the way for their eventual membership in the European Union.
After nearly 14 hours of talks in Brussels, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, described the differences between the two sides as ''narrow and very shallow.'' She said a window remained for them to come to an agreement before she presents a crucial report at a union ministerial meeting on Monday, which is expected to determine whether Serbia will get a start date for talks to join the bloc. 
Having admitted the divided island of Cyprus in 2004, the European Union has been unwilling to import another frozen conflict, and it had made clear to Kosovo and Serbia that normalizing relations is the only way to smooth a path to their eventual membership.
An agreement would be a turning point in relations between Serbia and Kosovo, which declared independence on Feb. 17, 2008, almost a decade after NATO intervened against the Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to halt a brutal civil war with Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians.
Serbia, which has long considered Kosovo its medieval heartland, has steadfastly refused to recognize Kosovo, arguing that the declaration of independence was a reckless breach of international law. Kosovo's independence has been recognized by the United States and a majority of European Union countries. But countries including Russia and Spain have refused recognition, fearing separatist movements in their own territories.
Any deal will fall short of Serbian recognition of Kosovo's independence. But analysts said an agreement would nevertheless herald a new reconciliation after the Balkan wars of the 1990s, which broke up Yugoslavia.
In addition to undermining Serbia's and Kosovo's chances of joining the European Union, failure to reach a deal would be a blow to both countries' struggling economies and weaken regional stability.
Officials close to the talks said the two countries had agreed on the broad principle that Serbs in the small Serbian-majority area in northern Kosovo would gain more powers in return for tacitly recognizing the authority of Kosovo's government. But in a sign of the tough challenges ahead, the prime minister of each country blamed the other's intransigence for undermining a deal.
Kosovo's prime minister, Hashim Thaci, told reporters that as in previous rounds of talks, Serbia had refused a deal. But Prime Minister Ivica Dacic of Serbia insisted that Kosovo had torpedoed the agreement by demanding too many conditions, including insisting on its membership in the United Nations, according to an independent Serbian broadcaster, B92.
At a time when the European Union is mired in a euro crisis, an accord would also be a vindication of the soft power of the world's biggest trading bloc, its ability to press countries that want to join to make difficult compromises.
Trying one last push after talks collapsed earlier this month, Ms. Ashton, invited Serbia and Kosovo back to the negotiating table on Wednesday, delaying her report, scheduled for Tuesday, on Serbia's readiness to start membership talks.
At stake is how much autonomy Kosovo is willing to cede to its Serbian minority. Serbia has retained de facto control over the area in northern Kosovo where Serbs have lived in isolated enclaves that do not recognize the authority of the Kosovo government.
Under a potential agreement, municipal structures in that area would attain greater autonomy over services like health care and education in return for Belgrade's recognition of Pristina's authority there. But Kosovo's deputy foreign minister, Petrit Selimi, said the talks had faltered Wednesday over Belgrade's demand for too much autonomy over judges and police in northern Kosovo, which he said Pristina regarded as a breach of its sovereignty.
It was a sign of progress that the leaders of Kosovo and Serbia, both former archnationalists, sat at the same table. Mr. Thaci is reviled by many Serbs as a guerrilla commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which fought the war in the 1990s.
His Serbian counterpart, Mr. Dacic, was the wartime spokesman of Mr. Milosevic's, who was overthrown in 2000 and died in jail in 2006 while being tried for crimes against humanity.
Kosovo's security is guaranteed by roughly 5,000 NATO troops, and the international community hopes that the potential calming of ethnic tensions engendered by any agreement would tip the scale decisively toward peace.
An agreement would pave the way for Serbia to get a date to begin European Union membership talks. It would help Serbia rejuvenate its economy and cement its links to the West, an important psychological and geopolitical landmark.
It would also enhance regional harmony. Slovenia, a former Yugoslav republic, joined the union in 2004. Croatia is set to join in July. A deeply divided Bosnia remains the regional laggard, though analysts predicted that a potential Kosovo deal would help focus minds there.
For Kosovo, a desperately poor, predominantly Muslim landlocked country of two million, warmer ties with Serbia would help buttress its standing and lift a beleaguered economy. Unemployment in Kosovo is about 40 percent, and lawlessness and corruption are rife.
But vocal critics on both sides have expressed visceral anger and skepticism, underlining the challenges to enforcing any deal. The Kosovo opposition movement Vetevendosje -- which means self-determination in Albanian -- said it planned mass protests if any deal emerged.
Shpend Ahmeti, the vice president of Vetevendosje, insisted by phone from Pristina that a deal would reinforce rather than overcome ethnic divisions. Giving further autonomy to Kosovo's Serbs, he said, would effectively make Kosovo ''another Bosnia,'' where a decentralized institutional structure and ethnic rifts make it hard to govern.

HEADLINE: Rising Bank Profits Tempt a Push for Tougher Rules

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
Banks have been reporting steady growth in earnings since soon after the financial crisis. With the latest reports rolling in, analysts think the banks' first-quarter profits will be their best ever.
But as welcome as such profits are to the banks, they may also become a source of discomfort. The ballooning bottom lines could embolden the lawmakers and regulators who want to introduce additional measures to overhaul the banking system.
After the financial crisis, many officials involved in the regulatory revamp feared that tougher rules, like caps on bank assets, could destabilize the financial system and harm economic growth. It is a view that prominent bankers and lobbyists have also voiced.
Despite industry opposition to new rules, the buoyant bank profits could add to the ammunition that influential figures in Washington are using to advocate for more radical ideas to overhaul the banks. 
''I hope the regulators move forward with tougher regulations,'' said Sheila C. Bair, a former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a primary bank regulator, and now a senior adviser at the Pew Charitable Trusts. ''This wouldn't endanger the economic recovery.''
Much has been done to strengthen banks since the financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank legislation, which Congress passed in 2010, and international banking standards known as the Basel III rules are forcing banks to hold safer assets, curtail trading activities and set aside more capital to absorb potential losses.
Even so, there is bipartisan support to do more. Most recently, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, said that they planned to introduce a bill that would require banks to hold considerably more capital. If passed, such a requirement is likely to prompt the largest banks to shrink in size. While a draft of the legislation does not stipulate a maximum size for banks, it requires financial firms with more than $400 billion of assets to hold additional capital. Big banks like Citigroup and Bank of America well exceed that amount, as do Wall Street firms like Morgan Stanley, but regional lenders would fall under that threshold.
The restlessness over the big banks extends beyond Congress.
Daniel K. Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor who oversees regulation, floated an idea last year for limiting bank size. And Thomas M. Hoenig, vice chairman at the F.D.I.C., has been pushing the overhaul of large, complex banks as well as more rigorous capital standards.
The banking industry might be able to bear more regulations, given how it has fared under earlier measures. In some ways, the banks have thrived despite the added costs of all the new rules and demands since 2008.
Dick Bove, a bank analyst at Rafferty Capital Markets, estimates that F.D.I.C.-insured banks will earn $39 billion in the first quarter of this year, which would be a record quarterly showing. ''No one can argue that banks were hurt from a profit standpoint by regulation,'' he said.
The financial overhauls of the last four years don't appear to have held banks back from indulging in activities that facilitate economic growth. Helped by Wall Street financial firms, American companies have raised huge amounts in capital markets since the crisis. Last year, corporations issued $940 billion of bonds, a record amount, according to Dealogic, a data provider. This has happened even as investment banks scaled back their operations to get ready for regulations they vocally oppose, like the so-called Volcker Rule.
The overhaul doesn't appear to have hurt the housing market, either. Large lenders like Wells Fargo have profited well from the recent boom in mortgage refinancing. That activity has also helped consumers, through sharply lower borrowing rates for millions of homeowners.
Banks are also making significantly more loans to companies, which bolsters the economy and job growth in many parts of the country. There is even evidence that the overhaul may have helped the banks become better run. Citigroup, which was subject to much regulatory pressure, is more streamlined and reported strong first-quarter earnings this week.
Little of this might have been expected after hearing past warnings from bankers. In 2011, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said that the proposed rules to overhaul derivatives, a commonly used financial instrument, ''would damage America.'' He also said that the Basel rules were ''anti-American.'' Comment letters filed by lobbyists with regulators used sophisticated-looking models to show how rules could hold back the economy.
''As far as the banks are concerned, there is never a good time to raise capital or increase regulation,'' Ms. Bair said. ''When times are bad, they say it could hurt things, and when times are good, they say they don't need it.''
Some analysts, however, caution against reading too much into the banks' strong profits.
Though banks have been preparing for new rules for months, many of them have not been fully executed, which means the true costs of the measures will not be known until later.
Mr. Bove says that, while bank profits have hardly suffered from new regulation, their customers have. Lenders have simply passed on many of the costs, mostly in the form of new fees, he said. ''The government aimed a Stinger missile at the banking industry and missed and hit the consumer instead,'' said Mr. Bove, who also notes that loans to small business are still weak.
In addition, bank profits may not be as strong as they look, say some analysts. Earnings appear less impressive when taking into account the new capital that banks have to hold. This can be seen when applying a metric called return on equity, which reflects the extra capital.
Financial companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had a 7.9 percent return on equity last year, according to data from S.& P. That's below the 10 percent return for utilities last year, also a regulated industry. And the banks' return is down from the 16 percent return that they achieved in 2006.
That is why some analysts argue that it would be a mistake to force banks to hold even more capital than they already will under Dodd-Frank and Basel III. They argue that it would depress returns on equity and therefore prompt banks to exit certain businesses, reducing credit in the economy. In a research note last week, a Goldman Sachs bank analyst estimated a Brown-Vitter bill could remove $3.8 trillion of credit from the United States banking system.
But considering that past dire forecasts haven't materialized, advocates for tougher rules may be tempted to press on.
Phillip L. Swagel, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, sees risks in adopting higher capital reserves, but he says he thinks the industry's gloominess can be overdone.
''I do understand the frustration of the bank critics when they see pieces like the one from Goldman Sachs saying that the world will end under Brown-Vitter,'' said Professor Swagel, who served as assistant secretary for economic policy under Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.
Despite the sharp debate, he says he thinks there is growing agreement among policy makers, and even banks, that more capital might be needed. ''I see consensus on the top-line issue of more capital,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Looking Overseas, Businesses Learn to Master Currency Exchange

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SATALINE

 BODY:
Jean-Paul Tennant is in the adventure business, but that does not mean he enjoys taking risks. He is chief executive of a travel company, Geographic Expeditions, that specializes in arranging ambitious trips to exotic lands, places where unstable local currencies can make financial transactions a challenge.
Based in San Francisco, the 31-year-old company books trips to Bhutan, Tibet, Central Asia, Patagonia and the Galpagos Islands months or even more than a year in advance. In late 2006, Mr. Tennant had booked travel for eight clients who wanted to explore northern India. Then the rupee began a double-digit climb against the dollar, which prompted one Indian supplier who had already agreed to fees for hotel rooms, guides and drivers to say he needed to raise his prices. Suddenly a trip costing Geographic Expeditions $7,500 per person was going to jump to $9,000.
''As soon as we commit to a price, we are heavily exposed if we don't know what our costs will be,'' Mr. Tennant said. ''It can totally kill a company like ours.'' He quickly canceled the contract and found another supplier that agreed to a firm quote. 
As more small companies conduct business overseas, owners are learning that volatile exchange rates can cut into profits. More of these businesses are using banks and international payment companies and creating risk management strategies that mimic those of large concerns.
Mr. Tennant said he now worked with experienced global currency traders who help Geographic Expeditions conduct transactions and lock in costs. The strategy has helped his company of 45 employees grow to expected sales of $27 million this year.
These are some tips for conducting business in foreign currencies, based on the experiences of small-business owners like Mr. Tennant.
EXTEND THE QUOTE PERIOD Many American businesses pay their overseas vendors in the local currency. But not all business owners have the time or expertise to figure out how to avoid being hit by a sudden change in the exchange rate.
Craig T. Batten is chief financial officer of S4 Inc. in Toano, Va., which imports and sells $8 million in holiday lights a year. Four years ago, the company was so small that he could not find a bank to help him, so Mr. Batten worked alone, getting quotes from Chinese manufacturers that were paid in dollars. He would make a deposit of up to 50 percent of the order when he placed it, with the balance due when the product was shipped. Quotes would be valid for up to 90 days. After that, the vendor would deliver a new quote, which was time-consuming and could force S4 to update its prices.
Now working with Citizens Bank, Mr. Batten said he got quotes six months in advance and could pay in the local currency, the renminbi.
''The U.S. dollar has been losing value compared with the renminbi,'' Mr. Batten said. ''The two places I deal with will hold prices for a longer time and quote better prices because they're not hedging on the loss of the U.S. dollar.''
The bank saves him money, he said, because he has been able to develop relationships with their representatives, who look out for him. ''They often reduce the wire transfer fees when dealing with funds outside of U.S. dollars,'' he said.
WORK WITH A TRADER Adriana Kahane, founder and chief executive of Dream Foods International in Santa Monica, Calif., depends on a currency trading company to help her business import organic citrus juices from Sicily. Dream Foods tallies about $6 million a year in sales.
When she started in 1998, Ms. Kahane relied on a big bank to buy currency to carry out transactions. She would place an order 90 days or more in advance, committing to buy, say, 75,000 euros on a certain date to pay a supplier. When the date came, even if she did not need the product at that moment, she was obligated to buy the currency. That became a problem during the recession, she said, when ''we were a little bit squeezed on our margins because of the high cost of the euro.''
Five years ago Ms. Kahane started using Associated Foreign Exchange, or AFEX, an international payment and foreign exchange company in Los Angeles. She said the company had been willing to give her extra days before she was committed to buying euros. The AFEX representative calls her regularly when he sees the euro's value dropping and knows she may want to make a purchase. She said that had helped Dream Foods save as much as $100,000 in a year.
''The smaller foreign exchange shops are more competitive and I find their service level is much higher,'' she said. ''If they see a swing in the rates, they are going to give me a call.''
LOCK IN THE PRICE Mr. Tennant of Geographic Expeditions urges business owners to use forward contracts that lock in an agreed-upon price for a foreign currency. This strategy works especially well for companies like wine importers that publish prices months in advance.
Mr. Tennant works with Wells Fargo and AFEX to carry out the transactions. Traders buy the currency -- for instance, New Zealand dollars -- to pay for hotel rooms or tours that will be used months later. The exchange rate is set and the price cannot budge, even if the currency rates change.
''You've locked in the price of the foreign currency that you're going to need to buy on payment date,'' Mr. Tennant said. ''If you can lock in a price because you're using the appropriate financial instrument, it's good for the consumer. Hedging is a wonderful thing. It takes uncertainty off the table.''
Some volatile currencies, however, cannot be hedged, he said, including the Moroccan dirham, the Mongolian tugrik and the Tajik somoni. It also is more challenging to deal with countries like China that have capital controls in place to regulate the flow of foreign currency in and out of the economy.
Geographic Expeditions tries to have at least two suppliers in any one destination so that when one supplier raises prices, as the Indian vendor did, the company can find an alternative. When American dollars must be used, Mr. Tennant makes sure those contracts stipulate that the prices cannot change.
Generally, he said, ''If we can't hedge, we eat the risk.''
STICK WITH DOLLARS Some small businesses find that using foreign currency is too great a challenge. When Ice Air, a Mount Vernon, N.Y., company, buys air-conditioning units made in China for resale, Hugh Koh, the company's chief financial officer, insists on paying in dollars.
For three years, he said, the company worked with a major bank to buy forward contracts and conduct business in euros. With the exchange rate fluctuations and bank fees, Ice Air broke even on the currency transactions.
''It was a lot of work,'' Mr. Koh said. ''With foreign exchange, there's an element of gambling in there. There is always the risk.''
By dealing only in dollars, he said, the company avoids market fluctuations. But there are drawbacks. Some overseas vendors refuse to accept dollars. Those that do may try to protect themselves by charging a fee, adding as much as 10 percent to the cost of their products or services.
But Mr. Koh is happy to pay a fee that brings peace of mind. ''For planning purposes it's a finite number,'' he said. ''When we look at costs for this year, we know what the costs will be.''

HEADLINE: Tesco to Sustain Large Costs In Leaving American Market

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- After six years of fruitless attempts to make money in the United States, the supermarket chain Tesco said Wednesday that its withdrawal from the market would come at a big cost.
Tesco has yet to decide how to exit the U.S. market, where it set up the Fresh & Easy convenience stores in 2007, but said it would cost 1.2 billion, or $1.8 billion. Some analysts have said the withdrawal, which was decided in December, comes after the British chain grossly misjudged American consumer habits.
''When you try something there is always a risk,'' the chief executive, Philip Clarke, said of the U.S. business at a news conference. ''We tried something a long way from home.'' 
Tesco initially hoped it had discovered a market niche for smaller stores offering warm meals along the West Coast. But it soon became clear that the stores failed to compete with larger supermarkets as the economic slump crimped consumer spending. Attempts to turn the business around by changing store interiors, the product range and marketing also failed.
Laurie McIlwee, the chief financial officer, said he was in discussions with ''a number of organizations that want to buy the entirety of Fresh & Easy,'' Tesco's preferred outcome. He declined to say how many companies were involved in the discussion but said a deal could be announced in as few as three months.
Jonathan Pritchard, an analyst at Oriel Securities, said that exiting the United States was a good idea and that he expected Tesco to complete the task in the next six to nine months.
Mr. Clarke said the episode had taught Tesco ''that when you can't see a return in a reasonable time frame, you call an end to it and move your energy elsewhere.''
''There are better things we can do with our resources for our shareholders than that,'' he said.
Tesco now plans to open additional smaller convenience stores across Britain and to win market share in South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. It also plans to benefit more from faster-growing retailing markets in China, India and Turkey.
Mr. Clarke started a review of Tesco's businesses over a year ago, scaling back operations outside Britain to focus on its struggling business at home. Large investments abroad over the past decade, including in Asia, proved expensive and somewhat less successful than hoped. At the same time, sales struggled in Britain, where Tesco relied too much on its large market share alone to generate sales growth.
Reporting a drop in profit for the year that ended Feb. 23, Tesco said business in South Korea and Europe was difficult. The economic crisis in Europe meant that consumers were cutting back spending, while in South Korea, new restrictions in opening hours hurt sales.
Even in Britain, Tesco is slowing its expansion. It said it decided not to go ahead with planned expansions of about 100 properties here, adding to a total write-down on its real estate of 804 million. Tesco has been losing market share in Britain to rivals with lower prices, like the discount retailer Aldi, and it was affected by the horse meat scandal this year, which led it to withdraw some products.
To attract people to its British stores, the chain invested in the upmarket coffee chain Harris+Hoole, the bakery brand Euphorium and the family-friendly restaurant chain Giraffe, which it bought last month.
Tesco's announcements have ''given investors mild indigestion,'' Richard Hunter of Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers said.
Tesco shares closed down 3.9 percent in London on Wednesday. The company said trading profit fell 13 percent in its fiscal year that ended in February, to 3.45 billion. Sales rose 1.3 percent, to 72.4 billion.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: India's Tata Group Maps U.S. Expansion

BYLINE: SHIVANI VORA


HIGHLIGHT: Better known for outsourcing jobs to India, Tata is ramping up in the U.S. 

 BODY:
NEW YORK- Tata Group, the Indian conglomerate whose name is associated with one of the biggest outsourcing firms in the world, is bringing its more of its business to United States.
Already the largest Indian-owned business in the country by revenue, with more than 24,000 employees working for 11 companies, Tata is positioning itself to become a household name in the United States, said Kapil Sharma, 41, the senior North America general manager of Tata Sons, the Indian conglomerate's holding company.
This year, he said, Tata plans to hire thousands more, increase awareness of American brands like the once-popular Eight O'Clock Coffee and strengthen its ties with government officials.

"When people think of India and business with the U.S., outsourcing most commonly comes to mind," said Mr. Sharma over lunch earlier this year at the Pierre Hotel, part of the Tata-owned Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces. "Here, it's the other way around, and the U.S. is becoming more and more important to the company."
Mr. Sharma said the reason for Tata's increasing foothold in the United States is simple: "There are lots of chances for Tata to be profitable in the U.S.," he said. 
Tata was founded in 1868 by Jamsetji Tata as a trading company and has grown into a giant in the steel, hotels and auto industry, with 450,000 global employees, up from 200,000 employees in 2003. The group recently named Cyrus P. Mistry of Ireland as its sixth chairman, the first outside the Tata family.
Tata's expansion in the United States has been accompanied by expansion around the world, part of a drive started in 2000 by the former chairman Ratan Tata. Although only 25 percent of the company's employees are outside India, 58 percent of its revenues are generated in the other nearly 80 countries where it does business.
Tata's United States portfolio generated $8 billion in revenue in 2011, Mr. Sharma said, which is small compared to the company's overall annual revenue of $100 billion in the last fiscal year.
Still, Mr. Sharma said the company's American investments are highly valued. "The talent available and innovations in the U.S. are a big factor in our growth here," he said. "We feel that we can marry those two with the Tata name to create success."
Mr. Sharma said that Tata's ties to the United States go back to 1945, roughly two months after the end of World War II, when the company opened a trading office in Manhattan. The company has expanded to include consumer brands like Tetley, Eight O'Clock Coffee, Jaguar Land Rover, a vitamin beverage called Activate and Tata Chemicals, which mines soda ash.
A big priority for Tata is a substantial expansion of Eight O'Clock Coffee in the United States and Canada by revamping the brand to be more accessible through the introduction of products like K-cups, which are individual portions of coffee that are used with Keurig machines.
Mr. Sharma, who was once the senior counsel for former Democratic Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, is also trying to strengthen the company's relationship with prominent politicians. Already, he said, he has a friendly relationship with South Carolina's Republican governor, Nikki R. Haley, and Tata was one of the sponsors of a reception at the National Governors Association in February.
Mr. Sharma said he enlisted 15 employees to attend the reception and mingle with the politicians. "Governors understand foreign investment and what it can bring to their community," he said.
Despite Mr. Sharma's efforts to move the company beyond outsourcing, Tata's main business in the United States right now is its information technology company, Tata Consulting Services, or T.C.S., which has 20,000 employees and 18 offices. T.C.S. recently opened new service centers in Santa Clara, Calif., and Minneapolis and is in the process of hiring 2,000 more consultants in the United States. T.C.S.'s revenue from North America has almost quadrupled to more than $5 billion a year in the five years to March 2012.
Mr. Sharma said the demand for an expanded workforce is coming from an increasing number of new clients, as well as more projects from existing clients, which include Microsoft, Cisco and Chrysler.
TCS is growing faster in the United States than its Indian rivals like Infosys, said Arup Roy, a research director at Gartner who is based in Mumbai. Mr. Roy cites several reasons for Tata's edge, including consistent quality, client satisfaction, breadth of offerings, continuous improvement programs and a huge brand awareness among large clients in the United States.
Tata's biggest push after T.C.S. is consumer products, most notably Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley, but Arvind Panagariya, a professor of economics and Indian political economy at Columbia University, said that compared to established American brands, its presence in the market is still small. "You can't compare Jaguar Land Rover with a Ford or Tetley with, say, a Lipton," he said.
Still, both companies have grown since Tata came into the picture. Since Tata bought Tetley in 2000 and Jaguar Land Rover in 2008, sales at both companies have picked up in the United States, Mr. Sharma said. Jaguar Land Rover, for example, sold 287,000 vehicles in 2007 while still owned by Ford, but last year the automaker sold a record 357,773 vehicles, which is a 30 percent increase from 2011.
Not all of Tata's American ventures have been successful. The company owned a series of four-star hotels in the mid-1990s, including the Lexington in New York City, said Alan Rosling, who was the executive director of the board of Tata Sons for five years before he left in 2009.
"The properties Tata was behind didn't work with the rest of the portfolio," he said, which was focused on high-end hotels. So Tata exited the United States hotel business in the late 1990s.
In 2005, Tata got back into the American hotel market, this time by adding five-star hotels, including the Pierre in New York and Taj Boston, to the Taj portfolio.
Tata's expanding presence in the United States is part of the wave of Indian investment in the last five years, which also includes companies like Mahindra, Wipro and Jindal Steel.
According to data from the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis, India ranked fourth in its growth rate of foreign direct investment in the United States from 2006 to 2011 (Israel, China and New Zealand are the top three). India's financial interests in the United States rose 40.8 percent in that period, with a total spending of $9.8 billion.
Though the flow of foreign direct investments from India to the United States has recently dropped, Professor Panagariya said that fluctuations are normal because India is still a rising nation.
Given Tata's number of acquisitions in the last decade, snapping up more companies in the United States might seem the obvious strategy, but Mr. Sharma said that is not the case.
"At this point, it's not about buying more companies," he said. "We want to focus on the companies we have and educate the U.S. about who we are."

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley Reports Profit, but Investors Have Doubts

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: Morgan Stanley reported first-quarter adjusted earnings of $1 billion, or 50 cents a share, but share prices fell to their lowest level since January. 

 BODY:
 8:11 p.m. | Updated 
Morgan Stanley shareholders have been awaiting a turnaround at the bank. On Thursday, some decided they could not wait any longer.
Shares of Morgan Stanley tumbled 5.4 percent, falling to their lowest level since January, after the bank's quarterly results showed a sharp drop in trading revenue.
Yet earnings for the first quarter were stronger than Wall Street analysts had expected. Indeed, the quarterly results underscored the progress the bank has made in building its wealth management division, as well as the continued drag from the fixed-income business. 
"Morgan Stanley is like a team changing sports, and the sport they are leaving didn't do so well, but the one they are going to did," said Chris Grisanti, the owner and co-founder of Grisanti Capital Management, which owns shares of Morgan Stanley. "However, I think now there is some doubt in the market about their ability to make this transition."
Revenue from trading bonds, commodities and currencies fell 42 percent, to $1.5 billion from the year-ago period. That was decidedly worse than rivals like Goldman Sachs, which had a drop in fixed-income trading of just 7 percent.
The first quarter was a challenging one for most banks, particularly in March as investor concern rose over a prolonged federal budget impasse in the United States and the health of Europe's economies. Morgan Stanley, though, seemed to be affected more than other Wall Street banks.
Since the financial crisis, Morgan Stanley has been working to reduce the size of its fixed-income department, cutting staff and selling assets. The department had been the source of trading losses, and Morgan Stanley's chief executive, James P. Gorman, has been trying to shift the bank out of riskier businesses to less volatile areas like wealth management.
Richard Bove, an analyst with Rafferty Capital Markets, said that Morgan Stanley's decision to shrink the fixed-income business meant that not only was it losing talented traders, it was not attracting as many as it used to. As a result, it will be hard for Morgan Stanley to keep up with competitors.
"Most investors are unhappy with the fact this company was not able to grow its trading activity as much as its peers and as a result they perceive there is a significant problem at the company and are pulling away from the stock," he said.
Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, said she was surprised by the severity of Thursday's stock drop.
She said while there was certainly room for improvement in the earnings, investors needed to keep in mind that the bank had a strong first quarter in 2012, so that in comparison the decline in trading revenue appeared worse than it really was.
"I am not saying $1.5 billion is as good as it can be, but we are continuing that steady progress we have always talk about," Ms. Porat said, noting the bank had strong sequential revenue growth over the last year and continued to sell risky assets.
Morgan Stanley earned a profit, adjusted for accounting charges, of $1 billion, or 50 cents a share. That compares with a loss of $79 million in the period a year earlier. The one-time charges were related to the bank's credit spreads. Excluding the charges, the bank had a profit of $1.2 billion, or 61 cents a share, a decline from the $1.4 billion reported in the first quarter of 2012.
Morgan Stanley's adjusted revenue for the three months ended March 31 fell to $8.5 billion, from $8.9 billion in the period a year earlier. Analysts forecast revenue of $8.35 billion.
Return on equity, a measure of how efficiently shareholder money is being deployed, fell to 7.6 percent from 9.2 percent in the year-ago period
Excluding charges related to the bank's credit spreads, known as debt valuation adjustments, net revenue in institutional securities, which houses the fixed-income department, was $4.4 billion, compared with $5.1 billion in the period a year earlier.
Revenue from trading commodities and rates fell in the quarter. The decline in revenue from trading interest rates came despite a decision to take more risk over the last year. In rates and credit spreads, the bank's quarterly value at risk - a yardstick of how much could be lost in one trading day - was $61 million, up from $46 million in the year-ago period.
The bright spot in Morgan Stanley's earnings was its wealth management division, led by Gregory Fleming. It posted pretax income from continuing operations of $597 million, up 48 percent from the $403 million reported in the first quarter of last year.
One number investors were watching, the division's pretax profit margin, came in at 17 percent, higher than some analysts had projected. Net revenue in wealth management rose to $3.5 billion from $3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2012.

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley's First-Quarter Rebound

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Morgan Stanley posts a first-quarter profit of $1 billion. | Rising profits may turn out to be a source of discomfort for banks. | A top Barclays executive, Rich Ricci, is stepping down. | Stephen A. Feinberg has emerged as a possible buyer of the gun maker Freedom Group. 

 BODY:
Morgan Stanley on Thursday reported first-quarter profit of $1 billion, or 50 cents a share, driven by sold results in wealth management. The profit compared with a loss of $79 million a year earlier and beat estimates. Excluding one-time charges, the firm had a profit of $1.2 billion, or 61 cents a share, which was down from $1.4 billion reported in the first quarter of 2012. The firm is holding a conference call at 10 a.m. to discuss the results.
RISING PROFITS TEMPT A PUSH FOR TOUGHER RULES | Rising profits may turn out to be a source of discomfort for banks, DealBook's Peter Eavis writes. "The ballooning bottom lines could embolden the lawmakers and regulators who want to introduce additional measures to overhaul the banking system." 
New rules have not brought about the disruption that many officials feared. And now, buoyant profits could provide ammunition for those in Washington who advocate for a more radical overhaul. "I hope the regulators move forward with tougher regulations," said Sheila C. Bair, a former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. "This wouldn't endanger the economic recovery." In some ways, banks have thrived since 2008 despite the added costs of new rules. "No one can argue that banks were hurt from a profit standpoint by regulation," said Dick Bove, a bank analyst at Rafferty Capital Markets.
There is a bipartisan push to toughen regulation. Recently, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, said they would introduce a bill to require the biggest banks to hold significantly more capital. Last year, Daniel K. Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor who oversees regulation, floated an idea for limiting bank size.
RICCI TO STEP DOWN FROM BARCLAYS | The head of corporate and investment banking at Barclays, Rich Ricci, is stepping down. A top lieutenant to Robert E. Diamond Jr., the former Barclays chief executive who stepped down after a rate-rigging scandal, Mr. Ricci had been expected to leave after his name surfaced in the Libor inquiry, DealBook's Mark Scott writes. "Earlier this year, regulatory filings showed that Mr. Ricci had cashed in $26 million of deferred shares. He was awarded the shares - some 5.7 million - as part of his bonus from 2009 to 2011."
CERBERUS OWNER MIGHT BUY GUN MAKER | As Cerberus Capital Management looks for buyers for the Freedom Group, the gun maker it pledged to sell in the wake of the school shootings in Connecticut, the private equity firm has found a possible buyer in its owner, Stephen A. Feinberg. "He has reached out to friends and other wealthy investors about teaming up on a potential offer," DealBook's Peter Lattman reports, citing two people briefed on the matter. "The bid would be what is called a stalking horse bid, essentially setting the floor for other offers in the auction process."
"A bid by Mr. Feinberg presents a host of potential conflicts of interest. It is exceedingly rare, if not unprecedented, for the owner of a private equity fund to purchase a company owned by the fund. To entertain a bid by Mr. Feinberg, these people said, Cerberus Capital Management and the Freedom Group will adopt several measures to avoid any perception of inside dealing and to prevent a sweetheart deal for Mr. Feinberg at the expense of his investors."
The Senate's defeat of gun-related measures on Wednesday, all but ending an effort to pass meaningful legislation, may actually have a positive effect on the Freedom Group's business, Mr. Lattman notes.
ON THE AGENDA | The Blackstone Group and Verizon report earnings before the market opens. Advanced Micro Devices, E*Trade Financial, Google and Microsoft report earnings on Thursday evening. SeaWorld Entertainment is scheduled to price its initial public offering. Officials including Wolfgang Schuble, the German finance minister, and Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chairman of the Eurogroup, speak in Washington at the Bertelsmann Foundation-Financial Times conference.
LOEB CONFRONTS TENSION OVER PENSIONS | The hedge fund manager Daniel S. Loeb has been facing criticism after an article in Rolling Stone highlighted his connection to a group that has advocated for states to alter pension benefit plans. Now, Mr. Loeb, the billionaire who runs Third Point, has canceled his plans to speak at a Thursday conference of the Council of Institutional Investors, after certain pension funds threatened to confront him, Reuters reports. The hedge fund manager defended himself in a letter to the chair of the investor group, saying, "I have never taken a position against" defined benefit plans, "nor has any philanthropic organization I lead."

HEADLINE: The Mercedes Concept GLA Is a Personal Drive-In Theater

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Mercedes-Benz will introduce its Concept GLA compact crossover this weekend at the Shanghai Motor Show in China. 

 BODY:
Mercedes-Benz is going smaller and sportier with its Concept GLA, a compact crossover aimed at younger buyers. The GLA, to be unveiled at the Shanghai Motor Show this weekend, has a long, muscular nose, large wheels and squat haunches. The mechanical bits include a turbocharged 2-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine, making 208 horsepower, a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and 4Matic all-wheel drive. 
A production version may be available in the United States in late 2014, though it is likely to lack some of the baubles of the show car, like the kitschy frameless doors reminiscent of an old Subaru. But one can hope that the high-definition cameras mounted to the roof rails - which could be removed and attached to a ski helmet or dog collar - and laser-beam lights that double as movie projectors will make the cut.
You read that right: the Concept GLA's lights include laser beams that can, supposedly, project images from a smartphone, the Internet or a digital storage device onto whatever surface you feel like pointing at. But if you can't find a whitewashed concrete wall or abandoned drive-in theater screen, there's also a screen inside the car that could be used to watch movies and YouTube clips.
Compared with the BMW X1, the GLA is longer, wider and lower at 172.5 inches long, 77.9 inches wide and 62.2 inches high. The overall stance is more or less aggressive - or perhaps as aggressive as a compact crossover can look before you consider that it's a compact crossover. 
Mercedes-Benz swathed the interior with tastefully arranged panels of hand-stitched leather, bits of aluminum trim and fiber-optic ambient lighting. The climate-control switches change color from red to blue depending on whether the user is raising or lowering the cabin temperature.
Prices have not been announced. The comparable BMW X1 starts around $32,000 and can run past $40,000.

HEADLINE: One on One: Tim Jones of Buzzient, Hunting Chatter on Explosives

BYLINE: AMY O'LEARY


HIGHLIGHT: Good Samaritans can be virtual, too. After the Boston Marathon attack, Tim Jones, an explosives expert and chief of a social media management company, began tracking Web chatter on explosives, offering the data to the Boston police, whom he has been working with since 2011. 

 BODY:
When two bombs exploded at Monday's Boston Marathon, good Samaritans of all sorts rushed in, from off-duty medical personnel to residents who opened their homes to evacuees. Tim Jones, the chief executive of Buzzient, a Boston-area social media management start-up, felt a similar urge to help, using his company's ability to search Web history on forums, comments and social media, to focus on specific topics - like explosives.
Mr. Jones also happens to be the former head of an explosives-detection company. Given his background, he jumped in when this week's news broke - as a kind of virtual bystander. Nearly two years ago, he had offered his company's social media monitoring tools to the Boston Police Department, pro bono. This week, his first thought was to tweak his company's search algorithms to target online chatter about explosives, in case the police department would seek that kind of data as their investigation continued. The following is condensed and edited from an interview with Mr. Jones about his company's volunteer efforts to assist with the investigation. 
 Q. 
 Your company, Buzzient, has been working pro bono with the Boston Police Department since 2011, shortly after the London riots. How did that relationship begin?
 A. 
 We were big proponents of Boston's "innovation district" about two years ago, and with that started to work more closely with the mayor's office. I received an inquiry from the mayor's chief of staff, and this was right after the London riots.
The London police weren't paying attention to social networks, they had no idea that groups of people were communicating on social networks saying: "Hey, five guys, take tube and start something here. Another five guys take the tube and start something there." The Boston Police Department saw that, thought, "Hmm, this is something we should pay attention to."
Police Commissioner Ed Davis reached out to me and said, "Hey, we're interested in what you guys are doing, we'd like to know a little bit more." He came over to our office, sat down with us, and saw that there was kind of a shared vision of how we could use emerging technology to at least give them a little bit of an early warning system. So what we offered to do was make this available to them pro bono. To be clear, there's no financial relationship between Buzzient and the City of Boston, we've never been formally requested by the City of Boston or the F.B.I. to use Buzzient. It's something we just did because it was the right thing to do.
 Q. 
 How did you first hear the news on Monday about the explosions at the Boston Marathon? 
 A. 
I saw a couple of alerts on the phone. The first thing I did was I sat down and just logged into the system myself and started making changes, based upon my knowledge of explosives. (In a prior life I ran an explosives detection company that I spun out of Georgia Tech.) There is a timeliness to this around gathering data and the best thing to do was to sit down and up the tempo of the system that we had running. So we began to focus on social media conversations and content around explosives.
 Q. 
 With your background in explosives detection technologies, what kinds of things did you think would be helpful to look for on the social Web? 
 A. 
As it has turned out, I believe these explosives are going to turn out to be either black powder or TNT-based. But a lot of what I worked on before was on the detection of plastic explosives and plastic explosive variants - C4, RDX, HMX, PETN and TATP. The analysis we conducted here was really around: were people around online talking about these much more destructive explosives? That's to figure out if there were any telltale signs of someone asking about these complex explosives becoming frustrated, deciding they would go for less destructive explosives, like TNT. It was also to determine whether there is any ongoing threat of people trying to use these more complex explosives.
 Q. 
 How did you get involved in the field of explosives detection? 
 A. 
At the time I was a venture capitalist with a particular focus on spinning technology out of our national labs and major universities. 9/11 comes along and I'm sitting there thinking, "I'm making good money as a venture capitalist, but is there more to life?"
I had previously seen technology coming out of Georgia Tech that enabled you to take the equivalent of a chip, a semiconductor, and identify either explosives or biological elements to detect them based on the vapor trail they create. Every time an explosive comes into contact with air it creates a unique vapor trail, a unique signature. So the signature for TNT is different than the signature for C4. By deploying this low-cost chip technology, the thesis was, one could build a very, very low cost, very ubiquitous detector grid that you could then deploy in things like mailboxes, lamp posts, airports, etc.
The frustration we ultimately found was at that time I think the attention of the venture capital community had already shifted away from homeland and global security back to the Internet, particularly the consumer Internet. When everything happened on Monday, I kind of tilted my head and said, "I told you so." This is the stuff we knew we needed to do and, quite frankly, there wasn't a lot of appetite for doing so.
 Q. 
 What would be the holy grail for mining social analytics in the Boston Marathon case? 
 A. 
The holy grail would be something similar to what happened with the ricin letters that were sent to the White House: someone who has logged onto a forum, and has logged in with some identifying piece of information - a user name, an e-mail address - has asked particular questions, commented, maybe, on other posts. Someone who has, in effect, self-identified, where someone basically puts out enough information you could say, "Oh, this person is kind of asking pretty much the same sorts of questions that correspond to what we found in the physical forensics."

HEADLINE: Wheelies: The Eurozone Plunge Edition

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The European new car market has taken a dive over the past 18 months, but Chevrolet says its Cruze diesel will get 46 miles per gallon. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Once the engine that drove Europe's economy, new car sales there are in a significant slump. With unemployment at 11 percent across the region, people have been putting off new car purchases as the European debt crisis continues and the economy contracts. New car sales in Europe have slid to 2.9 million in the first quarter of 2013, down from 3.3 million the year before. Spain, Italy and France experienced large declines in the new car market, and now even Germany has joined the ranks of Eurozone countries with a double-digit dip in new car sales. (The Boston Globe)
 The small car arms race continues. General Motors announced the Chevrolet Cruze Clean Turbo Diesel's estimated fuel economy numbers Thursday, claiming that the compact sedan has unseated Volkswagen's Jetta TDI as the most fuel-efficient diesel sedan. G.M. says that the Cruze, equipped with a 148-horsepower 2-liter turbodiesel 4-cylinder and a 6-speed automatic transmission, gets 46 miles per gallon; 4 miles per gallon better than the 140-horsepower Jetta diesel. The Cruze diesel, with a starting price of $25,695, also boasts an estimated range of 700 miles. (Automotive News) 
 Higher new car prices have led to the introduction of longer-term car loans, some as lengthy as 96 months. But Jennifer Waters of The Wall Street Journal cautions against entering into an eight-year car loan. Alec Gutierrez, a senior market analyst for Kelley Blue Book, concurred, saying that most new car buyers would end up owing more than a car is worth after several years. (Market Watch)
 General Motors says it is mulling over a new name for its redesigned midsize pickup truck, last sold in the United States in 2012 under the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon nameplates. (A redesigned version is sold overseas.) The names emerged in 2004, when G.M. replaced its 22-year-old Chevrolet S10 and GMC S15 compact pickup models with a slightly larger platform. Both Colorado and Canyon nameplates may be scrapped when G.M. shifts its global Colorado platform to the United States sometime in 2014. The new midsize pickups will probably be very different from their full-size relatives, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, and will be aimed at competing with the Toyota Tacoma. (Edmunds)
 Louisiana may join a small group of states requiring animals to be secured when riding in the back of an open pickup truck. Legislation was introduced this week to the Louisiana House that would prohibit drivers from traveling with animals in open pickup beds on the Interstate. State Representative Frank Howard's reason for supporting the bill was personal; he said two or three of his dogs jumped from the back of a moving truck on the freeway, one of them hanging itself on the side of the truck. According to research conducted for the Connecticut General Assembly in 2009, at least eight states (including Connecticut) required restraints or enclosures for animals traveling in open pickup beds. (The Times-Picayune)
 Orrion Wilson, a contestant for Fox's pop music talent show "X Factor," told authorities he didn't have any money for a bus fare when he finished his audition near New Orleans. So he allegedly stole a car someone had left idling at a gas station near the audition site. The police followed Mr. Wilson in a chase that reached speeds of 75 miles per hour, ending the excitement with a well-timed pit maneuver. Mr. Wilson expressed confidence to the police that he did well in his audition. (TMZ)

HEADLINE: On Whether the Rich Pay Too Little in Taxes

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A majority of Americans believe that high-income people do not pay enough in taxes, but that majority has been shrinking over the last couple of decades, according to new data from Gallup. 

 BODY:
On Tuesday Bruce Bartlett mentioned that a majority of Americans believe that high-income people do not pay enough in taxes. That majority, though, has been shrinking over the last couple of decades, according to new data from Gallup. 
Gallup asks respondents about whether they think members of different income groups are paying "their fair share in federal taxes, paying too much or paying too little." In 1992 and 1993, 77 percent of Americans said that upper-income people paid too little. Today, the share is 61 percent. 
That change in public opinion seems to contradict the trend in the actual tax burden faced by high-income households. As a New York Times data analysis showed last fall, the average tax rate paid by people of all income classes has fallen since the mid-1990s, including that for wealthier people. 
That said, the share of the nation's total tax bill that is paid by the wealthy has been growing - but that's because the incomes of the wealthy have increased so strikingly, faster than the individual tax rates they face have fallen. And of course Congress did raise the top marginal tax rate for 2013.
Meanwhile, as I noted last year, Americans have become much more critical of the tax share paid by the poor.
In 1992, 8 percent of Americans said lower-income people paid too little in taxes. When the question was asked this month, the share was 19 percent, perhaps resonating with the sentiment expressed by Mitt Romney's "47 percent" comments.

HEADLINE: Public Offering Values SeaWorld at $2.5 Billion

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Shares of SeaWorld Entertainment were priced at $27, valuing the company at $2.5 billion. 

 BODY:
To many Americans, SeaWorld offers family fun amid penguins and killer whales.
To the Blackstone Group,, it offers the potential for lucrative returns.
On Friday, SeaWorld Entertainment will make its debut as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange in one of the biggest offerings of a private-equity-backed company in recent months. SeaWorld has become a signature investment for Blackstone, which recently played host to a pair of penguins in its Park Avenue offices.
The initial public offering had a promising start Thursday evening, with SeaWorld pricing shares at $27 each, at the top of an expected range, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. At that price, the deal raised $702 million and valued the company at $2.5 billion. 
Blackstone, which paid about $2.3 billion for SeaWorld in 2009, is selling shares in the public offering but will retain control of the company. After investing about $1 billion of equity in the deal, Blackstone received dividends of $500 million last year and $110.1 million the year before.
The theme park company, which includes other attractions, was once a division of the giant beer maker Anheuser-Busch InBev. Blackstone bought the company, which was not part of Anheuser-Busch InBev's core business, in a bet on the strength of brands like SeaWorld and Busch Gardens.
Since then, SeaWorld has added products, including iPhone and Android apps, and acquired an additional theme park last year, bringing the total to 11. It is also trying to build on its well-known brands, with plans to introduce an animated penguin character, Puck, at its theme park in Orlando, Fla.
SeaWorld has turned a profit from live shows, thrill rides and other attractions, earning $77.4 million last year, four times what it made in 2011. As a sweetener for its new investors, it plans to pay a dividend of 20 cents a share starting this quarter.
But SeaWorld's business model is vulnerable to a weak economy and to consumers who remain frugal in the wake of the recession.
The company gets most of its money from admissions at its theme parks, and relies on sales of food and merchandise. Its average ticket price is higher than those of two main rivals, Six Flags and Cedar Fair, according to a research note from Ian Corydon, an analyst with B. Riley & Company. Still, SeaWorld is trying to attract a broad swath of visitors.
"It's more of a destination park strategy," Mr. Corydon said. "The Orlando and Southern California parks are known the world over and draw guests from out of town."
SeaWorld is still haunted by an incident at its theme park in Orlando, where a trainer was killed by an Orca whale in full view of visitors in 2010. The accident drew intense criticism in the news media, and it is the subject of the documentary "Blackfish," which is scheduled for release this summer.
After revising its safety protocols, SeaWorld continues to deal with the legal fallout from the killing. The company has clashed with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which issued several citations.
"Once a trainer is in the water with a killer whale that chooses to engage in undesirable behavior, the trainer is at the whale's mercy," wrote Ken S. Welsch, a federal administrative law judge for the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, in a ruling last year.
Blackstone, the largest alternative investment firm in the world, has shown strength in its business over all. On Thursday, the firm said its profit in the first quarter rose 28 percent, to $628 million, as it reported growth in its assets under management.
Before holding the initial public offering, Blackstone was reported to have fielded takeover offers for SeaWorld. But it turned them down, according to reports, betting that the public market would offer better returns.
The offering was handled by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, Barclays and Wells Fargo Securities.
Blackstone has had some fun with its SeaWorld investment.
In January, the firm invited two Magellanic penguins to its Manhattan offices. The penguins were well-behaved, a person with knowledge of their visit said at the time. But not being housebroken, they left unexpected gifts on a carpet and a conference table.

HEADLINE: City's Jobless Rate Dips as Many People Stop Looking for Work

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: The State Labor Department reported 8.9 percent of New York City residents were unemployed in March, a rate higher than for the state and the nation. 

 BODY:
 New York City's unemployment rate dipped back below 9 percent in March, but most of the decline was caused by people dropping out of the work force, according to data released by the State Labor Department on Thursday. 
 The city's unemployment rate had been 9.1 percent in January and February after ending 2012 at 8.8 percent, its lowest point in a year and a half. Last month, it fell to 8.9 percent as the monthly survey of employers showed that the city added back almost all of the jobs lost in February. 
 Still, the Labor Department said the annual rate of growth of private-sector jobs in the city, now at 1.8 percent, trailed the national growth rate of 1.9 percent. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has frequently pointed to a higher rate of job growth in the city as evidence that his policies have helped the economy.
 The national unemployment rate, at 7.6 percent in March, was much lower than the city's. New York State's unemployment rate dropped to 8.2 percent, from 8.4 percent in February.
 Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist with Eastern Consolidated, a real estate investment services firm in Manhattan, calculated that the city gained 14,500 jobs in March, after adjustments to the state data to smooth out the usual seasonal fluctuations in hiring and layoffs. Most of those gains resulted from the end of the strike by school bus drivers, which temporarily pulled down the number of jobs in February, Ms. Denham said.
 Over the last two months, the city has added just 500 private-sector jobs, she said. Ms. Denham noted, however, that the two surveys that contribute to the official monthly report on the job market continue to vary widely. The survey of employers shows a healthy rate of hiring, while the survey of residents indicates that far fewer people have returned to work in the past year.
 Indeed, the survey of residents shows that a smaller share of adults in the city were employed in March than at any time since the summer of 2011.
 Statewide, more than 785,000 residents were unemployed in March, and fewer than half of them were collecting benefits, the Labor Department said. Many New Yorkers have exhausted all of the unemployment insurance they were eligible for as Congress has trimmed the emergency benefits offered after the last recession.

HEADLINE: New York Is U.S. Cultural Leader, at Least in Making Yogurt

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The state topped California in yogurt production last year, and at the same time, according to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, showed &#8220;our approach to growing the economy and creating an entrepreneurial government is paying off.&#8221; 

 BODY:
New York State is now the yogurt capital of the nation.
The state's chief yogurt promoter, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, claimed victory on Thursday in the battle for national yogurt supremacy, citing state data that showed New York topping California in production for 2012. 
Hoping to milk the announcement for all it's worth, Mr. Cuomo's office issued a nearly 2,100-word statement celebrating New York's triumph. The announcement is the latest in a string of dairy distinctions for the governor, including brokering peace in a dispute between two upstate mayors over the expansion of a Greek yogurt plant and convening the state's first "yogurt summit," which was marred only by a brief shortage of spoons.
"With New York State officially being crowned Yogurt Capital of America, it is clear that our approach to growing the economy and creating an entrepreneurial government is paying off," Mr. Cuomo said.
In 2012, New York produced 692 million pounds of yogurt, compared with 587 million pounds in California, according to data from each state. In 2011, California produced 627 million pounds of yogurt, comfortably exceeding the 554 million pounds produced in New York.
A spokesman for the federal government's National Agricultural Statistics Service said he could not independently confirm New York's yogurt pre-eminence because his agency stopped tracking state-by-state yogurt production after 2009. But in case anyone was to accuse Mr. Cuomo of embellishing his milestone, an administration official said New York State calculated its yogurt production using the same methodology as California did.
A spokesman for Gov. Jerry Brown of California did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether he was conceding defeat in the yogurt wars. But Steve Lyle, a spokesman for the California Department of Food and Agriculture, chose a course of diplomacy. 
"We appreciate Governor Cuomo's interest in agriculture and food production," Mr. Lyle said, "and wish New York's yogurt producers the best in bringing a wholesome quality product to consumers."
Jennifer Giambroni, a spokeswoman for the California Milk Advisory Board, said the board did not dispute Mr. Cuomo's numbers. 
"More importantly, though," she said, "I think we can all agree that when dairy farmers in any state win, we all win."

Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Artist and Visionary: William Matthew Prior Revealed' (through May 26) William Matthew Prior (1806-1873), the subject of this fascinating exhibition, painted portraits in the ''American primitive'' mode. His paintings of solemn, pie-faced tots, stiffly posed yet animated by some inner mystery, are especially compelling. But he had the chops to paint like a well-trained academician too. He was also an abolitionist who, at some risk to his reputation, painted portraits of black people; they are among his best works. He was also into spiritualism, and he was a savvy entrepreneur. He was, altogether, a most remarkable character. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
&#x2605; Asia Society: 'The Artful Recluse: Painting, Poetry, and Politics in 17th-Century China' (through June 2) With the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, China's intellectual elite, many of them artists who worked in the imperial government, were thrown into a tailspin. Confucian ethics demanded filial devotion to the old regime. But how were they to demonstrate it? One way was to remove themselves from active life and signal their resistance through art. How they did so is the subject of this compellingly fine-grained painting show. Some artists sacrificed their lives for principles; others used recluse status as a career move. The emotional weight, psychological depth, and intellectual complexity of the work of this time is what comes through here. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'LaToya Ruby Frazier: A Haunted Capital' (through Aug. 11) This preternaturally mature body of work by a 31-year-old photographer connects bedrooms and streetscapes, the suffering of loved ones and the afflictions of a ''distressed municipality'' (the state's official term for Ms. Frazier's hometown, Braddock, Pa.). Simultaneously introspective and extroverted, it's composed of arresting black-and-white photographs that sometimes look like studio portraits or social documentaries but aren't fully at home in either category. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'John Singer Sargent Watercolors' (through July 28) Sargent fans and watercolor hobbyists will be in heaven with this exhibition's more than 90 watercolors from the first decade of the 20th century, all from the collections of the Brooklyn Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and all representing picturesque scenes in Europe. Sargent pioneered the kind of loosely gestural yet clearly representational watercolor painting that today's popular culture adores. He has his detractors, though, who may profit from re-examining their prejudices in light of this beautiful show. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui' (through Aug. 4) Born in Ghana and long a resident of Nigeria where he maintains a productive studio, El Anatsui has for the past decade been creating spectacularly large, fabric-like sculpture from countless numbers of liquor-bottle caps linked together with twists of copper. The work weaves together ideas about colonialism, politics and economics, and is absolutely gorgeous. The Brooklyn show, which originated at the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, also includes a number of the artist's earlier and now-overlooked carved wood pieces, which are well worth studying. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
The Frick Collection: 'Piero della Francesca in America' (through May 19) Reuniting six panels from an altarpiece by Piero, this ravishing show approximates an intimate quattrocento chapel in the Frick's grand Oval Room. At the center of the installation is a seventh painting, the Clark Art Institute's ''Virgin and Child Enthroned With Four Angels,'' which comes from a different altarpiece in the painter's hometown, Sansepolcro, and exemplifies Piero's uncanny orchestration of figures, architecture and religious symbolism. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Gutai: Splendid Playground' (through May 8) The first large, in-depth examination of Japan's best-known postwar art movement is a mind-shifting event that brings together all the mediums it encompassed, brilliantly interwoven. The eccentrically made paintings suggest that Japan produced Abstract Expressionism's strongest second generation, the artists who most convincingly and directly extended Pollock's innovative drip technique. But the show reveals little-known precedents for Happenings, Minimalism and various strains of Post-Minimalism. It should permanently dislodge any notion of postwar modernism as a strictly Western phenomenon. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: The Hugo Boss Prize 2012: Danh Vo' (through May 27) Known mostly for attenuated, elliptical works, this year's Hugo Boss recipient opts for density and robustness with a display of some 4,000 items that once belonged to the artist Martin Wong (1946-99). Installed wonder-cabinet style in a shelf-lined gallery, the items range from art to artifact to tchotchkes; leap across cultures; and trickle from high to low, where racial stereotypes and kitsch frequently take over. It gives us an artist who has decided to function as a curator and an archaeologist and to keep the honor of his prize in motion. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'No Country: Contemporary Art for South and Southeast Asia' (through May 22) American museums are increasingly collecting contemporary art from outside the Western Hemisphere, and the Guggenheim, supported by the financial corporation UBS is leading the pack. This inaugural show in the acquisitions campaign highlights work from South and Southeast Asia. Certain artists -- like Amar Kanwar, from India, and Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook, from Thailand -- have international reputations. Others, like the sculptor Tang Da Wu, from Singapore, and the painter Aung Myint, Myanmar, both born in 1940s, are less familiar. Nearly all the work of the roughly two dozen artists refers in partisan, political and personal ways to specific histories. The inclusion of those histories in our art museums is long, long overdue. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter)
International Center of Photography: 'Roman Vishniac Rediscovered' (through May 5) After World War II, Roman Vishniac's widely published photographs of Orthodox Jews living in Eastern Europe in the 1930s came to signify in popular imagination the human essence of what the Nazi's genocidal program destroyed. Drawn from an archive of more than 30,000 items donated to the museum over the past two decades by his daughter, Mara Vishniac Kohn, this exhibition rounds out and fills in Vishniac's story. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Japan Society: 'Edo Pop: The Graphic Impact of Japanese Prints' (through June 9) Contemporary provocateurs could learn a thing or two from the venerable artists in ''Edo Pop,'' who mixed high and low culture in arch and urbane ways. In this show's 100 or so ukiyo-e, or color woodblock prints (drawn from the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts), valiant samurai turn out to be Kabuki actors in costume; refined landscapes depict well-trodden tourist sites; and images of classical beauties accompanied by poems are more often than not portraits of courtesans. These spirited images bring to life Edo Japan's ''floating world,'' a sort of Renaissance of popular entertainment. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Jewish Museum: 'As it were ... So to speak: A Museum Collection in Dialogue With Barbara Bloom' (through Aug. 4) Ms. Bloom, invited to organize a show from elements of the museum's collection, has turned to the Talmud for inspiration. Weaving together real and fictional narratives, historical and literary sources, she creates new and often ambiguous contexts for ceremonial and decorative objects like Torah pointers, Kiddush cups and spice containers. Somehow she manages to quote Nietzsche, Freud, Leonard Cohen, Joan Didion, the Bible and various Wikipedia entries, all without losing her own probing, skeptical voice. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'James Nares: Street' (through May 27) Far from pedestrian, this show revolves around a ravishing, 61-minute video projection by the artist James Nares. Called ''Street,'' it consists of long, slow-motion pans of people going about their business on the sidewalks and streets of New York City. To go with it, Mr. Nares combed through the museum's permanent collection and came up with a fascinating array of thematically related photographs, prints, paintings and drawings having largely to do with human and vehicular traffic. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Photography and the American Civil War' (through Sept. 2) As intellectually fascinating as it is emotionally wrenching, this exhibition is sure to be remembered as one of the great museum photography shows ever. Its more than 200 photographs include expansive images of battlefields and war-ruined towns; wallet-size portraits of soldiers; preciously framed daguerreotypes; political campaign buttons; a doctor's documents of horrifically wounded soldiers; portraits of loved ones in lockets; and a series depicting the hanging of five co-conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by the photographer Alexander Gardner. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: Impressionism, Fashion and Modernity (through May 27) The title may suggest a double-dose of pandering, but the show itself is a stunning combination of great paintings, ravishing gowns, historical clarity and pitch-perfect contextualizing. Demonstrating how the Impressionists and more conservative painters alike used the latest fashions to define their sitters as real people, it builds fascinating webs of new information and viewpoints around some of the best-known, most beloved paintings of all time, quite a few of which don't often travel to this country. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Degas, Miss La La and the Cirque Fernando' (through May 12) Viewers catching their first glimpse of ''Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando'' will tend to agree with an early Degas biographer who called the painting ''one of his most surprising canvases.'' But after a close look at this curious 1879 picture of an aerialist hanging from a rope by her teeth (on loan from the National Gallery in London, and displayed with related studies, sketchbooks, circus programs and other ephemera), they will recognize Degas's skeptical eye and classical perspective on modern entertainment. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Claes Oldenburg: The Street and the Store' and 'Claes Oldenburg: Mouse Museum, Ray Gun Wing' (through to Aug. 5) Pop Art is based on two things: ordinariness and eating. It's about daily consumption; the democratic appetite, ravenous for meat, sweets, life on the street, and getting more of everything, cheap. No artist cooked up a tastier version of the primal Pop recipe than Claes Oldenburg did in New York in the late 1950s and early '60s. The art he made in that brief, fecund time is the focus of a two-meals-for-the-price-of-one MoMA feast. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Edvard Munch: The Scream' (through April 29) A version of Edvard Munch's ''Scream'' has been on view at this museum since the fall, having come almost straight from the auction block. Protected by a Plexiglas box, like the Mona Lisa, it has been given a prominent perch opposite van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' in the fifth-floor painting and sculpture galleries. It's rare chance to get acquainted with ''The Scream'' in person and in context. The museum has built a mini-exhibition around the work, surrounding it with Munch paintings and prints that amplify its motifs and mood. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Projects 99: Meiro Koizumi' (through May 1) It would be hard to find another work of contemporary art that protests war with such soulful grace as Meiro Koizumi's ''Defect in Vision'' (2011), the main attraction of this small show. This 12-minute, black-and-white video dramatizes a final conversation between a kamikaze pilot and his wife, both of whom are blind, as they eat together in a small, old-world-style dining room. It is a riveting meditation on the doomed, myth-saturated mind of Japan's warrior class in the last days of World War II. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light' (through Aug. 12) With nearly 160 works ranging from photographs of London in the 1930s and during World War II to nearly abstract Surrealist nudes from the 1950s and '60s, this impeccable survey makes a strong if slightly over-edited argument for Brandt as one of the founders of modern photography. It sticks to vintage prints and brings a wonderful lucidity to a persistent balance of art and humanity that is, as it is frequently described: strange, mysterious and irresistible. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through Aug. 5) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera.

&#x2605; New Museum: 'NYC 1993: Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star' (through May 26) History is written by the winners, which in contemporary art usually means the market. It's often also written by people who weren't on the scene and have to take the winners' word for what happened and what mattered. Such is the case with this retrospective show that too often favors the currently best-selling survivors of a fraught era over many now less well-known on-the-ground players. There's good art here, but the spirit of a furiously skeptical utopian moment -- very high, very low -- rarely breaks through the institutional nostalgia. And the chance to probe some market myths -- exactly how political was that 1993 ''political'' Whitney Biennial? -- is lost. Like all surveys of the immediate past, ''NYC 1993'' will get everyone kvetching, and it's a must-see, if only to find ways to bring the story into the present differently. Nari Ward's 1993 installation ''Amazing Grace'' in the New Museum's next-door space is for the ages. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Radical Terrain' (through April 29) The third and last of three beautifully produced, back-to-back mini-surveys in the series Modernist Art From India, this exhibition combines landscape painting done in India in the years following independence in 1947 with recent work by young artists -- some South Asian, most not -- that corresponds to or comments on the older art. Small in size and unfamiliar in content, the show is large with history. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Blues for Smoke' (through April 28) As a musical category blues is hard to pin down, and this show makes the job harder, which seems to be its point. It's saying: blues isn't a thing; it's a set of feelings, a state of mind, maybe a state of grace. In origin, it's African-American, developing with gospel and jazz, and folding into R&B, funk and hip-hop. But it has long since become a transethnic, transcultural phenomenon bigger than music, an enveloping aesthetic that includes art. And when you have art by the likes of Zoe Leonard, Kerry James Marshall, Rachel Harrison, Martin Wong, William Pope.L, Alma Thomas, Wu Tsang and David Hammons, you cannot go wrong. Whitney Museum of American Art, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum: 'Jay DeFeo: A Retrospective' (through June 2) The American artist DeFeo, who died in 1989 at 60, is famous for a single work, a gargantuan painting -- nearly 12 feet tall -- called ''The Rose,'' which she labored on exhaustingly for eight years, even after it had been extracted out of her San Francisco studio with a forklift. In the absence of other evidence, many people tend to see the piece as the sum of her accomplishment, but to this view the Whitney's tenderly shaped and visually absorbing survey says: No. There's more, and different. ''The Rose'' may have been the pivot point of her career -- DeFeo herself said as much -- but streams of inventive, if less spectacular work, work flowed toward it and from it.

Galleries: 57th Street
&#x2605; Philip Guston: 'A Centennial Exhibition' (through April 27) On the 100th anniversary of this Abstract Expressionism best-known apostate, this large exhibition includes one of his last abstractions but concentrates on the indelible figurative work of his last decade -- the 1970s -- which did so much to inspire the painters of the 1980s. Several paintings are refreshingly unfamiliar, including ''Alfie in Small Town,'' which commemorates a placid West Highland terrier who once called this gallery home. McKee Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 688-5951, mckeegallery.com. (Smith)
Joe Zucker: 'Empire Descending a Staircase' (through April 27) This is something of a comeback show for one of the most restless and ambitious painters to emerge from the 1970s, who habitually combines eccentric painting processes with weird subject matter and weirder materials. On crumbling drywall in lush tones of gray, his latest works depict the fluted columns and capitals -- usual to important buildings since the Greeks -- in a state of collapse. You can almost see the dust rising. Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue near 57th Street, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com. (Smith)

David Diao: 'TMI' (through April 27) Postmasters, one of Chelsea's few consensus-aversive spaces, is leaving the neighborhood, and on just the right note, with a survey of work by the painter David Diao, who first showed at the gallery in 1985. In his work Mr. Daio has been teasing, rebuking, adoring and dissing the formal and institutional history of modern art for all these decades, and here we see him in action from 1991 to 2013, with wry, needle-sharp, passive-aggressive homages to Duchamp, Barnett Newman, MoMA, the current art market and himself. It's good to know that wherever Postmasters lands -- and it will -- he'll be there too. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-3323, postmastersart.com. (Cotter)
&#x2605; 'Faith Ringgold's America: Early Works and Story Quilts' (through April 27) A veritable mini-retrospective covering nearly 50 years gives some indication of the innovative and prescient ways this multitalented artist has juggled message and form, high and low, art and craft, inspirational narrative and quiet or not-so quiet fury about racial and sexual inequality. The biggest revelations are her implacable paintings from the 1960s, which blend Pop, Social Realism and several kinds of abstraction and sometimes presage current forms of language art.

&#x2605; Joshua Marsh: 'As If' and Johannes DeYoung: 'Ego Loser' (through May 4) Mr. Marsh makes uncommonly beautiful paintings of ordinary objects. With an exquisitely sensuous touch and using luminous colors, he isolates, simplifies and flattens things like pitchers, brooms and dustpans to the brink of pure yet sumptuous abstraction. Mr. DeYoung's ''Ego Loser'' is a darkly comical, claymation-style video projection in which a hideous man utters self-help and mantras from low-end sources. Jeff Bailey Gallery, 625 West 27th Street, (212) 989-0156, baileygallery.com. (Johnson)
Justin Matherly: 'All industrious people' (through April 27) The concrete casts in Mr. Matherly's first solo at Paula Cooper are modeled on stone reliefs from Mount Nemrud, an excavated temple in Turkey. Mr. Matherly seems most interested in its iconography of power transmitted through touch; his steles show the Hellenistic king Antiochus I receiving divine authority through handshakes with the gods. At the same time, a platform made of metal walkers suggests weakness and precariousness; nearby, smudged inkjet monoprints based on photographs reduce the features of the Nemrud site to blurry abstractions.

Giosetta Fioroni: 'L'Argento' (through June 3) This first American survey of Giosetta Fioroni reveals that we still have much to learn about postwar Italian art, despite recent gallery exhibitions of Lucio Fontana, Piero Manzoni, Giorgio Griffa, Gianni Colombo and Luigi Ghirri and museum shows of Michelangelo Pistoletto and Alighiero Boetti. In the silvery, evanescent paintings, drawings and films of Ms. Fioroni, who was born in Rome in 1932, we see how American Pop's celebrities and commodities took on new meanings in a post-fascist society. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Rosenberg)
Jon Kessler: 'The Web' (through April 28) With all his usual bells and whistles, as well as some new ones, Jon Kessler nimbly mocks the art world's techno-dependency in his kinetic multimedia installation ''The Web.'' It's best experienced with a smartphone or tablet in hand; visitors who download the related app will experience a kind of short-circuited social network in which shared images stay on-site instead of zooming around the Internet -- the closest thing art may have, in this moment, to a captive audience.

Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles.

Out of Town
'Albrecht Drer: Master Drawings, Watercolors, and Prints from the Albertina' (through June 9) Albrecht Drer had it all: the eye of a Raphael, the brains of a Leonardo, the looks of a cleaned-up Kurt Cobain. Traditionally, the category of great artist implies great painter, and Drer was that, though there's reason to think that he was at his most inventive, involved and expansive in his works on paper. Evidence for that argument is in this startlingly generous loan exhibition of more than 100 works on paper that includes some of his best known images. National Gallery of Art, on the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Great and Mighty Things: Outsider Art From the Jill and Sheldon Bonovitz Collection' (through June 9) One good turn generates another: the gift of a beloved, finely calibrated collection of American outsider art to a major encyclopedic museum is celebrated with an equally excellent exhibition of same. It displays around 200 paintings, sculptures, drawings and assemblages, made mostly from the 1930s to the '80s by 27 outsiders, both renowned and less prominent. All are seen here at or close to their best, pressing against the increasingly unjustifiable division between outsider and inside. 2600 Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Philadelphia, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Smith)
'Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Art and Design, 1848-1900' (through May 19) A large and well-done survey of paintings, drawings, books, furnishings, textiles and even stained glass includes such classics as John Everett Millais's ''Ophelia'' and Henry Wallis's ''Chatterton.'' It also enables a clear assessment of England's ever-popular mid-19th-century art movement, whose legacy is fittingly full of contradictions. Using brazenly modern colors, the brotherhood nonetheless turned toward the past, fashioning a nostalgic, literary, costume-heavy, clichd style that demeaned women. The best works here are the landscapes, which are unfortunately in short supply. National Gallery of Art, on the National Mall between Third and Seventh Streets NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Smith)
Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'The Civil War and American Art' (through April 28) On the surface, this probing, perspective-altering exhibition, one of many events commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, looks straightforward, even ordinary. We know most of the paintings and photographs on sight; they're classics. What we know less well is their meaning within the context of the nation's single greatest internal catastrophe, and that's what the show is about. It travels to the Metropolitan Museum of Art this spring, running from May 21 to Sept. 2. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-7970, americanart.si.edu. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'Nam June Paik: Global Visionary' (through Aug. 11) Including a large and fascinating trove of material from the Nam June Paik archive, acquired by the Smithsonian from the artist's estate in 2009, this survey of the avant-garde musician, multimedia wizard and video art pioneer (1932-2006) looks startlingly current despite the preponderance of analog televisions and other obsolete hardware. It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos.

&#x2605; Luigi Ghirri: 'Kodachrome' (closes on Saturday) The photographs of Luigi Ghirri (1943-92), as seen in this show of selections from his 1978 book, ''Kodachrome,'' sometimes bring to mind American color photography by William Eggleston and Joel Sternfeld but have a dreamier quality and a more persistent sense of artifice. Images that at first seem to be ordinary vacation shots gradually reveal an eerie obsession with symmetry. Elsewhere, ocean vistas and Alpine landscapes turn out to be restaurant murals, billboards or postcards. In the book Mr. Ghirri writes of a ''labyrinth, the walls of which are ever more illusory ... to the point at which we might merge with them.'' Matthew Marks, 526 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Rosenberg)
Miroslaw Balka: 'The Order of Things' (closes on Saturday) The single rousingly portentous sculpture here involves black liquid continually gushing from suspended, industrial-size hoses into a pair of giant bins made of rusty steel plate. Since its title refers to a book by the French philosopher Michel Foucault, you know that big ideas are afoot. Maybe it is an allegory of the mindlessly self-perpetuating machinery driving modern civilization. Something like that. Gladstone, 530 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-7606, gladstonegallery.com. (Johnson)
Judith Braun: 'May I Draw' (closes on Sunday) The small invariably symmetrical graphite drawings that dominate this exhibition are almost impossibly exquisite. Some are calligraphic; others suggest butterfly wings, spider webs or jellyfish; still others explore eccentric, subtly erotic geometric relationships. The most elaborate doubles and redoubles the artist's mantra: ''Oh May I Draw as Jane Writes,'' leaving little doubt that the Jane in question is Austen. Joe Sheftel Gallery, 24A Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 226-4900, joesheftelgallery.com. (Smith)
Paul D'Agostino: 'Twilit Ensembles' (closes on Sunday) A Manhattan gallery debut inadvertently forms a kind of David and Goliath contest. Supposedly weightier, more serious paintings and collages are outdistanced by a series of modest comical drawings in stenciled ink whose main characters are derived from paint splatters on the artist's studio floor. They deftly mine territory between Marcel Duchamp and Dr. Seuss and could be developed into children's books for adults. Pocket Utopia, 191 Henry Street, between Clinton and Jefferson Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 375-8532, pocketutopia.com. (Smith)
Mary Beth Edelson: '22 Others' (closes on Saturday) In the early 1970s Mary Beth Edelson invited some of her friends and associates to direct her in making art. Her goal, strongly influenced by feminism and Jung, was to tap into a collective unconscious. The fruits of this project, ''22 Others,'' were exhibited in 1973 in Washington at the Henri Gallery and the Corcoran Gallery of Art and have now been restaged at Suzanne Geiss. Although the works' language and imagery can seem dated, the collaborative ethos behind them feels extraordinarily fresh and generous.

&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Zarina: Paper Like Skin' (closes on Sunday) ''Paper is an organic material, almost like human skin,'' the artist Zarina Hashmi has said. In her exhibition at the Guggenheim, it's that and more: paper is sculpture, poetry, currency and, above all, a kind of permanent home for a nomadic spirit. Her art speaks poignantly, though sometimes opaquely, of relocation and exile; works like the 2001 woodcut ''Dividing Line'' reference the violent 1947 partition of India and Pakistan, while ''Ten Thousand Things,'' a set of small paper collages recreating works from her oeuvre, nods to Duchamp's museum-in-a-suitcase. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
Al Held: 'Alphabet Paintings' (closes on Saturday) Al Held (1928-2005) was one of the last and best of the big-impact abstract painters to emerge from the postwar era. ''Alphabet Paintings'' is an exhilarating show of seven paintings dating from 1961 to '67, a transitional period during which Mr. Held based compositions on simple, geometric shapes and, more remarkably, letters of the Roman alphabet. At 8  by 12 feet, ''The Yellow X'' (1965) is spectacular. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7727, cheimread.com. (Johnson)
Mary Lucier: 'New Installation Works' (closes on Saturday) Ms. Lucier's video projection ''Wisconsin Arc,'' the main attraction of this show, is a beguiling meditation on visual perception and consciousness. The three-part, 26-minute loop opens with a close-up of a glass of ice water through which you see people in the distance moving slowly left and right, and it ends with people walking on a beach in a brief scene that repeats over and over, with ghostly overlays of the same action lingering like memories. Lennon, Weinberg, 514 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 941-0012, lennonweinberg.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Path of Nature: French Paintings From the Wheelock Whitney Collection, 1785-1850' (closes on Sunday) ''Sparkle with repose'' was the effect the British artist John Constable said he was after in his landscapes. His French contemporaries had the same idea. Today, Constable's a star. But Len Pallire? Adrien Dauzats? Alexandre-Hyacinthe Dunouy? Only wonkish scholars are likely to know their names. Lucky for them, and for us, that one of those scholars is Wheelock Whitney III, who has a passion for French art from the years between Neo-Classicism and Romanticism, and a special love for gleaming little oil sketches done out of doors. In 2003 he gave his pictures to the Met, where 50 of them, along with some exquisitely funky genre paintings, make up this small gem of a show. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Drawing Surrealism' (closes on Sunday) This sensational show of 165 works by 70 artists from 15 countries traces the movement from its early automatist stirrings to the doorstep of Abstract Expressionism. Expanding the field of players with numerous new names, it also has a wonderful clarity, organized according to the techniques that the Surrealists commandeered (collage and photography), breathed life into (frottage, decalcomania and exquisite corpse) and frequently crossbred. It may be among the best encapsulations of Surrealism you will ever see. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Smith)
Neue Galerie: 'German Expressionism 1900-1930: Masterpieces From the Neue Galerie Collection' (closes on Monday) German Expressionism was a messy, complicated movement, with numerous stylistic and philosophical variations. It's not easily corralled into a tidy overview, despite the best efforts of the Neue Galerie in this collection show. The installation sorts everything into two groups, using the rubrics of ''primitivism'' and ''modernity.'' ''Primitivism'' seems to mean the gallery of jarringly bright, vigorously brushy paintings by members of the Brcke and the Blaue Reiter; under ''modernity'' are Neue Sachlichkeit portraits by Otto Dix, George Grosz, Christian Schad and others, made with caustic humor and an eye for the grotesque. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Khalil Rabah: 'Pages, 7, 8, 9' (closes on Saturday) Some years ago, Khalil Rabah, a Palestinian artist born in Jerusalem in 1961, founded the fictional Palestinian Museum of Natural History and Humankind. It was, and remains, an ambitious institution, with departments of geology, paleontology, anthropology and botany, all represented in this show by a back edition of its summer 2011 newsletter in the form of large paintings. Like the real-fake museum itself, the newsletter is funny, mournful, bitter, perverse, pro-nationalist, anti-nationalist, illusion-deflating, consciousness-raising, politically piercing, and free. E-flux, 311 East Broadway, at Grand Street, (212) 619-3356, e-flux.com. (Cotter)
Saya Woolfalk: 'Chimera' (closes on Thursday) A West African masquerade version of Mozart's ''Magic Flute,'' with Tibetan tantric overlays, might look something like a Saya Woolfalk installation. Ms. Woolfalk has created her own society of mythological beings called the Empathics, who not only blend racial and ethnic differences, but also dissolve the line between humans and plants. These sculptural figures, with their blossom heads, are fantastic but, as with all fundamentally spiritual art, a complex moral thread runs through the fantasy.

HEADLINE: A Profit at Morgan Stanley, but Investors Have Doubts

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
8:11 p.m. | Updated
Morgan Stanley shareholders have been awaiting a turnaround at the bank. On Thursday, some decided they could not wait any longer.
Shares of Morgan Stanley tumbled 5.4 percent, falling to their lowest level since January, after the bank's quarterly results showed a sharp drop in trading revenue.
Yet earnings for the first quarter were stronger than Wall Street analysts had expected. Indeed, the quarterly results underscored the progress the bank has made in building its wealth management division, as well as the continued drag from the fixed-income business. 
''Morgan Stanley is like a team changing sports, and the sport they are leaving didn't do so well, but the one they are going to did,'' said Chris Grisanti, the owner and co-founder of Grisanti Capital Management, which owns shares of Morgan Stanley. ''However, I think now there is some doubt in the market about their ability to make this transition.''
Revenue from trading bonds, commodities and currencies fell 42 percent, to $1.5 billion from the year-ago period. That was decidedly worse than rivals like Goldman Sachs, which had a drop in fixed-income trading of just 7 percent.
The first quarter was a challenging one for most banks, particularly in March as investor concern rose over a prolonged federal budget impasse in the United States and the health of Europe's economies. Morgan Stanley, though, seemed to be affected more than other Wall Street banks.
Since the financial crisis, Morgan Stanley has been working to reduce the size of its fixed-income department, cutting staff and selling assets. The department had been the source of trading losses, and Morgan Stanley's chief executive, James P. Gorman, has been trying to shift the bank out of riskier businesses to less volatile areas like wealth management.
Richard Bove, an analyst with Rafferty Capital Markets, said that Morgan Stanley's decision to shrink the fixed-income business meant that not only was it losing talented traders, it was not attracting as many as it used to. As a result, it will be hard for Morgan Stanley to keep up with competitors.
''Most investors are unhappy with the fact this company was not able to grow its trading activity as much as its peers and as a result they perceive there is a significant problem at the company and are pulling away from the stock,'' he said.
Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, said she was surprised by the severity of Thursday's stock drop.
She said while there was certainly room for improvement in the earnings, investors needed to keep in mind that the bank had a strong first quarter in 2012, so that in comparison the decline in trading revenue appeared worse than it really was.
''I am not saying $1.5 billion is as good as it can be, but we are continuing that steady progress we have always talk about,'' Ms. Porat said, noting the bank had strong sequential revenue growth over the last year and continued to sell risky assets.
Morgan Stanley earned a profit, adjusted for accounting charges, of $1 billion, or 50 cents a share. That compares with a loss of $79 million in the period a year earlier. The one-time charges were related to the bank's credit spreads. Excluding the charges, the bank had a profit of $1.2 billion, or 61 cents a share, a decline from the $1.4 billion reported in the first quarter of 2012.
Morgan Stanley's adjusted revenue for the three months ended March 31 fell to $8.5 billion, from $8.9 billion in the period a year earlier. Analysts forecast revenue of $8.35 billion.
Return on equity, a measure of how efficiently shareholder money is being deployed, fell to 7.6 percent from 9.2 percent in the year-ago period
Excluding charges related to the bank's credit spreads, known as debt valuation adjustments, net revenue in institutional securities, which houses the fixed-income department, was $4.4 billion, compared with $5.1 billion in the period a year earlier.
Revenue from trading commodities and rates fell in the quarter. The decline in revenue from trading interest rates came despite a decision to take more risk over the last year. In rates and credit spreads, the bank's quarterly value at risk -- a yardstick of how much could be lost in one trading day -- was $61 million, up from $46 million in the year-ago period.
The bright spot in Morgan Stanley's earnings was its wealth management division, led by Gregory Fleming. It posted pretax income from continuing operations of $597 million, up 48 percent from the $403 million reported in the first quarter of last year.
One number investors were watching, the division's pretax profit margin, came in at 17 percent, higher than some analysts had projected. Net revenue in wealth management rose to $3.5 billion from $3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2012.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The title of Vali Nasr's provocative and uneven new book, ''The Dispensable Nation: American Foreign Policy in Retreat,'' plays on President Bill Clinton's description of the United States as the world's one ''indispensable nation.'' Mr. Nasr -- who was a senior adviser to Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan (AfPak) -- suggests in this sharply critical volume that the foreign policy pursued under Mr. Obama has diminished America's leadership role in the world.
To our allies, Mr. Nasr writes, ''our constant tactical maneuvers don't add up to a coherent strategy or a vision of global leadership. Gone is the exuberant American desire to lead in the world. In its place there is the image of a superpower tired of the world and in retreat, most visibly from the one area of the world where it has been most intensely engaged,'' the Middle East. 
Mr. Nasr does not grapple here with how the Bush administration's aggressive, pre-emptive policies led the United States into a costly and unnecessary war in Iraq, and he also fails to provide a convincing and detailed assessment of just how the developments of the Arab Spring might have been more cogently handled by the Obama administration.
What Mr. Nasr's book, at its best, does do is shed light on the heated infighting within the Obama administration, particularly between the White House and the State Department, adding new details and insights to dynamics previously chronicled in news reports and books like ''Little America,'' by Rajiv Chandrasekaran; ''The Obamians,'' by James Mann; and ''Obama's Wars,'' by Bob Woodward.
Mr. Nasr offers his own thoughts about one of the most watched relationships in modern politics, the pas de deux of former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and President Obama: he asserts that had it not been for Mrs. Clinton's personal connection with the president and her tenacity, ''the State Department would have had no influence on policy making whatsoever.''
He also fleshes out our understanding of the contentious relationship that developed between Mr. Holbrooke and the White House, which was the result of turf wars, philosophical differences, a clash of personalities (the brash, sometimes swashbuckling style of Mr. Holbrooke crashing up against the ''no drama'' style favored by President Obama and many of his aides) and differing ideas about how to bring the war in Afghanistan to a close.
It was a rivalry, Mr. Chandrasekaran argued in ''Little America,'' that ''sabotaged America's best chance for a peace deal to end the war'' there. Mr. Holbrooke became ill during a meeting in Mrs. Clinton's office on Dec. 10, 2010, and despite surgery to repair a tear to his aorta, died a few days later.
In this book Mr. Nasr contends that ''the White House campaign against the State Department, and especially Holbrooke, was at times a theater of the absurd. Holbrooke was not included in Obama's video conferences'' with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, ''and was cut out of the presidential retinue when Obama went to Afghanistan.''
''The White House,'' Mr. Nasr says, ''resented losing AfPak to the State Department,'' and ''that was one big reason'' it was ''on a warpath with Holbrooke -- he was in their way and kept the State Department in the mix on an important foreign policy area.'' Mr. Holbrooke, he goes on, ''would not cede ground to the White House, not when he thought those who wanted to wrest control of Afghanistan were out of their depth and not up to the job.''
Mr. Nasr describes Mr. Holbrooke (who oversaw the 1995 Dayton peace accords that ended the war in Bosnia) as ''a brilliant strategic thinker in the same league as such giants of American diplomacy as Averell Harriman and Henry Kissinger.'' And he uses his own in-depth knowledge of the geopolitics of the Middle East to make an impassioned case for many of Mr. Holbrooke's diplomatic initiatives and ideas, which often failed to find traction within the White House.
In these pages Mr. Nasr -- who is now dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Washington -- writes about Mr. Holbrooke's pressing for reconciliation talks with the Taliban early on, when, in Mr. Nasr's words, ''our leverage was at its strongest -- when we had the maximum number of troops on the ground in Afghanistan,'' and before troop withdrawal plans were announced.
Mr. Nasr also writes thoughtfully about Mr. Holbrooke's understanding of the regional dynamics of the Middle East and South Asia. He discusses Mr. Holbrooke's belief that lasting political solutions could be forged not by military means alone but through a combination of leverage and diplomacy involving all the stakeholders in the region (including countries like Iran and India), and his conviction that such diplomacy included engagement on issues of long-term social and economic interest to individual countries.
The problem with this book is that its genuinely interesting analyses are often undermined by Mr. Nasr's certainty about matters that are subject to an incalculable number of variables; his vitriolic anger at the Obama White House; and his penchant for making overly broad, sometimes willfully alarmist generalizations.
Mr. Nasr asserts that the president was ''very concerned with shielding his right flank so as not to open himself to right-wing criticism,'' then goes on to declare that ''it is not going too far to say that American foreign policy had become completely subservient to tactical domestic political considerations.''
He writes that the administration's current policy toward Iran (its assumptions and strategy are now ''hardly distinguishable,'' he says, ''from those of the Bush White House'') will ''eventually turn Iran into a failed state'' that will ''pose a new set of security challenges to the region and the United States.'' And he argues that the Obama administration's ''pivot to Asia'' policy and what he sees as its neglect and mismanagement of the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan and the unspooling fallout of the Arab Spring are simply pushing that vital region ''further into China's bosom.''
One nightmarish possibility envisioned by Mr. Nasr goes like this: in a couple of decades, ''China and Russia will have gobbled up Central Asia, cornered Europe's energy markets, and planted themselves smack in the middle of the Middle East. They will have emerged as global giants challenging America's place in the world and perhaps the primacy of the U.S. dollar as the currency of international exchange. And once that happens, it will be all but impossible to reverse. We would then face global threats, threats on a scale we encountered during the cold war, threats that dwarf whatever danger Iran can ever pose.''
Mr. Nasr makes some persuasive arguments for more concerted diplomatic and economic engagement on the part of the United States around the globe, though his observations about America's essential role on the world stage owe a lot to those set out by Zbigniew Brzezinski in his astute 2012 book, ''Strategic Vision: America and the Crisis of Global Power.''
When it comes to specifics, Mr. Nasr's recommendations can sound vague or unrealistic. For instance, he writes that ''solving the problems of the Middle East and the threat they pose to the world requires a fundamental change in the region's economic profile,'' and the ''international community would have to make a sizable investment -- a Marshall Plan in scale -- to bring about change of that magnitude.''
He acknowledges that this is problematic, given the economic difficulties America faces today, but in another chapter complains that our settling ''for doing so much less'' -- in Egypt -- ''than we did after 1989 in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America speaks volumes about our disengagement from the region. If the potential for democracy held by the Arab Spring was not enough to compel our engagement, it is not clear what would be.''
In the end, Mr. Nasr's eagerness to see virtually every action taken by the Obama administration on foreign policy through as dark a glass as possible distracts attention from his many valid criticisms, and from his thought-provoking assessments of how developments across the Middle East and South Asia today -- in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Libya and Syria -- are intertwined historically, economically and politically in a fantastically complicated puzzle that has no easy or straightforward solutions.

HEADLINE: The Second Wave

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Liberals are furious, but the gun issue will not significantly damage the Republican Party. Sure, it looks bad to oppose background checks, which have overwhelming popular support. Sure, the Republican position will further taint the party's image in places like the suburbs of Philadelphia and Northern Virginia. Sure, the party looks extreme when it can't accept a bill sponsored by the conservative Senator Joe Manchin and the very conservative Senator Pat Toomey.
But, let's face it, the gun issue has its own unique dynamic, which is that the people who oppose gun limits vote on this issue while the people who support them do not. 
Moreover, Democrats never made a compelling case that the bill would have been effective, that it would have directly prevented future Sandy Hooks or lowered the murder rate nationwide. Even many of the bill's supporters were lukewarm about its contents.
The main reason the gun issue won't significantly harm Republicans is that it doesn't play into the core debate that will shape the future of the party. The issue that does that is immigration. The near-term future of American politics will be determined by who wins the immigration debate.
In the months since the election, a rift has opened between the Republicans you might call first-wave revolutionaries and those you might call second-wave revolutionaries. The first-wave revolutionaries (the party's Congressional leaders) think of themselves as very conservative. They ejected the remaining moderates from their ranks. They sympathize with the Tea Party. They are loyal to Fox News and support a radical restructuring of the government.
These first-wave revolutionaries haven't softened their conservatism, but they are trying to adjust it to win majority support. They are trying to find policies to boost social mobility, so Republicans look less like the party of the rich. They are swinging behind immigration reform, believing that Hispanics won't even listen to Republicans until they put that issue in the rearview mirror.
The second-wave revolutionaries -- like Rand Paul (on some issues), Jim DeMint, Ted Cruz and some of the cutting-edge talk radio jocks -- see the first-wave revolutionaries as a bunch of incompetent establishmentarians. They speak of the Bush-Cheney administration as if it were some sort of liberal Republican regime run by Nelson Rockefeller and Jacob Javits. They argue that Republicans have lost elections recently because the party has been led by big-spending, mushy moderates like John McCain and Mitt Romney and managed by out-of-touch elitists like Karl Rove and Reince Priebus.
The second wavers are much more tactically aggressive, favoring filibusters and such when possible. What the party needs now, they argue, is an ultra-Goldwaterite insurgency that topples the ''establishment,'' ditches immigration reform and wins Hispanic votes by appealing to the evangelicals among them and offering them economic liberty.
The first and second wavers are just beginning their immigration clash. A few weeks ago, I would have thought the pro-immigration forces had gigantic advantages, but now it is hard to be sure.
The immigration fight will be pitting a cohesive insurgent opposition force against a fragile coalition of bipartisan proponents who have to ambivalently defend a sprawling piece of compromise legislation. We've seen this kind of fight before. Things usually don't end up well for the proponents.
Whether it's guns or immigration, it is easy to imagine that the underlying political landscape, which prevented progress in the past, has changed. But when you actually try to pass something, you often discover the underlying landscape has not changed. The immigration fight of 2013 might bear an eerie similarity to the fight of 2007.
The arguments that might persuade Republicans to support immigration reform are all on the table. They came on election night 2012. The arguments against are only just now unfolding.
It is just a fact that the big short-term beneficiaries of this law are not generally Republicans: the 11 million who are living in the shadows; the high-tech entrepreneurs who will get more skilled labor. The short-term losers, meanwhile, are often Republicans: the white working-class people who will face a new group of labor-market competition when they try to get jobs in retail; the taxpayers who, at least in the short term, will have to pay some additional costs.
In the past, Republican politicians have had trouble saying no to the latest and most radical insurgency. Even if they know immigration reform is eventually good for their party, lawmakers may figure that opposing it is immediately necessary for themselves.
It would be great if Republicans can hash out their differences over a concrete policy matter, especially immigration, which touches conservatism's competing values. But if the insurgent right defeats immigration reform, that will be a sign that the party's self-marginalization will continue. The revolution devours its own.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Data Signals Tepid Growth

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week and factory activity in the nation's mid-Atlantic region cooled in April, providing further signs of a moderation in economic growth. 
Underscoring the softening growth outlook, another report on Thursday showed that a gauge of future economic activity fell in March for the first time in seven months. These reports are the latest to indicate a step back in the economy after a brisk start to the year as tighter fiscal policy began to set in.
''The evidence is mounting that the economy lost momentum in March and that has carried to April,'' said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics.
Economic reports for January and February have suggested that growth accelerated in the first quarter after activity almost stalled in the final three months of 2012.
But in a replay of the previous two years, the economy appears to have hit a speed bump at the end of the quarter, with data like employment, retail sales and manufacturing weakening significantly in March.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 352,000, the Labor Department said. The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labor market trends, rose 2,750, to 361,250.
While claims rose last week, they were still at levels that economists normally associate with average monthly job gains of more than 150,000. That helped ease concerns of a deterioration in labor market conditions after employment had its smallest increase in nine months in March. Employers added 88,000 workers to their payrolls last month after a solid 268,000 increase in February.
''Labor market conditions still appear to be grinding forward, but pushing against the weight of a slowing economy and subdued confidence,'' said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors.
In separate report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its business activity index fell to 1.3 in April from a reading of 2.0 in March. A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing.
Details of the survey, which covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, were weak. Measures of factory employment and new orders contracted.
Inventories fell sharply after being flat in March, an indication that stock accumulation will not contribute to growth in the second quarter. Inventories are expected to have significantly increased output in the first three months of 2013.
''This report has to raise some concerns that the nation's manufacturing sector may be starting to feel the impact of the higher taxes on households and the cutbacks in government spending,'' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors.
A third report supported views that the economy was again headed for a soft patch this spring. The Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators slipped 0.1 percent to 94.7 last month, the first drop since August.
The data provides ammunition for the Federal Reserve to maintain its aggressive policy easing, despite a rift among policy makers on continuing asset purchases.
''Growth is continuing but a spring slowdown looks to be in place. The numbers support the view of many at the Fed that the end of the liquidity surge is nowhere in sight,'' Mr. Naroff said.

HEADLINE: Fate of the Immigration Bill May Hinge on Farm Districts

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Any chance of getting immigration legislation through the House will most likely depend on representatives like Doc Hastings.
While he has not been the most outspoken about immigration issues, proponents of an overhaul are counting on Mr. Hastings, a Republican, for one reason: His Congressional district, which cuts a wide path through the center of Washington State, depends heavily on agriculture, an industry with a significant stake in the outcome of the debate.
Much of Washington's $46 billion agriculture sector is in Mr. Hastings's district, where farmers grow everything from apples to wheat. Local agribusinesses there rely on a work force largely composed of immigrants, thousands of whom are believed to be in the country illegally. 
A coalition of 11 agriculture groups has launched a major lobbying campaign in support of an immigration overhaul. Members of the effort, known as the Agricultural Workforce Coalition, see representatives from districts where thousands of jobs depend on agriculture as key to any effort to pass the legislation.
Agriculture Department data shows that Republicans represent 17 of the top 20 districts where agriculture is a major industry. And farm groups are hoping that local concerns will trump national politics as the legislation moves forward in the Republican-controlled House, where it will most likely face a tough challenge from conservatives who have been hostile to previous attempts to change the system.
''Republicans from big agriculture districts will definitely be the deciding factor in getting any type of immigration reform through the House,'' said Dean Norton, a dairy farmer who is president of the New York Farm Bureau. ''There is a lot of clamoring in these districts to do something about immigration.''
Mr. Hastings has not said if he would support the immigration legislation introduced in the Senate, but he has backed efforts to help the farm sector in the past.
Neal Kirby, Mr. Hastings's spokesman, said the congressman ''has long advocated for a guest worker program for agriculture that is workable and will provide central Washington farmers with the legal work force they need to fill jobs that Americans are not'' willing to do.
''Developing a workable program as a part of immigration reform is critical to central Washington's economy,'' he said.
The farm sector has been a core constituency of the Republican Party for many years. Campaign contribution data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington research group, shows that since 1990, agriculture interests have mostly given to Republicans in Congress.
Last year, farm-heavy districts voted overwhelmingly for Mitt Romney. Tom Nassif, president of the Western Growers, and Chuck Conners, president of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, two of the organizations pushing for immigration legislation, were advisers to Mr. Romney during the campaign.
Agriculture's main focus is on changing the H-2A visa program, which allows fruit and vegetable growers, slaughterhouses and other agribusinesses to hire temporary workers for jobs that cannot be filled by Americans.
The system allows foreign workers to enter the country on a visa for no longer than one year.
But agriculture officials say the current system does not work because industries like dairy farming and meat production are year-round enterprises and are unable to fill their need for workers. They also say the program is overly bureaucratic.
Among the changes the farm sector wants to see is the replacement of the seasonal visa program with one that would allow workers to accept a job under a three-year visa.
The agriculture groups, which lobbied heavily on Capitol Hill as a group of senators worked to draft an immigration bill, say they will soon began a similar campaign in the House.
''We will bring the weight of growers in all 50 states to the Senate and the House in support of this legislation,'' said Tom Stenzel, chief executive of the United Fresh Produce Association, a trade group of fruit and vegetable growers.
Despite high unemployment in Mr. Hastings's Washington district, growers and other farm interests there say they still suffer from worker shortages because of current immigration laws.
Mr. Kirby, Mr. Hastings's spokesman, said the congressman had met with the farm lobbying coalition and had been in contact with growers. ''This has been a longtime priority of Congressman Hastings,'' he said.

HEADLINE: I.B.M., Missing Estimates, Falters as Slow Hardware Sales Hurt Revenue and Profits

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. stumbled in the first quarter, as economic uncertainty and a falloff in its hardware business pulled both profits and revenue down.
In the past, the company's cost-cutting discipline and a steady shift toward higher-profit offerings have enabled it to keep earnings steaming ahead, surpassing Wall Street's forecasts, even during the recession. Revenue growth has long been modest, but nothing like the falloff in the first quarter, down 5 percent, to $23.4 billion compared with the year-ago period. Net income was off 1 percent, to $3 billion.
''This is very uncharacteristic,'' said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''We're seeing I.B.M. struggle.'' 
The question, analysts say, is whether the company is facing a temporary setback or whether its hardware business might be a drag on revenue and profits for a while.
In a conference call, Mark Loughridge, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, said that the quarter ended far weaker than it began, and that some anticipated mainframe and software deals failed to close. ''We're not immune from the global economy,'' he said, but largely attributed the slump to a sales ''execution problem.''
I.B.M. is the largest supplier of information technology -- hardware, software and services -- to corporations and government agencies worldwide, and its results are watched as a guide to broader trends in business technology spending.
The once-hot China market, Mr. Loughridge said, grew by ''a disappointing 1 percent.'' The recent change in Chinese leadership, he said, may have brought an investment pause as national and local plans are fine-tuned.
But he said parts of the hardware business are facing a longer transition. The mainframe division, he said, is healthy. The troubles seem to be in units that sell industry-standard data center computers, typically powered by Intel chips, and larger data center computers that use I.B.M.'s Power chips.
To cut costs, he said, I.B.M. planned to take most of $1 billion yearly in charges to trim the payroll in the current quarter. He said most of the affected workers would be outside the United States.
I.B.M.'s earnings results fell short of analysts' estimates, for the first time since 2005.
The profit performance was 5 cents below expectations of $3.05 a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. Operating earnings rose 8 percent to $3 a share, compared with $2.78 a share last year; these earnings typically surpass the net income results because I.B.M. spends billions each year buying its own shares, so there are fewer.
Revenue for the quarter declined to $23.4 billion, held down by the continuing economic weakness in some markets and a stronger dollar. Its revenue fell below the Wall Street forecast of $24.7 billion.
In after-hours trading, I.B.M. shares were down 4.2 percent to $198.45 a share. During the regular session, when stock prices fell in general and before I.B.M. reported earnings, its shares closed at $207.15, off $2.52, or 1.2 percent.
Businesses that I.B.M. has earmarked for growth performed robustly. For example, its so-called Smarter Planet division, which sells mainly software and services to governments and companies to streamline product distribution, reduce energy consumption and manage traffic, rose more than 25 percent.
But growth units could not offset weak demand elsewhere. Revenue for its big services business, which accounts for half of I.B.M.'s revenue, was down 4 percent. Its software business was flat for the quarter, while hardware sales fell 17 percent.
Analysts say the hardware problem could point to a structural shift as companies tap computing resources from remote data centers run by others -- so-called cloud computing -- instead of building out their own data centers. Still, I.B.M. reported that its own cloud computing unit grew more than 70 percent.

HEADLINE: Rising Tensions With Russia

BYLINE: By DENIS CORBOY, WILLIAM COURTNEY and KENNETH YALOWITZ

 BODY:
Russia's relations with the West are again plunging. This time the cause is repression in Russia and the Western reaction to it. Last time it was the invasion of Georgia in 2008, and before that NATO expansion to the east. Unless the West develops an enduring and resilient strategy toward Russia, the deterioration in ties may be prolonged.
Popular support for President Vladimir Putin and his semi-authoritarian rule is ebbing. In late 2011 he began facing large demonstrations against his government. Polls by the respected Levada Center show that although 64 percent of respondents support Putin, 55 percent want him to leave office in 2018 when his third term ends. The head of the National Anti-Corruption Committee says corruption amounts to $300 billion annually. 
Seemingly unnerved by the opposition, Putin is responding with repression. Last May the police beat participants in a Moscow demonstration. Fearing a democratic ''color revolution'' -- as Georgia and Ukraine experienced in the mid-2000s -- Putin arranged for a law that requires civil society groups to register as foreign ''agents.'' The authorities are raiding their offices.
In December, a U.S. law provided for sanctions on those responsible for the punishment and death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who was investigating official corruption, and for other gross violations of human rights in Russia. Putin then banned U.S. adoptions of Russian children, leaving thousands of orphans stranded.
Political show trials, a Soviet relic, seem to be resuming. This week Alexei Navalny, an opposition leader, went on trial on trumped-up charges of embezzling timber from a state company. Demonstrators from last May 6 are being threatened with years in prison or psychiatric confinement, another Soviet-era punishment.
Putin's retrograde steps mask deeper troubles. Educated elites are alienated by the turn toward authoritarian rule, even if they have yet to organize an effective democratic opposition.
Discrimination against Muslim and ethnic minorities is a cancer. Putin adds to concerns by tacking closer to the Russian Orthodox Church. With the prospect of a declining population, the economy needs increasing numbers of migrant laborers from Central Asia and the Caucasus, yet they face frequent mistreatment. Last year, according to the Sova Center in Moscow, the level of xenophobia and radical nationalism in Russia remained high: Hate attacks left 19 people dead and injured 187.
Putin's nationalization of certain key industries combined with his anti-American posturing erodes the investment climate. The economy is at risk because of high dependence on oil and gas exports, earnings from which may drop as productivity declines in older West Siberian oil fields and competition for gas export markets sharpens amid rising world production. Western trade and investment is needed.
Russia's difficulties with the West are spreading. Last week hundreds demonstrated during Putin's visit to Germany, and Chancellor Angela Merkel had sharp words on human rights. In the Cyprus banking crisis, the West was unwilling to ease difficulties for Russian depositors, many of whom were suspected of laundering ill-gotten gains.
How can relations with Russia be put on a more stable footing? The answer lies in implementing consistent and sustainable policies.
Pragmatic cooperation must continue. Examples are lessening nuclear dangers, operating the International Space Station and developing the Arctic. In Moscow this week the U.S. national security adviser, Thomas Donilon, registered dismay over human rights abuses while encouraging progress on common interests.
Western support for the security of Russia's neighbors reduces risks of the destabilizing effects of overreach by the Kremlin. After a Russian cyberattack on Estonia in 2007, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization placed a major cyberdefense center there. Last year, when Moscow warned that putting NATO missile defenses in Poland would cause Russia to base new nuclear missiles in Kaliningrad, the West objected and reassured Poland of its support.
Consistent Western support for human rights and political freedoms is critical. The West should expose political show trials, find creative ways to aid besieged civil society groups, and help Internet users circumnavigate censorship.
The West ought to continue backing Russia's international economic engagement, such as its new World Trade Organization membership, but on the same basis as it does for other nations. Holding Russia to accepted standards while providing technical assistance will send the right signal.
The West is in for a difficult period with Russia. It must combine principles with realism. The Russians will determine the pace of their democratic evolution, but the West can help by nurturing collaboration while keeping faith with those who seek a more open Russia.

William Courtney was U.S. ambassador to Kazakhstan and Georgia, and special assistant to the president for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia. Kenneth Yalowitz served as U.S. ambassador to Belarus and Georgia.

HEADLINE: Monetary Fund Chief Warns Against '3-Speed' Recovery

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY; Nicola Clark contributed reporting from Paris.

 BODY:
Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, called for moving the world into a ''full-speed recovery'' at a news conference on Thursday at the opening of the fund's annual spring meetings with its sister institution, the World Bank.
Ms. Lagarde, echoing an earlier warning, expressed concern about what she called a ''three-speed'' global economy, with developing nations growing rapidly, the United States healing faster than most other advanced industrial countries, but Europe continuing to suffer from insufficient demand and incomplete government policies. 
''It's not the healthiest recovery,'' Ms. Lagarde said. But ''we believe that we have avoided the worst, and the economic world no longer looks quite as dangerous as it did.''
She added: ''The pickup in financial conditions, financial markets, is clearly not translating into a sustained pickup in growth and jobs.''
The news conference came shortly after news broke that a French court had ordered Ms. Lagarde to appear at a hearing on her handling of a financial scandal during her time as finance minister in Paris.
Asked about the affair at the news conference, Ms. Lagarde said that she had known of the possibility of being interviewed by the investigative commission for years. ''There is nothing new under the sun,'' Ms. Lagarde said, dismissing any concerns that the inquiry would affect her position as the head of the I.M.F. ''I will be very happy to travel for a couple of days to Paris. I look forward to it.''
The investigation, which led to a police raid of Ms. Lagarde's apartment in Paris last month, concerns her decision in 2007 to refer to an arbitration panel a decades-old dispute between Bernard Tapie, a wealthy friend of France's president at the time, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the state-owned bank Crdit Lyonnais. The panel ultimately brokered a settlement that awarded Mr. Tapie, the flamboyant former owner of the Olympique Marseille soccer team, about $580 million, including interest.
The court's summons of Ms. Lagarde could lead to the opening of a formal investigation of her role in the affair. But in France, being placed under formal investigation does not necessarily lead to charges and does not imply a presumption of guilt. Ms. Lagarde has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the Tapie matter.
At the news conference, Ms. Lagarde gave her blessing to recent actions taken by the Bank of Japan to help bolster growth. She also said that the European Central Bank had more room to aid the recovery in Europe, where many countries are still undergoing economic contraction, unemployment is still rising and the credit markets remain broken.
''Of all the major central banks in the world, the E.C.B. is the only one who clearly still has room to maneuver,'' Ms. Lagarde said.
Asked if Spain needed more time for fiscal adjustment, Ms. Lagarde replied that it did. She added that the country needed to put a budget-tightening plan in motion, but that it need not be ''upfront, heavy duty'' fiscal consolidation.
At a separate news conference, Jim Yong Kim, the head of the World Bank, which focuses on economic development, laid out his vision for a ''two-pronged approach for a world free of poverty.''
Dr. Kim has called for eradicating extreme poverty by 2030 and for fostering income growth for the bottom 40 percent in every country. ''For that second goal,'' he said, ''we also mean sharing prosperity across generations, and that calls for bold action on climate change.''

HEADLINE: Officials in Israel Stress Readiness for a Lone Strike on Iran

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- With Chuck Hagel scheduled to begin his first visit to Israel as secretary of defense on Sunday, Israeli defense and military officials issued explicit warnings this week that Israel was prepared and had the capability to carry out a lone military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also spoke of dealing with the Iranian nuclear threat in an interview with the BBC broadcast on Thursday. Israel has ''different vulnerabilities and different capabilities'' from the United States, he said. ''We have to make our own calculations, when we lose the capacity to defend ourselves by ourselves.'' 
Israeli officials have been expressing growing frustration with what they view as ineffective international efforts to halt what Israel and the West see as an Iranian quest for nuclear weapons. Despite economic sanctions and rounds of diplomatic talks, the officials say, the Iranian centrifuges continue to spin.
Yuval Steinitz, Israel's minister of strategic and intelligence affairs and international relations, said in an interview that Iran was abusing the diplomatic process to further its uranium enrichment program and that it was ''high time'' for the international community to issue Iran ''a deadline or a timetable, or even a military threat.''
Iran, according to Mr. Steinitz, is about halfway to reaching the ''red line'' that Mr. Netanyahu drew on a cartoonlike diagram of a bomb before the United Nations last fall, representing the amount of medium-enriched uranium it would need to build a bomb. Iran has denied it intends to build a nuclear weapon and has said that it needs the enriched uranium for energy and medical uses.
The chief of staff of Iran's armed forces, Maj. Gen. Hassan Firouzabadi, on Thursday dismissed Israel's threats as bluster that should not be taken seriously. Speaking on the sidelines of the Army Day parade in Tehran, he added that the United States would be deterred by Iran's military might and not enter into war with it, according to the state-controlled Islamic Republic News Agency.
Though Mr. Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders have continuously emphasized Israel's right to defend itself by its own means, talk of possible action has been rare in recent months. Israel, during this time, has sought to lower tensions with the United States over Israel's calls for red lines and in the face of vehement American opposition to an uncoordinated Israeli strike.
Ehud Barak, Israel's defense minister until last month, quietly dropped his aggressive stance, focusing instead on the need to cooperate with Washington. President Shimon Peres spoke out openly against the idea of a lone Israeli strike, saying that the limited damage that Israel could inflict meant that it had to ''proceed together with America.''
Secretary of State John Kerry sought to reassure the Israelis during a visit this month, pledging that the United States would stand with Israel against the Iranian threat ''and as the president has said many times, he doesn't bluff.''
Israel's new defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, said in a speech for Independence Day on Tuesday that Israel should not lead the campaign against Iran, a role better left to the United States and the West. But he added that Israel could be the first target of a nuclear Iran, and that Israel ''should prepare for the possibility that it will have to defend itself by its own means.''
Mr. Yaalon, a former military chief of staff who served in the last government as the minister of strategic affairs, is said by officials and experts to have been generally cautious on Iran. But Amos Yadlin, the former military intelligence chief who now directs the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, wrote of Mr. Yaalon in an article last month, ''The defense minister is known to believe that an attack on Iran is less dangerous than an Iran with military nuclear capability.''
Israel's current military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz, said in an Independence Day interview with Ynet, a Hebrew news Web site, ''We have the ability to cope with the danger that Iran poses to us, and permit me not to get dragged into the operational details.''
Asked by Israel Radio whether the Israeli military had the ability to attack Iran's nuclear facilities alone if there was no other choice, General Gantz replied, ''Unequivocally, yes.''
Prof. Efraim Inbar, director of the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University, said in an interview that the Israeli statements ''echoed the mood of the country'' in the same week that it marked Remembrance Day for its fallen soldiers and celebrated 65 years of independence. But he said the statements could also be seen as ''signaling Israel's displeasure with international efforts to block progress on the Iranian nuclear program'' ahead of Mr. Hagel's visit.
As for whether the statements were an indication of Israeli intentions or were meant to goad world leaders into more action, Professor Inbar said: ''I don't know. It could be both.''
Mr. Steinitz, the minister of strategic affairs, argued that it was easier to intercept a nuclear project at the enrichment phase than after a decision to actually to build a bomb. Assembling a bomb might take several more months, ''but this can be done in a little room like this office,'' he said. ''It is very hard to detect and supervise. Once the Iranians have completed enrichment, they are actually on the verge of a bomb.''
''We have to learn a lesson from what happened with North Korea,'' Mr. Steinitz added. ''To think that fanatic regimes will be rational when they have nuclear weapons -- such fanatic regimes cannot be trusted.''
He said Mr. Netanyahu's red line translated into about 250 to 300 kilograms of uranium (or about 550 to 660 pounds) enriched to 20 percent.
''They abuse the diplomatic process to get closer,'' he said of the Iranians. ''Instead of giving up they take another step -- sometimes a little step, sometimes a bigger one.''

Full reviews of recent jazz performances: nytimes.com/jazz. A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.
&#x2605; Darcy James Argue and Secret Society (Saturday) A composer who understands the grainy particulars behind a sweeping gesture, Mr. Argue has been gaining momentum over the last few years with the Secret Society, his flagship orchestra. Ten days before the release of the group's second album -- ''Brooklyn Babylon'' (New Amsterdam), a distillation of his recent work for the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music -- Mr. Argue and crew return there to perform under more casual conditions. At 10 p.m., BAMcaf, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; free. (Nate Chinen) 
&#x2605; Bobby Avey (Saturday) Mr. Avey is an intellectually restless young pianist, conceptualist and composer whose new album, ''Be Not So Long to Speak'' (Minsi Ridge), frames his ideas in solitude. Strikingly, the austerity of the setting is no kind of limitation for him, and the same should be true of this concert, under optimal conditions for solo pianism. At 8 p.m., Klavierhaus Recital Hall, 211 West 58th Street, Manhattan, brownpapertickets.com/event/367851; $15. (Chinen)
Celebrating Duke Ellington (Thursday through April 27) Jazz at Lincoln Center has periodically paused to pay tribute to its most profound influence, and so this repertory concert -- featuring Wynton Marsalis and the organization's resident orchestra -- can be pegged as both a habitual gesture and a crack team doing what it does best. Thursday and next Friday at 8 p.m.; April 27 at 2 and 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; limited availability. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Claudia Quintet (Friday and Saturday) This precisely calibrated but willfully spontaneous chamber-jazz group led by John Hollenbeck, a drummer and composer, makes the layering of timbre a suspenseful event. The ensemble -- now with Chris Speed on tenor saxophone and clarinet, Matt Moran on vibraphone, Red Wierenga on accordion and Chris Tordini on bass -- will be playing new music intended for a forthcoming album. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Caf, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $20 cover, includes a drink. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Gerald Clayton Trio (Friday through Sunday) Gerald Clayton, a pianist of great touch and soulful exposition, just released ''Life Forum'' (Concord Jazz), an album ambitious in concept and texture, with a clear emphasis on his designs as a composer-bandleader. At the heart of the album is the excellent working trio he presents here, featuring the bassist Joe Sanders and the drummer Justin Brown. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Steve Coleman and Five Elements (Tuesday through April 28) ''Functional Arrhythmias'' (Pi Recordings) is the engrossing new album from Mr. Coleman, a fiercely independent alto saxophonist and composer, featuring a revamped edition of his working band. It seems likely to provide some fodder for his residency next week at the Stone, with a different arrangement of collaborators in each set. Among them are the trumpeters Jonathan Finlayson, Graham Haynes and Shane Endsley; the guitarists David Gilmore and Miles Okazaki; and his funk-adept rhythm team from the album, the drummer Sean Rickman and the electric bassist Anthony Tidd. At 8 and 10 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; $15 or $20 for each set. (Chinen)
Elegant Ellington (Wednesday and Thursday) Ignoring for a moment that the title is a lesson in redundancy, this jazz-cabaret program should access the Duke Ellington songbook from a variety of angles. The singers on deck almost ensure that outcome: along with the scholarly Michael Feinstein, they include the literary crooner Kurt Elling, the bluesman Blind Boy Paxton and the up-and-comer Brianna Thomas. Wednesday at 7 p.m., Thursday at 7 and 9 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $55 to $95. (Chinen)
Peter Evans's Zebulon Trio (Wednesday) Peter Evans, a trumpeter with an expressive command of timbre and texture, named this trio -- with John Hbert on bass and Kassa Overall on drums -- after the sorely missed club in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where it recorded an album last year. The album, ''Zebulon,'' is now out on Mr. Evans's own More Is More Records, and provides a loose framework of expectation here. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Caf, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $20 cover, includes a drink. (Chinen)
4 Generations of Miles (Wednesday through April 27) The rapid permutation of Miles Davis's bands makes it technically possible for four of his former sidemen to claim connection to four separate phases of his career. Here those musicians are the drummer Jimmy Cobb, the alto saxophonist Sonny Fortune, the bassist Buster Williams and the guitarist Mike Stern. At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium Jazz Club, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, theiridium.com; $35 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Richard Galliano-Christian Howes Quintet (Friday through Sunday) The energetic violinist Christian Howes has a new album, ''Southern Exposure'' (Resonance), featuring Richard Galliano, the celebrated French accordionist, as a special guest. They revisit that terrain -- playing music inspired by a wealth of South American traditions -- in this run, with Josh Nelson on piano, George Delancey on bass and Cedric Easton on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $30 to $45 cover, $15 for students at select sets, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Hiromi: The Trio Project (Friday through Sunday) Drawing from her most recent album, ''Move'' (Telarc), the extravagantly dynamic pianist Hiromi Uehara pursues an aesthetic of hyper-dexterity with help from her regular partners, the bassist Anthony Jackson and the drummer Simon Phillips. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $45 cover at tables, $25 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)
Kate and Keith Duo-Palooza (Saturday) Kate McGarry, an emotionally lucid and musically sure-footed singer, joins her husband, the guitarist Keith Ganz, in a set full of far-ranging material, likely to appear on an album soon. From 6 to 9 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; no cover, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)
Kings of the Crescent City (Friday and Saturday) Victor Goines, a longtime clarinetist and saxophonist with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, leads a repertory tribute to his hometown, New Orleans, with a group consisting of Marcus Printup and Kenny Rampton on trumpet, Chris Crenshaw on trombone, Don Vappie on banjo, Reginald Veal on bass and Adonis Rose on drums. At 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $30 to $120. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Diana Krall (Friday) ''Glad Rag Doll'' (Verve), the most recent album by Diana Krall, is on one hand a nifty bit of pop archaeology, consisting of songs culled mostly from the '20s and '30s. It's also a shrewd image tweak for Ms. Krall, with its dusty T Bone Burnett sound and its Ziegfeld Follies style. All of which bodes well for this stop on her current tour. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 465-6500, beacontheatre.com; sold out. (Chinen)
Mat Maneri Trio (Thursday) Mat Maneri is a violist with an elastic approach to pulse and pitch; in this trio, he has intuitive support from Ed Schuller on bass and Randy Peterson on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Caf, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $20 cover, includes a drink. (Chinen)
Vadim Neselovskyi & Friends (Thursday) Mr. Neselovskyi is a Ukrainian pianist of high technical fluency who has a strong connection to the classical tradition, as he demonstrates on a new solo album, ''Music For September'' (Sunnyside). This one-nighter will feature a group with Tammy Scheffer on vocals, Daniel Foose on bass and Ronen Itzik on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; $10 cover, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen)
Jean Rohe (Sunday and Tuesday) A sure-footed young singer-songwriter mixing aesthetic approaches from jazz, folk and chamber music, Ms. Rohe appears on Sunday with something she calls her End of the World Show, playing mandolin alongside the accordionist Liam Robinson, the percussionist Rogrio Boccato and the percussionist James Shipp, among others. (Sharing the bill is Down Home, a worthy project of the saxophonist Petr Cancura.) On Tuesday Ms. Rohe performs with no outside help, playing a new batch of songs. Sunday at 8:15, Shapeshifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $10. Tuesday at 10 p.m., Cornelia Street Caf, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $20 cover, includes a drink. (Chinen)
Catherine Russell (Thursday through April 28) Ms. Russell, a jazz singer with a husky tone but a bright temperament, draws here from her fourth album, ''Strictly Romancin' '' (World Village/Harmonia Mundi), with a band that includes the guitarist and banjoist Matt Munisteri. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $35 to $45 cover, $20 and $25 for students at select sets, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
&#x2605; John Scofield Hollowbody Band (Friday and Saturday) John Scofield has long been a jazz guitarist with a more than casual interest in groove, and he's deep in his element with his Hollowbody Band. It features a fellow six-string specialist, Mike Stern, as a sparring partner, and a rhythm section with the bassist Ben Street and the drummer Bill Stewart. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Christian Scott Sextet (Thursday through April 28) The declarative mode comes easily to Mr. Scott, a fiendishly gifted young trumpeter born and raised in New Orleans and now residing in Harlem. He has a tough working band, but here he opts for something less proven: a sextet with Warren Wolf on vibraphone, Braxton Cook on alto saxophone, Lawrence Fields on piano, Vicente Archer on bass and Corey Fonville on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set next Friday and April 27, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25 and $30 cover. (Chinen)
Ben Sidran and His Don't Cry for No Hipster Band (Wednesday) Mr. Sidran is a well-traveled keyboardist and conversationalist whose new album, ''Don't Cry for No Hipster'' (Nardis), puts him forward again as a singer-songwriter in the Bob Dorough vein. As on the album, he works here with the guitarist Will Bernard, the saxophonist John Ellis, the bassist Tim Luntzel, the percussionist Moses Patrou and the drummer Leo Sidran (his son). At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20 cover. (Chinen)
Terell Stafford Quintet (Tuesday through April 28) A bright and assertive trumpeter with a solid hard-bop footing, Terell Stafford has lately been hard at work trying to establish the Jazz Orchestra of Philadelphia, an entity devoted to the music and musicians of his adopted hometown. He seems likely to draw partly from that legacy here, leading a band with a fellow Philadelphian, Tim Warfield, on saxophones. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)
Colin Stranahan's Pacemaker (Thursday) An alert and sensitive drummer, Mr. Stranahan was one of three finalists in this year's Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition, which imposes certain normative demands. He'll most likely be freer in this environment, connecting with the guitarist Ben Monder, the pianist Pete Rende and the bassist Thomas Morgan. At 7 p.m., Shapeshifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $10. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Tri-Centric Orchestra (Sunday) Established by the visionary composer Anthony Braxton, the Tri-Centric Orchestra is a new-music outfit stocked with keen improvisers like the saxophonist Josh Sinton and Taylor Ho Bynum, playing the cornet and fluegelhorn here. This concert, which will not involve Mr. Braxton, features the premieres of three ensemble commissions: ''When Life's Door Opens,'' by the flutist Nicole Mitchell; ''Shifting Shorelines, Within and Without,'' by the violinist Jason Kao Hwang; and ''Dark Flow,'' by the accordionist Kamala Sankaram. At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org; $15, $10 for members. (Chinen)
Steve Turre Quintet (Friday and Saturday) Steve Turre, the trombonist and conch shell player, brings casual virtuosity to the conventions of small-group hard bop. He leads a quintet ready for action, with the tenor saxophonist Billy Harper, the pianist Donald Vega, the bassist Gerald Cannon and the drummer Dion Parson. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; $35 cover. (Chinen)
Steve Wilson Quintet (Friday through Sunday) The alto and soprano saxophonist Steve Wilson combines economy and modernity in his playing, usually in the context of a quartet (or on one of his blue-chip assignments as a sideman). His quintet for this run features the trumpeter Alex Sipiagin, the pianist George Cables, the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Ulysses Owens Jr. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25 and $30 cover. (Chinen)
Yellowjackets (Tuesday through April 27) This jazz-funk pace car recently celebrated its 30th year in business, which means it has weathered many cycles of taste and technology, managing never to struggle. Along with the band's founders and de facto leaders, the keyboardist Russell Ferrante and the saxophonist Bob Mintzer, its current lineup features the drummer William Kennedy, back in the fold after more than a decade away, and the bassist Felix Pastorius, filling in while Jimmy Haslip is on hiatus. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 and $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

HEADLINE: The Excel Depression

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
In this age of information, math errors can lead to disaster. NASA's Mars Orbiter crashed because engineers forgot to convert to metric measurements; JPMorgan Chase's ''London Whale'' venture went bad in part because modelers divided by a sum instead of an average. So, did an Excel coding error destroy the economies of the Western world?
The story so far: At the beginning of 2010, two Harvard economists, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, circulated a paper, ''Growth in a Time of Debt,'' that purported to identify a critical ''threshold,'' a tipping point, for government indebtedness. Once debt exceeds 90 percent of gross domestic product, they claimed, economic growth drops off sharply. 
Ms. Reinhart and Mr. Rogoff had credibility thanks to a widely admired earlier book on the history of financial crises, and their timing was impeccable. The paper came out just after Greece went into crisis and played right into the desire of many officials to ''pivot'' from stimulus to austerity. As a result, the paper instantly became famous; it was, and is, surely the most influential economic analysis of recent years.
In fact, Reinhart-Rogoff quickly achieved almost sacred status among self-proclaimed guardians of fiscal responsibility; their tipping-point claim was treated not as a disputed hypothesis but as unquestioned fact. For example, a Washington Post editorial earlier this year warned against any relaxation on the deficit front, because we are ''dangerously near the 90 percent mark that economists regard as a threat to sustainable economic growth.'' Notice the phrasing: ''economists,'' not ''some economists,'' let alone ''some economists, vigorously disputed by other economists with equally good credentials,'' which was the reality.
For the truth is that Reinhart-Rogoff faced substantial criticism from the start, and the controversy grew over time. As soon as the paper was released, many economists pointed out that a negative correlation between debt and economic performance need not mean that high debt causes low growth. It could just as easily be the other way around, with poor economic performance leading to high debt. Indeed, that's obviously the case for Japan, which went deep into debt only after its growth collapsed in the early 1990s.
Over time, another problem emerged: Other researchers, using seemingly comparable data on debt and growth, couldn't replicate the Reinhart-Rogoff results. They typically found some correlation between high debt and slow growth -- but nothing that looked like a tipping point at 90 percent or, indeed, any particular level of debt.
Finally, Ms. Reinhart and Mr. Rogoff allowed researchers at the University of Massachusetts to look at their original spreadsheet -- and the mystery of the irreproducible results was solved. First, they omitted some data; second, they used unusual and highly questionable statistical procedures; and finally, yes, they made an Excel coding error. Correct these oddities and errors, and you get what other researchers have found: some correlation between high debt and slow growth, with no indication of which is causing which, but no sign at all of that 90 percent ''threshold.''
In response, Ms. Reinhart and Mr. Rogoff have acknowledged the coding error, defended their other decisions and claimed that they never asserted that debt necessarily causes slow growth. That's a bit disingenuous because they repeatedly insinuated that proposition even if they avoided saying it outright. But, in any case, what really matters isn't what they meant to say, it's how their work was read: Austerity enthusiasts trumpeted that supposed 90 percent tipping point as a proven fact and a reason to slash government spending even in the face of mass unemployment.
So the Reinhart-Rogoff fiasco needs to be seen in the broader context of austerity mania: the obviously intense desire of policy makers, politicians and pundits across the Western world to turn their backs on the unemployed and instead use the economic crisis as an excuse to slash social programs.
What the Reinhart-Rogoff affair shows is the extent to which austerity has been sold on false pretenses. For three years, the turn to austerity has been presented not as a choice but as a necessity. Economic research, austerity advocates insisted, showed that terrible things happen once debt exceeds 90 percent of G.D.P. But ''economic research'' showed no such thing; a couple of economists made that assertion, while many others disagreed. Policy makers abandoned the unemployed and turned to austerity because they wanted to, not because they had to.
So will toppling Reinhart-Rogoff from its pedestal change anything? I'd like to think so. But I predict that the usual suspects will just find another dubious piece of economic analysis to canonize, and the depression will go on and on.

HEADLINE: Obama's Labor Nominee Faces G.O.P. Critics in Senate

BYLINE: By EMMARIE HUETTEMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Responding to sharp criticism from Republicans for his work on housing discrimination and voting rights at the Justice Department, Thomas E. Perez, President Obama's choice to head the Labor Department, on Thursday defended his record and said that if confirmed, his focus would be on tackling the nation's high unemployment rate. 
Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the labor committee, cited a scathing report from other Republican lawmakers as he questioned Mr. Perez about a deal he helped broker with officials in St. Paul for the city to drop a housing discrimination lawsuit in exchange for the Justice Department's declining to join two whistle-blower complaints against the city.
''That seems to me to be an extraordinary amount of wheeling and dealing outside the normal responsibilities of the assistant attorney general for civil rights,'' Mr. Alexander said.
He later added that he expected Mr. Perez to respond in full to a subpoena from Representative Darrell Issa of California, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, for personal e-mails believed to contain more information about the deal.
Mr. Perez countered that not only had he sought the guidance of ethics experts on the agreement, his had not been the final word.
''The senior career people in the civil division kicked the tires on this case. They looked at it very carefully, they made a very considered judgment that it was a weak case,'' he said.
Democrats were eager to voice their support for Mr. Perez, who, if confirmed would be the only Hispanic member of the cabinet.
Anticipating questions about the deal, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, the committee chairman, opened the questioning by leading Mr. Perez through a series of largely yes-or-no queries designed to rebut the Republican report.
''As I said, we have gone through this with a fine-tooth comb, with our lawyers, with our staff,'' Mr. Harkin said. ''And everything I can see is that you acted appropriately and ethically to advance the interests of the United States.''
Questioning the role of politics in Mr. Perez's challenges to voting laws, Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, brought up the Justice Department's move to block that state's voter identification law in 2011 on the grounds that it would discourage minority voters.
''As I look at your management style, it seems to have a political perspective, a political bias in the management style,'' Mr. Scott said. ''It seems not to be open and not to be balanced and certainly not to be fair.''
Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, released a statement in March vowing to block Mr. Perez's nomination pending a response from the Justice Department on his accusations of uneven enforcement of voter registration rights in his state.
As expected, many of the questions focused on job creation, with senators from both parties asking about his commitment to the Job Corps, a training program for young people, among others.
''Jobs, jobs, and jobs,'' Mr. Perez said, summing up his top priority as labor secretary. ''I believe it's critically important to get Americans back to work, and I believe the Department of Labor can play a critical role.''
The committee plans to take up the nomination again next week.

HEADLINE: Soft Outlook for Earnings Feeds a Market Retreat

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The stock market fell again on Thursday and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed below a crucial technical level after disappointing financial forecasts from eBay and other companies cast doubt on the market's recent strength.
The S.& P. 500 ended below its 50-day moving average of 1,543.04 for the first time this year, giving more weight to analysts' concerns that the market's recent rally was losing momentum, particularly after two days of sharp declines this week. 
The Nasdaq 100 and the Russell 2000 indexes both have closed below their 50-day averages this week, adding to the overall technical pressure on the market.
Technology led the day's fall. Shares of eBay dropped 5.9 percent to $52.82, a day after the e-commerce company posted results and gave a disappointing earnings forecast for the second quarter. The S.& P. technology sector index lost 1.4 percent.
Apple shares extended their slide from Wednesday, when the stock broke below $400 on an intraday basis for the first time since December 2011. The stock tumbled 2.7 percent to close at $392.05 on Thursday.
The CBOE volatility index, Wall Street's fear index, gained 6.4 percent to 17.56. The VIX, as it is known, is up roughly 46 percent for the week so far. It still remains well below its recent highs, but the gains could signal a change in the market trend.
''There's definitely technical damage,'' said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Delta Global Asset Management. ''I think that the period we had that had volatility tamped way down has likely ended.''
Stocks have rallied for much of the year on expectations that the American economy would continue to strengthen and that the Federal Reserve would keep its economic stimulus in place.
More recent data on the economy has been less upbeat. On Wednesday, reports showed that factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region cooled in April and that the index of leading economic indicators, a gauge of future economic activity, fell in March for the first time in seven months.
The Dow Jones industrial average slid 81.45 points, or 0.56 percent, to close at 14,537.14. The S.& P. 500 dropped 10.40 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,541.61. The Nasdaq composite index fell 38.31 points, or 1.20 percent, to 3,166.36.
After the bell, a number of prominent technology companies reported their financial results, including I.B.M., whose shares fell 4.2 percent to $198.45 in after-hours trading after its earnings missed analysts' expectations.
After hours, shares of Google rose 2 percent after it released first-quarter results. It closed at $765.91. Shares of Microsoft shot up 2.7 percent to $29.57 after posting its results.
During Thursday's regular session, volume was roughly 7.05 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the NYSE MKT. In comparison, the average daily closing volume is about 6.36 billion this year.
Volume has been heavier on negative days this week, as many investors have anticipated a pullback for some time after stocks' strong run to start the year and moved quickly to take profits.
The S.& P. 500's moving average was also the floor of the trading range during the last month, making 1,543 a crucial technical support, according to Richard Ross, global technical strategist at Auerbach Grayson.
Mr. Ross and other analysts noted that the S.& P. 500 had posted negative second quarters in the last three years.
The S.& P. health care sector also experienced big declines, with the UnitedHealth Group down 3.8 percent at $59.69, after the insurer lowered its 2013 revenue outlook.
Other decliners included Morgan Stanley, whose shares dropped 5.4 percent to $20.31 after the bank reported revenue from fixed-income and commodities trading fell sharply from a year earlier. Shares of Bank of America, which posted disappointing results on Wednesday, fell 2.2 percent to $11.44 on Thursday.
The earnings of companies in the S.& P. 500 are expected to have risen 1.9 percent in the first quarter, up from the 1.5 percent estimate at the start of the month, based on actual results from 82 companies and estimates for the rest, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Of companies that have reported, 72 percent have topped analysts' expectations for their earnings, but only 43.9 percent have exceeded revenue forecasts.
In the bond market, interest rates slipped. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 4/32, to 102 27/32, while its yield dipped to 1.69 percent, from 1.70 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: One Man's Currency Is Another Man's Bet

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
What do you get when you combine evangelical fervor with leverage and rising speculation?
The gold market, circa 2013.
In the more than four decades since President Richard M. Nixon severed the dollar's last ties to gold, there have been two bull markets in gold -- markets that peaked not that far apart, when adjusted for inflation. To a believer, gold is different from any other commodity. The others are expected to rise and fall with supply and demand. A supply shock, perhaps caused by a drought in Brazil or a confrontation in the Persian Gulf, may send the price of orange juice or oil soaring. A fall in economic activity may depress the value of any industrial commodity. A commodity, like any other investment, can become overvalued or undervalued.
But to the faithful, that doesn't include gold. Sure, it has uses in the real economy, like jewelry and dentistry. But that is not the important issue. To them, it is money. It cannot be overvalued. 
There was a time when gold really was money, when the gold standard reigned supreme. Its record was not an especially good one. There was the minor issue of supply shocks -- as when gold from the New World caused drastic inflation in Spain -- and there were repeated panics and depressions in the 19th century. A determination to stick to the gold standard helped worsen the Great Depression.
But to those who revere gold, such problems are minor compared to the sins of fiat money, which is defined as money not anchored in gold but instead determined by central bankers, who can -- and eventually will -- surrender to political pressures to devalue the currency. Discretion will be abused.
Those who back the gold standard think ''you can design a rule that will tell you what to do, no matter what the circumstances,'' says Robert J. Barbera, the co-director of the Center for Financial Economics at Johns Hopkins University. ''But there is no one-size-fits-all rule for monetary policy. Ultimately, you need discretion.''
Central bankers go in and out of fashion. Back in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as inflation grew and grew in the United States and other developed economies, their credibility was challenged as never before. Gold, and its sort-of sibling, silver, soared, but then crashed back to earth well before Paul A. Volcker, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, proved he could and would tame inflation, even if doing so sent the American economy into back-to-back recessions.
During January 1980, as the first of those recessions was beginning, gold went from a little over $500 an ounce to $850 and then back under $700.
By early 1999, when Time Magazine put the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, on its cover as the head of ''the Committee to Save the World,'' central bankers had become geniuses. (The other members of that committee were the former Treasury secretary, Robert E. Rubin, and his deputy at the time, Lawrence H. Summers, who later succeeded Mr. Rubin.) The stock market was booming, recessions were distant memories and gold was under $300 an ounce.
After 1980, gold never got close to $800 an ounce until, once again, the central bankers began to look imperfect. In 2007, as the American economy struggled to deal with what was then seen as the subprime housing crisis, gold climbed back above $800 and then set a new high, in nominal dollars, early in 2008, early in the American recession.
This time around, the sin of central banks appeared to be one of inadequate regulation, and of allowing a credit boom to get out of hand. If William McChesney Martin Jr., a former Fed chairman, once said the Fed's job was ''to take away the punch bowl just when the party gets going,'' Mr. Greenspan was spiking the punch during his final years.
The hostility to the Fed since then has been largely based on worries that, Ben S. Bernanke, Mr. Greenspan's successor, was going to destroy the dollar. Having lowered short-term rates to virtually zero, the Fed and other central banks have purchased huge quantities of government bonds. That is not printing money in the sense that no printing press is involved, but in every other sense it is.
Surely, said those who believe in gold, burdensome inflation was just around the corner. The Republican platform in 2012 did not use the phrase ''gold standard,'' but said ''as we face the task of cleaning up the wreckage of the current administration's policies,'' a Republican administration would appoint a ''commission to investigate possible ways to set a fixed value for the dollar.''
By the time of the Republican convention, it turned out, gold had peaked at a little more than $1,900 an ounce. This week, in what looked like panic selling, the metal fell back below $1,400.
In 1980, as in this year, gold had attracted a lot of speculators who might or might not care about a gold standard, but who knew a rising market when they saw one. Exchange-traded funds have made it a lot easier to invest in gold -- no need to store a gold bar or a bag of coins -- and they have also made it much easier to borrow money to support such positions. Margin calls no doubt had something to do with Monday's plunge, as they did with the collapse of silver futures back in 1980.
In 1980, a case could be made that those margin calls, in the futures market, were brought on by a conspiracy against the people who had driven prices up. An article in Fortune Magazine pointed to changes in the rules at the commodity exchange, making it all but impossible to speculate on silver prices continuing to rise. This time, there are no obvious changes in rules to explain the plunge. It may be that a lot of people simply placed bets with borrowed money, expecting a disaster that has not arrived, and now are scrambling to minimize their losses.
Perhaps, as in 1980, evidence is growing that the central bankers are getting it right -- or at least right enough. By coincidence, the day after the Monday plunge in gold, the International Monetary Fund released its World Economic Report, with a chapter titled ''The dog that didn't bark: Has inflation been muzzled?'' The chapter had a suitable quantity of ''buts'' and ''howevers,'' but the basic answer was ''Yes,'' in large part because people trust central bankers and assume that central bank inflation targets will be met, at least in the long run.
''Fears about high inflation should not prevent monetary authorities from pursuing highly accommodative monetary policy,'' the I.M.F. concluded.
It may be a coincidence, but this week's plunge coincided with growing publicity for a currency that sounds a little like gold, at least if you are not paying close attention. That is the digital currency called bitcoin, which has of late been more volatile than a dot-com stock in 1999. Invented in 2009, its supply supposedly is controlled by a rigid computer program, making it, like gold, not subject to central bank manipulation. It got an endorsement last week from The Economist magazine: ''Regulators should keep their hands off new forms of digital money such as bitcoin,'' the magazine wrote, proclaiming that the bitcoin's ''unique digital signature'' makes it ''impossible to forge.''
To gold advocates, that kind of talk is dangerous.
''The bitcoin is not the answer to the Federal Reserve's depredations against the dollar,'' wrote Steve Forbes, a former presidential hopeful, in his blog at Forbes.com. ''The basic reason: It has no fixed value. It trades like a stock or commodity. In recent days it has been crashing after a spectacular rise in terms of dollars. Such volatility makes it useless as a means to do transactions.''
Of course, you could say something similar about gold.

HEADLINE: In Congress, a Bill Seeks to Tie Municipal Borrowing Power to Public Pension Disclosure

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Representatives from California and two other states introduced a bill in Congress on Thursday that would strip states and cities of their right to issue tax-exempt bonds unless they first disclosed the true cost of their pension plans and whether they could pay it.
The measure seeks to prevent more municipal bankruptcies like the one in Stockton, Calif., where the city has defaulted on hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of municipal bonds but continues to pay hundreds of millions of dollars more in pension costs. 
A debate is now raging in that bankruptcy over which of the two debts has legal priority. The question has far-reaching implications both for labor relations and the building of public works, and many experts expect the Supreme Court to have the final say.
Sponsors of the disclosure bill, all Republicans, said Stockton and other distressed cities would not be in such deep trouble -- and their workers, residents and bondholders exposed to such painful losses -- if they had been keeping accurate track of what they promised to their retirees all along.
Sponsors said they wanted to send a signal that no matter what else happened, the federal government would not bail out states, cities or other governments that promised more than they could deliver.
''The costs of public pension funds are driving an increasing number of states and municipalities toward insolvency,'' said a sponsor of the bill, Representative Devin Nunes, a California Republican whose district includes Fresno and other inland cities that are still struggling to recover from the housing bust and the Great Recession.
Another sponsor, Darrell Issa, also a California Republican, said he thought that because pension costs were essentially hidden, state and local officials could ''pander to both public employees and taxpayers'' by racking up huge promises that local taxpayers would never agree to if they understood the cost.
''The key to addressing this problem is shining a light on the financial health of pension systems and making clear that federal taxpayers will not pick up the bill for reckless mismanagement,'' said Mr. Issa, whose district includes prosperous communities in San Diego County, which has had pension trouble, and Orange County, which declared bankruptcy in 1994 after its aggressive investments soured.
Other sponsors were Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee, and Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina. He said he would introduce the Senate version of the bill in a few days.
The bill would not require governments to change the type of benefits they offered workers, or to invest their retirement money in any particular way. The federal government has little or no power to direct such decisions by states and cities because of state sovereignty provisions in the Constitution.
A similar bill was introduced in 2011, and while it picked up sponsors from both parties, it drew withering opposition from public employees' unions, who viewed it as an attack on public workers. They argued the bill was a deliberate effort to make pensions look exorbitant, to stoke taxpayer anger and resentment, and heighten the pressure on states and cities to switch to 401(k) plans.
''The federal government does not need to intervene in this issue,'' said Iris J. Lav of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy research group based in Washington, at a hearing on the previous bill before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight. ''States should be able to gradually solve their underfunding problems with the steps they are already taking,'' like requiring bigger contributions from both workers and governments.
In the new bill, the method for calculating pension costs has been changed so that it closely resembles the one that actuaries already use under certain circumstances. The big bellwether California state pension system, known as Calpers, already uses such a method to calculate a local government's final bill when it drops out of the system, for example.
This time, the bill may also gain momentum from the changing circumstances -- Stockton's pension fight is out in the open, for instance, and certain other cities, like Detroit, are clearly struggling more than ever with retirement benefit costs. Federal regulators recently accused Illinois of securities fraud for issuing what they said was misleading information about its pension system.
Perhaps most important, in Washington the search is on for ways to reduce the federal deficit. The tax exemption for municipal bonds costs the Treasury more than $30 billion a year in forgone revenue, and fiscal experts say municipalities are at greater risk of losing it now than since the Great Depression. The Obama administration has repeatedly proposed capping it. So did Mitt Romney during the last presidential campaign.
The new bill would not use the tax exemption so much to narrow the federal deficit as to force municipalities into giving the world an unvarnished look at their pension plans. Until now, the accounting rules have permitted governments to factor in actuarial assumptions and smoothing techniques that greatly lowballed the benefits' cost.
In some cases, local governments could even say their workers' benefits were free. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board recently tightened the rules, but many economists say the revisions do not go far enough.
Moody's Investors Service, for one, has said it will not use the numbers that states and cities disclose in rating municipal bond offerings without first adjusting them. On Wednesday, Moody's said it had started making the adjustments, and had put Chicago, Cincinnati, Minneapolis, Portland, Ore., and 25 other local governments and school districts on review for possible downgrades as a result.
''The manner in which these obligations are reported varies widely, and we believe the liabilities are underreported from a balance sheet perspective,'' said Timothy Blake, a managing director at the ratings firm.
City and state officials generally remain hostile to the idea of so-called fair value pension disclosures. But they also cherish their ability to raise money at low cost with tax-exempt bonds and would probably make the disclosures if that were the only way to keep the tax exemption.

HEADLINE: Survivors Are Bound By Sorrow And Loss

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
WEST, Tex. -- The explosion at the fertilizer plant here on Wednesday sliced a path of devastation through this farming community nestled on the prairie some 80 miles south of Dallas, binding in sorrow people already connected by blood, marriage and a shared immigrant past.
It squashed the roof of David Pareya's truck, parked on the next block, as if it had been punched by a giant fist. It flattened a nursing home across the street; Gladys Quilter, 85, helped her 92-year-old sister, Lucille Price, escape through the window of her room. Five miles to the north, it loosened the nails holding the wallboard to Debbie Robertson's living room, as her house shook softly, like a baby's rattle. 
On Thursday, over beers at Wolf's Bar or the Czech sweet buns known as kolache at Mimi Montgomery's Village Bakery, residents pieced together the destruction they have not yet been able to assess. Stories from behind the roadblocks rolled in on Thursday, told by rescuers, survivors and their relatives, who converged on the small strip that is the downtown here to share companionship and grief.
Ms. Robertson said Mr. Pareya, her cousin and West's justice of the peace, talked to her not about the damage to his truck or the buckled walls of his home, but of the friends whose deaths he had spent the day pronouncing in his official capacity, as he made his way across the debris field.
Thomas Wolf, who runs the bar an uncle opened on the sole commercial strip about 20 years ago, spoke of the many relatives he has taken in: his parents, Tommy and Joann, whose home was leveled by the blast; his brother Rick, whose house now stands crooked; a daughter who drove three hours on Wednesday to check in on everyone.
There were people who came to watch, and people like Joyce and Steve Brock who came to help. Sipping coffee at the Village Bakery, whose owners put out free food for whoever walked through its doors on Thursday ''just because,'' as Ms. Montgomery put it. The Brocks -- she is 75 and he is 80 -- offered their lake home nearby to anyone who needed a place to stay.
''One time when we needed help we got help from folks we knew and from complete strangers,'' Mrs. Brock said. ''We think it's time to do our part and help others.''
West sprouted along railroad tracks and got its name from Thomas M. West, an entrepreneur who had a big safe and offered to use it to store the payments for railroad workers, some of whom put down roots. The experiment eventually turned into a bank, which extended credit to many Czech immigrants who arrived here with nothing but a desire to farm the area's fertile lands and make a life for themselves in their new country.
Farming remains West's economic driver. There is a feed mill to the south of Oak Street, the main drag here, where the area's corn and oat crops are ground. The fertilizer plant sits to the north, near houses, the nursing home, a school and an apartment building, which has been destroyed.
The largest employer is the school system, but a job at the plant was ''a good job, of decent pay,'' said Ms. Montgomery, whose grandfather came here from Moravia at the start of the 20th century. Farmers hauled the liquid fertilizer it distributed in tanks hooked to the backs of their pickup trucks. The fertilizer is made of anhydrous ammonia, a nitrogen-hydrogen combination that is used as a crop nutrient.
The mayor, Tommy Muska, lost his home. The president of the Kiwanis Club, Donald Cernosek, lost his. Ms. Montgomery said Mrs. Price, her aunt, had held on to her house after moving into the nursing home and stayed there occasionally on weekends, when her children visited. That home, too, is now gone.
''In the end, I don't know how much we care about all that,'' Ms. Montgomery, teary-eyed, said as she opened the door of her bakery to a visitor. ''We're still counting the bodies.''

HEADLINE: A Silicon Valley Vision for San Francisco

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- The evening did not unfold as planned for Ron Conway, one of the tech industry's most influential investors.
He stayed longer than expected at a political fund-raiser with President Obama at a hedge-fund billionaire's home in Sea Cliff, on this city's northwest edge, because of the president's security requirements and a missing valet. Unable to find his car, he would not make it across town to the Embarcadero for an event hosted by sf.citi, the civic organization he founded 14 months ago to unite tech companies, harness their political influence and, perhaps, change San Francisco.
Later that evening, after finding his car and his way home, he said: ''The tech community is a closely knit group, which is why it's so powerful. All of these companies have an affinity for each other, even if they compete with each other.''
Speaking at his home overlooking the city, with his blue blazer tossed on a couch and his wife, Gayle, and son Topher sitting around a large kitchen island, he said, ''You need a catalyst, so I'm a catalyst.'' 
Having amassed a fortune by investing early in Google, Facebook, Twitter and other start-ups, Mr. Conway has become, in two short years, one of San Francisco's power brokers, using his wealth and network to pursue his vision of a business-friendly, tech-driven city with single-minded clarity.
Mr. Conway, 62, lobbied successfully for tax changes favoring tech start-ups and helped elect Mayor Edwin M. Lee. He is the face and force behind sf.citi, or the San Francisco Citizens Initiative for Technology and Innovation, which champions tech companies' interests and is also creating and financing new technology to improve city policing and transportation.
The mayor and Mr. Conway are, by all accounts, very close, appearing often together in public here and recently going to Paris on a business trip.
In an interview, the mayor said he smiles when he is accused of being too cozy with Mr. Conway. ''I feel pretty comfortable with getting close to people whose values benefit the city,'' he said. ''Ten more Ron Conways would be helpful.''
Other industries like health care and tourism contribute more to the city treasury, but they have been overshadowed by tech's rapid growth here. Tech start-ups disappeared from the city with the bursting of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s, but a new generation of companies, especially in social media, has established roots. Sf.citi has about 500 member companies, accounting for 90 percent of the tech industry in the city, according to the organization.
''He's really been able to unite what historically has been a politically nonengaged sector,'' said Corey Cook, an associate professor of politics at the University of San Francisco.
Mr. Conway was not widely known outside the tech industry. But in Silicon Valley, he was a godfather or an elder statesman, said Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce.com, a software company and the biggest tech business based here.
''He brings a level of maturity to the industry that it badly needs,'' Mr. Benioff said, adding that he was surprised at how deeply engaged Mr. Conway had become in civic affairs. ''Ron is a force of nature. Whatever he focuses on, he creates.''
After achieving success in the computer industry in the 1990s, Mr. Conway became an angel investor, taking early stakes in promising start-ups, mostly in Silicon Valley. In 2004, Mr. Conway, who was born in San Francisco, moved back to the city with his wife after the youngest of his three sons went to college.
It was in 2010, Mr. Conway said, when he first got to know city officials through his involvement in helping pass a city law that made it illegal to sit or lie on sidewalks in San Francisco for most of the day. He was the biggest donor to the campaign behind the law, which was supported by the city and business associations but was opposed by advocates for the homeless.
He began backing Mr. Lee after he, as interim mayor in 2011, passed a tax exemption for Twitter, which had been considering leaving the city. Enlisting the assistance of many tech heavyweights, Mr. Conway later formed an outside group that helped elect Mr. Lee to a full term.
Last fall, sf.citi scored its first big political success when voters approved a payroll tax change that benefits tech start-ups. Mr. Lee said the new payroll tax and other policy changes favorable to the tech industry would create jobs. But critics speak of favoritism.
''Ron Conway seems to be more interested in whatever political payoff comes for his industry instead of what's in the best interest of the city he claims to care about,'' said Art Agnos, a former mayor.
Others say the rising influence of Mr. Conway and the tech industry signals a fundamental change in the city's character. The breaks given to his industry have attracted tech companies and highly paid tech workers, who in turn have contributed to rising rents and living costs.
''That's really made it difficult for San Franciscans who have been here generations to survive,'' said John Avalos, a city supervisor and a leading voice for the city's progressive movement. ''There's a lot of displacement going on, mostly because people have been priced out of their housing as part of the tech boom. I don't think Ron Conway considers these changes that we are seeing as important.''
Mr. Conway rejects the criticism, pointing to the jobs created by tech companies.
With the exception of an immigration overhaul, a perennial demand of the tech industry, Mr. Conway said he had little interest in national affairs until the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The shooting occurred while the Conways were hosting a Christmas party whose guests included Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in Tucson in 2011.
Seeing her presence as ''a sign,'' Mr. Conway has thrown himself into the battle for greater gun control. Working with Sandy Hook Promise, a group of Newtown parents, Mr. Conway has started a campaign with other venture capitalists to encourage the development of gun safety technology. He has been attending Democratic and Republican fund-raisers to press for stricter gun laws, though he was unsure whether his efforts would have the impact his local ones have enjoyed.
''I really don't have a lot of interest in national politics, and it's because I'm a skeptic,'' he said. ''I think you can accomplish a lot more locally. I don't want to spin the wheels and not get anything done.''

Previews and Openings
'Bull' (previews start on Thursday; opens on May 2) Mike Bartlett raised plenty of eyebrows -- and landed on last year's Top 10 list of The New York Times critic Ben Brantley -- with ''Cockfight Play.'' Now, in what is being called a companion piece, Mr. Bartlett looks at a different realm of questionable behavior, this time focusing on the workplace. With three candidates vying for two jobs, chivalry is presumably dead and gone. It's part of 59E59's seven-show Brits Off Broadway festival. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Eric Grode) 
'Bunty Berman Presents...' (in previews; opens on May 9) The New Group had a hit in 2008 with Ayub Khan Din's ''Rafta, Rafta...,'' a delightful comedy about Indian families in England's working-class North West. The same playwright returns with another ellipsis, this time attached to a Bollywood-style musical about a 1950s Bombay film producer whose star is fading, along with that of his once adored leading man. Mr. Khan Din wrote the book and lyrics, and shared composing duties with Paul Bogaev. After doing a bang-up job on the earlier work, Scott Elliott again directs. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (David Rooney)
'Core Values' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on May 6) Is there anyone working right now who projects working-stiff pathos better than Reed Birney? His sad-sack nobility, seen to such stirring effect in ''Circle Mirror Transformation'' and ''Uncle Vanya,'' seems ideally suited to this new workplace drama by Steven Levenson (''The Language of Tree''). It seems safe to assume that the setting -- a weekend staff retreat for a small travel agency -- won't offer much in the way of respite for the workaday stresses. Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, arsnovanyc.com. (Grode)
'A Family for All Occasions' (previews start on Thursday; opens on May 12) The Labyrinth Theater looks to two of its leading lights, Philip Seymour Hoffman and the playwright Bob Glaudini, for this latest look into familial dysfunction. Mr. Hoffman starred in Mr. Glaudini's ''Jack Goes Boating'' in 2007, and now he's directing a group of other Labyrinth stalwarts (including Deirdre O'Connell and Jeffrey DeMunn) in this look at the upheavals that happen when a recent retiree's daughter brings her new boyfriend home. Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 513-1080, labtheater.org. (Grode)
'Fragments' (opens on Sunday) C.I.C.T./Thtre des Bouffes du Nord returns to New York with this acclaimed production from 2011: a setting of five short pieces by Samuel Beckett, directed with becoming simplicity by Peter Brook and Marie-Hlne Estienne, that showcase the writer's peerless gift for theatrical economy, as well as the glinting comic light that shines from much of his work (1:00). Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, tfana.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Here Lies Love' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) You were expecting a conventional bio-musical from a creative team that includes the maverick musicians David Byrne and Fatboy Slim, the director Alex Timbers and the choreographer Annie-B Parson? Exploring the abuse of power, this show deconstructs the journey of the former Filipina first lady and shoe hoarder Imelda Marcos as an immersive dance-club experience. The audience stands throughout, weaving among the performers in a 360-degree scenic and video environment. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Rooney)
'I'll Eat You Last: A Chat With Sue Mengers' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) One fabulous larger-than-life broad who blazed through the 1970s takes on another in this solo vehicle by John Logan (''Red''), fresh off rejuvenating the James Bond franchise with his screenplay for ''Skyfall.'' Though fans can lament that Bette Midler won't be singing in her first Broadway appearance in more than 30 years, Miss M should find ample scope for her irrepressible wit in this portrait of the Hollywood superagent, renowned for her stellar client list, her parties, her caftans and her sailor-mouth vocabulary. Joe Mantello directs. Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Macbeth' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Two figures clinically survey the action, but the speaking roles are the exclusive domain of Alan Cumming in this feverish reimagining of the Scottish play as the obsessive torment of a haunted psychiatric patient. The Tony-winning director John Tiffany (''Once'') and Andrew Goldberg (''The Bomb-itty of Errors'') stage this audacious National Theater of Scotland production, seen briefly in New York last summer at the Lincoln Center Festival. It will be on Broadway through June, giving a wider audience the chance to watch the polysexual Mr. Cumming ply his erotic skills on himself as an incentive for murder. Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Mayday Mayday' (in previews; opens on Monday) The last time Tristan Sturrock was on the stage of St. Ann's Warehouse, he was playing the extremely active male lead in ''Brief Encounter.'' Who would have guessed that just a few years earlier, with a baby on the way, he was crumpled at the base of a wall with a broken neck? This solo show demonstrates how he got from there to here. It's directed by Katy Carmichael, who would know a thing or two about the subject matter: She was the pregnant girlfriend at the time. St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Grode)
'The Memory Show' (in previews; opens on April 30) Perhaps the success of ''Next to Normal,'' which dealt with bipolar disorder, has paved the way for musical treatments of other health woes. This piece by Zach Redler and Sara Cooper also follows a family (here a mother and a daughter) as it grapples with the mother's illness (Alzheimer's disease). Joe Calarco directed Catherine Cox and the up-and-comer Leslie Kritzer in a Barrington Stage Company production in 2010, and now all three are doing the same for the adventurous Transport Group. The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, new42.org. (Grode)
'Nikolai and the Others' (in previews; opens on May 6) The always inventive David Cromer directs a large cast that includes Blair Brown, Michael Cerveris, Alvin Epstein, Kathryn Erbe, John Glover and Stephen Kunken in this latest excursion into history from Richard Nelson. Set in Westport, Conn., during a spring weekend in 1948, the play considers the questionable ways in which American art was financed at the start of the cold war. It focuses on a gathering of Russian migrs, including George Balanchine and Igor Stravinsky, retracing the roots of their collaboration on the ballet ''Orpheus.'' Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Pippin' (in previews; opens on Thursday) The 1970s redux on Broadway didn't fare well last season, with neither ''Godspell'' nor ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' sticking around long. But Diane Paulus managed to make the countercultural relic ''Hair'' feel vital and relevant in her thrilling 2009 revival. So she might also be the right person to give a fresh take on Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson's 1972 show about a restless royal heir seeking his ''Corner of the Sky.'' First seen at the American Repertory Theater, where Ms. Paulus is artistic director, the show features Matthew James Thomas, Patina Miller, Terrence Mann, Charlotte d'Amboise and Andrea Martin, with circus and acrobatic elements created by Gypsy Snider of the Montreal-based troupe 7 Fingers. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Richard III: Born With Teeth' (in previews; opens on Sunday) The logo for this modern-day adaptation by Epic Theater Ensemble actually crosses out the name of Shakespeare's hunchbacked usurper, replacing it with that apocryphal natal dental factoid from the play. It's part of the National Endowment for the Arts program Shakespeare for a New Generation. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 270-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'The Testament of Mary' (in previews; opens on Monday) Before it became a searing novella, the Irish author Colm Toibin's eloquently humanized first-person account of the post-Crucifixion years of Mary, mother of Jesus, was an acclaimed monologue performed at the Dublin Theater Festival in 2011 by Marie Mullan under the direction of Garry Hynes. This new production, starring Fiona Shaw, is the latest chapter in the long and fruitful creative partnership between Ms. Shaw and the director Deborah Warner, whose work together was last seen on Broadway in a blazing ''Medea'' in 2002. Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'This Side of Neverland' (previews start on Friday; opens on May 5) One of the Mint Theater's earliest resuscitation efforts came with a pair of plays by A. A. Milne, showing a creative world beyond the Hundred Acre Wood and its four-legged inhabitants. Now the Pearl Theater looks for similar success with J.M. Barrie of ''Peter Pan'' fame, with the help of two lesser-known one-act plays -- ''Rosalind'' (1914) and ''The Twelve-Pound Look'' (1921) -- that have very much grown up. Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (Grode)
'The Trip to Bountiful' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) The director Michael Wilson has a distinguished history staging the work of Horton Foote, most recently with ''Dividing the Estate'' and ''The Orphans' Home Cycle.'' In his production of Foote's 1953 drama, Cicely Tyson returns to Broadway for the first time in 30 years to play Carrie Watts, a role that has won acclaim for Lillian Gish, Geraldine Page and Lois Smith. The lead character is an elderly Texas woman determined to make one final journey to her hometown, against the wishes of her family. Starring alongside Ms. Tyson are Cuba Gooding Jr., Vanessa Williams, Condola Rashad and Tom Wopat. Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
Broadway
'Ann' Holland Taylor wrote and stars in this solo show about Ann Richards, the straight-shooting onetime governor of Texas. Ms. Taylor's engaging performance goes beyond impersonation, though the script is neither a dramatically shapely piece of writing nor a deeply probing character study (1:55). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, lct.org. (Isherwood)
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may occasionally feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'The Big Knife' Bobby Cannavale stars in the first (and last?) Broadway revival of Clifford Odets's 1949 drama about a movie star in a moral bind: to knuckle under to studio blackmail and sign his life and artistic aspirations away, or leave behind the corrupt system and risk reprisals. Doug Hughes's sluggish production doesn't make a case for the play's enduring merits; Odets handled similar themes with more urgency and cogency in ''Golden Boy,'' seen earlier this season in a superior revival (2:20). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Kinky Boots' Cyndi Lauper has created a love-and-heat-seeking score that performs like a pop star on Ecstasy. This Harvey Fierstein-scripted tale of lost souls in shoe business, in which a young factory owner (Stark Sands) teams up with a drag queen (Billy Porter), sometimes turns into a sermon. But it's hard to resist the audience-hugging charisma of the songs (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Lucky Guy' Nora Ephron's elegy and valentine to the rough-and-tumble of big-city newsrooms and scoop-hungry reporters, starring Tom Hanks as the columnist Michael McAlary, is written with a true fan's avidity. Directed with bells and whistles by George C. Wolfe, this is less a fully developed play than a boisterous swapping of fond anecdotes about the end of a life and the end of an era (2:00). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Matilda the Musical' The most satisfying and subversive musical ever to come out of Britain. Directed by Matthew Warchus, with a book by Dennis Kelly and addictive songs by Tim Minchin, this adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel is an exhilarating tale of empowerment, told from the perspective of that most powerless group, little children. Bertie Carvel is priceless as their school-mistress nemesis (2:35). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Motown: The Musical' A dramatically slapdash but musically vibrant joy ride through the glory days of the Detroit music label founded by Berry Gordy. Mr. Gordy's book is sketchy and obvious -- you want to plug your ears whenever the music stops. But the music is, of course, some of the greatest R&B ever recorded, and the performers mostly electric (2:40). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'The Nance' Playing a gay burlesque performer whose onstage specialty is mincing effeminacy, Nathan Lane combines shiny expertise and dark conviction to sometimes devastating effect, in this strained if heartfelt play by Douglas Carter Beane. Not even Mr. Lane, though, can reconcile all the disparities the script asks him to weave together. Jack O'Brien is the estimable director (2:25). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella' This ultimate and most enduring of makeover stories, via the team who gave us ''Oklahoma!,'' has been restyled by the director Mark Brokaw and the writer Douglas Carter Beane into a glittery patchwork of snark and sincerity, with a whole lot of fancy ball gowns. Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana are the appealing leading lovers (2:20). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Portraying a woman mired in what appears to be a permanent midlife crisis, the marvelous comic actor Kristine Nielsen provides much of the laughing gas in Christopher Durang's uneven but intermittently delightful riff on Chekhovian themes. David Hyde Pierce and Sigourney Weaver also star in Nicholas Martin's production, smoothly transferred from a sellout run Off Broadway (2:30). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'According to Goldman' The more promising their script becomes, the more two screenwriters find their partnership is at risk in this play produced by Theater Breaking Through Barriers (1:45). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, tbtb.org. (Ken Jaworowski)
&#x2605; 'All in the Timing' One of the zestier plates of theatrical tapas to be had. This 20th-anniversary production of David Ives's popular anthology of mini-plays, directed by John Rando, leaves you feeling lighter, but not emptier. There's nutrition in these sketches about (gulp!) relativity and randomness, and surprising substance in their silliness. Carson Elrod leads a bouncy cast (1:45). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Buyer & Cellar' Jonathan Tolins has concocted an irresistible one-man play from the most peculiar of fictitious premises -- an underemployed Los Angeles actor goes to work in Barbra Streisand's Malibu basement -- allowing the playwright to ruminate with delicious wit and perspicacity on the solitude of celebrity, the love-hate attraction between gay men and divas, and the melancholy that lurks beneath narcissism. In the capable hands of the director Stephen Brackett and the wickedly charming actor Michael Urie, this seriously funny slice of absurdist whimsy creates the illusion of a stage filled with multiple people, all of them with their own droll point of view (1:30). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'The Call' Tanya Barfield's thoughtful, absorbing drama explores the tensions that arise when a white couple (the terrific Kerry Butler and Kelly AuCoin) decide to adopt an African baby. Their African-American friends, a lesbian couple well played by Eisa Davis and Crystal A. Dickinson, have different perspectives on their choice. Leigh Silverman directs (1:50).

'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; 'Donnybrook!' This revival of Johnny Burke and Robert E. McEnroe's 1961 musical (itself an adaptation of ''The Quiet Man,'' the 1952 St. Patrick's Day perennial about an Irish-American boxer's fraught courtship of a redheaded spitfire), jettisons the most dated, disturbing and indulgent elements of the movie but retains the essential sentimental blarney. With a fine cast and crisp direction by Charlotte Moore, the result is as fresh as a morning after rain in the west of Ireland (2:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Andy Webster)
&#x2605; 'The Drawer Boy' The Oberon Theater Ensemble does a fine job with this lovely play by Michael Healey about two farmers, one with a brain injury, and the writer who comes to observe them for the purposes of writing a play about farming. The humor is left wry and dry, and when it comes time to reveal the story of how the two men arrived at their present state, heartstrings are tugged expertly (2:00). Return engagement opens on Wednesday at Soho Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, (866) 811-4111, sohoplayhouse.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
&#x2605; 'Finks' The subject matter, the blacklist of the 1950s, may have been visited before, but this bracing production by the Ensemble Studio Theater gets your blood boiling all over again thanks to lively performances by Aaron Serotsky and especially Miriam Silverman. They play a couple who are caught up in the witch hunt, and the playwright, Joe Gilford, drew on the experiences of his own parents, actors who were blacklisted, to create the story (2:15). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Genzlinger)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Webster)
&#x2605; '_______ Up Everything' The unprintable title of this winsome rock musical is trying way too hard to shock and awe. But then, so are all the show's characters, who are Brooklyn faux-hemians desperately trying to prove their anti-establishment bona fides. Poking fun at the pasty-white underbelly of Brooklyn's hipster crowd is like shooting free-range ducks in an artisanal barrel, but with catchy music and a talented cast, this show still does so exquisitely well (1:35). Elektra Theater, 669 Eighth Avenue, at 42nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, fueonstage.com. (Catherine Rampell)
'Futurology the Musical' A lot of Anthony J. Dixon and Sandra J. Barnes's tale of three glamorous astronauts from the future trying to save a young actress-singer from her own ego could have been written by a high school student. But there are some nice melodies, and the female lead's best friend turns into a youngish Tina Turner (2:15). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, futurologythemusical.com. (Gates)
&#x2605; 'Julius Caesar' The blood runs warm in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of this Shakespeare tragedy, which has ingeniously been reset in contemporary, civil war-torn Africa. In putting aside what we normally think of as ''Roman manners,'' and introducing a greater emotional transparency, Gregory Doran's version vibrantly emphasizes the human fallibility of Shakespeare's noble characters (2:40). Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Brantley)
'The Last Five Years' Jason Robert Brown has mounted a stylish production of his two-character musical about the waxing and waning of young love. Adam Kantor and Betsy Wolfe play aspiring artists whose paths diverge. Their story is told in songs that are skillfully written but, like his characters, are on the generic side (1:25). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)
'The Madrid' Edie Falco, whose face usually seems like an open window, pulls down the blinds in Liz Flahive's muted, murky play about a runaway kindergarten teacher, directed by Leigh Silverman. Ms. Flahive has a poet's hand for echoing imagery. But this production often feels paralyzed in its contemplation of the mystery of everyday lives (2:10). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Brantley)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)
&#x2605; 'Old Hats' Bill Irwin and David Shiner, the peerless neo-vaudevillian jesters behind the long-running hit ''Fool Moon,'' have concocted a winning new compendium of nifty clown routines. The pixie-ish singer-songwriter Nellie McKay makes for a perfect musical foil in this ebullient, thoroughly charming variety show (1:50). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Revisionist' As a Polish Holocaust survivor in Jesse Eisenberg's somewhat implausible new play, Vanessa Redgrave reminds us why she's considered the greatest actress of her generation. She inhabits her character with precision and authority, making us feel like humble, privileged trespassers in an exotic world. Mr. Eisenberg almost holds his own portraying her graceless young American cousin (1:45). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Talley's Folly' Danny Burstein and Sarah Paulson give performances of translucent feeling in this loving Roundabout Theater Company revival of Lanford Wilson's 1979 romantic pas de deux about two misfits in 1944 Missouri trying to find a mutual rhythm. Directed with sympathy and insight by Michael Wilson (1:35). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Women of Will' Mixing casually delivered scholarly exposition with intensely rendered performance, this impassioned exploration of Shakespeare's heroines by Tina Packer traces their evolution through their language. When Ms. Packer and her co-star, Nigel Gore, get down to the business of acting, it's not just poetry in motion, it's thought made flesh. Eric Tucker directs (2:30).

Off Off Broadway
&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00). Duplex Cabaret Theater, 61 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, pattiissues.brownpapertickets.com. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Then She Fell' Inspired by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended. A guided tour of Wonderland, created by Third Rail Projects, leads its participants through a series of rooms and an interactive evening of dance, poetry, food and drink (2:00). Return engagement starts on Saturday. The Kingsland Ward at St. John's, 195 Maujer Street, near Humboldt Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 374-5196, thenshefell.com. (Brantley)
'Totally Tubular Time Machine' This show is less a play or musical than a big, campy, drinking party, with a little bit of singing thrown in. Held at an '80s-theme dance club in Midtown, it features celebrity impersonators who wander through the crowd handing out party favors (lollipops from Katy Perry, trucker hats from Justin Bieber) and taking turns at karaoke. The impersonations come with varying degrees of similitude and singing talent (2:00). Saturdays only. Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, (212) 921-1999, totallytubularnyc.com. (Rampell)

Last Chance
'Breakfast at Tiffany's' (closes on Sunday) Holly Golightly does not. Go lightly, that is. Everyone in this lugubrious stage adaptation of Truman Capote's beloved 1958 novella gives the impression that what they're doing onstage is hard labor.

'Bullet Catch' (closes on Sunday) The Scottish actor Rob Drummond wrote and performs this dramatized magic act centering on the trick of the title, in which he appears to catch in his teeth a bullet fired by an audience volunteer. Mr. Drummond stokes suspense by relating a tale of a fatal accident involving the same trick, but those dispirited by gun violence (like me) may find the conceit distasteful (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Good With People' (closes on Sunday) A beautiful, deceptive wisp of a play, David Harrower's two-character drama, set in a Scottish hotel, is a story of how people haunt their own lives, failing ever to be entirely present no matter where they are. Blythe Duff and Andrew Scott-Ramsay are the entire (and excellent) cast. George Perrin directs with light and icy fingers (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Brantley)
'Hit the Wall' (closes on Sunday) Ike Holter's impassioned evocation of the Stonewall Riots and Eric Hoff's vigorous production are strongest when stylized interpretation eclipses conventional realism. A hit in Chicago last year, the drama is being staged just a stone's throw from Christopher Park in Greenwich Village where the events depicted occurred, amplifying the historical echoes of the sweltering June night in 1969 when drag queens, gay men and lesbians pushed back during a routine police raid. While the freewheeling play traffics in stereotype and anachronism with mixed results, it adopts a vernacular that speaks sincerely and directly to today's gay youth, inviting them to honor the earlier generation that broke the chains of marginalization and invisibility (1:35). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Rooney)
'Living Dead in Denmark' (closes on Sunday) An antic, uneven blend of Shakespearean characters, zombies, dystopian humor, pop references, dueling blades and scattershot anachronisms, ''Living Dead in Denmark'' doesn't quite hit all its marks -- but not for lack of trying. The energy is high, though, and the fight choreography, by the theater veteran Rick Sordelet and his son Christian Kelly-Sordelet, is impressive (1:55). Gene Frankel Theater, 24 Bond Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, brownpapertickets.com/event/324234. (Webster)
&#x2605; 'Passion' (closes on Friday) Staged by John Doyle, a minimalist with a scalpel, this hypnotic revival of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's musical study of love beyond reason comes across as a pulsing collective fever dream, while reminding us that startling clarity can come from such dreams (1:45).

'Shaheed: The Dream and Death of Benazir Bhutto' (closes on Sunday) Anna Khaja plays eight characters in her one-woman show that mixes fact and fiction to understand the complicated, contradictory person that was Benazir Bhutto. Ms. Khaja, who wrote the script, is a better actress than writer, and some of the characters seem thin. Still the show reminds us of why Bhutto was so interesting (1:30).

HEADLINE: Contest Winners Fight Sanitation Woes With Technology

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
SERRAVAL, France -- At a school in a rundown suburb of Dakar, Senegal, the students had nowhere to go to the bathroom. The boys urinated against the outside walls, the girls headed behind the building. There was no way for any of them to wash their hands.
That changed after the directors of the school turned to a new technological tool to alert the authorities -- and their watchdogs -- to the problem. Shortly after they did so, the toilets, which had been out of order for months, were fixed. 
''For us, it's not just to show that there is a capacity in Africa to develop good applications,'' said Daniel Annerose, chief executive of a mobile technology company in Dakar, called Manobi, which developed the reporting system, which lets teachers, students or parents report problems with sanitation facilities at more than 2,000 schools across Senegal.
The system, called mSchool, is one of three winners of a competition organized by the World Bank to identify promising solutions to address a striking discrepancy in access to high and low technologies in developing countries: Six billion of the seven billion people around the world have mobile phones, while only 4.5 billion have access to toilets, according to a recent United Nations report.
The winners of the Sanitation Hackathon, as the World Bank calls the project, are set to be honored on Friday in connection with the annual meetings of the bank and its sister organization, the International Monetary Fund. The other honorees are Sun-Clean, a computer game developed by students at the University of Indonesia, which teaches children about good hygiene; and Taarifa, a Web application developed by programmers in Britain, Germany, the United States and Tanzania, which uses ''open source'' technology, interactive mapping and other features to help public officials track sanitation problems.
Because of the rapid spread of cellular phones, mobile technology has previously been used to address a variety of problems in the developing world, including access to financial services, health care information and education. But toilets were another matter.
''People don't want to talk about poo,'' said Jaehyang So, manager of the Water and Sanitation Program, a fund administered by the World Bank. ''There's the ick factor.''
In addition to the deaths and health problems, Ms. So said, poor sanitation causes a variety of other problems. In places where schools lack working toilets, many girls drop out once they begin menstruating because of a lack of privacy, she said, causing a form of educational discrimination.
''We were saying, 'Isn't this awful,''' Ms. So said. ''Then we decided to say, 'What can we learn from the tech industry?' Why is it that pretty much everyone who wants an iPhone can get one? How do they get this kind of rapid scale-up?''
Building on a process that had previously been employed to address problems in supplying clean water to people in poor areas, the World Bank turned its attention to sanitation. Over six months last year, it solicited ideas from experts in the field, as well as software developers. The process culminated in early December with the actual hackathon -- two days in which more than 1,000 developers gathered in 40 cities worldwide to work on their projects.
The project has been funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and supported by companies like Nokia, the mobile phone maker, and organizations like Toilet Hackers, a group of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and others who are seeking solutions to the problem of poor sanitation.
''It's something that can have a little more impact than helping someone find the nearest bar or restaurant,'' said Gary Gale, director of global community programs in the location and commerce division of Nokia, which works with the company's mapping technology.
After the event in Washington, the winners of the hackathon are set to travel to Silicon Valley for meetings with venture capitalists and entrepreneurs who are interested in the issue. The World Bank does not plan to invest in the projects, but hopes that others might.
''We would love it if Silicon Valley could take some of these applications and build them into sustainable businesses,'' said Chris Vein, chief innovation officer for information and communications technology development at the bank. That way, he added, the projects could create jobs and economic growth, perhaps helping to ease the poverty that underlies poor sanitation.
John Kluge Jr., a New York venture capitalist who is a co-founder of Toilet Hackers, said mobile technology can help, but is ''just one part of the equation.'' If toilets are to be provided to more of the 2.5 billion people without them, new methods of financing -- not just aid -- will also be needed.
''Innovation isn't just about technology and design,'' Mr. Kluge said. ''It's also about the business model.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Public Offering Values SeaWorld at $2.5 Billion

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ALDEN

 BODY:
To many Americans, SeaWorld offers family fun amid penguins and killer whales.
To the Blackstone Group,, it offers the potential for lucrative returns.
On Friday, SeaWorld Entertainment will make its debut as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange in one of the biggest offerings of a private-equity-backed company in recent months. SeaWorld has become a signature investment for Blackstone, which recently played host to a pair of penguins in its Park Avenue offices.
The initial public offering had a promising start Thursday evening, with SeaWorld pricing shares at $27 each, at the top of an expected range, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. At that price, the deal raised $702 million and valued the company at $2.5 billion. 
Blackstone, which paid about $2.3 billion for SeaWorld in 2009, is selling shares in the public offering but will retain control of the company. After investing about $1 billion of equity in the deal, Blackstone received dividends of $500 million last year and $110.1 million the year before.
The theme park company, which includes other attractions, was once a division of the giant beer maker Anheuser-Busch InBev. Blackstone bought the company, which was not part of Anheuser-Busch InBev's core business, in a bet on the strength of brands like SeaWorld and Busch Gardens.
Since then, SeaWorld has added products, including iPhone and Android apps, and acquired an additional theme park last year, bringing the total to 11. It is also trying to build on its well-known brands, with plans to introduce an animated penguin character, Puck, at its theme park in Orlando, Fla.
SeaWorld has turned a profit from live shows, thrill rides and other attractions, earning $77.4 million last year, four times what it made in 2011. As a sweetener for its new investors, it plans to pay a dividend of 20 cents a share starting this quarter.
But SeaWorld's business model is vulnerable to a weak economy and to consumers who remain frugal in the wake of the recession.
The company gets most of its money from admissions at its theme parks, and relies on sales of food and merchandise. Its average ticket price is higher than those of two main rivals, Six Flags and Cedar Fair, according to a research note from Ian Corydon, an analyst with B. Riley & Company. Still, SeaWorld is trying to attract a broad swath of visitors.
''It's more of a destination park strategy,'' Mr. Corydon said. ''The Orlando and Southern California parks are known the world over and draw guests from out of town.''
SeaWorld is still haunted by an incident at its theme park in Orlando, where a trainer was killed by an Orca whale in full view of visitors in 2010. The accident drew intense criticism in the news media, and it is the subject of the documentary ''Blackfish,'' which is scheduled for release this summer.
After revising its safety protocols, SeaWorld continues to deal with the legal fallout from the killing. The company has clashed with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which issued several citations.
''Once a trainer is in the water with a killer whale that chooses to engage in undesirable behavior, the trainer is at the whale's mercy,'' wrote Ken S. Welsch, a federal administrative law judge for the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, in a ruling last year.
Blackstone, the largest alternative investment firm in the world, has shown strength in its business over all. On Thursday, the firm said its profit in the first quarter rose 28 percent, to $628 million, as it reported growth in its assets under management.
Before holding the initial public offering, Blackstone was reported to have fielded takeover offers for SeaWorld. But it turned them down, according to reports, betting that the public market would offer better returns.
The offering was handled by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays and Wells Fargo Securities.
Blackstone has had some fun with its SeaWorld investment.
In January, the firm invited two Magellanic penguins to its Manhattan offices. The penguins were well-behaved, a person with knowledge of their visit said at the time. But not being housebroken, they left unexpected gifts on a carpet and a conference table.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Redux: Arcane Names Hiding Big Risk

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
The alchemists of Wall Street are at it again.
The banks that created risky amalgams of mortgages and loans during the boom -- the kind that went so wrong during the bust -- are busily reviving the same types of investments that many thought were gone for good. Once more, arcane-sounding financial products like collateralized debt obligations are being minted on Wall Street.
The revival partly reflects the same investor optimism that has lifted the stock market to new heights. With the real estate market and the economy improving, another financial crisis seems a distant prospect. What's more, at a time when the Federal Reserve has pushed interest rates close to zero, the safest of these new investments offer interest rates almost double that paid by ultrasafe United States Treasury securities, according to RBS Securities, which was involved in such instruments in the past.
But the revival also underscores how these investments, known as structured financial products, have largely escaped new regulations that were supposed to prevent a repeat of the last financial crisis. 
''All of this seems like a fairly quick round trip,'' said Manus Clancy, a managing director at Trepp, a research firm that focuses on commercial real estate. ''You are seeing a fair number of sins being forgiven.''
Banks are turning out some types of structured products as fast or faster than they did before the bottom fell out. So far this year, for instance, banks have issued $33.5 billion in bonds backed by commercial mortgages, slightly more than they did in early 2005, when the real estate market was flying high, according to data from Thomson Reuters.
Banks have won over investors by taking steps to make this generation of structured products safer than the last one. But with demand for these products on the rise, credit ratings agencies and regulators are warning that the additional protections are already dwindling, allowing some of the old excesses to creep back into the market.
''The players in the business are generally the same as they were before,'' said Tad Philipp, a commercial real estate analyst at Moody's rating agency. ''Because it's the old players, they know how to push the boundaries.''
Whatever the risks, the basic principle behind the products remains the same. A pool of loans -- whether home mortgages or corporate loans -- are mixed together into bonds, ranked by varying levels of risk. If the underlying loans go bad, the bonds at the bottom of the pecking order suffer losses first, followed by the next lowest, and so on up the chain. It is only after enormous losses that the top-ranked AAA bonds lose money.
Bundling many loans into one investment, a process known as securitization, provides an efficient way to channel money to borrowers who might not otherwise get funds. But securitization proved dangerous during the last real estate boom because it encouraged banks to give loans to people with weak credit and then pass on those risky loans to the buyers of the structured products. When the real estate market dropped in value, it inflicted unexpected losses on those investors and led to chaos in the financial system. Many investors complained that the complexity of the instruments obscured their risks.
The Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul is forcing banks to take extra steps in the process of bundling loans, but it does not change the basic approach.
For a glimpse into this process, both before and after the crisis, consider the mortgage taken out by the Hard Rock Hotel in downtown Chicago. In mid-2007, just as the real estate market was coming unhinged, the hotel -- like many ordinary home buyers -- took out a risky mortgage on which it paid only interest. JPMorgan Chase mixed this loan and others into a commercial mortgage-backed security. Credit ratings agencies gave a large portion of the resulting bonds a AAA rating.
After the recession, the hotel struggled to keep up with its payments, edging it toward foreclosure. It was one of several bad loans that caused losses for holders of the old bonds. But late last year, with the market for structured finance coming back to life, the hotel's owners were able to refinance the old mortgage. In February, that refinanced loan turned up in a new bond, which again received a AAA rating.
By many measures, loan pools like the one that contains the hotel's mortgage are nowhere near as risky as they were in 2007. Before the crisis, 57 percent of the outstanding money in commercial mortgage-backed securities was in interest-only loans like the Hard Rock Hotel's previous loan. Though it fell sharply after the crisis, the percentage of money in interest-only loans is again rising swiftly. It has reached 34 percent this year, up from 11 percent two years ago, according to Trepp.
The structured product that has been the fastest to revive is the one that encountered the least trouble in 2008: collateralized loan obligations. These involve pools of loans given to companies with junk ratings.
In the first quarter of this year, banks issued about $26 billion in new collateralized loan obligations -- more than in the same period in 2007, according to S&P Capital IQ. Demand for the loan pools has been so brisk that banks have been able to loosen underwriting standards on the underlying loans and bonds. This provoked the Federal Reserve to release guidance last month warning that ''prudent underwriting practices have deteriorated.''
Not all markets have revived as quickly. The slowest bonds to return are those linked to home mortgages, the structured products that caused the most problems during the crisis. Many AAA mortgage bonds suffered significant losses when large numbers of subprime mortgages went sour.
But even here there are signs of life. Last month, JPMorgan became the first major American bank to issue a bond backed by residential mortgages. Other banks have been talking about doing the same.
These first steps have been greeted with concern. While a large portion of the JPMorgan deal was given the highest rating by Fitch and Kroll Bond Ratings, Moody's issued a report arguing that investors were not given enough protection. Fitch issued a similar note when a Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, released its first new mortgage security last fall.
Brian Reynolds, the chief market strategist at Rosenblatt Securities, said that when the quality of bonds starts sliding, it rarely improves until a crisis.
''It's not risky immediately, but it puts us on the path to additional systemic risk,'' Mr. Reynolds said.
Still, the revival is welcome news for Wall Street banks and structured finance specialists. In 2008 and 2009, some banks eliminated their entire teams, assuming they would not be needed again. But last year, revenue from securitizations was up 68 percent, according to the data company Coalition.
''Literally we thought the business was gone,'' said Jeanne E. Branthover, a Wall Street recruiter. ''The surprise is that this is a skill that banks are looking for again.''

HEADLINE: Dell Contest Loses a Bidder

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The Blackstone Group has walked away from the bidding for Dell, people involved in the negotiations said. | SeaWorld Entertainment, backed by the Blackstone Group, priced shares at $27 each in its I.P.O., at the top of an expected range. | The structured financial products that played a starring role in the financial crisis are being created again. | Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, revealed his fashion secrets in an interview with Vanity Fair. 

 BODY:
BLACKSTONE SAID TO DROP OUT OF DELL BIDDING | The Blackstone Group has walked away from the bidding for Dell, after discovering that the computer maker's business was deteriorating faster than it previously understood, DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin and Jeffrey Cane report, citing people involved in the negotiations.
Blackstone, the private equity giant, had been inspecting Dell's books before deciding whether to make a formal bid to rival the $13.65-a-share take-private offer from the company's founder, Michael S. Dell, and the private equity firm Silver Lake. The withdrawal of Blackstone leaves only Carl C. Icahn, the activist investor, as a potential rival to the $24.4 billion buyout proposal from Mr. Dell's group. On Thursday, Blackstone notified the special committee of Dell's board that it would no longer pursue a bid, the people involved in the negotiations said. 
SEAWORLD PRICES I.P.O. AT TOP OF RANGE | To many Americans, SeaWorld offers family fun amid penguins and killer whales. To the Blackstone Group, it offers the potential for lucrative returns. On Friday, SeaWorld Entertainment is making its debut as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange in one of the biggest offerings of a private-equity-backed company in recent months. SeaWorld, which will trade under the ticker symbol SEAS, has become a signature investment for Blackstone, which recently played host to a pair of penguins in its Park Avenue offices.
The initial public offering had a promising start Thursday evening, with SeaWorld pricing shares at $27 each, at the top of an expected range, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. At that price, the deal raised $702 million and valued the company at $2.5 billion. Blackstone, which paid about $2.3 billion for SeaWorld in 2009, is selling shares in the public offering but will retain control of the company.
RISK REDUX ON WALL ST. | The structured financial products that played a starring role in the financial crisis are being created again. "Once more, arcane-sounding financial products like collateralized debt obligations are being minted on Wall Street," The New York Times's Nathaniel Popper writes. "At a time when the Federal Reserve has pushed interest rates close to zero, the safest of these new investments offer interest rates almost double that paid by ultrasafe United States Treasury securities, according to RBS Securities, which was involved in such instruments in the past." Still, the revival underscores how the investments "have largely escaped new regulations that were supposed to prevent a repeat of the last financial crisis."
MUNGER'S $110 MILLION GIFT | Charles T. Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and a longtime business partner of Warren E. Buffett's, has pledged $110 million to the University of Michigan, the largest donation in the school's history, the university said in a statement Thursday. The stock gift will pay for a graduate student residence on the school's Ann Arbor campus, and will include $10 million for fellowships for students. Mr. Munger, 89, earned his undergraduate degree at the university, DealBook's Peter Lattman notes.
ON THE AGENDA | General Electric and State Street report earnings before the market opens. Alan Greenspan is on Bloomberg TV at 7 a.m. Jim Atchison, the chief executive of SeaWorld, is on CNBC at 9:50 a.m., and on Bloomberg TV at 10:05 a.m.
CATCHING UP WITH BLANKFEIN | Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive and chairman of Goldman Sachs, revealed his fashion secrets in an interview with Vanity Fair. "I open up my closet, and there's a dozen absolutely identical suits," Mr. Blankfein told the magazine's blog VF Daily. The comments were at a cocktail party supporting Americans for Marriage Equality, held at a Calvin Klein boutique in Manhattan, where Mr. Blankfein gave a brief speech. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the Goldman chief offered his thoughts on Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker who is running for mayor of New York. "I always liked her. I think if she were mayor, it wouldn't be bad. I'd be happy," Mr. Blankfein said. But he added, "You think this is my first rodeo? I don't know who all the alternatives are yet. I haven't made up my mind, but I think she'd be a good mayor.""

HEADLINE: Sotheby's Auction Boosts Indian Art Sales

BYLINE: GAYATRI RANGACHARI SHAH


HIGHLIGHT: The recent Sotheby&#8217;s auction of Amrita Jhaveri&#8217;s art collection signals resurgence of the Indian art market, experts say. 

 BODY:
MUMBAI -The Indian art market appears to be on the rebound after Sotheby's first international evening sale of Indian art in New York last month fetched nearly $7 million.
The works of the Amaya Collection, which included paintings by modern masters like Vasudeo Gaitonde, Sayed Haider Raza and Francis Newton Souza, were amassed by Amrita Jhaveri, a collector and gallery owner based in London. Sixty percent of the sale prices exceeded their high estimates, and the 43 lots brought in a total of $6,694,875, just under Sotheby's pre-sale high estimate of $7 million.
"The sale is indicative of the market coming back," said Peter Nagy, who runs the art gallery Nature Morte in New Delhi and Berlin.
Prices for modern and contemporary Indian art began to climb rapidly in 2000, but slumped in 2008 with the onset of the global recession. The last two years have been cautious, with collectors focusing on modern Indian art, rather than contemporary, believing the latter had too strong a run in the previous decade. 
Nonetheless, the overall value of the Indian art auction market shot up from $3 million in 2000 to $100 million in 2010, according to Saffronart, an online auction house based in India.
The Amrita Jhaveri sale was the first single-owner sale by Sotheby's in Indian art in well over a decade, and the most notable news in Indian art market so far this year.
Speculation was rife about why Ms. Jhaveri, 43, decided to sell off part of a collection that took decades to complete, and why she decided to go with Sotheby's, given she and her husband were both employees of the rival auction house Christie's for many years.
Ms. Jhaveri offered a simple, pragmatic explanation in a recent telephone interview.
"Auctions follow a regular schedule," she said, speaking from London, where she resides with her husband, Christopher M. Davidge, the former chief executive of Christie's. (Mr. Davidge was a key witness in the price fixing scandal that shook the auction world in 2001.)
"There was no auction of Indian art [by Sotheby's] in March. Strategically, it was a very good decision because all the attention would be focused on the 40-odd works that I would be selling."
Since prices fell after the global recession, Ms. Jhaveri said she has had "time to reflect on what I wanted to keep."
"It's never easy to do but I felt it was necessary to make the collection stronger," she said.
"It was an easy decision to sell," she said, "but what was going into the sale was complicated. How do you cull carefully but still have a catalog that represents the collection and your particular eye and your particular taste?"
The auction represented about a tenth of Ms. Jhaveri's collection, she estimated, and she said she still owns 300 or so art works. A catalog containing three essays explaining the importance of Ms. Jhaveri's collection was produced to accompany the sale, and the auction drew bidders from first time buyers of modern and contemporary Indian art from the United States, Britain and Southeast Asia.
"Amrita's sale was a jolt to the Indian art market," said Yamini Mehta, head of the Indian and Southeast Asian art department at Sotheby's, in a telephone interview.
Ms. Jhaveri, who headed Christie's in India from 1995 until 2000, said that her choice of Sotheby's as cosigner was also purely a business decision.
(An interesting aside: Her former boss at Christie's, Lord Mark Poltimore, is now deputy chairman of Sotheby's Europe. He conducted the auction in New York, missing his red carpet moment at the London premiere of Danny Boyle's latest film, "Trance," in which he has a role.)
It is considered a gamble to hold an evening sale of Indian art in New York, which is early morning in India, but that did not seem to deter buyers.
Highlights of the sale included "Untitled" from Mr. Gaitonde, which sold for $965,000, above a high estimate of $800,000; "The Crucifixion," by Mr. Souza, which sold for $557,000, besting a high estimate of $300,000; "The Black Devi," by Manjit Bawa, which sold for $389,000, about double its estimate; and "Satsang," by Bhupen Khakhar, which sold for $341,000, beating a high estimate of $250,000.
Ms. Jhaveri said that a portion of the sale's proceeds would support a project space and lecture room at the Delhi-based nonprofit artists' collective, KHOJ International Artists Association. She is also donating a Mrinalini Mukherjee hemp sculpture to the Tate Modern in London, "to ensure that good Indian art is represented at institutions outside India."
Ms. Jhaveri, who was born and brought up in Mumbai, said she had an interest in art from childhood because her father, Dinesh, was passionate about art. Describing him as an "old-fashioned" collector with eclectic taste, Ms. Jhaveri said he bought everything from Kerala masks to Indian silver to bronzes.
The eldest of three sisters, Ms. Jhaveri said she never considered a career in art because when she was growing up there were no role models in the industry. After graduating from Brown University in 1991, where she majored in comparative literature, she said she couldn't find a job in the United States. So she headed to London, on a scholarship, to study Indian and Islamic art at the School of Oriental and Asian studies.
After she returned to Mumbai, having completed her degree, she looked for something to do, and that's when Christie's came calling. The auction house was just getting started in India, and Ms. Jhaveri said she started the office out of her bedroom.
Since then, Ms. Jhaveri has become a prime mover in the Indian art world, dividing her time between homes in Mumbai and London. In addition to a two-decade collecting history, Ms. Jhaveri authored a book on Indian art, was instrumental in bringing a sculpture show by British-Indian sculptor Anish Kapoor to India three years ago. She also runs a Mumbai gallery, Jhaveri Contemporary, with her sister Priya.
Mr. Nagy of Nature Morte called Ms. Jhaveri "a major player and very discreet." "She's upper crusty, extremely quiet and not flashy at all."
Ms. Jhaveri said she felt both elation and relief after the sale and wants to reorient her collection to include art and artists who have been overlooked by the market.
"My collection follows my life and interest," she said. "When I die, I want to have just 10 works on my wall in one home."

Dear Diary:
When the daffodils bloom in my neighborhood, I think of spring 2002, when suddenly daffodils appeared everywhere; it seemed the smallest bare patch of earth had a few blossoms to share. 
A gift of a million bulbs had been sent by a Dutch millionaire, the city of Rotterdam and other donors; they were planted by volunteers. 
For all of which, great thanks: we needed that.

HEADLINE: SeaWorld Shares Jump 13% in Trading Debut

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The Blackstone Group&#8217;s theme-park operator made a splash on Friday in its debut as a publicly traded company. 

 BODY:
SeaWorld Entertainment made a splash on Friday in its debut as a publicly traded company.
The stock of the theme park operator opened at $30.56 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, 13 percent above the initial public offering price. 
The company, taken public by the Blackstone Group, priced each share at $27 Thursday evening, the top of its expected range, raising $702 million and valuing the company at $2.5 billion.
SeaWorld's stock, under the ticker symbol SEAS, climbed higher during the morning, trading around $31.
The deal is one of the biggest offerings of a private equity-backed company in recent months. Blackstone, which paid $2.3 billion for SeaWorld in 2009, sold 16 million shares in the offering but retains control of the company.
SeaWorld earned $77.4 million last year, four times what it made in 2011. As a sweetener for its new investors, it plans to pay a dividend of 20 cents a share starting this quarter.
But the company, which operates 11 theme parks, including SeaWorld and Busch Gardens, is vulnerable to consumers who remain frugal in the wake of the recession.
SeaWorld gets most of its money from admissions at its parks, and also relies on sales of food and merchandise. Its average ticket price is higher than those of two main rivals, Six Flags and Cedar Fair, according to a research note from Ian Corydon, an analyst with B. Riley & Company.
The company is counting on the strength of its well-known brands, including Shamu, in a push to draw more visitors. It has added new attractions at its parks and released iPhone and Android apps. It also plans to introduce an animated penguin character, Puck, at its theme park in Orlando, Fla.
SeaWorld is still haunted by an incident at its theme park in Orlando, in which a trainer was killed by an Orca whale in full view of visitors in 2010. The company continues to deal with the legal fallout from the killing, which is the subject of a documentary to be released this summer.
The offering was handled by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, Barclays and Wells Fargo Securities.

HEADLINE: Lack Of Nuance Is Not The Problem

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Being wrong is. 

 BODY:
I see that both Tyler Cowen and Austin Frakt are offering explanations/excuses for the Reinhart-Rogoff affair in terms of the dynamics of wonk celebrity - basically, the pressure one feels under to take strong positions to attract and hold media attention. As an explanation, I think this has some merit; as an excuse, none at all. 
What happened with R-R was that they came out with a sloppy paper that played to the spirit of the times. The sloppiness was immediately obvious from the way they highlighted slow US growth in the late 1940s as an illustration of the price of debt overhang, somehow missing the point about postwar demobilization. It took only a few days for critics to point out the correlation versus causation issue too. 
Now, that was the point where R-R should have said, OK, we've been careless here, we need to rethink this, and backed off. But the paper was also a huge immediate hit with the austerians, and they got sucked in.
Notice, however, that the problem with the original wasn't that it failed to convey the nuances. The problem was that it was just plain wrong - wrong about America after the war, wrong about what a debt-growth correlation means. (It turns out that there was other wrongness too, but that was enough).
So the moral of the story should not be, "Don't take strong positions". It should instead be "Don't take a strong position that some people want to hear if the position isn't supported by theory and evidence". Or maybe, even more briefly, "Don't pander".
And the trouble with where I think Cowen, at least, is going is the apparent suggestion that everyone who develops a prominent public profile in economics has to do it by pandering. No, they don't - and specifically, I don't think that's what I do. I've taken very strong positions over the years; I've been wrong on some occasions; but I can't think of any cases where I took a stronger position than my actual beliefs warranted.
In particular, my hard-line views on policy in the current crisis - it's a demand problem not a structural problem, there is no risk of crowding out, there is no risk of inflation from aggressive monetary expansion, there are large negative effects from austerity - aren't simplifications of some more complex story, they are what my basic model and the lessons of history teach. Where there are things my "base" would like to believe but I'm not convinced, I say so - e.g., on the issue of whether inequality is a key factor holding back recovery.
So don't make excuses for Reinhart and Rogoff by suggesting that somehow their flub was inherent in being prominent, that everyone does it. It wasn't and they don't.
