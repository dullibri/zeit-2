HEADLINE: Editors' Note

 BODY:
A front-page article on Nov. 30 described signs that the American economy may be recovering. It quoted business people and economists who were beginning to see signs of improvement. 
 The headline in some editions referred to "the Clinton Recovery," and the first sentence referred to "the Clinton expansion," as did the headline in other editions. Although the article reported suggestions that part of the recovery was due to a psychological reaction to the election of Bill Clinton, most of the statistical evidence of improvement predated the election, and should have been more directly linked to the Bush Administration.

HEADLINE: Clinton Warns That Predictions of Economic Upturn Might Be Premature

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
As he prepared to announce his economic team later this week, President-elect Bill Clinton emerged from days of virtual seclusion today to warn that predictions of an economic upturn might be premature.
On a stop in Chicago on his way from Little Rock, Ark., to the capital, Mr. Clinton emphasized to students at Wilbur Wright Community College, a vocational school, that his economic prescriptions were still essential. 
 "We may or may not be coming out of our recession; there are some good indicators that we are," Mr. Clinton told about 100 students at the school in a working-class neighborhood on Chicago's northwest side. "But the long-term problems are there, and that is what I have to address."
 
Sounding Like a Professor
 Aides described Mr. Clinton's visit to Chicago as a political payback to a state that solidly supported his candidacy and from which he drew several top campaign aides.
Moving his hands in a wave motion to describe the economic peaks and valleys in what amounted to a sometimes-dull lecture, Mr. Clinton sounded more like an economics professor than the next President. Questions from a dozen members of the audience did little to liven the discourse.
Nonetheless, his cautionary words seemed intended to lower expectations and signal that he planned to emphasize long-term remedies rather than a short-term stimulus for the economy.
In his first round of announcements, Mr. Clinton is expected to name Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as Treasury Secretary and announce other top economic appointees as well. In addition, aides say he was narrowing his list for Secretary of State to Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and Warren M. Christopher, the transition director.
Another person said to be under consideration for a top position in the economics area is Franklin D. Raines, vice chairman of the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Government-sponsored private corporation known as Fannie Mae. Mr. Raines is now in charge of the Clinton transition team studying the operations of various Federal agencies that deal with the economy.
The 43-year-old former Rhodes Scholar is one of the few blacks being talked about for a high-level economics post, perhaps at the Treasury or the Office of the United States Trade Representative.
 
Meets New House Members
 Addressing students at the racially mixed trade school, Mr. Clinton repeated a refrain from his campaign: that nothing was more important than overhauling the nation's health-care system.
"If I could wave a magic wand tomorrow and do one thing for this economy," Mr. Clinton said, "I would bring health costs in line with inflation and provide a basic package for everybody because eight years from now that would free more money for people to invest in their children's education, for business to invest in the plants and the production and the jobs of the future and any other thing we could do."
After arriving this evening in Washington for his second visit here since Election Day, Mr. Clinton attended a bipartisan reception for newly elected House members at the Library of Congress and spoke by satellite to a meeting of the South Carolina Democratic Party. Mr. Clinton lost the state in November, but its former Governor, Richard W. Riley, is heading the effort to recruit appointments below the Cabinet level.
Mr. Clinton also attended a private dinner in the Georgetown home of Katharine Graham, chairwoman of The Washington Post Company.
The guest list included both present and former Government officials, journalists and members of Mr. Clinton's transition team.
Hillary Clinton wore her hair in a French twist with pearls on the top, which represented a substantial change in her appearance from what millions saw during the campaign. She was flanked at dinner by the financier Warren Buffett and Donald E. Graham, publisher of The Post.
In her toast, Mrs. Graham remarked that the first President she had met was Calvin Coolidge. She said of the gathering in her mansion, "These occasions have value. They create relationships beyond the office."
Mr. Clinton said, "Washington is a better place than most Americans think it is."
In his toast, he remarked that nations' capitals have often been places of intrigue and calculation, and he added that political leaders should "calculate less what is best for all of us" and instead more "what is best for all of those who sent us here."
Other guests included Senators Nunn, Edward M. Kennedy, , John D. Rockefeller 4th, William S. Cohen and George J. Mitchell; Mr. Christopher and Vernon E. Jordan, the leaders of the transition team; Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke of Baltimore; Tom Johnson, president of of CNN; Franklyn G. Jenifer, president of Howard University; Ken Burns, the television documentary maker; David McCullough, the historian and author of the new biography of Harry S. Truman; Richard M. Helms, the former Director of Central Intelligence, and Robert S. McNamara, the former Defense Secretary.
 
Easy Questions
 Though he is having private meetings here with transition officials and others, Mr. Clinton's two-day trip was a respite from days of being closeted in the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock interviewing prospective appointments and meeting with his closest advisers. Those advisers say he has been practically obsessed with filling his Cabinet.
 
Easy Questions
 His appearance in Chicago gave the public its first taste of what the President-elect's aides say will be several forums in which ordinary people can ask Mr. Clinton questions. The format, a carry-over from the campaign, is viewed as a way for Mr. Clinton to appear in touch with Americans while avoiding often-tougher questions from reporters.
In addition to his failure to attack President Bush, Mr. Clinton's oratory today differed from the campaign in that he offered few uplifting words as he gave a detailed analysis of the economy and state of American education.
Mr. Clinton has an even busier agenda for Tuesday, when he will spend most of the day meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He will pay a courtesy call on Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who will administer the oath to him.
The Supreme Court announced today that Vice President-elect Al Gore would be sworn in by former Justice Thurgood Marshall; Justice Marshall's son, Thurgood Jr., was a top Gore aide during the campaign.

HEADLINE: Staunch Conservative Wins G.O.P. Post in House

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
In a victory by conservatives over the moderate wing of the party, House Republicans today selected as their third-ranking leader Representative Dick Armey, a blunt-talking Texan with a penchant for bashing liberal Democrats and promoting supply-side economics.
Mr. Armey's 88-to-84 victory was too narrow to signify a definitive direction for Republicans in the post-election rebuilding period, even in the House where as an overwhelmed minority they are little more than a debating team. But it is one more indication that Republicans do not interpret the defeat of President Bush as a sign that they should retreat from conservative positions on issues like taxes and abortion. 
 The Democrats, for their part, re-elected Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, who both ran unopposed. Mr. Foley added a fourth chief deputy whip, appointing Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a leading member of the Hispanic caucus who is frequently mentioned as a possible Cabinet appointee.
 
Appropriations Head Is Ousted
 The Democratic leadership ousted Representative Jamie L. Whitten of Mississippi as chairman of the Appropriations Committee after 14 years at its helm. Mr. Whitten, 82 years old and in poor health, was replaced by Representative William H. Natcher of Kentucky, 83.
Emerging from the closed-door meeting, Mr. Whitten told reporters: "I just talked from the heart. I expressed my regret that they had failed to continue me in that position."
Mr. Armey, who represents a district in suburban Dallas-Fort Worth, defeated Representative Jerry Lewis of California, who sought re-election as chairman of the Republican Conference, a position from which he reinforced the centrist leadership of Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the minority leader.
Mr. Armey's challenge was supported by the No. 2 Republican in the House, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the confrontational minority whip who has privately told members that he hopes to run for leader if Mr. Michel decides to retire rather than seek re-election in 1994.
Mr. Michel, who will turn 70 in March, was not challenged for his leadership post this year, but he may be becoming more isolated in his party caucus. While Mr. Michel has always taken a conciliatory approach to Democratic leaders, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Armey can be expected to carve sharp distinctions between the two parties.
 
Strategy of Confrontation
 "I see confrontation as a tool," Mr. Armey told reporters after his victory. He has long nurtured the image of an outsider, starting when he arrived here eight years ago and lived out of his office as a demonstration of his frugality and scorn for the trappings of power. "My heart is in Texas," he said today, "not with the Washington establishment."
Mr. Armey, who has a Ph.D. in economics, is best known as a polemicist for conservative causes. But he also demonstrated the ability to construct legislative coalitions when in the late 1980's he successfully pushed for the establishment of an independent commission to review closings of military bases, so decisions would be based on merit and not the seniority of representatives.
Mr. Armey's narrow victory was made possible by the 47 Republican freshmen, who were attracted to his call for term limits and slashes in Congressional perquisites. Representative-elect Martin R. Hoke of Ohio said 30 to 35 freshmen voted for Mr. Armey, demonstrating their ability to unite their votes to help guide the party.
"It's ideas that reshaped the Republican Party 12 years ago and a lack of ideas that undid the party the last four years," Mr. Hoke said. "Armey is ideas driven and Lewis is politics driven."
Representative-elect Ernest J. Istook of Oklahoma said Mr. Armey's victory demonstrated that "the majority of Republican members agree we need an aggressive tack to highlight the differences between Republicans and Democrats on taxes, spending and overregulation."
Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, a conservative who straddles the Michel and Gingrich wings, won election unopposed as chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, the fourth-ranking leadership position.
The Republicans are expected to solidify the conservative hold on the leadership on Tuesday by re-electing Representative Bill McCollum of Florida as Republican Conference vice chairman over the challenge of Representative Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut, a supporter of abortion rights.
With most of the leadership elections out of the way, the caucuses are turning their attention to formulating positions on overhauling House rules. The Republicans are expected to call for sweeping changes, including term limits for committee chairmen.
But the Democrats control the votes, and they will do little more than tinker with rules that consolidate their control of the chamber. But they are expected to grant delegates from the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States' three territories the right to vote on the House floor on nearly all substantive matters except final passage of legislation.

HEADLINE: MOZAMBIQUE FORCE PROPOSED AT U.N.

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali asked United Nations members today to send a peacekeeping force of up to 10,000 troops and civilians to prepare free elections in Mozambique.
The request was made as the member countries owe the United Nations a total of more than $500 million for unpaid bills for other peacekeeping operations. 
 Less than a week ago the Security Council also authorized the United States to lead a large military force into Somalia to restore order there and assure the distribution of relief supplies. In the last year the United Nations has dispatched substantial forces to Cambodia and the Balkans, and a peacekeeping mission in Mozambique would raise to 13 the number of such operations under way.
In a report to the Security Council, the Secretary General recommended that "very substantial resources" should be made available, "especially on the military side," to help Mozambique carry out an agreement ending 14 years of civil war. President Joaquim Chissano's Government negotiated the accord last fall with the Renamo resistance movement.
 
$2.6 Billion for Peacekeeping
 Mr. Boutros-Ghali gave no estimate of the cost of the force, which he recommended should have 7,000 soldiers and more than 1,200 civilian electoral and administrative officers. But officials said the cost would run into hundreds of millions of dollars.
The force would also increase the number of deployed United Nations troops, from more than 50,000 to 60,000, and increase the annual peacekeeping budget, which is expected to total $2.6 billion this year. That sum is almost a third of all the money the United Nations has spent on peacekeeping since 1948.
A Mozambique operation thus seems certain to worsen the financial crisis that the United Nations is facing because of the continuing refusals of many countries, including the United States and Russia, to pay their full shares of its costs. At the end of last month member countries owed a total of $642.5 million in unpaid dues for past and present peacekeeping operations, with the United States $290 million in the red and the Russian federation $115.4 million. Adding arrears to the regular budget, the United Nations is owed $1.2 billion by its members, with the United States and the Russian federation at $410 million each.
 
Protection of Corridors
 The Mozambique force would oversee the demobilization of the armed forces of both factions, the organization of free and fair elections and the eventual formation of an army that would include soldiers from both factions. The force would also take over the protection of the four vital transportation corridors across Mozambique to landlocked countries in Central Africa. Malawian and Zimbabwean troops now guard the routes.
Officially, the elections are supposed to be held within a year of the signing of the accord last October. But Mr. Boutros-Ghali made clear today that he would not proceed until both sides had fully complied with the military aspects of the accord and could not thus challenge the outcome with force.

HEADLINE: Bush and Yeltsin in Talks to Gain A-Arms Accord

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia have begun personal negotiations by telephone and letter in the last week in an effort to resolve differences that threaten a major nuclear arms reduction agreement that the two announced in June, the White House said today.
Mr. Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said Mr. Bush spoke by telephone to Mr. Yeltsin on Sunday about the differences, which negotiators at lower levels in the Moscow Government had raised this year. 
 Discussions between Acting Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger and the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, have so far failed to reach a final accord, Mr. Fitzwater said.
 
Officials to Meet in Sweden
 Mr. Eagleburger and Mr. Kozyrev are expected to resume their talks this weekend at a meeting in Stockholm of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin announced the accord, which would reduce the stocks of nuclear missiles on both sides by one-third to one-half, at a Washington summit meeting on June 17. But since then the Russians, with their economy faltering, have made proposals on technical issues intended to reduce the cost of compliance. These have raised concerns on the American side about how the agreement can be verified, said a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The two Presidents, when they met last June, thought they had worked out this agreement, and then we sat down and finally worked it out in technical language and forwarded it to the Russians," that official said. "They came back, finally, with some new proposals and differences that raised more problems than they solved."
Asked whether the differences were serious, the official replied, "To experts they are."
Mr. Bush first called Mr. Yeltsin about problems with the treaty over the Thanksgiving weekend, and the President has also sent the Russian leader "a couple of letters" about the talks, Mr. Fitzwater said.
 
Russia Seeks to Save Money
 The agreement's major feature is a pledge by the Russians to abolish all their land-based multiple-warhead missiles. Many of the differences that are now under discussion involve an apparent desire by the Russians to save money by converting some multiple-warhead systems to single-warhead ones, rather than destroying them outright.
Some American officials fear that those changes would allow Russia to secretly rebuild its nuclear force later.
For example, the Russians agreed in June to destroy the all 150 SS-18 multiple-warhead missiles remaining on their territory, but they had not specifically agreed to destroy the silos in which they are stored, as is customary in such treaties.
Moscow has now proposed to store single-warhead missiles in those silos, but American experts are balking at the suggestion.
The Russians also wish to revise the June agreement to allow them to preserve all 170 of their multiple-warhead SS-19 missiles by removing five of their six warheads, effectively making them single-warhead weapons.
The United States worries that the warheads could be secretly re-mounted on the missiles later without inspectors being aware of the change.
The two sides also disagree over whether the final accord should explicitly mention in its preamble the 1970 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and the Russians are seeking to place new limits on the American flexibility to covert conventionally armed B-1 bombers to carry nuclear weapons.
 
No Bush-Yeltsin Meeting Is Set
 Asked today about reports that the two leaders might meet in Alaska before President Bush leaves office to sign a final accord, Mr. Fitzwater said neither side had scheduled any such session. But should an agreement be reached, another aide said, "I don't think anyone's ruling it out."

HEADLINE: A Door Opening Wide for the Poor

 BODY:
The City University of New York began in 1847 as a free academy for young men of poor and immigrant families who normally did not have access to other universities and colleges in the city.
Since then, CUNY has become one of the largest universities in the country. It has graduated 11 Nobel Prize winners and more corporate leaders than any other university system, based on a ranking by Standard and Poor's. 
 In 1870, Hunter College, an institution to educate young women to become teachers, was added. And in 1930 and 1937, Brooklyn and Queens Colleges joined what was to become known as the Big Four cornerstones of the City University system.
In 1947, New York Technical College became the city's first two-year institution, foreshadowing the later creation of nearly a dozen community colleges two decades later.
In a pivotal change in 1961, the relatively autonomous colleges were unified under a single chancellor. That year also marked the beginning of the Ph.D. programs at CUNY.
Nine years later, CUNY initiated its open-enrollment program, under which all high school graduates were guaranteed enrollment. The result was that CUNY became the third-largest university in the country, behind the State University of New York and the California State University system, with more than 200,000 students. In the 1970's, several more community colleges were created, causing CUNY's enrollment to grow to 250,000.
But the economic crisis that hit the city in 1976 caused CUNY to run out of operating money and close its doors for two weeks. A result was that the system was forced to end 129 years of free tuition. Another result was that its fiscal governance was largely transferred to the state.

HEADLINE: EUROPEANS FACING BATTLE OF BUDGET

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Instead of providing an occasion to repair tattered dreams of regional unity, a summit meeting of European Community leaders this week may well result in a new rift over an issue that deeply concerns all 12 member countries: who pays for and who benefits from the community budget.
The summit's agenda is already weighed down by seemingly more crucial problems -- the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Denmark's rejection of the treaty on European unity, French objections to a community farm trade agreement with the United States and applications for new membership in the community. 
 But behind the headlines, that perennial source of trouble -- money -- is threatening to dominate the meeting in Edinburgh, Scotland, this Friday and Saturday. The demands of poorer members for greater community assistance are likely to be confronted by the reluctance of the richer nations to pay out more.
Last week, Prime Minister John Major of Britain, chairman of the summit meeting, traveled the region trying to sell his proposed compromise on the budget dispute. "Insufficient," said Spain's Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez. "Disappointing," said Portugal's Prime Minister, Anibal Cavaco Silva.
 
Threat by 'Poor Four'
 Arguing that their partners are committed to helping them reach the community's average living standards, the so-called "poor four" -- Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal -- have now threatened to delay progress on other questions if they are rebuffed in Edinburgh.
Further, they contend that without additional help they stand no chance of taking part in the community's plan to create a single currency by 1999. Fears of a "two-speed Europe" would then be realized, they say, and the idea of economic unity would be undermined.
In response, the richer governments, led by Germany, Britain and France, have pleaded that they are constrained from greater generosity by economic recessions. Long the principal benefactor of the "poor four," Bonn has added that its new priority must be to develop former East Germany.
The fact that community finance ministers will attend the Edinburgh summit meeting is itself confirmation that the budget is shaping up to be a major issue of contention. And while seemingly an internal matter, the outcome of the debate is being awaited anxiously by more than just the 12 participating nations.
The "poor four" have specifically warned that they will block negotiations with new applicants for community membership until the budget question is resolved to their satisfaction. Austria, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland have already asked to join, and the plan has been for negotiations to start early next year.
Switzerland is now unlikely to pursue these negotiations after Swiss voters on Sunday rejected the country's participation in the planned single market with community members.
 
East Europeans Watching
 Some Eastern European countries that aspire to eventual membership as a way of advancing economically view the budget debate as a crucial gauge of the community's mood. If richer members are reluctant to help their current poorer partners, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia cannot hope for early entry into the community.
The money squabble has proved so divisive that community leaders postponed addressing it at their last two summit meetings. Since it relates to planned increases in the community's budget starting Jan. 1, 1993, however, a solution can no longer be put off.
All member states contribute to the budget, and therefore it must win the approval of all of them. Of the 12, however, only Germany, Britain, France and the Netherlands pay in more than they subsequently receive. This year, 58 percent of the budget has been spent on farming subsidies, while 30 percent has gone to helping backward regions or countries.
The poorer nations have the president of the community's executive commission, Jacques Delors, as their main ally. After paring down more ambitious targets, he has proposed raising the budget from 1.2 percent to 1.32 percent of the community's combined gross national product by 1999.
 
Budget Increase Seen
 Although the increase in monetary terms will depend on economic growth rates, the commission anticipates a budget increase from $75.5 billion this year to around $106 billion by 1999. A so-called Cohesion Fund, created specifically to finance development projects in the "poor four," would also grow, from $7.4 billion to $18.5 billion.
In contrast, the British compromise, already dismissed by Mr. Delors as "a serious political mistake," would have the budget grow to just 1.25 percent of the combined G.N.P., or an estimated $98.7 billion, by 1999, with the Cohesion Fund limited to $15 billion.
The passion being stirred by these numbers reflects the pain being inflicted throughout the region by this year's sudden economic slowdown.
Last week, Mr. Delors's commission estimated growth in the community at perhaps 1.5 percent next year. It forecast that average unemployment would remain over 11 percent until at least 1996. In almost every country, governments are cutting spending and becoming more unpopular, raising the risk of being turned out by voters.

HEADLINE: U.S. Lures Dominicans, Too, to the Cruel Sea

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Re public, Dec. 5

 BODY:
After failing to persuade relatives in New York to take her in, losing money on a counterfeit visa that was never delivered, and prostituting herself in the hope of finding an American willing to marry her long enough that she could emigrate legally, Josefina Archibald was down to what for many Dominicans represents the final hope.
In the dark of a seedy merengue bar in a run-down quarter of this sprawling capital recently, Miss Archibald, a 19-year-old mother of one whose education ended in junior high school, handed over to a man named Carlos the equivalent of $150. It represented one-half payment for a risky trip in a small boat that she expects to take her to Puerto Rico early next month. 
 "I want to help my family and I want nice things for my son, but the only thing for me here is prostitution," she said, explaining her decision to risk losing hard-won money yet again to racketeers, or even worse drowning at sea. "For a young person like me, reaching your country is the only way out."
While the chaotic exodus of boat people from neighboring Haiti has often received intense attention from the United States in the last year, Dominican and American authorities say that aspiring emigrants from this country like Miss Archibald are part of a quieter wave that over time may be every bit as large, if less dramatic, than the outflow from Haiti.
Their estimates vary, but officials of the United States Border Patrol and Dominican authorities say that year in and year out 10,000 to 20,000 people set out from coastal towns in the eastern part of this country into the dangerous currents of the 90-mile-wide Mona Passage hoping to reach Puerto Rico.
Officials say the emigrants run the gamut from the scantly educated, like Miss Archibald, to young professionals made desperate by a shortage of opportunity here even for those with university degrees.
Since the coup in Haiti in September 1991, about 40,000 Haitians have been intercepted by the United States Coast Guard trying to make the 500-mile trip to southern Florida. Three-quarters of those Haitians were returned to their country.
Last year, Dominican authorities, who acknowledge the true figure may be much higher, say that at least 1,200 people drowned at sea or simply disappeared as a result of these clandestine voyages, which are sold as 24-hour trips but often last much longer because of difficult sea conditions.
"It's a wonder that a lot of these boats make it five miles off shore they are built so cheaply," said Gary Labbe, a United States Border Patrol official in Puerto Rico, describing the 30-foot yawls. The boats are typically loaded with 50 or more passengers and powered with nothing larger than a 25-horsepower outboard motor.
Dominican authorities are burdened with a 30 percent unemployment rate and demands on their surveillance resources that range from an increase in drug shipments from South America to a long border with an even poorer neighbor, Haiti. Despite the loss of life from the exodus, they say there is little they can do to stop or even slow the outflow of their citizens.
Currently, people caught attempting the voyage or those returned from Puerto Rico are fined the equivalent of about $4 for leaving the country illegally, a small fraction of the $300 to $500 fee charged for a place on a boat. Officials say that proposed laws that would allow prosecution of boat runners for attempted murder and would increase penalties on people seeking to flee have been repeatedly defeated in the Congress because of fears of alienating voters desperate to leave the country. Others say corruption links many legislators to the rings that organize the traffic.
"It is well known that many of these groups are working hand in hand with lawmakers," said Eugenio Cabral, executive director of the Defensa Civil, which overseas many refugee matters. "There have even been cases where people have been caught engaging in this traffic when legislators have used their influence to help get them off."

HEADLINE: The Push and Pull Over Taxes

SERIES: Tax Politics -- First of four articles.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The 12 years of Republican reign seem, looking back, like a constant political war over taxes, a war that will almost certainly continue next year after Bill Clinton becomes President.
Year after year, ignoring the counsel of economists and business executives that the wisest tax code is a stable and predictable one, the laws were changed in important ways. It happened in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1989 and 1990, more frequent and detailed changes in taxes than ever before in American history, and another new law would have been adopted this year if President Bush had not cast a veto.
 
Change and More Change
 Income tax rates were slashed, cut again and then increased slightly. Tax breaks to encourage business investment and personal savings were widened, then repealed. A surtax on the elderly to pay the cost of catastrophic illnesses was approved in 1987 and retracted in 1988. Social Security, Medicare and gasoline taxes went up. Corporate taxes fell. 
 Hundreds of billions of dollars of tax liability was shifted around among individuals and companies. Over these years, tax policy was a pervasive issue in every Presidential election.
Except for the very rich and the very poor, the overall tax burden of Americans is about the same as it was a dozen years ago.
A family of three at the center of the income spectrum paid 19.8 percent of its earnings in Federal taxes in 1980, the year before Ronald Reagan became President. Next year, according to calculations by the Congressional Budget Office, such a family (with an income between about $29,000 and $42,000) will owe, on average, 19.5 percent.
Put another way, as a fraction of the economy, the amount of Federal, state and local taxes collected has remained almost constant. It was 27.8 percent of gross domestic product in 1980 and 28 percent last year.
But the fact that overall tax burdens remained rather stable masks the extent to which constant changes in the law forced people and companies to alter the way they saved and spent and invested their money. First, for instance, people were induced to invest in commercial real estate; then that carrot was withdrawn. One year savings accounts were tax free; the next year they were not. Deductions for medical expenses and sales taxes went by the boards.
 
Affecting Daily Life
 Tax policy, in short, became not only a driving force in the nation's politics, but in the way people ran their lives day to day.
And despite all the turmoil, politicians seem to feel just as strongly today that the tax system needs to be revamped as they did in 1980.
In this year's election, President Bush stressed the Republican dogma that Americans in general and rich people in particular are taxed too much for the good of the economy. President-elect Clinton campaigned on the familiar Democratic theme that the tax system is unfair -- too generous to the wealthy and too burdensome to the middle class.
Since Mr. Clinton won and since his Democratic allies in Congress seem disposed to give him the tax-policy changes he wants, in general if not in every particular, shots of Gucci Gulch -- the corridors of Capitol Hill so known because that is where the tax lobbyists lurk in their tasseled loafers -- will doubtless be staples on television news programs once again.
Mr. Clinton says he wants to raise income taxes on the wealthy, revive tax breaks for businesses to induce them to invest in machinery and equipment, crack down on tax avoidance by foreign companies doing business in the United States and give a modest tax cut to middle-class taxpayers.
As the Clinton proposals are debated, these questions will form the backdrop: Did the Republicans actually cut taxes or merely shift them around? Is the tax system more or less fair than it used to be? Are Americans taxed less than people in other countries? What are the flaws in the American tax system?
And finally, is Mr. Clinton offering the right tax medicine for the economy and the country?
 
Reagan's First Term

 The main theme of Ronald Reagan's Presidential campaign in 1980 was that Government was too big and taxes were too high. Adopting the view known as supply-side economics, he held that lower taxes on individuals and businesses would improve the economy by increasing work effort, savings, investment and production. Some of his advisers even maintained that economic growth spurred by reduced taxes would increase the Government's revenue.
Democrats in Congress, intimidated by Mr. Reagan's popularity and enticed by a seemingly pain-free approach to financing the Government, not only sided with the President but managed to one-up him with their generosity. The result was the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, the deepest tax cut in American history.
Businesses were allowed to write off the cost of their equipment much faster than the equipment actually deteriorated, a procedure known as accelerated depreciation. Along with the existing investment tax credit, this became the basis for many tax shelters.
Individuals got a 23 percent tax cut over three years, and the top rate paid by the wealthiest taxpayers was lowered to 50 percent from 70 percent. The rate on capital gains, the profits from investments, fell to 20 percent from 28. Breaks were devised for savings accounts, retirement accounts and two-earner families. Estate taxes were eliminated for many wealthy taxpayers.
And most important, in the view of C. Eugene Steuerle, a top tax official under Mr. Reagan and the author of a new book, "The Tax Decade," the law was written so that rates and exemptions would be adjusted automatically each year for inflation, meaning the Government would no longer collect more revenue just because prices and wages went up.
The new tax law had hardly been signed before many Administration officials and legislators realized they had acted irresponsibly. As a consequence, big tax increases were enacted in 1982 and 1984 to offset some of the lost revenue. Social Security taxes were raised substantially in 1983 to put the shaky retirement system back on sound footing.
 
Tax Reform
Broad Overhaul Limits Deductions
 By 1984, the tax system was a mess. Many of the nation's largest and most profitable corporations took such advantage of legal loopholes that they paid no taxes whatsoever. People with similar incomes paid vastly different amounts in taxes, and many wealthy individuals sought out tax shelters rather than productive investments.
After his re-election, Mr. Reagan gave what he called tax reform his highest legislative priority. And leading Democrats like Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, realizing that they too could gain political mileage, joined Mr. Reagan as allies.
The road was a long and tortuous one, and countless lawmakers, lobbyists and bureaucrats fell by the wayside. But in October 1986, President Reagan had signed the Tax Reform Act, the most comprehensive overhaul of the country's tax structure since World War II.
The foundation of the legislation was a sharp reduction in income tax rates and the elimination or restriction of hundreds of deductions, exemptions and other tax breaks.
The top tax rate on individuals, 70 percent when Mr. Reagan became President, was lowered to 28 percent, and the maximum corporate rate was reduced to 34 percent from 46 percent.
Among the familiar deductions that were scrapped or limited were those for state and local sales taxes, individual retirement accounts, consumer interest payments, medical expenses, union dues and business meals. Tax shelters were essentially abolished, as was a special rate for capital gains.
Banks, insurance companies, real estate interests, oil and gas producers and smokestack industries lost valuable tax write-offs. The taxes of nearly every household and business were affected. It was one of the most monumental pieces of legislation in American history.
 
Bush's Struggle
'Read My Lips' And Capital Gains
 George Bush never bought into tax reform. As Vice President, he did little work on behalf of the Reagan measure and tried unsuccessfully behind the scenes to preserve tax advantages for the oil and gas industry.
In his 1988 campaign, Mr. Bush's tax policy was stated in one memorable sentence, "Read my lips: no new taxes." As President, the one tax matter that seemed to engage him was the treatment of capital gains. He wasted considerable political muscle trying unsuccessfully to lower the rate on investment profits, which are enjoyed mostly by the wealthiest taxpayers.
Mr. Bush and the Democrats jockeyed for position in 1989, but by the next year they were at each other's throats over taxes as they tried to strike a deal to lower the budget deficit.
Time and again, Mr. Bush took a firm stand, only to waver. In the end, the President suffered a miserable defeat. His advocacy of a reduced capital gains rate enabled his Democratic opponents to portray him as a patron of fat cats. And by signing a tax increase, he reneged on his central campaign promise.
The 1990 law raised taxes on wealthy people by lifting the top rate to 31 percent from 28 percent and by restricting some of their deductions and exemptions. It also removed millions of the poorest Americans from the tax rolls altogether.
But the main effect was political. The struggle over the budget deal underscored Mr. Bush's indecisiveness on domestic issues. Then, and again with his veto of the tax bill this year, the President seemed more concerned with the affluent than with ordinary taxpayers. In many respects, this portended his political downfall.
 
The Effects
Shuffle Puts More In Deepest Pockets
 One popular misconception is that the Republican tax cuts caused the crippling Federal budget deficit, now approaching $300 billion a year. The fact is, the large deficit resulted because the Government vastly increased what it spent each year, while tax revenues changed little.
In terms of tax policy, the Reagan and Bush Administrations succeeded mainly in shifting around the kind of taxes Americans pay. Payroll taxes for Social Security have risen steeply. Income taxes have fallen, and taxes on corporate profits are way down.
While most Americans basically broke even, the wealthiest enjoyed something of a windfall.
Economists at the Congressional Budget Office have calculated that the richest 1 percent of taxpayers -- families earning more than about $200,000 annually -- owe 9 percent less in taxes each year, on average, than they would have if the laws had remained unchanged.
That amounts to an average tax reduction for these affluent taxpayers of around $16,000 -- enough, say, for a handsome new car or a year's tuition at a fine university.
Whether this is fair depends on one's perspective.
Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a research center with ties to organized labor, asserted in an interview that it was quite unfair. "Rich people," he said, "are way undertaxed based on what they can afford, what they used to pay and what they would pay in other countries."
But others hold that the entire economy would be weakened and that everyone would suffer if the rich were taxed more. Norman B. Ture, a developer of tax policy under President Reagan and now the president of a research organization called the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation, said the wealthy were "the most productive people in the country." He added, "Tax them more, and if you think that will have no effect on their behavior, then you have to assume they are very peculiar human beings."
The wealthy now pay a higher proportion of total taxes than they did in 1980. But their share of total income has grown even more than their share of the tax burden.
 
A Global Perspective
Seeking Solutions To System's Flaws
 The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, an association of the world's industrial nations, calculates that taxes in the United States are lower than they are in this country's main economic competitors -- slightly lower than taxes in Japan and considerably lower than those in Europe.
This is one of the strongest arguments used by economists who hold that Americans are undertaxed. But the O.E.C.D. figures can be misleading. For instance, the health care system in Europe is financed by taxes. In the United States, medical costs are borne mostly by private insurance paid by employers. The tax statistics do not reflect this difference and others.
"People in the United States are taxed less, it's pretty clear, but how much less is very hard to measure," said Timothy M. Smeeding, an economist at Syracuse University who studies the comparative economies of different countries.
Whatever the comparison with other countries, economists across the political scale agree that several aspects of the American tax system are badly flawed.
One is that the system encourages consumption and discourages saving. Another is that it gives real estate an advantage over other investments. A third is that the tax treatment is more favorable if companies borrow money than if they raise capital by issuing stock.
But while the economists agree on the problems, no consensus exists on the solutions.
Some economists want to tax consumption instead of income, but that would be a boon to rich people who can afford to spend a smaller proportion of what they earn. Some want to phase out or otherwise restrict deductions for mortgage interest to put real estate on an equal footing with other investments, but that would cause an upheaval in the housing market. Some would abolish the corporate profits tax or eliminate the tax on dividends so that the money is not taxed twice, but that would cost the Government much more revenue than it can afford to lose.
 
Clintonomics
Economists Shun Tax-Cutting Plan
 Mr. Clinton's tax policy is still under development, but he seems to have approached the matter from a political perspective rather than an economic or theoretical one.
He would be hard-pressed, for instance, to find a prominent economist, Republican or Democrat, who favors his campaign promise to give Americans making less than $80,000 a tax cut of a few hundred dollars a year.
"I hope he changes his mind about the middle-class tax cut," said Henry Aaron, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution and a strong supporter of the President-elect. "The last thing this nation needs right now is a large tax cut for any group."
But Mr. Clinton insists that raising the taxes of the wealthy and cutting the taxes of the middle class is not only fair but necessary.
"The American people," he said at a news conference last month, "will be much more willing to accept the argument that all have to sacrifice and contribute over the long run if they believe we're starting from a fair tax system, and I don't believe we are today."
With that in mind, he has said he wants to raise the top tax rate on families earning more than about $200,000 a year to 36 percent from 31 percent. He wants to impose a surtax on incomes of more than $1 million and to stiffen the minimum tax owed by wealthy individuals who have big deductions or considerable tax-free income.
As for businesses, Mr. Clinton said in the campaign that he could raise $45 billion over four years with tougher enforcement of tax laws on foreign companies that do business in the United States. But since the election, some of his economic advisers have acknowledged that they may be able to raise only a fraction of that amount.
More attention has been given to his proposals for an investment tax credit to businesses to help stimulate the economy. Mr. Clinton has not said how large the tax break should be, which investments should be covered, which industries should benefit or whether the credit should be permanent or temporary.
Those matters are likely to be the subject of fierce lobbying and debate, one more skirmish in the continuing political war over taxes.


GRAPHIC: The nominal tax rates published by the Government tell little about what taxpayers actually pay, thanks to the tax code's many deductions, exclusions, allowances, credits and surcharges, and varying rates applied to different parts of a family's total income.
Charts/Graphs: "Effective Tax Rates"
 Effective rates solve the problem by taking a family's ultimate tax bill and treating it as if it were a simple percentage of the family's adjusted income. ("Family" includes families of one person -- a single taxpayer with no dependents.)
 In the chart, the population is divided into give groups of equal numbers of people, called quintiles, based on adjusted family income. Each quintile includes 45 million people for 1980 and 51.4 million for 1993.
 A family is assigned to a quintile based on how its income compares with incomes of other families of the same size. For example, a one-person family in the middle quintile in 1993 would earn between $18,333 and $27,126, but a two-person family in the same quintile would earn between $24,459 and $34,712.
 The graphs track percentages of all Federal taxes, Federal individual income tax, Social Security and similar taxes paid by all taxpayers, the five quintiles alluded to above, and the richest one percent of families. (Source: Congressional Budget Office) (pg. D15)
 
"Piece of the Action"
 The total tax burden on the economy -- measured by comparing tax receipts to the gross domestic product -- grew steadily from the mid-1950's until 1969, but has remained roughly stable since then.
 The makeup of the tax take has changed greatly over the years. Federal taxes on corporate profits now account for much less of the total, and Social Security and similar taxes much more than they did in the 1950's. State and local individual income taxes have also grown substantially.
 The graph tracks total tax receipts (from Federal individual income taxes, Social Security and similar taxes, Federal corporate profits taxes, other Federal taxes, state and local individual income taxes, and other state and local taxes) as a percentage of gross domestic product. The years for which the data is shown are 1946, 1960, 1969, 1975, 1981, and 1991. (Source: C. Eugene Steuerle, "The Tax Decade" [Urban Institute Press]) (pg. D15)

HEADLINE: Trenton Seeks Guarantees For College

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Assembly Republicans today proposed a $75 million bond act to finance a package of education bills highlighted by guaranteed financial aid for New Jersey high school graduates attending college or vocational school in the state.
To qualify, all students would have to do is successfully complete 12 semester hours at an accredited college in the state -- regardless of their families' financial status or whether the school is public or private. Education experts said there was no precedent for a state making such an offer. 
 Voters must approve the proposed bond act and the Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, said he would try to push the bills through the Legislature in time to place the measure on the ballot next November. If passed by the voters, the target date for the program to begin would be January 1994.
Among the unanswered questions today was whether the bond act would raise enough money to provide loans for all those who might want them. It was also unclear how the state could enforce repayment of the loans in a way that would keep the aid fund solvent; Federal student loan programs have been plagued by defaults.
Assemblyman Thomas S. Smith, one of the legislators sponsoring the four-bill package, described it as "a clear departure from the past."
"We are implicitly saying that New Jersey young people have a right to an education beyond the high school level," he said.
The maximum amount of the loans per year could not exceed the annual tuition at Rutgers University, now $3,254 a year. The state would pay the tuition directly to the school.
Students would be required to sign a contract that specified that upon graduation, they would repay the loan through payroll deduction or by direct payment if they are self-employed at a rate of $2,000 a year, or 10 percent of their salary, whichever amount is greater.
Students would make one extra year of payments after the loan is repaid. So for each student the service charge would be either $2,000 or 10 percent of their salary, whichever is greater. All money would be redeposited into the college tuition loan fund, Mr. Wolfe said.
 
'Bad Idea,' Expert Says
 One legislator described the plan as "a mom and apple pie" issue that legislators would be hard-pressed to oppose. But the political payoff could create fiscal complications down the road. By looking to a bond act to finance the plan, the Legislature risks opening the way for a host of other bonds to pay for projects that traditionally had been paid for through appropriations.
Morton Owens Schapiro, chairman of the Economics Department at the University of Southern California and a national expert on higher education finance, called the New Jersey proposal a "bad idea."
"It is the last thing we need right now," he said. "When you combine the fact that public colleges and universities are hurting for money and that wealthier kids are going to public colleges and universities in increasing numbers, it is natural to conclude that what should be done is to ask students who can afford it to pay a larger proportion of costs."
Mr. Schapiro said he knew of no other state tuition plan in which any student, regardless of financial status, was eligible.
"The fact that they are not capping it, seems to me, that it is a political bill, not an economic one," said Mr. Schapiro, who grew up in Union, N.J.
The ranking Democrat on the Assembly Education Committee, Assemblyman Joseph Charles Jr., attacked the Republican plan as riddled with legal, financial and social shortcomings, and timed to "set the political agenda" for next year's elections.
"This bonding proposal is a politically crafty way of attempting to provide aid for upper-income families," Mr. Charles said. "This proposal fails to target the middle-class people who need the aid the most. These stipends should not be open-ended."
 
$10 Million Reading Program
 Sponsors of the legislation said they had not actually projected how many students would be eligible for the program, but they said it might require issuing more bonds if the demand outstripped the financing.
Mr. Haytaian and the three freshman legislators who joined him at today's news conference -- Assemblywoman Priscilla B. Anderson and Assemblymen Smith and David W. Wolfe -- described the package as landmark legislation to combat illiteracy, to improve student achievement and to make it possible for everyone to afford a post-secondary education.
One bill in the four-bill package would establish the $75 million bond act and the other three would appropriate the money. In addition to $45 million for college tuition loans and $20 million for vocational school loans, the plan calls for a $10 million reading tutorial program for the third through the seventh grades.
The vocational tuition loan bill, co-sponsored by Assemblyman Paul DiGaetano, is similar to the proposed college program. The Republicans said there are 60,000 students currently enrolled in 200 trade schools in New Jersey.
The final bill in the package, sponsored by Ms. Anderson, would establish through the State Department of Education a reading tutorial program for third to seventh grade students.
Retired teachers would be enlisted to staff the program, which would be offered to public schools, but not required, Ms. Anderson said. The teachers would be paid the state minimum wage of $5.05 an hour.
Of the three programs, the tutorial plan is the only one that is not self-perpetuating. For the program to continue beyond the four years envisioned in the Anderson bill it would require another bond issue or an appropriation.
Mr. Florio, a Democrat, said he had not seen the Republican proposals and he declined to comment on them.
Mr. Haytaian's support of the package of bills means they are likely to move swiftly through the Assembly and to have strong support in the Senate. With a 58-to-22 majority in the Assembly and a 27-to-13 advantage in the Senate, the Republicans can with or without Mr. Florio's support get the plan onto the ballot.

HEADLINE: Credit Markets;
Reports of Clinton Nominees Ease Fears of Bond Traders

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market rallied yesterday as it absorbed the names mentioned over the weekend for important economic appointments in the Clinton Administration. The price of the 30-year bond was up almost half a point, and prices of Treasury notes rose across the board.
Traders and analysts said they were encouraged by the expected choice of Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Finance Committee, as Secretary of the Treasury, and the consideration of other potential appointees like Representative Leon E. Panetta, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, as director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
 But the market might have reacted more strongly, these analysts said, with the appointment of another candidate on President-elect Bill Clinton's short list: Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve.
"I don't think these guys are market movers," Charles Liberman, managing director of financial markets research at Chemical Securities, said of the potential appointees. "But in the absence of the Volcker choice, these other guys are acceptable."
From Bill Clinton's point of view, the expected appointments could not have come at a better time in the bond market. As reflected in the rally on Friday and yesterday, there is a new feeling that the spending and tax program Mr. Clinton has promised to stimulate the economy is now less threatening to the bond market.
At the same time, the employment data released on Friday showed that the economy, while growing, was not moving ahead as fast as many in the market feared.
Together, these themes weave a positive background for the market as the end of the year draws near. But some analysts, like Mr. Liberman, assert that investors and traders have gone too far if they are assuming there will be only a small fiscal stimulus program, or none at all.
Some analysts say they think the stronger than expected growth means that Mr. Clinton can propose a much smaller fiscal stimulus program. This means there is less risk of overstimulating the economy and igniting inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income investments. In addition, a smaller package means the Federal budget deficit will not grow as much in the next year or two, allowing the new President to concentrate more on deficit reduction.
 
 
Higher Rates Unlikely
 At the same time, the fact that the economy is not moving ahead too fast means that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates soon and that inflation is not moving higher. The hold on interest rates is good for shorter Treasury maturities and the hold on inflation is good for the 30-year bond and longer-term notes.
"The Fed is not going to tighten, and the deficit is not going to be let loose," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist for the First Boston Corporation. "That is a pretty good background for the market."
This background has allowed the price of the 30-year bond to jump a point and 7/32 point in two trading days. In late trading yesterday, the Treasury's 30-year bond was offered at a price of 1024/32 , up 14/32 , to yield 7.44 percent. That was down from 7.48 percent on Friday and 7.55 percent on Thursday. Friday was the first time since Oct. 14 that the yield had dipped below 7.50 percent.
Prices and yields move in opposite directions. Rising prices add to the value of bonds and notes while reducing the yields. When yields rise, the value of the security declines.
 
 
Note Prices Also Rise
 The prices of Treasury notes were also up yesterday, although, like the price of the 30-year bond, they fell from their intraday highs at the end of the trading day. The price of the 10-year note was up 8/32 to yield 6.77 percent, down from 6.81 percent on Friday and 6.89 percent on Thursday. The price of the two-year note was up 3/32 to yield 4.62 percent, down from 4.69 percent on Friday and 4.77 percent on Thursday.
The discount rates on Treasury bills also fell, but some analysts said that the results in the Treasury auction of three-month and six-month bills was a little disappointing, given the recent rally. The average discount rate on the three-month bill was 3.29 percent, down from 3.31 percent last week, and the average yield on the six-month bill was 3.37 percent. down from 3.46 percent last week.
Until Friday, many analysts had said they thought the jump in discount rates on Treasury bills and the rise in yields on short-term Treasury notes had been overdone. They argued that investors, traders and speculators had assumed that the economy was growing quite fast and had bet that the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates soon.
But when the market began to rally after Friday's moderate employment report, a lot of traders who had sold notes short, betting prices would fall, had to buy them to cover their positions, adding to the force of the rally.
Mr. Soss of First Boston now wonders if the rally in the shorter end of the market will be as overdone as the decline. "They were oversold, so now presumably they will rally until they are overbought," he said.
 
 
Still Expects Stimulus
 Mr. Liberman of Chemical Securities said he was not ready to believe that Mr. Clinton would have only a very small fiscal stimulus program, or none. Citing comments from Clinton aides, he said the President-elect believed he had won because President Bush was mismanaging the economy.
"So he is going to be sure to provide enough stimulus, so as the economy improves he can claim credit," he said.
It was difficult, traders said, to determine yesterday how much of the rally reflected approval of Mr. Clinton's apparent choices for important economic posts. Mr. Soss said, "The good economic backdrop allows you to treat all news in a midly favorable fashion."
William M. Brachfeld, an executive vice president of Daiwa Securities, said it was difficult to tell because so many customers who are big buyers had already closed their books for the year.
"No matter what happens, they are not going to do anything, and that's the real money," he said. "So you'll have to wait until next year."
Following are results from the Treasury auction yesterday of three-month and six month bills:

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
Town Sees Small Gain In Big Fight

BYLINE: By John T. McQuiston

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I.

 BODY:
THE last decade has been hard on this historic village, once the center of commerce and industry on Long Island. As shoppers abandoned Hempstead's downtown and retailers moved out, crime, especially drug dealing, increased.
But over the weekend, for a few hours at least, the street corners were "virtually free of crime." 
 It took a six-month police investigation and a drug sweep that rounded up 104 low-level dealers to bring about the change, but officials here are saying it is a start.
"Little by little we're drying up the street corners," Mayor James Garner said yesterday. "And we hope to make Hempstead a safer place for citizens to live and raise their families."
Hempstead is the oldest village in Nassau County and is at the county's center. At the turn of the century it was the hub of commercial activity on Long Island. Even as things began to change in the 1980's, Hempstead's population continued to grow. From 1980 to 1990, it rose from 40,404 to 49,453, up 22.4 percent, making it among the fastest growing communities in the New York region.
White middle-class residents were moving out and gradually Hempstead went from a virtually all-white community to one in which whites are a minority. Between 1980 and 1990, the black population of the village increased to 32,033, from 29,088, while people speaking Spanish grew to 9,454, from 3,445. Whites declined to 15,550, from 16,010.
"It's the only village on Long Island with a racial mix like this," Mayor Garner said.
At the same time, the number of poor people was rapidly increasing. As of 1990, 12.5 percent of the village's residents were living below the poverty line, one of Long Island's highest concentrations of poor people.
Crime rose, and the downtown area developed a reputation as being unsafe. With malls luring away shoppers, the downtown was deserted by major retailers, the latest being Abraham & Straus, which moved in October to the nearby Roosevelt Shopping Center in Garden City. It had occupied what was once the largest suburban department store in the nation.
Drug dealing is now the Police Department's biggest concern, said James Russo, the chief of police.
He said that the arrests in the five-day sweep begun last Tuesday night had cleared the village of drug dealers and left the streets "virtually free of crime" by Sunday night.
Many of the dealers, he said, were repeat offenders who hang out primarily near housing projects on Terrace Avenue, South Franklin Street and Arbemarle Avenue. Two of the suspects were 15 years old.
The arrests ended a six-month investigation, said Joseph Burruano, the county prosecutor in charge of the burglary and narcotics unit. He said the defendants were selling crack and cocaine, ranging in price from $20 to $100, to undercover officers.
Mr. Burruano said efforts were under way to expand the fight against drugs from the street level in Hempstead up the ladder to the middle-level distributors and major suppliers, a battle he acknowledged "would take much time and effort."
Chief Russo said that the sweep was the eighth in the last few years and that more than 1,000 street-level drug pushers had been arrested.
Of those charged over the weekend, nearly all the suspects were from Hempstead. Most were young and unemployed, said Chief Russo.
They were charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class "B" felony, punishable by up to 25 years in prison upon conviction.
But Mr. Burruano said he expected the "vast majority" with no previous convictions to serve between 60 days and 6 months, while those with previous convictions would serve between 4 1/2 and 9 years in prison.
Chief Russo said he thought the punishment was not severe enough and was among the reasons why many repeat offenders were arrested in the latest sweep.
But he said he was not discouraged. "We just have to keep locking them up," he said.

HEADLINE: Florio Presents Proposal To Restructure State Debt

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The Florio administration unveiled today a $1.6 billion bond refinancing and new debt plan that would capitalize on lower interest rates to pump more than $900 million into New Jersey's state coffers over the next three years, but at the expense of higher bond payments later.
The bond restructuring plan would allow the state to refinance $700 million in existing bonds and issue an additional $900 million in bonds without voter approval. 
 The State Treasurer, Samuel F. Crane, said the plan would allow New Jersey to take advantage of lower interest rates for both the refinanced bonds and the new ones.
Under the plan, the state would be acting like a homeowner who takes advantage of low interest rates to refinance an existing mortgage, thus lowering his monthly payments, and then takes out a second mortgage, which supplies extra cash. But in this case, the second loan is used mostly to pay interest on the first loan.
The money from the new bonds would be used to pay the state's debt service for three years, thus releasing the money normally used for that purpose to meet other needs.
 
Call for Quick Approval
 The tradeoff is that after the three-year period the state's annual bond payments will be $87 million higher for 17 years. In other words, the state will pay nearly $1.5 billion to use the $900 million for three years.
But Mr. Crane told the Legislature's Joint Budget Oversight Committee that the new borrowing would be necessary within a few years anyway, and borrowing now will allow the state to take advantage of low interest rates rather than running the risk that rates will rise.
He asked the committee to approve the plan quickly, but both Republicans and Democrats complained that they were being pressured into precipitous action. John Lynch of New Brunswick, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, said, "I am always concerned when I hear that we have something magnificent but it has to be done yesterday."
"What we will be doing," he said, "is increasing by 12.5 percent the amount of bond debt."
Mr. Crane said he wanted the plan approved immediately so he could get the new financing in place "before Christmas week." Doing so, he said, would allow the state to avoid a $50 million debt payment in January.
However, the committee, dominated by Republicans, recessed so its staff could study the proposal in detail. No time was set for a decision.
Mr. Crane said the debt refinancing and new borrowing would allow the state to accelerate capital construction projects that he said would create 17,000 jobs. Though a formal program has not been drawn up, he said, a broad range of projects, including schools and colleges, hospitals, libraries, veterans' homes and similar projects, would be considered.
The funds freed through the use of new bond money to pay debt service would initially increase the state's unappropriated surplus -- that is, it would be set aside for emergencies. The unappropriated surplus is now only $31 million, which both Mr. Crane and Wall Street's credit rating analysts consider far too low.
 
Fiscal Weatherizing
 The low surplus was cited as the major reason that Moody's Investors Service slightly lowered the state's bond rating, a measure of its credit worthiness, earlier this year.
Mr. Crane said that if the plan is approved, the state would be able to add $235 million to the surplus.
Over the two fiscal years from July 1993 through June 1995, he said, the new financing would also allow the state to deposit $100 million in its "Rainy Day Fund," which was created last year to deal with emergencies created by budget shortfalls. The remaining money freed by borrowing the $900 million to pay debt service, about $565 million, would go to capital construction projects.
The state's ability to issue the $900 million in new general obligation bonds without the referendum that would normally be required, Mr. Crane said, results from the Refunding Bond Act of 1985, which gave the state broader authority to refinance bonds to take advantage of favorable interest rates.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
T.W.A. Pact On Pensions Is Reached

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Carl C. Icahn virtually wrote the final chapter in an era in aviation history and to his involvement with financially troubled Trans World Airlines yesterday by reaching an agreement with the Government to support the airline's pension funds.
If approved by the bankruptcy court, the agreement with the Pension Guarantee Benefit Corporation will allow the airline to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors. It could also enable Mr. Icahn, a major figure in high-stakes corporate takeovers, to bow out of the airline with little financial damage. 
 The agreement, calling for Mr. Icahn to put up $200 million in cash to keep the airline operating, will be submitted to bankruptcy court Jan. 12, and Mr. Icahn will relinquish control of the carrier upon final approval, expected in about 30 days. The reorganized airline, whose future remains precarious, will be owned 55 percent by its unsecured creditors and the remainder by its 22,700 employees.
At a news conference in Washington yesterday, Robin Wilson, a member of T.W.A.'s two-man management committee, said, "T.W.A. will be a very competitive carrier -- not just in costs but in aggressive pursuit of revenue gains as well." The other committee member is Glenn R. Zander.
But analysts were not as optimistic. "T.W.A.'s future will clearly depend on the general state of the airline industry, including an economic recovery which will hopefully fuel the resumption of traffic growth," Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers said. "Its future will be beyond its control."
The agreement also calls for Mr. Icahn to provide about $80 million in minimum financing and to guarantee a total of $240 million payable over eight years to support the airline's existing pension plans in the event of a T.W.A. failure. The carrier earlier had pledged a note of $300 million to the plans, secured by its international routes and Kansas City maintenance base.
Last week, Aviation Daily, an industry publication, reported that T.W.A., supported by its unions and creditors, had undertaken a lobbying effort to win the pension corporation's blessing of the settlement. It said the effort was supported by Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican, and Senator John Danforth, the Missouri Republican.
While one airline analyst, who would not comment for the record, said Mr. Icahn appeared to have gotten off relatively easily, other analysts disagree.
"I think everybody got off well," Paul Karos of First Boston said.
Mr. Icahn also sounded pleased. "They have low costs and a good balance sheet," he said, referring to the airline.
The expected departure of Mr. Icahn will also remove from the industry one of the last of the individual investors who put up their money in an effort to imprint their personalities on the industry.

HEADLINE: Buying Surge Sends Dow Up by 18.65

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks were swept higher by a wave of buying yesterday as investors appeared more upbeat about corporate earnings and less worried that President-elect Bill Clinton's economic stimulus package would fire up inflation.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed 18.65 points higher at 3,307.33. Advancing issues led decliners, 1,210 to 673, on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was 220.1 million shares, compared with 235 million on Friday. 
 The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.93 points to a new high of 666.53. It was the eighth record close in nine sessions for the index.
Also setting new highs was the New York Stock Exchange composite index, which rose 1.59 points, to 239.36, and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, which gained 3.25 to close at 435.31. The American Stock Exchange index lost 0.59, to 394.36.
"It's a continuation of what happened last week," said Bob Antolini, head of over-the-counter trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Investors view secondary stocks as strong performers in a slow economic recovery and benefiting from tax policies of the incoming Clinton Administration.
Analysts said gains in the Dow component American Express contributed to the rise in the blue-chip barometer. American Express ended up 1 1/2, to 24 7/8, on a heavy volume of 8.9 million shares on reports that James D. Robinson 3d, company chairman, is stepping down after more than 15 years at the helm. Some analysts said strong gains in the bond market also buoyed stocks. Shares in Rayonier Timberlands L.P. plummeted 2 1/2, to 37. The Connecticut-based timber partnership said it did not know why its share price fell.
American Dental Laser soared 4 1/8, to 9 3/4, topping the Nasdaq net gainers list. The company said the Food and Drug Administration decided Friday to allow it to begin marketing a new dental device. Microsoft rose 1 5/8, to 93 3/8, and Intel rose 1/4, to 79.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Two Ad-Spending Forecasts Debate Amount of Growth

BYLINE: By Adam Bryant

 BODY:
BY the time 1992 is over, advertising spending in the United States will have risen 4.5 percent over 1991, a leading industry researcher said yesterday.
To a degree, an increase over 1991 was relatively easy to achieve, since the drop in ad spending last year marked the first such drop in 30 years. 
 And even though the estimate for 1992 by Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and director of forecasting for McCann-Erickson U.S.A., represents a cut of half a percentage point from his last estimate in June, he still spoke hopefully that the long-troubled economy was improving and would buoy the fortunes of the advertising industry. "I think the worst is over," he said at the opening session of the 20th annual Paine Webber media conference in Manhattan. "Optimism will gradually take hold."
Mr. Coen's track record as forecaster suggests he prefers to err on the side of optimism, but the revised 4.5 percent increase in ad spending for 1992, which is projected to total $132.1 billion, marks the second time he has slashed his estimate. A year ago, he projected that 1992 ad spending would grow 6.2 percent over 1991. In June, he cut his estimate to 5 percent.
According to Mr. Coen, local advertising continued to lag behind spending on national advertising this year. Newspapers and Yellow Pages have fared poorly because of the softness in classified and retail advertising. Mr. Coen said gains are likely next year because of the recent low levels in these categories.
Mr. Coen said that while his projections for advertising and economic growth proved overly optimistic through much of 1992, ad spending is now expanding faster than the economy. The gross domestic product grew at 3.9 percent in the third quarter, a rate well above many economists' projections.
For 1993, Mr. Coen predicted that United States advertising spending would grow by 6.9 percent, to $141.2 billion. If that estimate proves accurate, it would mark the first time since 1987 that United States advertising growth significantly outpaced economic growth.
One reason for the rosy prediction is that marketers are expected to turn increasingly to advertising, rather than coupons or other trade promotions, because more confident consumers will need to be lured less with promotions. Such predictions for 1993 are also noteworthy because those gains must come on top of the increased ad spending this year for the Winter and Summer Olympic Games.
Mr. Coen projected a 5.9 percent rise in ad spending worldwide in 1992, and another 5.9 percent gain worldwide in 1993.
After Mr. Coen made his semiannual forecast at the conference, which continues this week at the McGraw-Hill Building in midtown Manhattan, John Perriss, chairman and chief executive of the Zenith Media Worldwide subsidiary of Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C., presented less optimistic predictions.
He estimated that United States ad spending would grow a meager six-tenths of 1 percent this year, compared with a previous forecast of 1.2 percent growth. He also revised his forecast slightly upward for 1993 major media spending in North America to 3.2 percent growth compared with a July prediction of 3 percent.
"There will be steady improvement but no great bounce-back until economic conditions improve," Mr. Perriss said.
Mr. Perriss estimated that worldwide advertising would grow 4 percent in 1992 over 1991, and he also predicted a "very modest recovery" in 1993, an increase of 3.2 percent expected for the United States and 5.3 percent for worldwide advertising growth. The Asia/Pacific market continues to be yoked by Japan's economic difficulties, Mr. Perriss said. In Europe, the market is being hurt by declining demand as well as large increases in media supply.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls and Gold Gains, But Trading Volume Is Light

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply yesterday in extremely thin trading on the world's currency markets.
Gold prices rose slightly after falling overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $336.10 an ounce, up 40 cents from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold rose 40 cents an ounce, to a late bid of $336.00. 
 Analysts said that the dollar sold off overnight in foreign markets and that the selling continued when trading shifted to the United States.
"The dollar fell like a rock," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with IDEA, an advisory firm. "Thin market conditions exacerbated fund managers' selling of dollars."
Much attention focused on the Swiss franc, which rose despite the Sunday rejection by Swiss voters of a proposal to affiliate with the European Community. The market seemed to conclude that Switzerland's "relative isolation from the community is a good thing," Mr. Chandler said.
Traders said that any fresh data on the United States economy was expected to confirm that the recovery was finally on track. No extreme reactions are expected in the market.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to close at 124.87 Japanese yen, from 124.63 yen at the Friday close. Later, in London, it fell to 124.40 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 123.75 yen, down from 124.93 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5875, from $1.5585 late Friday. In New York it cost $1.5980 to buy 1, compared with $1.5593 of Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with the late Friday rates, included: 1.5563 German marks, down from 1.5925; 1.3935 Swiss francs down from 1.4280; 5.3025 French francs, down from 5.4140; 1,374.50 Italian lire, down from 1,397.00, and 1.2727 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2776.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with the late Friday rates, included: 1.5680 German marks, down from 1.5950; 1.3995 Swiss francs, down from 1.4315; 5.3640 French francs, down from 5.4225.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $334.75 an ounce, from $335.65 late Friday. In Zurich, it fell to a closing bid of $334.80 from $335.60.

HEADLINE: Retailers' Holiday Optimism

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The nation's retail chains said yesterday that they expected stronger Christmas sales this year, but they warned that it would be a long time before consumers resumed spending the way they did before the recession.
The National Retail Federation, meeting in New York, predicted growth of 5 to 6 percent in Christmas sales, up from 1 to 2 percent a year ago. Rising consumer confidence and colder weather are helping this year's gains, the group said. 
 Adjusting for inflation, Christmas sales will be up 3.5 percent at stores open a year or more, the group said.
But some retailers warned that times had changed, and that the American economy had entered an era characterized by layoffs among big employers like the auto and military industries.
"Today's consumer is cautious and will not change," Joseph Antonini, the chairman of the Kmart Corporation, said in a speech to the federation.
"I see 2 to 3 to 4 percent growth for the next several years," he said, speaking of the industry over all. "The reason for that is the jobs situation. I do not see a robust rebound in the economy."
Mr. Antonini said that holiday sales at Kmart's stores open more than a year would be up 4 to 5 percent and that the chain's total sales would rise 9 to 10 percent for the season.

Baseball Owners Vote to Reopen Labor Talks

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., Dec. 7

 BODY:
By the slimmest of majorities, 15-13, the major league baseball owners voted today to reopen negotiations on the collective bargaining agreement with the players, instantly creating speculation that the absence of a new agreement could jeopardize the beginning of the 1993 season.
Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, played down the likelihood of a lockout, saying that "everybody wants to see no disruption in baseball" and disclosing that the owners without dissent raised from a simple majority (15) to a three-fourths vote (21) the authorization required for a lockout. 
 Ravitch, one baseball official said, worked hard to get the necessary majority. One of his primary sales pitches was that the reopener and lockout were separate issues. He apparently succeeded in convincing some of the wavering owners of that view, though others said it was naive.
In the weeks leading up to today's vote, various owners had described the position of the group as sharply, and evenly, divided. Today's vote, conducted in a secret ballot, underscored that assessment and left some question about the support Ravitch will have as he tries to negotiate a change in the way that the clubs pay players.
"I think the owners will stand behind me 100 percent as I try to achieve our bargaining objectives," Ravitch said at a news conference. But he added: "Sure, it would be an easier negotiation if all 28 owners were of one mind. I can't deny that."
 
Fehr Says He Wasn't Notified
 Donald Fehr, head of the players' union, said he had not received a call from Ravitch or anyone else affiliated with the clubs notifying him of their decision.
Asked about the possible significance of the bare majority, he said: "I don't treat it with any particular significance. I have said for a long time that Ravitch is their man. They have asked him to fix the problem and he would get as many votes as he needed."
Speaking of Ravitch's stance on baseball labor matters, Fehr said, "People he allied with during the summer are people who would be viewed as hard-liners." Fehr didn't identify any owners, but he was clearly referring to Bud Selig of the Milwaukee Brewers and Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox.
In late May and early June, Selig, Reinsdorf and Ravitch tried to get Fay Vincent, who was then commissioner, to relinquish his authority in labor relations. Vincent refused, but the effort mushroomed into a move to oust him, and the owners opposed to him succeeded in forcing him to resign.
 
Owners Concerned by Escalation
 The labor contract that emerged from the owners' 1990 lockout expires Dec. 31, 1993. But either side had the right to reopen the contract by this Friday. The players, who have prospered handsomely the past 16 years under free agency and salary arbitration, had no reason to reopen.
The owners, taking a doom-and-gloom view of the game's future economy, want to change the salary system so that they can halt the escalation of salaries and have greater control over them. When negotiations begin, Ravitch will propose a system under which players will receive a share of the clubs' revenue and that will, in effect, place a cap on salaries.
Ravitch also has proposed that clubs extend their own sharing of revenue, and many of the clubs that voted against the reopener also oppose that plan.
Asked if he recommended that the owners vote to reopen, Ravitch said, "I told them if they wanted to have the option to affect the 1994 season, they had to reopen the contract in some fashion. There was concern among owners if you don't start talking now, you can't affect the economics of the 1994 season. You'd have to live with the economics of the current system."
Concern existed, too, Ravitch said, about the possibility of an interruption of the 1993 season. Some owners opposed a reopener for that reason.
"It's fair to say there are a lot of owners concerned about the technical risk that baseball won't be played in 1993," Ravitch said. "But I think they were reassured by the fact that there isn't anybody who wants to see baseball not played in 1993. There was not a single owner in the room who advocated that there be a lockout or that any decision be made about a lockout at this time."
The clubs, their labor expert said, do not seek a confrontation.
"We would like to move toward some change in the player-compensation system," Ravitch said, "because we don't think the current system works as well as other systems might. We want to do it quietly and constructively. I don't ask the union to give up any legal options they have; certainly the owners don't."
 
Fehr Sees 'Confrontation Possible'
 Fehr countered that "the mere fact this step was taken makes a confrontation possible when it otherwise wouldn't have been."
Fehr noted the string of off-field issues that have occupied baseball the past year -- the Japanese-led purchase of the Seattle Mariners, National League realignment, the initial and then the successful move against Vincent, sale of the San Francisco Giants, Marge Schott -- calling it a period of unusual turmoil and "a little more than plain meanness."
"For all the talk of partnership," he said, "it was interesting that our views were not solicited on any of these issues. I would have thought this was a year that people would have gone out of their way to make sure there wasn't a confrontation. Obviously, that hasn't happened and it's regrettable."
Ravitch said he doesn't plan to seek a vote for a lockout, adding: "I have made no effort to seek support for a lockout. I have never asked any owner to vote for it and I have no plans to do so now."
But he said: "I won't guarantee anything. I'll guarantee only that discussions will begin in good faith with the intention of proceeding to produce results without confrontation."
Baseball has never had a labor negotiation without a confrontation. Four strikes and three lockouts have punctuated talks for new agreements.

CUSTOMERS PROTEST NEW PLAN FOR MUTUAL BENEFIT LIFE

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
A newly revised rehabilitation plan for the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company drew fire from a group of more than 500,000 people who have retirement savings invested with the seized Newark-based insurer. The Association of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Contract Holders, said yesterday that the plan worked out by New Jersey and New York regulators favored contracts backed by state guarantee funds. 
 A group of insurance companies, including Prudential Insurance and Metropolitan Life, has agreed to guarantee contracts that are not backed by the states, but the minimum interest rate they pledged was lower than the minimum guaranteed by the states. The customers' group, whose members represent more than 80 percent of the $5.2 billion in retirement savings at stake in Mutual Benefit Life's rehabilitation, said the revised plan strayed from an agreement state regulators, insurance companies and customers had earlier worked out.

More Mathematicians

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
American educational institutions continue to award doctorates in mathematics at a near record rate, but more than half the recipients are foreigners, and employment prospects for the new mathematicians are distinctly uncertain.
A survey conducted by the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America reported that in the 1991-92 academic year, 1,050 Ph.D. degrees in mathematics were awarded, one of the highest numbers on record. Women, historically underrepresented in mathematics, did especially well; some 24 percent of the new doctors in mathematics were women. The median starting salaries for Ph.D. mathematics teachers also favored women, according to the survey. New male teachers can expect starting salaries of $34,000, while the starting salaries of women in comparable jobs average $34,900. 
 Only 42 percent of the new doctorates were granted to United States citizens, continuing a trend that has characterized American mathematical education during the last five years.
The growing participation of women in higher mathematics has not been matched by an increase in the number of black and Hispanic mathematicians. Of the 1,050 Ph.D. degrees in math granted during the year, only six went to American blacks and five to Hispanic people.
Another discouraging aspect of the survey was its findings on employment prospects. By late September, 13 percent of the new doctors of mathematics were still looking for jobs, a rate lower only than the record 14 percent in 1975.
This has created a paradox, in which on one hand mathematicians believe the United States is badly undersupplied with mathematicians, while on the other, mathematicians are having trouble finding jobs.
"The effect of economic conditions on higher education is felt strongly by the mathematics community," said Donald E. McClure of Brown University, author of the report on the survey. Pressures on the job market, he said, "limit the opportunities of new doctorates.
"At the same time," he added, "the number of students within the U.S. coming from our own undergraduate institutions and pursuing the Ph.D. does not nearly meet this country's overall demand for highly trained mathematical scientists."

The Firing Culture

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
After years of feeding on strawberries, cream and honey, or tons of money if you'd rather not be poetic about it, corporate executives are suddenly getting fired. Mr. Stempel of General Motors was the most spectacular instance of their new vulnerability. Now Mr. Robinson of American Express is said to be getting the boot.
Note that I don't dare breathe the names of these boardroom commanders without calling them "Mister." Such is the awe that corporate giants inspire in those bred to think of them as an elite class. "Corporate statesmen," they were called in the Eisenhower years. One was invited to kowtow. Now they get fired. 
 This is a big development in American firing. Until now, corporate giants were as unfireable as government workers and tenured college professors. Firing a corporate statesman can be done, apparently, only by his board of directors. It is a private operation carried out by a handful of boardroom big shots who have known each other for years.
Whatever the reason for a corporation's board to give the pink slip to its C.E.O., you can bet your gold fillings it has nothing to do with the reason you'd like to fire the guy.
If, for instance, you owned one of those multitudes of General Motors pickup trucks with the dangerously exposed gasoline tanks, you might enjoy telling Mr. Stempel to clear out his desk and pick up his farewell check at the pay window.
Never mind that those trucks were produced under the administration of Mr. Stempel's predecessor, Mr. Smith, who has since overseen his own retirement on a pension exceeding $1 million a year. You might be sufficiently hot-headed about your dangerous truck to drop the "Mister" and say, "Don't talk a retired Smith to me. What's Stempel done about my truck since taking over? Nothing. Stempel must go."
Boards of directors doubtless wish their companies wouldn't sell you dangerous merchandise. They are not merchants of death, nor heartless, nor totally indifferent to their customers' safety.
Still, if the profit margin is expanding, rather than fire their corporate giant they are more likely to approve his latest application for another pay rise after asking if there isn't something he can do, by the way, about the nasty gasoline-tank situation in his trucks.
How different this is from the traditional method of firing baseball managers and football coaches. Fans of the New York Giants football team, for example, are responding to the team's unsuccessful season by demanding the coach be fired. The sports pages and all history suggest he will be.
In contrast to the indifference a discontented Chevrolet buyer may expect after demanding that General Motors fire its president, a discontented Giants fan demanding Coach Handley's head seems to receive a sympathetic hearing from the authorities.
Actually, of course, all but the most dim-witted fan realizes he is merely acting out the traditional fan's role in a traditional firing ritual. The obvious remedy for an unsuccessful team is to fire the players, or at least the more incompetent among them, and hire better ones.
Sports fans know this. They also know just as surely that team owners will not do so. For one thing it would cost a great deal of money, which the owners might not have or which they might prefer to spend on Caribbean real estate if they did have it.
Moreover, it usually takes several years to replace losing players with winning players. Fans know this too and so are content to have the coach fired. Team owners, happy to be so easily forgiven for marketing an inferior product, contentedly play their role in the charade by firing the coach.
Hiring a new coach is the economically sound, though athletically absurd, solution for a losing-team problem, since coaches -- and, in baseball, managers -- work for even less money than mediocre, which is to say unwinning, athletes. The beauty part is that coaches and managers accept the rules of the charade and expect to be fired periodically, just as Mafia men accept, as part of their job, the probability that they will have to spend a percentage of their lives in prison.
The lesson here is that if you hope to fire the people you think need firing you must get a seat on the corporate board or own the team.

HEADLINE: Clinton Expected to Name Woman Attorney General

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton is moving to name the first woman to serve as Attorney General, and transition aides in Washington and Arkansas said today that he was considering four candidates.
The finalists, three judges and a Washington lawyer active in public-interest causes, are emblematic of the women who entered law schools in small numbers in the 1950's and 1960's and then rose to the top of their profession. 
 The candidates are Judge Patricia M. Wald of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit; Judge Amalya L. Kearse of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan; Judge Judith S. Kaye of the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, and Brooksley E. Born, a partner at the Washington firm of Arnold & Porter. All are accomplished legal scholars and considered liberals to varying degrees.
A person with knowledge of the appointment process said Mr. Clinton had also made his choices for two major economic positions, subject to background checks: Representative Leon E. Panetta as director of the Office of Management and Budget and Robert E. Rubin as economic security adviser.
Mr. Panetta, a California Democrat, heads the House Budget Committee, and Mr. Clinton is expected to highlight the post of budget director in his first round of appointments, to be announced Thursday and Friday.
 
Meeting With Women
 Mr. Rubin is co-chairman of the banking investment firm of Goldman Sachs & Company. Mr. Clinton is creating the post of economic security adviser, and its responsibilities have yet to be defined.
The decision to focus on female candidates for Attorney General followed a meeting in Washington last week in which top Clinton aides, including Vernon E. Jordan, the transition chairman, conferred with the leaders of about a half-dozen women's rights groups. According to those at the meeting, the representatives from the groups called on Mr. Clinton select a woman for one of what is sometimes referred to as the "big four" Cabinet posts: Treasury, State, Defense and Justice.
One transition official said the meeting was not confrontational because the Clinton team was receptive to the idea that a woman be chosen for one of those four positions. The official said the Justice Department provided the greatest opportunity to fulfill that notion because of the large pool of accomplished female lawyers.
All four candidates have been interviewed by top transition officials, two of them last weekend in Little Rock, Ark.
It is unclear what role was played by Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary, a prominent lawyer who is active in many of the same causes as some of the candidates. Some Clinton aides suggested that however influential Mrs. Clinton might have been, she and her husband were uneasy about people believing that she had significant influence in such issues.
 
A Carter Appointee
 The tentative decision to focus on four women to head the Justice Department means that Mr. Jordan, once referred to in newspaper accounts as a candidate for Attorney General, is not under serious consideration.
Judge Wald is, by some accounts, the slight favorite of transition officials. At 64, she is also the oldest of the four. She was appointed to the bench by President Jimmy Carter in 1979 after serving as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs.
After graduating from Yale Law School in 1951, she began work for a Washington law firm but soon took 10 years off to rear five children, managing at the same time to write a book urging reform of the bail laws and other scholarly articles.
She returned to practicing law in the early 1960's by joining a neighborhood legal-services offices. Over the next several years she worked for a variety of public-interest legal causes, including the Center for Law and Social Policy, which brought test cases in consumer and health areas, and the Mental Health Project. She has written extensively on issues like children's rights.
 
A Black and a New Yorker
 Judge Wald has told friends that she is interested in the job, but the peculiar judicial pension laws mean that she would forfeit all her pension interest accrued over 13 years if she left the bench now. If she served another two years as judge, she would receive her full salary as a pension. Transition officials said pension questions might not prove an obstacle.
Judge Kearse, also named to the bench by President Carter, is the first woman and the second black lawyer to serve on the Second Circuit, the first black being Thurgood Marshall. She is a native of Vauxhall, N.J. In addition to being an accomplished corporate lawyer with a Wall Street firm before she went on the bench, she is one of the nation's top contract bridge players and has written several books on the game.
Judge Kearse, 55, has also been mentioned in news accounts as a likely nominee for the Supreme Court in the Clinton Administration.
 
Candidate for State Post
 Similarly, Judge Kaye of New York's top state court has been thought of as a potential nominee to the Supreme Court. She is also a candidate to become chief judge of the state Court of Appeals, succeeding Judge Sol Wachtler, who resigned last month after being arrested on charges of extortion.
After graduating from Barnard College, Ms. Kaye became a society writer for The Hudson Dispatch newspaper in New Jersey. She has said that she thought she was given that job because it was considered women's work and that that motivated her to enroll in New York University Law school at night.
Judge Kaye, 54, became the first women to the state's highest court when she was appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1983.
 
Trailblazer at Stanford
 The fourth candidate, Ms. Born, has combined an active private practice with interest in children's issues, legal services and bar association activities. Ms. Born, 52, graduated at the top of her class at the Stanford University Law School and was the first woman to head the Stanford Law Review.
During the first few years of the Reagan Administration, she was the chairman of the American Bar Association's committee that evaluates nominees to the Federal bench. She is the only woman ever to hold that position.
She was also a pioneer in that she was named a partner at Arnold & Porter at a time when she insisted on working part-time to allow her to spend more time with her children, who are now grown.
She is also a founding member of the Women's Legal Defense Fund and is chairwoman of the National Women's Law Center.
Transition officials said they had not even begun to consider candidates for another important Justice Department position, Solicitor General, the person who argues the Federal Government's cases before the Supreme Court.
 
Transportation Secretary
 In other Cabinet positions, the list of finalists for Transportation Secretary is said by Democratic and transition office sources to include a former Democratic Governor of Michigan, the brother of Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago, and a Democratic Congressional leader.
James J. Blanchard, 41, who was Governor of Michigan from 1983 to 1991, is considered the top candidate, several of the sources said, all on the condition that they not be identified.
Mr. Blanchard, a lawyer and business consultant in Washington and Michigan, is a friend of Mr. Clinton and has been serving as an informal adviser in the transition to the President-elect and former Gov. Richard W. Riley of South Carolina, who is heading the transition team's search for appointees to sub-Cabinet posts.
William Daley, son and brother of Chicago Mayors, is also reported to be a finalist for Transportation Secretary. Mr. Daley, 43, is president of the Amalgamated Bank of Chicago.
Two Westerners who are members of minorities are also being considered: Representative Norman Y. Mineta of California and Henry G. Cisneros, former Mayor of San Antonio.
Mr. Mineta is an 18-year Congressman from San Jose, Calif. His family lost its insurance business and home during the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.
Mr. Cisneros is considered a candidate for several Cabinet positions, but it is also regarded as a possibility that Gov. Ann W. Richards will appoint him to the Senate seat that will be vacated if Lloyd Bentsen is nominated to be Treasury Secretary.

HEADLINE: Educator's $960,000 Payment Prompts Outrage

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
This fall, at 62, Edward J. Murphy, an influential administrator and superintendent of a special school district on Long Island, received the highest retirement award in the history of New York State -- $960,000.
Now, as state officials scramble to recoup the payment, they say the retirement award threatens to undermine not only the public's attitude toward Dr. Murphy's 42-year career, but its support for ever increasing taxes to pay for public education. 
 Yesterday, the State Education Commissioner, Thomas Sobol, said the payment was excessive and possibly illegal, and he moved to suspend the seven-member board that awarded the payment. He also moved to recover the money.
"Such payment is grossly excessive in a time when the state and local districts are facing serious fiscal constraints," he said.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who has been sparring with Long Island school officials for years over state aid reductions and spiraling local property taxes, issued a statement saying, "Instead of raising real-estate taxes and demanding more and more taxpayers' money from Albany, all school districts must finally admit the truth and subject themselves -- if not to severe discipline -- at least to reasonableness."
The payment was made after Dr. Murphy, the head of a district that provides services like vocational training and special education to 18 local school districts, put in his retirement papers on Sept. 30.
Just like many of the superintendents of the 40 other similar districts across the state, he received a salary of $43,499 from the State Education Department as well as additional pay from the local school districts. In Dr. Murphy's case, the supplemental pay was about $175,000 a year, bringing his total annual compensation to about $220,000.
This made him the highest paid education official in New York State, receiving far more than Mr. Sobol's $131,000 and the $195,000 paid to New York City's School Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, according to the State Education Department.
And as the retirement paperwork made its way through the education bureaucracy in Albany, state officials were stunned to discover some of the details of Dr. Murphy's contract with the Suffolk No. 3 Board of Cooperative Educational Services. Dr. Murphy had received a $960,000 payment, which included a $115,000 in "termination pay" and pay for 800 unused sick and vacation days at a rate of $1,040 a day. The Education Department said the package was the highest of its kind ever awarded in the state.
Among the terms of his contract, Dr. Murphy received up to 90 paid vacation days a year, when most state employees typically receive 15 to 20, said Christopher Carpenter, a spokesman for the Education Department.
And while regular state employees can receive pay for only the first 30 days of vacation, and get little or no benefit from unused sick days, Dr. Murphy was permitted to carry it all forward to his retirement.
Some state officials believe that the board was willing to approve the contract to keep Dr. Murphy from retiring. The retirement package was reported yesterday in Newsday.
Dr. Murphy did not return several telephone messages left on a tape machine at his home in Syosset. Asked about the award, Joseph F. Singleton, the deputy superintendent of the district, said the board had done nothing wrong.
 
'Nothing Illegal'
 "I respect the Commissioner highly, but the fact is that this board has done nothing illegal and has not violated any regulations of the Commissioner," Mr. Singleton said. Because the extra pay came from the school districts, rather than the state, "there is no need to return anything," he said.
But he declined to respond in detail until he received an order to show cause, which is expected to be issued by Mr. Sobol today. Before Mr. Sobol acted, the local board issued a statement, according to The Associated Press, saying that "the board believes that his compensation was appropriate for Dr. Murphy's consistently outstanding performance."
State officials said that in addition to the $960,000 payment, Dr. Murphy received about $50,000 for working the three months from July through his retirement in September.
Under the usual retirement rules, Dr. Murphy would be eligible for a pension of about $150,000 a year, according to Robert DeLuca, a spokesman for the State Retirement System. But if the $960,000 payment is eventually counted toward his retirement, it could double the pension to about $300,000 a year.
 
Pension Calculations
 Usually pensions are calculated on the average of a person's final three years of regular salary. However, in some cases pensions are based on the final five years of salary and whatever other compensation is awarded. Pensions are financed through a state pension plan into which school districts contribute.
Lawyers for the State Education Department reviewed the award and said there were several grounds for challenging it, Mr. Carpenter said. He said that while local boards had the authority to award additional pay, it was not clear whether they had the authority to pay for additional unused vacation days.
The Suffolk cooperative services board covers 18 school districts in the towns of Huntington Babylon and Smithtown, and has a reptutation for being among the most innovative in the state.
Alice F. Willet, the executive director of the Nassau-Suffolk School Boards Association, said that Dr. Murphy was "excellent, outstanding" and innovative. But the dispute over his retirement package, she said, "is going to have a detrimental impact upon our future legislative lobbying with the state."
"It is distressing when this comes at a time of economic hardship on Long Island," she said.
 
'Nothing Is Business as Usual'
 Last year, Dr. Murphy was among the scores of school officials who complained bitterly about what they saw as disastrous cuts in state aid that were disproportionately aimed at relatively wealthy Long Island school districts.
"This is a year when nothing is business as usual," he said at the time, addressing the impact of layoffs and tax increases. State officials said yesterday that despite the hardships, Dr. Murphy had received a $10,000 annual raise at the start of the new school year.

HEADLINE: MISSION TO SOMALIA;
Americans Will Find Somalia Full Of Arms Provided by Superpowers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
The American marines who landed in Somalia tonight have entered a country that is awash in weapons, many of them Soviet-made but also including American arms supplied to the African country by Washington in the 1980's.
Moscow was the principal weapons supplier to Somalia during the 1970's, and Soviet and Eastern European arms have continued to flow into the country in recent years from Libya and have been smuggled in from neighboring Ethiopia, current and former American officials say. 
 The results are readily apparent on the streets of Mogadishu, where clan members are seen with AK-47's, Soviet-made machine guns and even an occasional Soviet armored personnel carrier.
But while much of the weaponry is of Soviet origin, the American-led force will also face American arms. According to an internal Pentagon report, Washington provided $35 million in "lethal assistance" to the old Government of President Mohammed Siad Barre from 1981 to 1989. Among the American weapons are 4,800 rifles, 3,672 grenades, 482 TOW anti-tank missiles, 24 armored personnel carriers, 18 155-millimeter howitzers, 6,032 artillery shells, 75 81-millimeter mortars and 144 land mines.
 
Few Somali Heavy Weapons
 The Somalis' weapons are no match for American firepower. The Somalis have relatively few heavy weapons like tanks, and the absence of spare parts and maintenance problems have taken a toll. The Pentagon does not expect the Somali clans to mount a determined resistance to the American force.
But there are so many weapons and they are so widely dispersed that there are potential threats to the American troops everywhere. Even a few shots from a sniper or undetected mines could result in American casualties.
"The problem at the present time is not heavy weapons," said Paul B. Henze, a Rand Corporation analyst and former aide to Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser. "The problem is an enormous quantity of small arms, total disorder and young men whose way of life is to rob, steal and shoot."
Mr. Henze predicted that the Somalis "will not take on a convoy of marines, but there is no way of controlling that many people with guns."
The flood of arms in the Horn of Africa is a legacy of the cold war and of tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia. During the 1970's, Ethiopia and Somalia fought a war over the Ogaden region of Ethiopia. From 1961 to 1974, Somalia imported more than $210 million worth of arms, primarily from Moscow or Eastern European nations, according to Mr. Henze.
After Somalia invaded Ethiopia in 1977, the Soviets shifted their support to the Marxist Government in Ethiopia. After Moscow switched sides, Washington's ally, the Shah of Iran, provided Somalia with weapons, as did Egypt and other Arab nations. Washington's supply of arms to the Siad Barre Government from 1981 to 1989, was at a lower rate than Moscow's earlier flow.
According to an American official, after the United States stopped supplying weapons, Eastern bloc arms were provided by Libya. When the Siad Barre Government fell in 1991, armories were looted and the arms divided up by rival clans.
The overthrow of the Ethiopian Government of Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 also unleashed a new supply of arms in the Horn of Africa. With poorly patrolled borders, the region has a thriving black market in weapons.
It is unclear how many weapons in Somalia are in working order. But when the American Embassy personnel were rescued from Mogadishu by a Marine force in January 1991, Somalis were menacing the Embassy with shoulder-fired SA-7 surface-to-air missiles. The Americans also detected radar signals for SA-2 and SA-3 surface-to-air missiles during that operation.
Even if maintenance problems and a healthy fear of the marines mean that the heavier weapons are not much of a threat, disarming the entire country would be a herculean chore.

U.S. Orders Relief Workers Indoors for 48 Hours

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Relief workers have been advised by the United States military to stay indoors for at least the first 48 hours after the arrival of American troops in the Somali capital, but many relief officials are concerned that the interruption will last longer, gravely affecting hundreds of thousands of hungry people.
A 48-hour hiatus is not expected to have a great effect on the delivery of aid, at least in Mogadishu, which has received more food and health care than any other area. 
 The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has brought more food to more people in famine-torn Somalia during the past year than any other organization, has stocked two days' worth of food in its 600 kitchens. Their Somali workers have agreed to continue business as usual, feeding 1.2 million people in the Mogadishu area.
The situation is more critical where the famine is worst. In Baidoa, a major feeding center, Somali workers for one relief agency refused to go to work until the United States troops arrived.
But for the aid agencies, the key issue is whether the troops can quickly provide security for their operations, a function now performed by hundreds of paid Somali guards.
Safety, respect and power in Mogadishu are secured by machine guns. But United States military officials have told relief agencies that the troops would respond to armed Somalis as aggressors.
The Red Cross has ordered its guards to stay off the streets. But relief officials have not been able to figure out what to do with the guards.
"Do we allow them to keep their guns?" asked Rick Grant, a spokesman for CARE, "or do we take their guns from them to prevent accidental shootings from the Americans, which then opens them up to be shot by other Somalis? I don't want to be the one to ask my guard for his gun."
Other problems have surfaced for relief agencies.
In the past 24 hours, the value of the Somali shilling has risen sharply. A dollar now buys only 2,000 shillings, down from 3,200, creating a small financial crisis for CARE. The 900 guards at the port, for example, usually cost the equivalent of $5,000 a day, Mr. Grant said. But with the new exchange rate, the cost is closer to $8,000.

FEW SURPRISES IN HOSPITAL REPORT
A panel commissioned to investigate New York City's sprawling public hospital system identifies weaknesses that have already been pointed out and endorses changes that have already been made.

But it stops short of recommending the sweeping changes hoped for by some critics. B2.

After more than a week of virtual silence, several Hasidim may step forward to offer prosecutors information about events surrounding the beating of a homeless black man by a group of Hasidim in Crown Heights last week, the lawyer for the rabbinical student charged in the case said. Their testimony could prove an important development in a case fraught with political dangers whatever its outcome. Without any new witnesses, the prosecution would have to rely largely on the testimony of the beaten man, Ralph Nimmons, who has a long arrest record. B3.

HEADLINE: Foe of Slovak Leader Asking For U.S. Aid for New Nation

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
A leader of the opposition in Slovakia, which is to become an independent republic in three weeks, said today that the United States should assist his country regardless of the relatively authoritarian character of its current Government.
In an interview, the opposition leader, Ivan Miklos, deputy chairman of the Civic Democratic Union party in Bratislava, said, "Isolation would be punishment more for democratic forces than for the Government." 
 Under Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, a nationalist who gained power in elections in June on a platform of separation from Czechoslovakia, Slovakia is to acquire sovereignty on Jan. 1.
Mr. Miklos, a 32-year-old economist who was Minister of Privatization in the previous coalition Government, said he and other members of the opposition were concerned that Slovakia, the poorer part of Czechoslovakia, would soon slide into economic despair.
"Czechoslovakia had a chance at prosperity," Mr. Miklos said. "Now only the Czechs have that chance. Slovakia has lost that chance. The kind of help from Western countries that I have in mind would keep Slovakia out of isolation, and it would help to keep democrats alive."
Mr. Miklos said he was conveying this message to Congress, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and private foundations.
Since he assumed power in the summer, Prime Minister Meciar has stifled efforts to establish a free press in Slovakia, has denied funds to a university created by the political opposition in the city of Trnava, and has slowed plans for reforming the economic system inherited from the Communist era that ended three years ago.
Despite his opposition to Mr. Meciar, Mr. Miklos said a prudent Western policy toward Slovakia would be to support stability.
"Otherwise you would create a demand for a more totalitarian regime," he said. "Better a little help when it is needed than massive efforts later to deal with a catastrophe."
United States policy toward the two parts of Czechoslovakia is aimed at treating them "as much as possible on a basis of parity," an Administration official said today. Until now, American assistance has been aimed principally at helping Czech and Slovak enterprises obtain financial assistance and converting military industries to civilian purposes.
"If we treat Slovakia as a second-class citizen, they'll end up that way," the official said, adding that the Meciar Government would be judged on its merits in human rights, treatment of minorities and creation of democratic institutions.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Despite Good News, Clinton Says, Economic Ills Remain

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton, fearful that recent optimistic economic reports could blunt public pressure for change, cautioned today that hard times were probably not over and that painful long-term economic reforms were still required.
In a speech before newspaper managers, in meetings with Congressional leaders and again at a news conference, Mr. Clinton repeated the theme he has been sounding more and more in recent days: that the public should not reduce pressure on Congress for sweeping changes because of optimistic interpretations of recent economic data. 
 "There is a lot of talk in the atmosphere today of people saying, 'Well, you know, maybe you don't need to do anything about this economy because the unemployment rate is going down, and housing starts are up, and everything's just hunky-dory,' " Mr. Clinton said at a news conference with Democratic Congressional leaders.
That is not the case, he insisted, adding, "We are nowhere near to knowing that this short-term recession is, in fact, over." Indeed, although the unemployment rate did drop in November, to 7.2 percent from 7.4 percent, the latest figure for housing starts showed a 1.1 percent decline in October.
Even if the economy is improving, Mr. Clinton added, long-term changes to improve productivity and competitiveness are essential. "There must be a very strong multiyear deficit reduction plan submitted at the same time I submit this coming year's budget, and that's what I'm going to do," he said.
Mr. Clinton also used his second visit to Washington since the election to prepare the public for the prospect that he may have to spend more time on foreign policy than he had intended. If he does not come to grips with problems around the world before they erupt into full-blown crises, he said, "I might have to spend all my time on foreign policy, and I don't want that to happen."
 
Underlying Problems
 For the last two days Mr. Clinton has used his public appearances to reinforce his argument that figures showing an improvement in the unemployment rate and the strongest quarterly growth in the gross domestic product in four years do not reflect the underlying problems still plaguing the American economy.
Aides said his comments are part of an effort by Mr. Clinton to blunt "if it ain't broke don't fix it" arguments as well as to signal the public that he has not forgotten why he was elected.
Even if the economy is rebounding from its recent depths, Mr. Clinton said at a meeting of Gannett newspaper managers today, "Maybe that changes what you do in the short run, but there are certain fundamental long-term challenges, that I believe I was elected to address, which have caused great difficulty for most Americans and have caused great difficulty for our country."
He later added in his Congressional news conference, "I based my whole campaign on my absolute conviction that the fundamental economic problems of this country are long-term problems that have been 20 years in the making."
To underscore that point, Mr. Clinton held up a chart provided by Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, meant to show that increases in American productivity and job growth this year have not matched those following earlier economic slumps.
It is such long-term problems, he said, that "have led us to the situation now where most people are working longer hours than they were 20 years ago for lower wages in real dollars than they were making 10 years ago because of uncompetitive situations in the United States with regard to education and training, investment in new technologies, energy, dealing with the deficit and dealing with the health care issue."
 
Focus on the Rich
 Mr. Clinton said that such long-term problems can be cured only with tough long-term medicine, but, as in the campaign, he stopped short of detailing what sacrifices the middle classes might have to make, focusing instead on those who earn more than $200,000 a year.
Next week he will hold a conference on the economy in Little Rock, Ark., to which more than 250 business leaders and economists have been invited to discuss exactly how to put in place his proposals for improving productivity and competitiveness and reducing the deficit.
On foreign policy, Mr. Clinton also seemed to be trying to prepare the public to expect that events in Somalia and other areas will force him to direct his attention overseas, despite his campaign promise to focus on the economy like a "laser beam."
He said he appreciated President Bush's desire to withdraw American troops from Somalia by Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, but added, "We believe that this mission has merit and that an artificial timetable cannot be imposed upon it."
Mr. Clinton said that the crucial question in determining the length of United States involvement in Somalia is whether American troops will be needed to maintain order after the food situation is stabilized so that the government can be rebuilt, or whether that mission will be handled by a multinational force.
"I don't think anyone knows the final answer to that," he said.
At the same time, Mr. Clinton left open the possibility that his Administration might have to step up American involvement in Bosnia.
Mr. Clinton said he would not rule out a more aggressive involvement there, but stopped short of promising to commit troops. His aides have argued that there is much more the United States could do in Bosnia -- from tightening the arms embargo on Serbia to selective air strikes against Serbian artillery positions -- that would make a difference without putting American soldiers in harm's way.
"I'm quite concerned about what is likely to happen there -- the increase in violence, the impending loss of life," Mr. Clinton said. But he added that he understood why President Bush and other officials "do not wish to make a commitment of ground forces of the United States."

HEADLINE: MISSION TO SOMALIA;
Somali Clans Planning Last Grab for Advantage

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia, Dec. 8

 BODY:
The competing clans that have ravaged this country spent the day today plotting attacks to wring the last bit of military advantage over their foes before the arrival of American forces, which are expected to put a damper on much of the fighting.
The faction under Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid, which controls southern Mogadishu and most of the southern part of this dogleg-shaped country, was making plans to swoop into the famine-hit town of Bardera and oust the forces of Gen. Mohammed Siad Hersi Morgan. General Morgan, a son-in-law of former President Mohammed Siad Barre, wanted to ride into Kismayu, the southern port city, and fight General Aidid. 
 "We are afraid that if the Americans come they may say stop the fighting," said Abdullah Ahmed Shire, an adviser to General Aidid, after being asked about the planned offensive against Bardera. "We must be rid of these people because they are the remnants of the Marehan of Siad Barre."
 
Deep Clan Animosity
 The offensive has been delayed, reportedly because General Aidid's fighters are stuck in mud some 30 miles east of Bardera. But Mr. Shire's passion against the Marehan, the sub-clan of Mr. Siad Barre, whose 21-year dictatorship ended in 1991, illustrates the ferocity the clan fissures here.
The clan divisions have overcome other factors that would seem to make Somalia an unlikely candidate for civil war.
Unlike virtually any other country on the African continent, everyone speaks the same language. The Sunni version of Islam is embraced by more than 90 percent of the people, and almost everyone does the same thing: raises and sells cattle and camels.
 
A Nation's Collapse
 Yet almost 30 years after independence from the British and the Italians, Somalia has become riven by internecine clan politics backed by armories of cold war weapons to the point that it has ceased to exist as a nation.
"One can scarcely think of a significant domestic or foreign development in Somali politics since independence that was not influenced to a large degree by an underlying clan consideration," David D. Laitin and Said S. Samatar wrote in "Somalia, Nation in Search of a State." "Ethnicity remains the paramount factor."
The intense clan competition poses the greatest potential threat to the American-led military operation to protect the delivery of food and other humanitarian aid to the country if the Americans are seen to favor some groups over others. Somalis will defend their honor if they feel that it is being impugned.
"It is going to take a very enlightened group of officers working with the local people," said Stephen Tomlin, the director of the International Medical Corps, a Los Angeles-based agency, who has been here for more than a year and narrowly missed being killed by a bullet aimed at his head by an angry security guard. "Life for outsiders is very frustrating. You have to drink lots of tea and talk lots of hours at all levels. This is not the American way."
The Somali resilience in tough environmental conditions and their warrior tradition impressed the Europeans who started to colonize Somalia in the last century.
"It is wonderful how little we have yet managed to impress the Somalis with respect of our superior power," wrote J. W. C. Kirk, the British consul in Zanzibar, as the British started to make inroads into northern Somalia in the 1880's.
Significantly for the Americans, these characteristics persist.
Six major clan families account for the vast majority of Somalia's 4.5 million to 6 million people: the Darod, the Hawiye, the Isaak, the Dir, the Rahanwayn and the Digil. Within these clan-families are sub-clans and sub-sub-clans. Mr. Barre was a Darod who belonged to the Marehan sub-clan. During most of his 21 years of rule, the non-Marehans viewed all political and economic decisions as disenfranchising them, a belief that has driven many of the clans who were on the outs during Mr. Barre's rule to claim a larger share of the spoils left behind, and to fight when the other groups resisted.
The Hawiyes have emerged strongest from the fighting. Mohammed Ali Mahdi, who controls the north side of Mogadishu and little else, and General Aidid are Hawiyes. But Mr. Ali Mahdi is from the Abgal sub-clan, whose members managed to become a merchant class and consider this city theirs. General Aidid is a Habir Gidir from a village in central-western Somalia near the Ethiopian border.
Humanitarian agencies, contracting out the transport of large amounts of food assistance, say they must be constantly aware of clan allegiances and be as inclusive as possible when hiring staff.
But people of the Hawiye clan say physical characteristics give no sign to which sub-clan someone belongs to and that except for the inflection on some letters it is almost impossible to tell whether one of their clansmen is a Habir Gidir or an Abgal.
Even further distinctions exist, and aid agencies must be careful to spread their hiring of guards according to a careful calculation based on the relative power of the various groups. For example, the Habir Gidir includes four sub-sub-clans, and the International Committee of the Red Cross employs members of the two strongest of these sub-sub-clans for transport services.

HEADLINE: A.M.A. OPPOSES CAP ON MEDICAL COSTS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
In a rebuff to President-elect Bill Clinton, the American Medical Association today rejected the idea of an overall national limit on health care spending. But the doctors said they were willing to consider other ways of restraining costs.
At a meeting in Nashville, the association's House of Delegates approved a resolution saying the A.M.A. "strongly opposes a national ceiling on health-care spending." 
 Mr. Clinton proposed such limits in the campaign to try to slow medical prices, which have been rising about twice as fast as other consumer prices. His staff is now trying to translate his proposal into legislation.
But the American Medical Association asserted that national limits on health spending could undermine health care, inhibit progress and interfere with patients' freedom.
Another possible reason for the A.M.A. stance, one not mentioned in the resolution, is financial self-interest. A national ceiling on health spending could lead to stringent new limits on doctors' fees, economists say.
 
Doctors' Incomes
 Dr. Nancy W. Dickey, a trustee of the association, said doctors' incomes were not a factor. "We take this stance on behalf of our patients," Dr. Dickey said in a telephone interview. "The capping of health-care expenditures is far less of a concern to me as a physician than to my patients."
In the campaign, Mr. Clinton said repeatedly that he wanted to limit public and private spending on health care. In September, his idea was endorsed by the American College of Physicians, the largest medical specialty group in the United States, which has 77,000 members, who specialize in internal medicine.
Dr. John R. Ball, executive vice president of the American College of Physicians, expressed disappointment with the A.M.A., saying it had rejected the concept of a national health budget without offering specific alternatives.
"Health-care reform begins with cost control, and cost control begins with the commitment to living under a budget," Dr. Ball said. "The American people, the President-elect and leading members of Congress understand that." But the American Medical Association, which has 290,000 members, or 43 percent of the nation's doctors, said today that such limits would lead to a burdensome new system of regulation. The A.M.A. resolution was approved by voice vote.
Dr. Dickey of the A.M.A. said the association wanted to slow the growth of health spending by encouraging "market forces and economic competition," by discouraging malpractice lawsuits and by slashing administrative costs.
The A.M.A. also restored a policy today saying it was unethical for doctors to send patients to clinics in which the doctors have invested.
The policy, initially adopted in December 1991, strongly discourages doctors from referring patients to clinics, laboratories, diagnostic imaging centers and other businesses in which the doctors have a financial interest.
In June, the association softened the policy and said that such referrals could be ethical in some cases, if patients were informed of the doctors' financial interests.
Leaders of the A.M.A. decided to fight for the strict ethics policy. The policy says there is a potential conflict of interest whenever doctors send patients to medical businesses in which the doctors have a financial interest. Studies show that such referrals often raise costs to consumers.

HEADLINE: New York State Crosses the Hudson in Search of Taxes

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
As 3,000 New Yorkers who went shopping in New Jersey last weekend will soon discover, strangers were snooping around their cars: New York officials intent upon making them pay the sales tax they owe.
James W. Wetzler, State Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, sent four employees into parking lots across the Hudson River to write down the license numbers of cars with New York plates. 
 People whose names are coughed up by the computers will soon get polite letters telling them that they might just owe money to New York. About 600 other New Yorkers whose cars were spotted at shopping centers in Pennsylvania will receive similar letters.
"We're not sending anyone a bill," Mr. Wetzler said. "We're educating people about their tax responsibility so they won't be surprised if down the road they do get a bill from us for the sales tax owed on expensive items purchased out of state."
 
Does Anyone Comply?
 New Yorkers who shop out of state and bring their purchases back to New York are legally supposed to pay New York the difference between the sales tax in the other state and that in New York. Hardly anyone does so, however.
Mr. Wetzler is concerned that a tax change in New Jersey might be enticing New Yorkers to cross the Hudson to beat New York City's 8 1/4 percent sales tax. He has been especially unhappy about an advertisement for Ikea, the home-furnishings retailer that touted the "whopping" tax savings that Manhattanites could get at its store in Elizabeth.
Not surprisingly, news of Mr. Wetzler's license-plate caper was not well received yesterday in the Ikea parking lot.
"First of all, I have a right to spend my own money where ever I want," said Donna Currington, a 33-year-old nurse from the Bronx. "This is a time we all have to be careful with a dollar, and this stuff about the tax folks chasing after us is not going to deter me."
Another shopper, Lisen Sundgren, 26, an actress from Greenwich Village, said: "That sure sounds like Big Brother to me. I thought we put something like that all behind us with Russia giving up."
Since April 1, when New York's fiscal year began, 1,648 New Yorkers voluntarily paid nearly $1.7 million in sales tax for out-of-state purchases.
Karl Felsen, a spokesman for the Department of Taxation and Finance, said much of that was for purchases abroad. A probable reason that figure is as high as it is, he said, is publicity about New York's crackdown on such purchases. The state began combing United States Customs Service records two years ago.
"More and more people are paying" the sales tax on purchases in other states," Mr. Felsen said.
"But it is still an infinitesimally tiny portion of the total," he said. "We're still chipping away at it, but the real hope is Federal legislation" that would require retailers in one state to collect sales taxes owed to other states.
Mr. Felsen said the license-plate missions in New Jersey and Pennsylvania were the first time his department had sent people to monitor cars in parking lots. Since the early 1980's, New York has uncovered tax evaders mainly as a result of information-exchange agreements with other states. "In essence, those states audit their retailers and send names of New Yorker customers to us and we do the same in return," he said.
For years, New Yorkers have shopped for clothing in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, lured in part by the fact that those states levy no sales tax on clothing. Now, New York has changed strategies, provoked by the Ikea ads publicizing an expansion of a sales-tax break available in urban enterprise zones in New Jersey. As of Nov. 27, New Jersey began permitting retailers in parts of Elizabeth, Jersey City, Kearny and Orange to charge a 3 percent sales tax on purchases instead of the state's usual 6 percent rate. The tax break had already been in effect in six other economically depressed areas.
 
Ikea Defends Itself
 While Ikea insists it was not breaking any law, Mr. Wetzler accused the company of encouraging tax evasion. Acting on his request, the New York State Attorney General and the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs are examining whether the ads were misleading or illegal.
"We don't want to have a problem with the State of New York," said Pamela S. Diaconis, an Ikea spokeswoman. She added that Ikea intends to post signs in its Elizabeth store to inform out-of-state customers that they may have to pay additional taxes in their state.
Mr. Wetzler wants to do more. He is threatening to subpoena records from retailers in the New Jersey urban enterprise zones as well as charge-card companies and trucking companies that deliver their goods to New York to track down tax evaders. He said that Leslie A. Thompson, Director of the New Jersey Taxation Division, agreed to cooperate yesterday.
 
'Our Main Concern'
 "Our main concern at the moment is to point out to our taxpayers what their tax liabilities are in the hope they will comply voluntarily," Mr. Wetzler said. "In the event that fails, we'll engage in whatever enforcement efforts we deem to be cost effective."
Those caught would have to pay the tax, along with penalties and interest, which are explained in the mailing.
That was not a popular idea in the Ikea parking lot last evening.
"That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard," said Lisa Halgren, 32, a financial manager for a Manhattan corporation. "I work hard. I pay taxes. And if I want to save a little money that's my business and no one else's."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Municipal Bonds Rise

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The prices of actively traded municipal bonds rose about 1/4 point yesterday as investors moved to buy ahead of what could be a rally at the beginning of next year. The demand was good enough that several new issues were repriced to lower yields.
Some of the buying, traders said, was in anticipation of the drop-off in new issuance that usually comes at the end of December and the begining of January, a factor that could push prices higher. 
 In addition, there will be a huge amount of cash available at the beginning of next year from semiannual interest payments on outstanding municipal bonds, and because $9 billion or more in bonds are expected to be redeemed on Jan. 1. As investors with this cash look for new investments, prices could be pushed higher.
Dave Johnson, manager of tax-exempt mutual funds at Van Kampen Merritt in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., said there has been buying of municipal bonds by several of the new funds that have come to the market recently. The fact that there will be little supply at the beginning of next year and a lot of available cash makes the issues coming out now attractive to both new funds and individuals, he said, as they try to buy ahead of a January rally.
Peter B. Coffin, senior vice president at Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston, another mutual fund manager, said that these factors, and the threat of a tax increase next year, ought to help municipal bonds outperform the Treasury market in January.
The success of yesterday's sale of the general purpose revenue bonds issued by New York's Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority reflected the demand in the market yesterday. The issue, with Bear, Stearns & Company as the underwriter, was repriced at the end of the day to lower the yields from what was originally offered because demand was so strong.
The $655.75 million issue was the largest of the day. Of the total, $633.16 million are in noncallable series Y bonds. The remaining $22.59 million is in series Z bonds.
The series Y serial bonds were repriced to yield 4.70 percent in 1998, 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, below the initial pricing in the morning. The bonds due in 2008 were repriced to yield 6 percent, five basis points lower. At the top Federal tax rate of 31 percent, the bonds have a taxable equivalent yield of 6.81 percent for the 1998 maturity and 8.70 percent for the 2008 maturity.
The term bonds due in 2012 have a coupon of 6 percent and were repriced to yield 6.14 percent, six basis points less than the initial pricing. This is equivalent to 8.90 percent on a taxable bond. The term bond due in 2017 was repriced to yield 6.16 percent, four basis points lower, with a taxable equivalent yield of 8.93 percent. The bond due in 2018 was repriced to yield 6.27 percent, three basis points lower, with a taxable equivalent yield of 9.09 percent.
The issue is rated Aa by Moody's Investors Service and A+ by Standard Poor's.
At least three other smaller issues, including $47.2 million in New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation taxable service contract bonds, were repriced to lower yields.
 
Treasury market
 Prices of the 30-year bond and Treasury notes moved higher in light trading yesterday as the recent rally continued. But there were some comments from President-elect Clinton that could confuse traders and speculators just as they seem to be becoming more comfortable with the incoming Administration.
The price of the 30-year bond was up 6/32 , to 102 10/32 , to yield 7.43 percent, down from 7.44 Monday. The yield is the lowest since Oct. 6. The 10-year note was up 12/32 , to yield 6.71 percent, down from 6.77 percent the day before and the lowest since Oct. 29.
In comments in a morning speech in Washington, Mr. Clinton spoke about where the Federal deficit would be in four years.
"I think you can reasonably expect the budget deficit to be substantially smaller than it is today," he said, "both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of national income."
Traders and analysts like such comments because they point to a concern about the Federal budget dificit.
But in the afternoon, Mr. Clinton made comments that might have disturbed traders. He said he was not sure the recession was over, which could indicate that he would stilll propose a significant fiscal stimulus program, something that the bond market is worried about. It is the belief that the recent signs of stronger economic growth will mean a smaller fiscal stimulus package that is behind much of the recent rally.
"There is no evidence that we're really coming out of this in a traditional sense," Mr. Clinton told reporters after a day of meetings with leaders and rank-and-file Democrats in Congress.
"So we are nowhere near knowing if this short-term recession that has gone on agonizingly long is over."
One bond trader said that the comment yesterday reminded him that Mr. Clinton would still propose enough of a fiscal stimulus program to make it clear to the country that he had gotten the economy moving again. For bondholders, that might be too much because of the threat of overstimulating growth, which would force interest rates higher and could nudge the rate of inflation out of its very comfortable 2 percent to 3 percent range.

HEADLINE: Yields Flat On C.D.'s for Week Ahead

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Average yields on money market accounts and certificates of deposit at most banks in New York and around the country are virtually unchanged for the seven days beginning today, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.
Analysts said rates were unlikely to change much until President-elect Bill Clinton's inauguration next month. "Every time a new positive economic indicator pops up, it lessens the possibility of strong Government intervention to stimulate the economy," said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor. "And that tends to hold rates down."
 
Treasury Bills Down
 Moreover, the average discount rate on short-term Treasury bills dropped Monday at the weekly auction, reversing direction after eight consecutive weeks of increases. 
 The auction is often viewed as an indicator of how banks might adjust their rates on savings. But analysts said they did not expect further declines in three-month bills, which slipped 2 basis points, to 3.29 percent, and six-month bills, which were down 9 basis points, to 3.37 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Average Fall of One Basis Point
 Combined yield averages for money market accounts at commercial and savings banks in the New York area were down one basis point, to 2.74 percent. Three-month C.D.'s were unchanged at 2.87 percent and six-month C.D.'s remained at 3.02 percent.
The largest changes this week are at the Bank of Tokyo Trust, which lowered the average yield on its six-month C.D. by 28 basis points, to 2.77 percent and its yield on three-month C.D.'s by 31 basis points, to 2.74 percent. But its money market yield was unchanged at 2.38 percent.
Home Savings of America lowered its money market yield by one-tenth of a percentage point, to 2.84 percent.
Outside New York, average yields on six-month C.D.'s at 20 large banks rose 2 basis points, to 3.01 percent, while money market yields held steady at 2.68 percent.

HEADLINE: Dow Up by 14.85 as Stocks Extend Rally

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Wall Street stocks extended their rally yesterday as investors, apparently encouraged by the economic outlook, pumped more cash into the market.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 14.85 points to close at 3,322.18, with 234.3 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Advancing issues led decliners, 1,026 to 817. 
 The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.59 point to a new high of 667.12, its ninth record closing high in 10 sessions, but advancing shares beat losers by only a narrow margin.
Chris McLellan, head of trading at Robertson, Stephens & Company, said the tight range between gainers and losers led him to believe the over-the-counter market could be in for a deep correction.
"It's a very scary market," Mr. McLellan said. "The generals are marching but the soldiers aren't following."
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and New York Stock Exchange index also set new highs. "People want to get their cash to work before the year ends," said Ron Doran, director of institutional trading at C. L. King & Associates.
Analysts said the market's strong upside momentum outweighed early profit taking. "You've really got mood, momentum and money flow," said Alan Ackerman at Reich & Company.
Traders said the market was focusing on Washington, awaiting President-elect Bill Clinton's decisions on Cabinet posts and approach to fostering economic growth.
"Everyone is looking for a signal from Washington on Clinton appointments in order to gauge what his policy will be," said Jim Benning, a trader at BT Brokerage.
Recent signs of economic improvement have convinced investors that Mr. Clinton may be able to revise his plans for a substantial fiscal stimulus package and instead focus on lowering the nation's huge budget deficit.
"All his remarks are that we're going to do something with the deficit, which is our primary problem," said Dick Stein, a vice president at MKI Securities.
In Washington, Mr. Clinton said there was no real evidence the economic recession was over or that the first hopeful signs of recovery matched those usually seen after previous recessions.
Mr. Clinton made clear that he intended to pursue economic stimulus programs, which focus on jobs creation and investment, while simultaneously pursuing long-term deficit reduction goals.
Analysts said investors will be focusing on inflation data later this week to confirm recent signs of the economic recovery.
"There should be some caution out there," Mr. Doran said. "I'm surprised that we didn't have a little more profit taking."
Among the standout stocks, a first- day issue, the First Colony Corporation, topped the Big Board's most active list, closing at 30 1/8 after making its debut at 28. The company sells individual life insurance and annuity products throughout the United States.
International Business Machines fell 1/2, to 65 3/8, despite its announcement of new software products that promote the use of big mainframe computers as a central feature of personal-computer networks.
Capital Cities/ABC surged 15 3/4, to 478 1/2, after the broadcasting and publishing company said it was financially capable of and interested in making a major acquisition costing as much as $8 billion.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 1.68 points to a new high of 436.99. The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.29, to 394.65.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Company Promises a No-Effort TV-Rating Device

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
Seeking again to compete with A. C. Nielsen in the national ratings business, the Arbitron Company announced yesterday that it was developing a high-technology device for keeping track of television and radio audiences.
The device, which would take advantage of the latest military technology, would be worn by viewers, beeper-style. It would keep tabs on what its wearers are watching and listening to by "reading" an inaudible code etched into a program's sound track. 
 Arbitron's so-called pocket people meter -- still far from actual tests -- is the latest entry in the competition to devise a ratings system that can provide highly detailed information for advertisers and programmers but is effort free for viewers. Arbitron would not say how much it was spending to develop the system.
At a news conference in Manhattan yesterday, Ken Wollenberg, Arbitron's executive vice president for sales and marketing, told reporters that the "pocket people meter" would "require practically no effort on the part of the respondent." But some network executives, whose backing is crucial to Arbitron's efforts, immediately criticized the system as too demanding.
"The need exists for a better measurement," said Nicholas Schiavone, NBC's vice president for media and marketing. "So nothing should be dismissed out of hand." But because participants would have to carry the device wherever they went, "their proposal is not for a 'passive people meter,' he said. "The device requires an extraordinary level of cooperation, and in fact, it is very active."
Arbitron is working with a Canadian television industry cooperative, the BBM Bureau of Measurement, to develop the device. The Martin Marietta Corporation, the military contracting company, and Intellisys Automation, an engineering firm, are working on the design.
The plans call for the system to be tested in two media markets by late 1994. But Arbitron executives said that as of yet they had no clients for the new system and that they would not introduce the service unless clients materialized.
National television ratings, which determine how some $15 billion in advertising money is spent, are currently provided by Nielsen, using its own version of the "people meter."
 
Pushing the Button
 Each member of Nielsen's 4,000 sample households is given a personal control button and is supposed to press the button whenever he or she watches television. The networks complain that the system underrates audience numbers because many viewers -- particularly the much-sought-after younger viewers -- grow tired of punching in and out.
Nielsen, a unit of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, and Arbitron compete to provide local television ratings to stations and advertisers in regional media markets. Both companies use a combination of metered television sets and hand-written viewer diaries to assemble these ratings. Arbitron, a unit of the Ceridian Corporation, also provides ratings to 260 local radio markets based on the distinctly low-tech diaries.
Arbitron executives said one advantage of its new "pocket people meter" was that it would record whatever its wearer was watching on television or listening to on the radio, whether he was at home, at work or on the road.
 
Cooperation Needed
 But for the system to be effective, virtually every radio and television station would have to agree to imbed the code in its transmissions. The codes would be combinations of very narrow frequencies that would either be added or subtracted from the sound track, producing no audible change.
"Arbitron is assuming that everyone in the industry will cooperate," Jack Loftus, a spokesman for Nielsen, said. "Good luck."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mixed as Traders Await a Meeting in Germany

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended narrowly mixed yesterday in light trading as the currency markets awaited a meeting of Germany's central bank.
Gold prices fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $335.40 a troy ounce, down 70 cents from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold fell 75 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $335.25. 
 Analysts said there was little news to affect trading, with the market marking time ahead of tomorrow's meeting of a policy-setting committee of the Bundesbank, at which the German bank could take action on interest rates.
On Monday, the dollar fell sharply against the German mark as well as against other currencies. Analysts said thin trading volume had exaggerated the decline.
Raja Ramachandran, an analyst with Thomson Financial, said the dollar appeared to stabilize yesterday when it reached a technical support level against the mark.
In Tokyo yesterday, the dollar closed at 123.83 yen, down 1.04 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 123.95 yen. In New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 123.75 yen, unchanged from late Monday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5975, from $1.5875 late Monday. In New York, one pound cost $1.59975, more expensive than $1.5980 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.5562 German marks, down from 1.5563; 1.3945 Swiss francs, up from 1.3935; 5.3065 French francs, up from 5.3025; 1,367.50 Italian lire, down from 1,374.50, and 1.27225 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2727.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $335.65 a troy ounce, from $334.75 late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $335.25, from $334.80 late Monday.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS: Dips, but Not Much Dancing;
Holiday Party Indicator Is Finally Pointing Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Sober-minded people look to things like unemployment numbers for clues to the economy's health. But that may be much too rational. For the real story, scrutinize the menu of the office holiday party.
Do you see Champagne and caviar followed by prime rib? Recession's days are numbered. Or is there a bulletin-board request for potluck casseroles -- or no party at all? Times are still rocky. 
 Well, this indicator leads upward. After several years of penny pinching, many companies are putting on slightly more lavish affairs this year, according to a survey of 100 companies by a New York-based executive search firm, Battalia Winston International.
"Companies are more optimistic about the economy," said Dale Winston, president of Battalia Winston. "Most seem to believe that the downturn can't get worse." Many companies "feel a bit more positive about spending for Christmas parties," he added.
Mr. Winston views the office party as "a fun economic barometer."
Of the 100 companies surveyed by the firm, 87 said they were giving parties this year, compared with 82 last year. Forty-eight of the parties will be held in the evening, compared with 16 in 1991. And 26 companies are planning luncheons, which are less expensive, down from 66 last year.
But the ostentatious soirees of the 1980's are out of fashion, even for companies that can afford them. Nighttime dinner dances have given way to luncheons or cocktails. Companies that used to rent out an entire restaurant for an evening are having sandwiches or hors d'oeuvres brought in. Spouses are no longer invited at some companies.
"No business now, especially in the last few years, wants to appear to be wasting money," said Steven Hart, who heads the catering department at Zabar's delicatessen in Manhattan. The days are gone, he said, when companies can get "big fancy catering concerns to come in and do outlandish parties."

HEADLINE: This Season, Bottom Line Is on Top

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Although sale signs that promise 25 percent off are as ubiquitous as ever in stores this holiday season, retailers are dusting off and playing up time-honored techniques for snaring shoppers -- techniques that take less of a bite out of the bottom line.
The usual seasonal niceties are in place -- the holly boughs, the carols ringing from store sound systems and the extended shopping hours. But there are some distinct additions over Christmases past. Some retailers have set up makeshift coat checkrooms to relieve weary shoppers of wraps and packages; others are wrapping and delivering gifts free of charge. 
 Of course, most are offering their customers some kind of price break, from the plain vanilla $19.99 special on blue jeans at Macy's to the exclusive after-hours cocktail party Cartier is holding for big spenders, who get a 10 percent discount on anything they buy.
"Everyone has some hook out to get people to buy," said Walter F. Loeb, a retail consultant.
But Mr. Loeb and other longtime observers of the seasonal frenzy that overtakes retailers say the promotions this year are far less likely to have a negative impact on profits. Unlike the last three holiday seasons, when anxiety-ridden retailers started cut-rate Christmas sales a few days after Halloween, merchants this year have so far resisted rampant price slashing.
At Kmart stores on the day after Thanksgiving, for example, customers lined up before the 7 A.M. opening in hopes of getting one of the 19-inch color televisions that would go on sale for $199 only until 11 A.M. The limited-time sale has little effect on the company's profit margins and makes the stores more efficient by evening out traffic patterns.
Bloomingdale's is selling a number of once-in-a-lifetime experiences like a walk-on part for one night in a Broadway play or a ride over New York City in the Goodyear blimp. The money will go to the Victim Services Agency, a not-for-profit organization that helps finance programs for battered women, abused children and other victims.
Bloomingdale's will also cash a personal check worth up to $50 for holders of its charge cards and package its customers' presents in elegant star-spangled gold-and-black boxes that are available at cash registers at no extra charge.
Eddie Bauer, the chain of outdoor wear and sporting goods stores based in Redmond, Wash., is giving shoppers a gift in lieu of a discount. Every customer who spends $100 or more in its stores receives a prettily packaged box filled with popcorn, trail mix and three ounces of smoked salmon worth about $20.
At Macy's and other stores, shoppers may check their coats. Neiman Marcus is shipping merchandise ordered from its Christmas book by Federal Express at no additional charge to normal shipping and handling fees. Talbots is giving away gift wrap.
With the exception of free Federal Express delivery, none of these niceties are novel. But over the last decade, many retailers replaced such touches with sales that attracted customers in droves but eroded profits. With the recession making consumers cautious spenders, stores can ill afford such shrinkage.
"The greatest promotion we have at Christmas time is wrapping our landmark building in a big red bow and posting toy soldiers out front," said Simon Critchell, the president and chief executive of Cartier U.S.A. "It's a tradition at Cartier that people remember."
 
Not Merely Window Dressing
 A recent survey of consumer attitudes about this holiday shopping season by the market research company Yankelovich Clancy Shulman affirms that opulent windows, festive ornamentation and carols are important. About 63 percent of the 706 respondents said traditional holiday decorations and music were somewhat or very important factors in making their shopping experience more enjoyable.
"Sales promotions by themselves won't make people buy anymore," said James A. Taylor, president and chief executive of Yankelovich. "There's a desire for something more."
Mr. Critchell of Cartier said it was coincidental that the party Cartier is throwing for American Express card holders who spend lots of money was scheduled amid the holiday selling madness, although he acknowledged that the date was fortuitous nonetheless.
Mr. Critchell played down the discount Cartier is offering to those who attend. "The 10 percent off is not a major strategy," he said. "It's really just a strategy to offer people a reason to come."
Retailers are especially sensitive about using price as bait this year, perhaps remembering the paper-thin profit margins that resulted from excessive markdowns in the last three holiday seasons when shoppers almost uniformly refused to buy at full price. Several have also made well-publicized commitments to reducing the number of price-based promotions they stage and do not want word of sales this season to ruin their credibility.
On the day after Thanksgiving, a public relations employee at Bloomingdale's flagship store in Manhattan was assigned to pull down the placards directing shoppers to special bargains before a television news camera crew taped the action on the main floor.
But as much as they would like to shove the subject under the carpet, most retailers are offering their customers reduced prices on certain merchandise.
"Sales have become a mainstay of Christmas," said Thomas A. Filandro, a retail analyst at Gruntal & Company. "But I do think retailers actually have held back a little bit this year on their promotional activity based on price."
Or perhaps they are just doing a better job of turning price promotions to their advantage. On three days recently, Abraham & Straus gave its charge card holders $20 back for every $100 of merchandise they charged to their A & S cards. While the promotion essentially amounts to a 20 percent discount, A & S will eventually get the money back because it is issuing $10 coupons for the rebate that will only be good at its stores.
Radio Shack is giving customers who purchase big-ticket items a 60-day break on finance charges, and even Century 21, the off-price store in Manhattan and Brooklyn, was offering shoppers coupons with their purchases.
"This year I think the innovation is far higher when it comes to gimcrackery," said Alan G. Millstein, editor of the Fashion Network Report, a newsletter. "Somebody's been reading P. T. Barnum."

HEADLINE: Daily Challenge to Be True to One's Dream

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
When Donato Mancini moved into his cold-water loft in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, the idea was to stay a year, then move on to more comfortable quarters. That was in March 1980. "Almost 13 years without a hot shower," Mr. Mancini said with a rueful smile, gesturing out over his studio.
For nearly 13 years, Mr. Mancini has cooked his meals on a hot plate and an electric casserole. Each morning, he has heated water on the hot plate and taken a sponge bath. And every day, he has picked up charcoal or brush to work on drawings and paintings that pile up in his loft, most of them unsold and unseen. This has been his routine, in various locations around the city, since he left with an art degree from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 1970.
 
'It's Very Picturesque'
 The artist toiling away in a garret was already a cliche when Puccini wrote "La Boheme." But Mr. Mancini is the genuine article. For several years, Jock Truman, a retired New York gallery owner, put Mr. Mancini's loft on a shopping tour he organized for wealthy collectors. "He'd always stop at my place first," Mr. Mancini said. "It's very picturesque. You look at it and say, 'Yeah, this is an artist's studio.' " 
 The romance is in short supply, however, for Mr. Mancini and for the thousands of other artists in the city scrambling to get a foot on the ladder of success. New York is tough on its painters and sculptors. High rents have driven many of them from Manhattan and away from the dealers they hope to entice to their studios. Working space is scarce and often expensive, and artists who try to colonize commercial lofts can wind up spending more time fighting eviction by the city than making their art.
Even in the best of times, the expense of running a gallery means dealers think long and hard before taking on a new artist. In the current economic climate, with many galleries folding, the point of entry has narrowed even further, as dealers mount fewer exhibitions and cut back on the list of artists they represent.
Economic uncertainty has been compounded by a kind of esthetic malaise. The art world has failed to generate the kind of exciting movement that collectors embrace with open checkbooks. The boom that put painters like Julian Schnabel, David Salle and Eric Fischl in the pages of Vogue and HG has fizzled. The mood now is one of sullen apprehension, as strapped dealers, bored critics and restless artists scan the horizon for the next thing.
Yet for visual artists, New York is still the place. It's the city where careers are made, where the money, the dealers, the critics and the ideas are.
 
'The Center of the World'
 "Believe me, every month I say: 'I've got to get the hell out of here. I should be living in Florence,' " Mr. Mancini said. "But I stick it out, because New York really is the center of the world in many ways, especially if you want to be in touch with other artists, in other fields."
If nothing else, artists in New York can take solace in knowing that their struggles are a normal part of life in the city. The painter without a dealer and, for the moment, without a prayer does not necessarily count as a freak or a failure.
"There are a lot of people here living the same life you're living," said Mr. Mancini, a large, lumbering 45-year-old with a round face and a man-in-the-moon smile. A product of working-class Detroit, he still speaks with a blunt dese and dose accent, loudly and insistently, usually wagging a finger or jerking a thumb sideways for emphasis. When something strikes him as funny, he bursts into a ho-ho-ho laugh that can unexpectedly fly upward into an uncontrolled giggle.
"People forget how much understanding there is here from people on the same wavelength," he said. "You're not as isolated as you think you are."
It would be difficult, however, to find an artist more isolated than Mr. Mancini. He has chosen a medium, easel painting, that has undergone critical attack for nearly 30 years as a reactionary, bourgeois form (the art-critical term is retardataire) that has been superseded by photography, video, performance art and installation art with a sharp political edge.
Moreover, Mr. Mancini paints in a figurative style. That is, he deals in recognizable images, using an idiosyncratic visual language based on the work of Renaissance frescos, the Mexican muralists of the 1930's and Edward Hopper. He presents, in a kind of mythic narrative, the social rituals he experienced as a first-generation Italian growing up near the auto factories of Detroit, where his father worked until his death in 1972.
A characteristic painting is "Teen-Age Dance," a 6-by-14-foot triptych. On its side panels, two couples slow dance. In the central panel, throngs of teen-agers dance in a floodlighted outdoor arena, set against an ominous background in which the factories of Detroit pour smoke into a low, brooding sky.
"A lot of people are not sympathetic to the work," said Michael Walls, a SoHo dealer who has included drawings of Mr. Mancini's in two off-season group shows. "It is not part of the MOMA-endorsed official chronology of modern art, it's deliberately outside that, and people ask, How is it any different from things that were done in the 20's and 30's?"
Mr. Mancini has become used to hearing his work described as warmed-over Ashcan school, or worse, sentimental and illustrative, a short step removed from Norman Rockwell or Andrew Wyeth.
 
The Trouble With 'Tough Work'
 "I thought it was strong, memorable work, but not quite my esthetic" said Jack Tilton, a New York gallery owner, who visited Mr. Mancini's studio two years ago. "It's tough work, and in general tough work is slow to be appreciated, slow to sell, slow to make its way."
Mr. Walls said: "There's a kind of clumsiness that I haven't talked to him about: the use of these big clunky feet to anchor the figure to the ground. I'm certain that if the work were closer to a Renaissance or Beaux Arts ideal of delineating the human figure, he would have a wider audience: not among the movers and shakers and reputation makers, but among buyers."
Mr. Walls cited the fleshy, Bruegel-like figures, and "the Tiepolo-esque evocation of the Detroit skyline" approvingly. "I think it's part of what gives the work its craziness," he said. "His work is a very strange amalgamation."
That strangeness has effectively kept Mr. Mancini without a career. He has never sold enough work to make a living. To support his painting, he said, he does freelance work designing audio-visual displays. He has turned down full-time job offers to leave time for his art. He has never earned as much as $20,000 in a year from all sources of income, he said. To date, he has sold about 15 paintings and drawings. Expenses for supplies and promotional materials, including slides and transparencies of his work, postcard announcements for shows and postage, run about $3,000 a year, he said.
This year, Mr. Mancini received his first grant, for $2,000, from the Pyramid Arts Center in Rochester, as part of a regional program called "Diverse Forms," financed by the National Endowment for the Arts, the Andy Warhol Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation.
The grant is expected to help pay expenses for a series of paintings on two Italian festival parades, the feast of St. Paulinus in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and the feast of St. Rocco in Aliquippa, Pa.
 
Home Is Where The Light Is
 Mr. Mancini lives a spartan existence. His loft measures 1,000 square feet, and about 80 percent of that is devoted to work and storage space. He has a bed, a guest bed that doubles as a couch, a small circular coffee table, a table to eat on, five chairs, two bookshelves and a homemade work table he also uses as a desk. It's the kind of furniture that the Salvation Army no longer bothers to pick up. The unwary visitor who settles into the seat of honor, a 1930's-era swivel office chair, stands a good chance of being flipped straight back to the floor.
What the studio lacks in amenities it makes up for in light, which floods in from three sides, and from a large roof section of rippled translucent plastic. The sound of pigeons scrabbling for footing overhead is a constant background noise.
On days when he is not working for an audio-visual company, or visiting museums and galleries, Mr. Mancini starts drawing or painting at about 9 in the morning, and works until 7 P.M. If he has had an unproductive day -- fretting and fussing and erasing -- he might push on after dinner and work into the early hours of the morning. He works slowly. It can take him two or three years to finish a large painting, and several months to finish a large drawing.
Mr. Mancini has had just enough success over the years -- an exhibition here, a sale to an important collector there -- to keep him from sinking into despair. A banner year was 1982, when three of his large drawings were included in a show at the Drawing Center in SoHo and a gouache version of "Teen-Age Dance" was included in a show of Brooklyn artists at the Brooklyn Museum.
Mr. Truman, who once served as director of the Betty Parsons Gallery in its heyday, attended the Drawing Center show with J. Patrick Lannan, a major collector. Mr. Lannan bought all three works for his foundation's art collection.
This was a coup for Mr. Mancini. Placing work in the right hands can be more important than the money involved in the sale, in this case $2,500 for all three drawings.
At the same time, the show was an occasion for some bitterness. The New York Times reviewed the show, yet his work went unmentioned, an oversight Mr. Mancini says he does not regard as as accidental as his drawings covered the entire main wall of the gallery. The silent treatment, he insists, is a standard art-world strategy.
"One of the maneuvers of power is they try not to attack you, because that gives you as much attention as praise does," he said. "They ignore you. They don't empower you in any way; they don't give you the satisfaction of a fight."
Nevertheless, for the next two years, Mr. Mancini rode the crest of a small wave. His work appeared in two more group shows, in Chicago and Morristown, N.J. The Brooklyn Museum invited him back. Then, nothing. It was back to the routine of putting together press kits and mailing them to galleries, freshening up the package from time to time with photographs and slides of new work.
 
Fingers Crossed; Things Improve
 Lately, things have been looking a little more hopeful. Last year, the show at Mr. Walls's gallery led to a one-man show at the Miami-Dade Community College Art Museum. A scaled-down version of the show traveled to the Bergen Museum of Art and Science this year in Paramus, N.J. The $2,000 grant has buoyed Mr. Mancini's spirits. But a one-man show at Mr. Walls's gallery still eludes him.
Mr. Mancini, despite the frustrations of 27 years, remains philosophical about his art and his career. He defines his goals modestly. Success, he says, would mean earning enough money to paint full time.
"I didn't start doing this work gearing it toward my career; I did it after seeing my father in his casket," he said. "That's when I decided to commit myself to it totally, no turning back, although now I can see that I've given up a lot."
Mr. Mancini could probably find a city where the critical climate is more sympathetic, where he could be a larger fish in a smaller pond. But the idea doesn't appeal to him.
"Part of the thing is to do what you like and in the place you like," he said. "That's New York. This is the place where the lottery is being conducted. It gives you the dream, the hope that tomorrow maybe things will happen."

Bonds and the Giants Come to an Agreement

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., Dec. 8

 BODY:
The two most controversial and economically significant issues that have developed at baseball's winter meetings -- the Barry Bonds contract and the owners' reopening of the collective bargaining agreement -- have turned on the uncompleted sale of the San Francisco Giants.
The incoming owners finally resolved their problem with the Bonds contract today, completing the six-year, $43.75 million deal by agreeing not to make Bob Lurie, the outgoing owner, liable for the contract if the new group does not gain approval. 
 The Peter Magowan group is virtually assured of approval in the next few weeks, but it won't come in time to prevent the major league club owners from reopening the collective bargaining agreement.
Lurie was the Giants' owner Monday when the clubs voted, 15-13, to reopen the labor contract. Lurie, another owner said, voted for the reopener. The Magowan group, said a person familiar with its thinking, would have voted against the reopener.
 
Not Sticking Around
 With the reversal of that one vote, the outcome would have been 14-14, and the owners could not have reopened. They needed a simple majority, and they got that with Lurie's vote. Lurie, of course, won't be around when the possible consequences -- a lockout or a strike -- occur.
"Bob Lurie still owns the club," Bud Selig, chairman of the executive council, said. "He's sitting in the room representing the San Francisco Giants. The person who owns the business that day votes for the business."
The Magowan group had enough problems resolving the Bonds mess. Agreement on the financial terms of the $7,291,667-a-year contract was reached at about 7 o'clock Saturday evening. It took another three days to figure out how to take care of Lurie's stance that he would not accept the contract if the buying group were not approved.
"If we are not approved," Magowan said at a news conference, "Mr. Lurie has the right to decide if Barry Bonds is a member of the Giants. If he winds up with the team, he will not be responsible for Barry Bonds's contract. I don't want to get into any of the details about how that satisfaction was arranged."
 
Then What?
 But people around the Giants said that under the agreement if the Magowan group were not approved and Lurie did not want to keep Bonds at that price, he would become a free agent for a brief period.
If he signed with another team for less than $43.75 million, the McGowan group would make up the difference.
The final Bonds agreement was announced at 4:10 P.M., 44 hours after Bonds and his entourage left the Cochran Room of the Galt House Hotel, the news conference they thought they were attending having been canceled.
When they left Sunday evening, they exited through the kitchen. This time they marched single file along the wall of the room, Bonds leading the way. In line were Dennis Gilbert, Bonds's agent; Bobby Bonds, Barry's father; three of Gilbert's aides; Larry Baer, the Giants' executive vice president; Bob Quinn, the general manager, and Magowan.
"We're making a commitment, a big commitment to our fans and the entire California community," Magowan said.
Bonds, a two-time National League most valuable player, who lived in San Francisco when his father played for the Giants, said he couldn't "say how excited I am to have the opportunity to go back home."
 
Emotional Moment
 As part of the deal, his father will be the Giants' hitting coach, and the son said, "I always wanted to be able to share something with my father." Then, when he talked about receiving permission from Willie Mays, his godfather, to wear Mays's retired No. 24, he broke down.
He shed no tears over the contract. It will pay him a $2.5 million signing bonus and salaries of $4 million, $4.75 million, $7.75 million, $8 million, $8.25 million and $8.5 million. No one ever has received as high a salary as he will get in his last four years. Furthermore, if he is the league most valuable player, he will gain bonuses of $100,000 for the first time, $250,000 the second time, $750,000 the third time and $1 million the fourth time.
Bonds also shed no tears over leaving the Pittsburgh Pirates, although he has said he enjoyed playing for the team and living in the city.
The Pirates won't even get compensation of two choices in next June's amateur draft for losing Bonds.
 
Question of Oversight
 If the agreement had been final Sunday evening, the Pirates would have received the compensation. But it wasn't, and the Pirates didn't offer Bonds salary arbitration by Monday's deadline, thus forgoing their right to compensation.
Asked if not offering arbitration was an oversight, Ted Simmons, the Pirates' general manager, said it was not.
"What happens if he accepts?" Simmons said, thinking of the money it could have cost the Pirates. "That would have been awful for us."

HEADLINE: BILL'S LIST;
A New Foreign Policy for a New Era

SERIES: Bill's List: An occasional series commenting on ideas and issues facing the new Clinton Administration.

BYLINE: By Roger Morris; Roger Morris, who served on the National Security Council staff under Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon, is writing a book on the early days of the Clinton Presidency.

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M.

 BODY:
As Bill Clinton prepares for inauguration, his Presidency already seems haunted by the great issue he pointedly avoided in the campaign -- national security and foreign policy. History will judge the Bush Administration's missed opportunities and neglect of a revolutionary world as an almost epic blunder, leaving a legacy of contradiction and hazard.
Unless the new Administration develops a coherent view of a transformed world and of America's new international interest, role and purpose, there will be no more than a marginal, politically arbitrary reapportionment of huge national security budgets, which are now largely wasted on cold war vestiges yet are essential to finance domestic revival and deficit reduction. The same capricious politics are likely to raid non-military international spending or exploit trade tensions for short-run advantage, all with insidious effect. 
 Without a new foreign policy for a new era, Bill Clinton will forfeit command over budgets, bureaucracies and ultimately his own Presidency.
When he enters the Oval Office, he will find waiting a radically altered world. As old industrial and imperial orders collapse, America's power remains pre-eminent, though its leadership must be earned. Amid kaleidoscopic change and turmoil, the world is free of Great Power rivalries and has unprecedented opportunity for cooperation and peace, yet faces unparalleled challenges in the spread of weapons, ecological damage, festering poverty, vast migrations and separatist violence.
Much as George Bush failed to grasp that changing world, it has overtaken as well the conventional foreign policy aspirants to whom whom Mr. Clinton might have resorted and whose national security nostrums and habits of mind are now anachronistic.
Bill Clinton must marshal a new democratic foreign policy, one as bold and relevant as Harry S. Truman's 1947 summons to a peacetime America to contain Soviet expansion. Like Truman, Mr. Clinton is "present at the creation" of a new epoch in world affairs -- and the next half-century hangs in the balance.
Mr. Clinton's equivalent to deterring the Soviets is to seize the fleeting chance for post-cold-war demilitarization while also checking the plague of weapons proliferation and sectarian chaos that threatens any comity of nations. Since the U.S. cannot -- should not -- dominate in that effort, national security dictates a sustained commitment to a genuinely cooperative, collective international security system.
The foundation of that policy would be a peacekeeping force, drawn proportionately from U.N. member states and more than twice the size of the Desert Storm coalition, with the strength to stop any aggression or genocide. Europe, Japan and Russia would play and pay their fair shares. Contributing only its own portion, America, no more the primary world policeman, might safely, and within Mr. Clinton's term, see the return and reduction of its overseas forces to mainly territorial defense; it will also see the reconversion of its economy to a long-earned peace and nonmilitary prosperity.
The following steps toward collective security should be as compelling as those taken to deter the Soviets:
When the principal threat to peace is nationalist aggression or national disintegration, where a new global compact depends on common action in defense of the weakest, tragedies such as Bosnia and Somalia are the real Munichs, the ominous dominoes, of our era.
Seeing the new pragmatism of principle, the U.S. should immediately work to forge a system of collective action to redress such outrages -- action far more shared and purposeful than President Bush's 11th-hour U.S.-dominated expedition in the Somali famine.
Mr. Clinton should recognize the complexity of such intervention, external culpability in tragedies such as Somalia and the dangers of neo-imperial aggrandizement. Much of the new turmoil requires sustained peacekeeping, just as the cold war required U.S. staying power.
But he should understand, too, the Holocaust's enduring lesson -- that sovereignty in a seamless new world no longer allows a regime to destroy its own citizens with impunity or indifference, and that a truly peaceful planet must outlaw aggression within borders as well as across them.
Practically, as well as morally, the larger stake of collective security -- and the insidious precedent of impotence and appeasement -- would clearly justify the world's prudent military commitment after the most serious diplomacy failed.
Because the stability and participation of Russia are essential to that collective security, the U.S. should urgently mount all the aid necessary to bridge economic hardship and save post-Soviet democracy.
No Presidential policy would have more urgency -- or more riding on it -- than the necessity to prevent another Russian tragedy. Washington should take the initiative to forge ahead of the Russians in nuclear disarmament (already stalled in fresh suspicions), beginning with a long-term test ban, the renunciation of some $30 billion in needless new weapons in the wake of the George Bush-Boris Yeltsin arms agreement in June and eventual reduction of U.S. strategic weapons to an adequate minimum of 250 to 500 warheads.
In his first year, Mr. Clinton should place nonproliferation and disarmament on top of the international agenda; bring a prompt, exemplary end to our own $36 billion-a-year trade in conventional weapons (with reconversion provision for affected industries); begin an all-out collective effort to demilitarize worldwide by agreements with poorer nations to forgive debt in return for substantial conversion of military sectors to peaceful development along with strict inspection of arms reductions, and use all means to bring about a nuclear-free, demilitarized Middle East with renewed Arab-Israeli peace talks.
Where foreign policy merges most visibly with the domestic agenda, Mr. Clinton should seize a similar chance for needed change in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico. His policy should be to renegotiate, as necessary, America's international economic future, reversing George Bush's readiness to allow supranational trade agreements to erode U.S. labor and environmental standards. We should not avoid a trade war, Mr. Clinton should announce, only to inflict a class war on American and foreign workers, fought with high-tech sweatshops and symbolized by gruesomely polluted border towns.
Soon Mr. Clinton should meet with major trading partners, including Japan, the Pacific Rim, Europe and Latin America, to advance a straightforward new policy: America will settle for neither belligerent blocs nor politely masked inequity but rather will seek an equitable, politically sustainable world commerce of shared sacrifice, responsibility and opportunity for capital and labor. Since no nation is more important in the new U.S. policy than Japan, a mutually sensitive and systematic reduction of the $100 billion U.S. trade deficit would be the primary goal and crucible of U.S.-Japanese relations.
Not least, Mr. Clinton should convene a conference of rich and poor nations to strike a new bargain of ideals and self-interest in international development. Just as he visited a struggling neighborhood in Washington, showing he would be a concerned citizen of the capital, he should be the first U.S. chief executive in a generation to demonstrate an authentic sensibility toward the struggling nations.
No one's future is secure, he should explain, when four or five billion people in the world are left in smoking slums on the outskirts of hope. America cannot simply deal with domestic needs and then later turn to the world's anguish; either we begin anew to heal both or it may well not matter for our grandchildren if we make ourselves prosperous.
As another principle of new policy, the U.S. should become a leader -- and no longer a scofflaw or laggard -- in international environmental action, including energy conservation, meaningful reduction of carbon dioxide, stricter emission controls, hazardous-waste clean-up, responsible population policy, resource replenishment and myriad other measures to meet the danger of ecological disaster.
Washington should foster a new representative world organization to oversee and plan, decades ahead, common environmental policy and management of resources, just as GATT has been charged with orchestrating trade. For details, President Clinton should look to Vice President Al Gore, whose book "Earth in the Balance: Healing the Global Environment" is a blueprint for environmental security.
Finally, Mr. Clinton should come to grips with the most formidable challenge of all: ignoring the stale foreign policy Establishment and circumventing the permanent regime of bureaucrats, whose civil service ranks are deeply penetrated by Reagan-Bush loyalists.
Just as Truman's postwar internationalism could not be conducted by the old isolationists of a bygone era, the post-cold-war Clinton policy will survive only with new ways and new people, beyond old establishments and ex-officials. A centerpiece of the new diplomacy could be sophisticated conflict resolution, with assisted negotiation and mediation of the kind so successful under private auspices with the World Bank, among Nicaraguan factions and in Middle East water issues.
Preventing conflicts rather than reacting to crisis, creating forums for dialogue and joint problem-solving, acknowledging the legitimacy of all interests, understanding historical and psychological dynamics at work, building long-term relationships of collaboration -- these new techniques would apply to many international flash points.
For such innovation -- much less his emphasis on collective peacekeeping, humane international economics and environmentalism -- Mr. Clinton will find neither skill nor commitment among the cold-war veterans jockeying for jobs.
He must reach for a fresh generation of thinkers and doers -- for a new-world visionary, manager and practiced negotiator as Secretary of State; a Secretary of Defense versed in economic reconversion and internationalized security; a U.N. ambassador of stature to match the post's unparalleled new importance; policy-makers on international economics and the environment of ministerial rank and worldwide distinction for their mastery of the issues; a new Director of Central Intelligence with the mettle to turn a rogue relic into a relevant public servant, and a national security adviser of original intellect and old-fashioned humility, embodying America's new creativity yet modesty about its place on the planet.
In the end, the most important change should be in the President. He should believe in his own newcomer's genius, knowing that the new foreign policy is not sorcery, that he need not apprentice to the past. He should trust his own decency and intelligence in world affairs and a new democratization of foreign policy.
The President would have to choose decisively between conventionality, with its all too predictable outcome, and a new community of nations, joined by America and led by its example as never before. We can only hope that for Bill Clinton this would be no choice at all.

HEADLINE: Books, Books and More Books: Clinton an Omnivorous Reader

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

 BODY:
If there is still considerable uncertainty about the changes President-elect Bill Clinton intends to make after his inauguration on Jan. 20, at least one is now virtually carved in mahogany: there will be more bookshelves in the White House.
After Barbara Bush gave Hillary Clinton a tour of the private quarters at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue last month, Mrs. Clinton exclaimed to her friends here: "There aren't enough bookshelves!" She vowed to correct the situation. 
 The change will be perfectly in character. The Clintons added bookshelves to the Governor's Mansion here in Little Rock in 1979 after they moved in. When compelled to vacate, they constructed bookshelves in the house they bought on Midland Avenue; and when they returned to the mansion in 1983, they added more bookshelves.
The Clintons read books of all sorts, from Churchill to Clancy and from Lincoln to Ludlum. And that is the most striking feature of a cultural profile of the first-family-to-be pieced together in recent days from the recollections of longtime friends and associates.
In addition to his bibliophilia, the President-elect loves to sing, calls himself a movie addict and once in his youth considered becoming a professional jazz musician. Mrs. Clinton, who jokes with friends about her inability to carry a tune, prefers classical music to pop.
 
Other Bookish Presidents
 Of course, bookishness and other cultural interests are no index to success in politics. In fact, most political leaders prefer oral briefings to reading at length for themselves, and at least one, Adlai E. Stevenson, was seriously wounded by being caricatured as an egghead. But in modern times, such interests put Mr. Clinton in the company of, say, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman and John F. Kennedy.
Ann McCoy, administrator of the Governor's Mansion, said that the Clintons' private library on the second floor, together with about a dozen still unopened book boxes in the attic, numbered about 4,500 volumes.
Deborah Sale, a senior adviser who has known Mr. Clinton since their high school days in Hot Springs, said that during the campaign, when a voter asked Mr. Clinton whether it was true that he had read 300 books in one year, he replied with a laugh: "That was in 1982 when I didn't have much else to do." Mr. Clinton had been defeated the previous year in his campaign for re-election.
Carolyn Staley, Mr. Clinton's next-door neighbor when he lived in Hot Springs and a close friend, said he would read at least four or five books a week.
Carol Allin, who ran the now-defunct Capitol Book Store here for 11 years, said Mr. Clinton used to browse in her shop about once a month and "never left without an armful of books." Such avid reading habits make Mr. Clinton seem positively erudite compared to George Bush, who appeared to freeze when asked on television in 1984 to name a book he had recently read. Eventually, Mr. Bush mentioned a 22-year-old best seller, "The Guns of August," by Barbara Tuchman.
A Current Favorite:
Thoughts of a Stoic Last summer, Dee Dee Myers, Mr. Clinton's chief spokeswoman, caused a stir -- and aroused some skepticism -- when she reported that her boss's current favorite was the "Meditations" of Marcus Aurelius, which he reread every year or two.
The "Meditations" are not much of a reach for a present-day politician. Marcus Aurelius was a second-century Roman emperor whose victories were mostly undone (among other things, his conquering troops brought home a plague), and who consoled himself with the mind-over-matter Stoicism exemplified by statements like, "Do not think yourself hurt and you remain unhurt."
Another favorite of the Governor's, his aides say, is the Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez's challenging "One Hundred Years of Solitude," a fantasy that conjures a phantasmagorical Latin America.
Mr. Clinton also reads books and periodicals in German, a skill he acquired as an undergraduate at Georgetown University, said BetsyWright, his former chief of staff. The President-elect has been sending his daughter, Chelsea, to a German-speaking summer camp in Minnesota for the last four or five years, she said, and he makes a point of spending time conversing with her in German.
From Pop to Plato,
Many Books at Once
Rather than concentrate on one book at a time, aides say, Mr. Clinton usually reads several simultaneously, gulping down literary caviar and pretzels with the same enthusiasm. A typical load of books in the bag of reading material he travels with would include the latest Walter Mosley murder mystery, a biography of Lincoln or Churchill, a pop futurology selection like "Megatrends," a serious treatise on world economics like "Head to Head," by Lester Thurow, and a collection of Plato's Dialogues.
Indeed, Mr. Clinton appears to be almost obsessive about his cultural intake. Beverly Lindsey, a former director of the Arkansas Arts Council and a close Clinton friend, said that last week the President-elect and a group of friends watched "High Noon." Afterward, she said, he told the group it was the 19th time he had seen the movie, and then began describing the other occasions.
Ms. Wright said that Mr. Clinton had a prodigious memory for characters, actors, directors, situations and punchlines in books and movies.
Mrs. Lindsey acknowledged that much of the President-elect's reading was what she and her husband called "grocery store trash" like the technothrillers of Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlum.
Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Lindsey said, is a more consistently serious reader, devoting herself to law journals and recently Chaim Potok's 1967 best seller, "The Chosen."
A Fanatical Worker
Of Crosswords
Aides who travel with Mr. Clinton also describe him as a crossword puzzle addict who works the puzzles out with a pen rather than a pencil and completes them in record time.
Eli Segal, Mr. Clinton's chief financial adviser, said that he took Mr. Clinton to the New York office of Games Magazine, a crossword puzzle bimonthly he publishes, and had the editor clock Mr. Clinton in working out one of the toughest puzzles.
"He completed it in seven minutes," Mr. Segal said. "That's championship time."
Not everyone who knows Mr. Clinton is captivated by his reputation as a book person. Paul Greenberg, the editorial page editor of The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, said that Mr. Clinton regarded all culture as "ornamental rather than influential."
Responding to the reports of Mr. Clinton's enthusiasm for Marcus Aurelius, Mr. Greenberg wrote that it was about as plausible as "the news that Richard Nixon had taken up Zen." Mr. Greenberg added that "Clintonized culture" is little more than an exploitation of the arts for political purposes.
Ms. Wright, the former Clinton chief of staff, challenged that view. "His reading," she said, "is part of a lifelong quest for knowledge. He gains it from books and from people. He never stops."
Mr. Greenberg is correct in at least one respect. All politicians exploit the arts as naturally as they kiss babies, and Mr. Clinton is no exception.
Some Music for You
And You and You
For example, at each of his inaugural celebrations as Governor, Mr. Clinton meticulously selected the music to be performed throughout the day, making sure that the program included black gospel singing, a Pentacostal hymn, a Baptist hymn, jazz, pop, rock, symphonic and operatic selections and, always, his favorite Bach choral, "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring."
Partly, his aides insist, that is a sincere expression of the President-elect's love of music and ecclectic taste. Ms. Staley tells how startled she was one day in her youth to hear applause after practicing a Bach fugue on the piano in her home. Bill Clinton had heard her playing, slipped into her livingroom, listened quietly and then burst into applause.
That love of music is also evident when Cathie Buford, a former member of the Governor's staff, tells how exhilarated Mr. Clinton would be after participating in the annual all-night gospel sing in McNeil, Ark., and after singing in the choir of his church, the Immanuel Baptist Church in Little Rock. (Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, being members of the more reserved First United Methodist Church, infrequently attend these events.)
Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the musical programs for Mr. Clinton's past inaugural festivities have been stitched together craftily, using music as a medium for reaching out to various political constituencies.
Mr. and Mrs. Clinton also collect porcelain, fine examples of which they were shown during several trade-promoting trips to the Far East. Arkansas sells more than $80 million a year in poultry to Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. The Clintons are no doubt motivated by an appreciation of the artistry of these objects. Did they, perhaps, suddenly fall in love with a seductively gleaming teapot? Or did they begin to collect in order to flatter their hosts? To foster trade? Probably, the Clintons themselves would find it hard to sort out the answers.
Compassionate Tour
Of an Art Museum
Those who know Mr. Clinton best agree with Ms. Wright that he is attracted to books and the arts as a means of acquiring knowledge and satisfying an all-but-insatiable craving for mental stimulation. For example, David Leopoulos, a boyhood friend, recalled a guided tour of the Tate Gallery in London that Mr. Clinton gave him in the spring of 1970.
Mr. Leopoulos was then in the Army, stationed in Italy, and feeling distraught over the death of his mother, who had been murdered back home. Mr. Clinton, studying at Oxford, invited him to London to take his mind off of his grief.
"I had never heard of the Tate Gallery," Mr. Leopoulos recalled, "but he took me there from the station and began lecturing on the different paintings, the artists and what was going on politically at the time each work was painted that might have influenced it. I couldn't keep my mind on everything he was saying, but his knowledge was amazing."
Mr. Leopoulos said he had asked Mr. Clinton how he had learned so much, and the future President had replied: "Well, since I'm here in England, I felt I should expose myself to what's around."

HEADLINE: 7 Found Dead in a Virginia Coal Mine

BYLINE: By SABRA CHARTRAND, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORTON, Va., Dec. 9

 BODY:
Two and a half days after an explosion rocked South Mountain Mine No. 3 here, hopes that eight miners had survived the blast ended late tonight when grim officials announced they had found the bodies of seven of the men.
United States Assistant Secretary of Labor Bill Tattersall said the miners "apparently died in their work stations" and "did not survive the blast."
He said rescue workers found "seven of the eight bodies," but were unable to locate the last body or remove any of the dead from the mine because of dangerously high levels of methane gas. 
 Sheriff's deputies at the mine site boarded school buses where frightened family members had huddled for days to deliver the devastating news. Many of the relatives collapsed, hugging one another and rocking and crying in each others' arms.
Among the victims were Claude and Palmer Sturgill, brothers whose family first began working in the mines in the 1930's. For over 50 years Sturgill men blasted and drilled, opening solid rock deep in the Appalachains to haul out coal.
Over the decades, a young father died in a mine blast, a cousin was crippled by an earth scraper, and the countless dangerous jobs deep in the shafts left many of the clan injured.
Yet, few knew the dangers of mining coal better than the Sturgills. Like everyone else here, and like people in other hard-scrabble Appalachian towns, the Sturgills also knew that only mining paid a living wage in an area where work itself is scarce and they felt lucky to be earning $14 an hour doing the backbreaking job.
Between them, Claude Sturgill, 49, and his brother Palmer, 44, had eight children. In the cold, snowy days since the explosion on Monday morning, Claude's youngest son, 13-year-old Lee, camped with the rest of his family in a tent at the base of the hillside mine.
"Dad liked the money but he didn't feel safe in the mine and he wanted to find something else," the boy said earlier today. "But he couldn't. Just about everybody in my family works in the coal mines."
 
Losses of Two Kinds
 And now, eight of the 38 employees of the No. 3 mine are dead. The other workers, home at the time of the blast, are out of a job, perhaps permanently. And while there is little comparison between the two blows, people here know that in a place where few have life insurance, pensions or nest eggs, where new mines rarely open and existing ones are turning increasingly to mechanization and where unemployment is already in the double digits, the loss of 38 jobs is devastating, too.
While rescue workers, government investigators and officials from the South Mountain Coal Company, which owns the mine, have not determined the cause of Monday's explosion, all say that high levels of naturally occuring methane gas usually cause such disasters.
Norma Bowman, a Sturgill cousin, spent two and half days in her family's vigil, but never held out much hope.
"This is part of the work, the hazard of the job," she said earlier today. "Those boys all knew the risk. But they didn't have any choice."
 
Pulling Together
 Norton and the surrounding towns are the sorts of places where people rally to help one another faster than any Government agency can react. As soon as word of the explosion spread, townspeople rushed to the trapped men's relatives with blankets, clothes, food and spiritual support.
"This is small area," Mrs. Bowman said. "Everybody is kin to everybody else, and everyone pulls together.
Outside the Sturgill clan's tent, volunteers offered pizza and fried chicken to rescue workers and relatives. Others passed out stocking caps and mittens, while a Salvation Army canteen truck gave away hot coffee and food. In a nearby tent, the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company hooked up telephones for the families.
"An accident like this reminds everybody that there's no such things as an overpaid coal miner," said Jerry Gray, a local lawyer who once was part-owner of a mine but who now earns a living suing mine companies for property owners or miners.
 
Few Alternatives Available
 "If you drive down Main Street, you'll see it's a dying town," Mr. Gray said of Norton, whose population is under 5,000. "We've got high unemployment. They're mining more coal now than ever with fewer men. It's still a single-employer economy, and there will not be other mines opening up for these miners to work in."
Jackie Barnete, another Sturgill cousin, knows well how hard it is to find work outside the mines. He was disabled in a mine accident in 1988 and has not been able to find a job since.
"My Daddy had 37 years in the mines," Mr. Barnete said. "I was in and out of the mines for five years. The pay is good, even in a non-union mine. But I don't get any compensation, and now my wife has to support me and our kids."
Though the focus here was clearly on the fate of the trapped men, there was also worry about what would happen to the miners who had lost their jobs.
"As far as the company taking care of the other miners, that's doubtful," said Howard Campbell, a former South Mountain employee. "They're just out of a job and will have to apply for unemployment."
This lack of security and alternatives saddens, and angers, nearly everyone in small mining communities like Norton. "America wants a cheap product, but they don't realize this kind of cost goes into it," said the Rev. Wayne Harrison, pastor of the First Baptist Church. "But the people in the coal fields are very aware of what goes into it."
Even as he waited this afternoon for word of his father and uncle, Lee Sturgill and his older brother Chris both said they would still welcome work in a mine.
"I'd sure think about it if they offered me a good job," said 25-year-old Chris Sturgill, who now works for a heavy-machine company here.
Lee said: "My Dad doesn't want me to work in the mines He says coal is going to run out in this area pretty soon. But what else is there?"

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
CLINTON TO LEAD TALKS ON ECONOMY

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark, Dec. 9

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton will personally serve as the moderator for 12 hours of nationally televised talks on the economy here next week, to be attended by about 300 business men and women ranging from a South Dakota flower seller to the presidents of Xerox and Apple Computers.
What was originally conceived as a gathering of 25 to 30 business leaders to help form economic policy has ballooned into a full-blown spectacle, with 300 corporate executives, small-business people and economists now invited to take part in the two-day conference. It will be held in the city's largest auditorium and televised live on C-SPAN, with large chunks also being broadcast by CNN and the three major television networks. 
 Aides to the President-elect said he would personally serve as chairman and moderator of the event, which will be broken up during the two days into seven subject areas, ranging from trade to training to how to deal with the debt and the deficit. Mr. Clinton's aides said the different chapter headings of his campaign agenda book, "Putting People First," would serve as the basic outline for the conference.
 
Format for Discussion
 During each of the discussion segments, a different group of 30 of the invited guests will sit around a central table, with the others remaining in the audience. One member of the core group will be charged with presenting a paper on the subject, and then Mr. Clinton will throw open the discussion for all to participate.
Seated alongside the President-elect will be the incoming Administration's top economic advisers, whose selection is to be formally announced Thursday: Senator Lloyd Bentsen, whom Mr. Clinton is expected to nominate for Secretary of the Treasury; Representative Leon E. Panetta, a California Democrat who now heads the House Budget Committee and is the choice for director of Mr. Clinton's Office of Management and Budget, and Robert E. Rubin, co-chairman of Goldman Sachs & Company, who will be the head of a new economic advisory group.
Mr. Clinton has decided to rename that group, transition aides said today, dropping the name Economic Security Council and leaning toward the name National Economic Council. The Economic Security Council name was dropped, they said, because Mr. Clinton's aides feared that American trading partners would find it provocative and almost military in tone.
In addition to naming his top economic aides, Mr. Clinton this week is interviewing other prospective appointees. He has summoned to Little Rock for interviews two candidates to replace Carla A. Hills as United States Trade Representative: Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., who was Deputy Trade Representative in the Reagan Administration and who could provide Mr. Clinton the taste of Republicanism that the President-elect has hinted might be in his Cabinet, and Dr. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
 
Mushrooming of Event
 Participants in the conference were invited from all 50 states, and Clinton aides said that while many of their top donors wanted to be on the list, some had to be shunted aside to make room for a smattering of Republicans. The conference has ballooned in size partly because of the number of people agitating to attend and in part because Mr. Clinton has simply kept adding names.
Those invited include John H. Bryan, chairman of Sarah Lee Corporation; Michael Walsh, chairman of Tenneco Inc.; Sheryl L. Handler, founder of the Thinking Machines Corporation; Gordon E. Moore, chairman of Intel Corporation; John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer Inc.; Paul A. Allaire, chairman of the Xerox Corporation; John A. Young, president of the Hewlett Packard Company, and Alvin J. Boutte, of the Independence Bank of Chicago, a prominent black banker.
There will also be representatives from all three major American automobile manufacturers, although not their chairmen. Thomas Donahue, the secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and Lynn R. Williams, head of the United Steelworkers of America, will be on hand.
And so will Cathleen Piper, owner of the Piper Flower Shop in Yankton, S.D. "I'm a little intimidated," Ms. Piper said. "I may be the smallest, but I have the same problems as the big corporations: I worry about health care for my employees, transportation costs, environmental issues that affect rural America and pay for workers. I am delighted that Clinton would take the time to listen to ordinary Americans before he takes the big steps."
The thrust of the discussions will be remarks by Mr. Clinton and the other participants detailing how they think the economy got to its present state and how best to get out of it. There will be a closing news conference but no final document of recommendations.
"The process itself will be the product," said Mickey Kantor, a member of the Clinton transition board who is organizing the conference. "It will be a defining moment. We will have everyone's attention, and therefore the whole nation will have a chance to connect to what is the most important issue: how to improve the economy."

HEADLINE: Dow Up 1.63, but Secondary Shares Fall

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks posted minor gains yesterday but secondary shares fell after the Nasdaq composite index hit its ninth record close in the 10 sessions on Tuesday.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 1.63 points at 3,323.81, with 230.1 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 In the broader market, losers outpaced gainers 1,121 to 734.
The Nasdaq composite index ended 3.20 points lower at 663.92, down from Tuesday's record close.
"We're due for a little pause; there's no problem there," said Dick Gunter, senior vice president at Wedbush Morgan.
A late influx of buying lifted the blue chips, which had drifted lower earlier in the session. Earlier, the Dow was depressed by losses in key large-capitalization issues and airlines.
"Stocks have reached our short- to intermediate-term targets," said A. C. Moore, an analyst at Argus Investment Management. "We wouldn't be surprised to see the market pull back at this point. I think stocks are at a high level here."
The Federal Reserve's survey of the economy in its so-called beige book found that many manufacturers and retailers were seeing a pickup in activity in most regions of the country. Inflation is low or nil, the report said, confirming other economic data.
Despite the market's broad advance, some traders see more room for gains.
"I think stocks are still the best place to be right now," said Alice Sadlo of McDonald & Company. "I'd try to jump back in if prices got lower."
Traders said the leap in the price of the first-day issue Fresh Choice Inc., which operates restaurants in Northern California, was a sign that investors were still eager to put money into the market. Fresh Choice closed at 24 1/2, up from its initial pricing at 13.
"There's a tremendous amount of cash out there chasing the new issues," said Brian Finnerty, senior vice president at Unterberg Harris.
The Limited topped the most active list on the Big Board, closing down 7/8, to 26 3/4. It was among 11 specialty retailers downgraded by Merrill Lynch.
International Business Machines slumped 2 3/4, to 62 5/8, on speculation that it will make more announcements about restructuring, including additional staff cuts and a possible dividend cut. Standard & Poor's also said it was reviewing the computer giant's debt ratings.
Microsoft shed 1/2, to 92, and Apple Computer fell 1/2, to 57 5/8.
Valence Technology gained 4 3/8, to 25 3/8, after it announced a $100 million deal to sell its solid polymer batteries to Motorola Inc. Amgen fell 2 1/4, to 72 3/4. Prudential cut its rating on the company to hold from buy.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks lost 1.34 points, to 435.65. The American Stock Exchange index fell 1.67, to 392.98.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.80, to 239.44. The average share was down 12 cents.

HEADLINE: U.S. Still Holds Haitians With H.I.V. in Cuba

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Despite warnings of a potential "public health disaster," the Government is still holding more than 200 Haitian refugees infected with the virus that causes AIDS at Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba.
Officials of the Justice Department, which created a special camp for the infected refugees last spring, said it would remain in place until the incoming Clinton Administration decided what to do with them. 
 In letters, memorandums and discussions since the spring, Federal health officials have told the Justice Department that the detention camp was dangerous because people especially vulnerable to diseases like tuberculosis were confined in close quarters.
More than 270 Haitian men, women and children have been held at Guantanamo for more than six months, and some for more than a year. They live in makeshift buildings, sleeping on cots and using portable toilets.
The death of one infant from pneumonia after the baby and its mother were evacuated from the camp, and two attempted suicides inside the camp, have been recorded so far, and doctors fear that more health problems may arise.
"It is common sense I think to realize that concentrating people known to have an infection that causes immunosuprression in a tent city is a potential public health disaster," Dr. Paul V. Effler, an official of the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote in a memo sent to the Justice Department.
"We have growing public health concerns" about the camp, Dr. James O. Mason, Assistant Secretary for Health and chief of the Public Health Service, wrote to the Justice Department last spring. "Housing so many immunosuppressed individuals in close proximity to one another in a camp environment presents substantial risks for infection and potential for uncontrolled, sustained transmission of infectious diseases, both to the H.I.V.-infected persons as well as their families and the health care and other personnel who may share their environment. An epidemic of otherwise easily controllable infectious agents could be a major problem in this environment."
Dr. Mason said the solution was the rapid processing of the refugees' claims and closing of the camp.
But the Justice Department halted all processing of claims because of a two legal disputes: whether people infected with H.I.V. should be allowed to enter the United States, and whether the refugees have a right to come to this country to have their claims heard.
Some 15,000 Haitians have entered the United States since last year's coup, but 274 Haitians remain in legal limbo on Cuba. Many others were sent back to Haiti.
Paul Cappuccio, an associate deputy attorney general, said that it was now clear that the easiest thing to have done would have been to avoid testing the immigrants for H.I.V., and simply treat their claims as those of other Haitians, who must prove under immigration law that they fear political persecution in order to be granted asylum in the United States.
"Though everybody involved in the process thought it would be simpler not to test them for H.I.V., no one in the Administration was comfortable with remaining ignorant," he said. "The Government is just not comfortable turning a deliberate blind eye to the infection, given that there is a statute which states that we must consider this."
The Justice Department had fought for the statute because officials said people infected with H.I.V. would be a social and economic burden if permitted to enter this country. Such restrictions do not apply to people with other illnesses that can be more expensive to treat, like cancer.
President-elect Bill Clinton has said he will end the ban on immigrants infected with H.I.V.
Public Health officials have maintained that AIDS is not a significant hazard from immigrants because it is not spread by casual contact and because the United States, with a million people believed to be infected, already has far more people with H.I.V. than any country from which migrants might come.

HEADLINE: American Vows Millions to Ex-Soviet Science

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 9

 BODY:
An American financier with a philanthropic specialty in post-Communist transitions announced today that he would give $100 million over the next two years in direct research grants to keep former Soviet scientists working in a time of economic crisis.
The pledge by the American, George Soros, is by far the largest gift, government or private, received so far for the support of fundamental science in Russia, Boris Saltykov, Minister of Science and Technology, said at a news conference here today. 
 "What Mr. Soros has done is an extraordinarily generous act and a private statement of his faith in this country," said James Collins, the acting chief of mission at the United States Embassy. "I certainly think he has given the U.S. Government a standard to live by."
Mr. Soros has already distributed $100 million throughout the former Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe over the last five years as part of a broad effort to help build open, democratic societies.
Mr. Soros said the size of his latest grant was dictated by the crisis facing the once-powerful Soviet scientific establishment, and by his desire to set an example for Western governments and financial institutions.
"The thinking behind it is that there were some real values in the natural sciences in the former Soviet Union which are of world standard," he said in a telephone interview from Washington. "To lose them because of economic difficulties would be really a loss for mankind."
Mr. Soros has argued that now is the time for Western aid to be distributed in new, focused and imaginative ways. "This is a demonstration of what can be done," he said.
The salary of the average junior research scientist is now less than 5,000 rubles a month, while full professors make between 6,000 and 7,000 rubles a month. With the official exchange rate now at 419 rubles to the dollar, individual grants of $600 can go far, Russian scientists said today.
The grant from the Soros Foundation will be used to create the International Science Foundation for the Former Soviet Union, which will be based in Moscow and will provide money for research, equipment and scientific institutions in Russia and other former Soviet republics. The first $6 million will be disbursed as "emergency" grants early next year, while $85 million will be ready for distribution by mid-1993, after the foundation sets up for the review of grant applications. The remaining $9 million will cover operating costs.
Mr. Saltykov emphasized that research scientists would be able to apply for the grants directly, bypassing the traditional institutes and academies that until now have controlled the flow of research money.
This approach is certain to shake up the scientific establishment in Russia, which Mr. Soros said is one of his goals. "We are targeting the creative people," he said. "It will undoubtedly lead to a shift in power away from the administrators to the professionals."
Mr. Soros, a Hungarian-born financial expert who has made a fortune in investment funds, said the growth in his own business has allowed him to step up the level of philanthropic activities. "I was looking for a megaproject that would make a bigger impact," he said.
Several other Western institutions have come to the aid of Russian science, which is now suffering from severe budget cutbacks, an outflow of talent abroad and paralyzing uncertainties about the future. Scientists have watched their salaries fall behind inflation and their institutes cut back on personnel. To get their books and articles published, they often have to find sponsors themselves, as publishers seek more lucrative titles.
"Go into any bookstore to the science section, you will see stacks of books on astrology," said Aleksandr Levin, a professor of quantum chemistry. "Russian science needs some serious, focused help now. Science is not like canned goods that you put on a shelf and pick up again five years later. Science is a system which if it is not supported, will die."

HEADLINE: Chip Indicator Posts 3d Rise

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Orders and shipments for chips in the United States market both gained in November, and the semiconductor industry's leading indicator rose for the third time in three months, a trade group reported today.
The Semiconductor Industry Association, based in San Jose, Calif., reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1.13 for the three-month period that ended in November, up from a revised figure of 1.11 in October and from 1.07 in September. The ratio compares orders with shipments. A ratio above 1 indicates rising demand. 
 At $1.90 billion, three-month orders for November were up 5.6 percent from $1.80 billion for the three-month period ended in October and 42.0 percent higher than the comparable figure for one year ago, which was $1.34 billion. Three-month average shipments for November totaled $1.68 billion, up 3.9 percent from October's figure of $1.62 billion. At $1.66 billion, actual United States market shipments for the month of November were up 7.5 percent from October's $1.55 billion.

HEADLINE: Incentives Help Retain A Company In Suffolk

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Defying the trend of companies leaving the New York metropolitan area for the South and the West, a Long Island company announced yesterday that it was closing a factory in California and adding hundreds of jobs in Suffolk County.
But it took a package of $12 million in grants, low-interest loans and other financial incentives from New York State and Suffolk to persuade it not to leave. 
 The company, Symbol Technologies, is a major manufacturer of computerized devices for reading the bar codes used in stores, warehouses and inventory control systems. Although it has been based in Suffolk since it was founded in 1973, it said its rapid growth in recent years had forced it to look at alternative sites in other states.
Describing the deal to keep Symbol in Suffolk as a major victory, state officials said it would reinforce Long Island's role as a center of technologically advanced manufacturing at a time when it has been buffeted by layoffs and business failures.
 
"A New Era'
 "Firms like Symbol will help the Empire State inaugurate a new era of national leadership in advanced technology," Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said in a formal statement.
Symbol, which employs 850 people at its headquarters and a nearby plant in Bohemia, said it would close a plant in Costa Mesa, Calif., which it acquired in 1988, and consolidate all its operations in Suffolk County. It said it would hire 300 workers next year and 600 more by the end of 1996, bringing its total employment on Long Island to 1,750.
In addition to expanding its work force, the company said it would spend $30 million to $50 million to build a new headquarters in the Town of Islip.
"This is the first good news we've had about manufacturing on the Island in years," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since 1986, he said, manufacturing employment on Long Island has plummeted by more than 30 percent, from 180,000 to 124,000, largely because of the shrinkage of military industry activity.
 
Effect of Economy
 Analysts said a company like Symbol, which relies heavily on engineering and computer skills among its workers, is a particularly important prize for Suffolk now because it is bound to employ some of those laid off by military contractors.
For its part, Symbol said part of the appeal of Long Island was its surplus of high-technology workers. "If the Long Island economy were still at the hot pace of the early 1980's, our decision might have turned out differently," said Nancy Tully, a spokeswoman for the company.
She said several states had aggressively courted Symbol with offers of financial incentives, among them Delaware and Maryland. Although the company gave little consideration to leaving Long Island for California, she said proposals from other states were considered because Symbol officials wanted to consolidate all their manufacturing and executive functions, and needed more space than it now has in Bohemia.
What clinched the deal, said officials of the company and the Cuomo administration, was New York State's incentive package. It will provide provide Symbol with $6.6 million in grants and low-interest loans for construction, equipment and job training, $2 million in subsidies for electrical power and road improvements that are to cost $1.2 million.
Suffolk County will provide the company with $2.2 million in property tax abatements.
The incentive package "creates the kind of positive business environment in which high-technology companies can flourish," said Jerome Swartz, a Long Island electrical engineer who founded Symbol in his Stony Brook garage in 1973, and is now the company's chairman.
 
Decades of Losses
 New York State officials said Symbol's decision to expand on Long Island was particularly good news because it comes after decades of job losses and manufacturing relocations to the South and Mexico.
A recent example was announcement a year ago that the General Motors Corporation would close its assembly plant in North Tarrytown, eliminating 3,400 jobs by 1995, and transfer the same assembly operations to Georgia.
The incentives offered to Symbol were similar to those provided many companies that the state has attracted from elsewhere, or persuaded to remain in their New York offices and plants. In a much larger package, the state won agreement from the Union Carbide Corporation to consolidate its Industrial Gases Division in Tonawanda in 1990, but only after providing the company with low-interest loans, grants and other inducements worth $34 million.

HEADLINE: The Rally Wall St. Hardly Noticed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
It has happened quietly, without the flash and drama that made Wall Street what it was in the 1980's. But over the course of the last three months, stock prices have moved to record highs.
The relative lack of attention to the latest bull market may be because of the relatively poor performance of the 30 issues that make up the most famous and widely watched index of stock market performance, the Dow Jones industrial average. At 3,323.81, the Dow is up 4.89 percent this year, but still well below the record 3,413.21 it reached on June 1. 
 But broader, more representative indexes, like the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks and the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter issues, have never been higher.
 
Surprise on Wall Street
 The current rally, which began in early October, has confounded some of Wall Street's ablest professionals.
But it is a run-up that has been sparked and sustained by growing optimism about the economy, which is seen as improving, inflation, which is not viewed as a threat, and the potential of the incoming Clinton Administration. And it has been fed by a steady inflow of new money, much of it invested by mutual funds. Much of that, in turn, has been moving into small stocks.
"The run has surprised us," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers. "But we don't see any argument that says the market is cheap. That makes us cautious. But we were cautious when the S.& P 500 index was at 400 back in early October. Now it is at 436. We have missed the whole rally."
Perhaps the most important reason to explain why the run-up in stock prices has gone largely unnoticed or under-reported is that small investors, not big money managers, are fueling it.
"What has made it difficult for interpreters of this bull market is that it is a different marginal buyer that is moving into stocks," said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads Birinyi & Associates, a stock research firm.
"For years and years the public sold stocks. Now they are coming back."
According to data compiled by Mr. Birinyi, pension plans, which bought an average of $3.5 billion worth of stock each quarter, every quarter, from 1982 through 1989, have cut those purchases in half.
On the other hand, mutual funds, which purchased an average of $14 billion worth of stock each quarter in the 1980's, have been buying at a $40 billion- a-quarter clip in the current decade.
"During the 1980's, people who trade odd lots were net buyers on less than 1 percent of all trading days," Mr. Birinyi added. "This year, that odd-lotter has been a net buyer more than 50 percent of the time." Odd-lot trades are stock tranactions of fewer than 100 shares.
A. Marshall Acuff, chief equity strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said that "it became apparent by August that cash positions at mutual funds had begun to grow. The money was available, and those cash levels were maintained through October. And anecdotally, I hear from some funds they are struggling to get that money to work."
Confronted with the lowest interest rates in two decades, individuals have been shifting out of money market funds and maturing certificates of deposit and into stock and bond funds all year.
But analysts said that investor behavior changed somewhat this fall, and that Bill Clinton's election had a good bit to do with it.
Michael J. Hines, a senior vice president in marketing at Fidelity Investments, said discussions with focus groups of potential investors earlier this year were strikingly similar to ones held four years earlier.
"What we are seeing is very reminiscent to what happened in 1988," Mr. Hines said. "What people were doing then and did again this year was wait until they saw what happened in the election. This year the idea of change inherent in Clinton's victory was viewed as a very positive thing."
After the election, a monthly poll of investor attitudes conducted for Fidelity by the University of Michigan jumped 11 points in November, to its highest level since the early spring of 1991, Mr. Hines said.
In addition to the jump in confidence, analysts said newspaper articles noting that smaller companies tend to do better under Democrats appear to have contributed to the rise in the Nasdaq's composite index in recent months.
"A couple of headline-grabbing articles haven't hurt," said Chip Morris, an investment analyst for the $1.5 billion New Horizons Fund at T. Rowe Price Associates.
"In addition to that, this year it looks like the U.S. economy is recovering, while markets overseas are declining. That means you are seeing a rotation out of big companies who make a substantial part of their profits overseas and into companies who are more U.S.-centric."
The rise in the Nasdaq composite index has been impressive since October, but the recent run-up in prices of smaller companies is merely a continuation of a run that began at the end of September 1990.
Since then, the Dow has risen by 35 percent. The Nasdaq, by contrast, has risen by more than 90 percent.
 
Still a Bargain
 Analysts have also played a big role in touching off the rush to small stocks. Despite their appreciation in price, compared with their price-earnings ratio of the larger companies that make up the Standard & Poor's 500 index, small stocks remain comparatively cheap.
"I still think small stocks are underpriced," said Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company.
That said, few analysts were willing to predict the current rally would go much further in the near term. Indeed, stock prices moved generally lower yesterday, and the Nasdaq index tumbled.
"The market looks toppy now," said Byron Wien, chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "We are closer to the end than the beginning.
"But if you look at where we were at the beginning of the year, attitudes have shifted 180 degrees."
 
Europe Loses Its Sheen
 
 
At the start of the year, Mr. Wien recalled, Europe was the place to invest. Pessimism about the United States was rife.
"Now, we are coming out of recession, we have a leader who seems to be doing everything right and Europe's prospects have faded," he said of the President-elect.
Mr. Acuff at Smith Barney said the current run could last through December and up to Inauguration Day.
"This is sort of play time," he said. "The market keeps moving toward the inauguration as a benchmark. Then the hopes and expectations will be tested. After that, whatever people are looking or hoping for may not happen fast enough to sustain prices."

HEADLINE: Grim to Giddy: Dining Out Is In

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
The mood these days at the Four Seasons, one of New York's landmark restaurants, is positively giddy. In the evening, the restaurant's clubby Grill Room now welcomes a capacity crowd of around 140 guests a night, who order from a new, lower-priced prix fixe menu, instead of the lonely 6 to 10 who dined there earlier in the year. Reservations in the soaring Pool Room have also risen by about 10 percent in the last month.
"Everything had been in a decline or flat," said Alex Von Bidder, the general manager. "Then it just exploded." 
 After five years of layoffs and belt-tightening in the finance, law, publishing, retailing and advertising industries that sharply reduced the need and desire to dine out, restaurants from the most casual to the most exalted appear busy again. Many restaurants enjoying new success, like the Four Seasons, have taken to heart the lessons of the lean years, offering a less expensive menu and a more informal atmosphere.
"The grim mood of the past two or three years seems to be sliding away," said Tom Margittai, an owner of the Four Seasons, who estimated that his restaurant had lost 30 percent of its customers since the beginning of the recession. "We now see signs of better business, and people seem to be in a more spending mood. It's great to get the customers back in the door."
Since 1988, except for a few dozen perennial hot spots, New York restaurants had to shift gears to adjust to the economic decline. As passionate as many chefs and owners had been about their food and wines, they had to become hard-nosed business people, focusing more on attracting and keeping diners and on finding creative ways to control costs.
Many restaurants that were struggling a year ago report that business has improved and that more people are dining out. Joe Baum, managing partner of the Rainbow Room, said reservations for New Year's Eve, at $375 a person, were significantly ahead of last year's. "People are now rewarding themselves, " he added. "They're not as self-conscious about spending money."
 
More Orders, Pricier Wines
 The American Express Company and Visa U.S.A. have registered an increase in the use of their credit cards for dining out. Purveyors of fine foods say they have more orders on their books and are more confident that their invoices will be paid. Restaurants and hotels say more private parties are being scheduled.
Marc Sarrazin, owner of De Bragga & Spitler, a meat wholesaler in lower Manhattan, said his business was up 15 to 20 percent over last year. At the Gotham Bar and Grill, Scott Carney, the general manager, said that in the last couple of months people have been buying more expensive wines; the nightly average has been as much as $44 a bottle, up from $32 or so. And even in restaurants that were prospering despite hard times, like Aureole, reservations have been coming in for those hard-to-fill shoulder periods, around 6 P.M. and after 9:30 P.M.
The improvement began to take hold this summer, say those who regularly take the pulse of the restaurant business in New York, and it seems to have quickened appreciably since the Presidential election.
Around the country, restaurants are generally doing better. There are some problematic pockets, notably in Los Angeles, which has still not recovered from the combined effect of the riots in May and the summer's earthquakes. But in Atlanta, which is looking forward to the Super Bowl in 1994 and the Summer Olympics in 1996, the restaurant scene is flourishing, attracting chefs like Jean-Louis Palladin of Washington and Jean Banchet from Chicago.
Considering other bright economic indicators, like the drop in the jobless rate, it may have been inevitable that more people would start making reservations for dinner instead of buying Lean Cuisine. But helping to fuel the restaurant habit in New York was a promotional device that had a far more dynamic effect on business than originally intended.
The gimmick, lunch for $19.92, offered by about 100 restaurants during the week of the Democratic National Convention in July, was conceived by city officials and restaurateurs as a courtesy, mainly to the delegates and visiting journalists. It proved so effective in generating business that more than half of the participants retained the program through Labor Day and even beyond. A number of them have even added special dinner menus for $24.92.
"We're getting a hell of a lot of credit for something we did not anticipate," said Tim Zagat, president of the Zagat Survey Restaurant Guide, who helped organize the effort. "It proved to be a boon for the entire industry."
By encouraging droves of new customers to feel welcome in pricey restaurants like San Domenico or La Caravelle, the promotion helped fill and energize dining rooms that were once as sparsely visited as a fourth-run movie theater on a Monday afternoon.
 
A Lesson Is Learned
 "We have been able to bring in new traffic," said Tony May, owner of San Domenico, on Central Park South, where the promotion has been continued. "I was very stubborn about lowering prices, but I learned a lesson. Besides, once they come into the restaurant, they don't all order the prix fixe menu." Mr. May added that while his average check has decreased about 20 percent during the promotion, his gross sales have grown about 30 percent.
Nationwide, there has been a 1.8 percent growth in revenues in sit-down restaurants this year, according to the United States Department of Commerce. That is still far below the 6.9 percent growth in 1987, but up from the meager six-tenths of 1 percent in 1991.
"We're anticipating a slightly greater upturn for 1993," said Ron Paul, president of Technomic, a research and consulting firm in Chicago that analyzes these figures regularly. "We're actually more bullish now than we were in September."
Patricia Duffy, the vice president and general manager of the restaurant and entertainment industry for American Express, was optimistic. "We're now seeing a stabilization and growth mode in the industry," she said, "and that's a statement I would not have made a year ago." The number of transactions using the American Express card has increased over last year, but the company won't say by how much.
Thomas C. Edwards, the vice president for travel and entertainment marketing for Visa U.S.A., said that so far this year, card usage for dining has increased more than 10 percent over that of last year, when charges were more than $10 billion. He attributed this increase to improved business, as well as his company's aggressive marketing of the Visa card, which costs restaurateurs less to accept than does American Express.
 
Signs of Growth
 In New York, where the number of permits issued for restuarants by the Health Department has not varied significantly over the last five years, there are signs of growth for the 1993 fiscal year, which began on July 1. From July 1 through Nov. 21, the department reported issuing 8,963 permits, compared with a typical year's total of around 11,700.
And Mr. Zagat's latest guide lists 45 restaurants that have closed in 1992, compared with 57 the year before. It also showed 145 new restaurants this year, compared with 112 in 1991. "That really surprised me," he said.
The list of notable, largely informal newcomers this season includes Brasserie des Theatres, Becco, Banana Cafe, Follonico, Ariel & Michael and One Fifth Avenue, a new restaurant in a familiar location.
In addition, two of New York's leading chefs have new ventures. Jean-Georges Vongerichten of Jo Jo is poised to open Vong, a Thai restaurant, and Daniel Boulud, the former chef of Le Cirque, is scheduled to open a new venture on the Upper East Side early next year.
 
Successful but Closing
 A restaurant can fail or close for reasons not directly related to the economic climate or the amount of business it is doing. For example, Barry and Susan Wine will turn out the lights at the highly regarded Quilted Giraffe on Dec. 31, a decision influenced by the fact that the Sony Corporation, the restaurant's new landlord, is doing major reconstruction. The Wines would have had to close at least temporarily anyway, and this way they obtained a profitable settlement.
"Our business has been up tremendously since late August," said Mr. Wine, who also participated in the $19.92 promotion. "It was sluggish before that."
Still, sometimes the sheer weight of expenses incurred in the high-rolling 1980's can haunt a restaurant right into the grave. Mondrian, on East 59th Street, was one such casualty. It is still on the market for the original rent of $30,000 a month. "When the bank drops it to $20,000 there will be a taker," said Warren Newcorn, the executive vice president of the Winick Realty Corporation in Manhattan, a company that specializes in retail leasing.
Mr. Newcorn said that these days, most landlords are willing to make deals. "Rents are more affordable, a lot of new places are opening, and there are fewer spaces available now," he said. "Our business is up 30 percent over last year."
While landlords are more flexible, restaurateurs appear to have learned a hard lesson. Like investment firms and law offices, restaurants have emerged from the crucible of the late-1980's with a new, leaner management style. "You have to be very careful with costs and overhead," said David Liederman, who revised the menu at Broadway Grill to meet these goals and is now trying to reopen Chez Louis, which he closed in a rent dispute last year.
Steven Wils, the president of Harry Wils & Company, which supplies dairy products and specialty foods to restaurants, said that at the start of the year many of his customers were still ordering lower-quality ingredients to save money. "Not now," he said. "They're still very price-conscious, but they won't compromise on quality. They're bargaining hard."
 
A Demanding Public
 Chefs also say that today the dining public is more demanding and knowledgeable. As a result, the jobs restaurants are doing, especially when it comes to service, have improved strikingly.
Malcolm M. Knapp, president of the food-service-consulting firm in Manhattan that bears his name, compared the restaurant business today to the art market. "The speculators have been squeezed out and the real collectors are back," he said.
Mr. Knapp said he believed that since financial businesses had cut back and stabilized, they would start spending again. He also suggested that since New Yorkers voted heavily for Bill Clinton, the mood is especially buoyant here.
Ariane Daguin, co-owner of D'Artagnan, which supplies game and foie gras to restaurants, agreed. "Since November it has been good news all the way," she said. "We were hurt badly last year." Then, $70,000 in invoices were not paid, she continued but added, "I don't expect that to happen now."
For the most part, however, the optimism is hesitant. For example, while the reservation book at Le Bernardin, the plush French seafood restaurant in midtown where business has slipped since 1990, is full this month, Gilbert LeCoze, an owner, said, "Business is now about the same as last year, and I think it will be another year before things will be better."
December can always be counted on to be the busiest month of the year. As Ms. Daguin said: "People don't go out of business in December. They go out in January and that's when we'll really know." Or will we?
Mr. Paul, the Chicago consultant, said he expected restaurant sales to collapse in January, but he took a longer view. "December is great," he said, "and January is traditionally a terrible month. We all know that. The real question now is how many places will still be in good shape by the time April rolls around."

HEADLINE: Bid Is Weighed to Make Sales Tax Rise Permanent in Suffolk

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., Dec. 9

 BODY:
As Suffolk County lawmakers gave final approval today to a 5.8 percent increase in the property tax rate for 1993, Republican leaders raised the idea of making a temporary one-cent increase in the county sales tax into a permanent levy.
The Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, noting that the temporary sales tax increase was due to expire at the end of 1993, said he planned to ask state lawmakers to make most, if not all, of the tax increase permanent. The additional penny on the dollar generates $120 million a year. 
 Donald R. Blydenburgh, a Republican and presiding officer of the County Legislature, proposed that the sales tax issue be decided in a public referendum next November, when all 18 county legislators are up for re-election.
 
'The Major Issue'
 "Taxes will be the major issue, and the voters should have the chance to tell their lawmakers what to do," Mr. Blydenburgh said.
Meanwhile, the County Legislature this afternoon gave unanimous approval to next year's property tax rate, which will show up in tax bills that should arrive in the mail along with New Year's greetings. The increase will help to balance the county's $1.5 billion 1993 budget. For the average homeowner, the tax bill will rise by $37, to $677, county officials estimated.
Although the sales tax issue was not on the official agenda for today's meeting, the debate began in private among lawmakers, wary that their comments now could come back to haunt them next November.
The temporary sales tax increase was approved by the State Legislature in half-penny increments over the last two years as a way of balancing the county budget, paying back loans and providing additional funds for the Nassau County Police Department. The sales tax now totals 8.5 percent in the county.
Both half-penny increases are to expire on Dec. 31, 1993, and both state and county legislators would have to approve any increase.
Mr. Gaffney first mentioned making all or part of the sales tax increase permanent during talks last week with financial analysts from Moody's Investors Service before it reaffirmed Suffolk's Baa1 bond rating, which is two grades above junk-bond status.
In a statement issued to the county by Moody's, analysts noted that Suffolk had taken "important steps toward restoring the county's financial position." But the analysts noted that Suffolk was still faced with a "significant challenge" in 1993.
Mr. Gaffney said he was hopeful that the state and county legislatures would vote to keep at least three-quarters of the sales tax increase to help pay for the growing number of mandated state and Federal programs. He said the portion of the sales tax revenues being used to retire a one-time borrowing of $35 million to help cover a 1990 budget deficit could be allowed to expire.
Paul Sabatino, legal adviser to the Suffolk Legislature, said the sales tax question "could not be discussed in a vacuum." He suggested that the legislators may have to link it to another issue -- relief from mandated state and Federal programs.
He said economic circumstances might also determine whether the continuing revenues from the sales tax extension would be needed.
"If the economy picks up, we would all benefit," he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up on Expectations Of Stronger U.S. Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against major currencies yesterday amid perceptions that the United States economy was improving. Gold prices fell.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $333.60 an ounce, down $1.80 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold fell $1.50, to a late price of $333.75. 
 Zlatko Glamuzina, chief currency dealer at Banco di Sicilia, said the dollar was a double beneficiary of bad international news and good domestic news.
The market likes President-elect Bill Clinton's reported choices for various economic posts and it likes the improving economy, even though the improvement is slow, he said.
And, he said, the market is skittish about political and economic troubles worldwide: the Hong Kong financial markets are troubled, the German economy is skidding, the British economy is in recession and Japan's markets are roiling.
"The only place the international money can go is the United States," whether it is in dollars, Treasury securities or the stock market, Mr. Glamuzina said. "You will get ahead in the short term."
In New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 124.05 Japanese yen, up from 123.75 yen late Tuesday. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 123.85 yen, up 0.02 yen from Tuesday's close. The dollar closed at 123.95 yen in London.
In New York, a British pound cost $1.5660, down from $1.59975 late Tuesday. In London, the pound was quoted at $1.5695, down from $1.5975 late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5725 German marks, up from 1.5562; 1.4105 Swiss francs, up from 1.3945; 5.3665 French francs, up from 5.3065; 1,393.00 Italian lire, up from 1,367.50, and 1.27305 Canadian dollars, up from 1.27225.
The price of gold fell $1.65 in London to $334.00 an ounce. In Zurich, gold fell $1.45, to $333.80. In Hong Kong, gold lost $2.16 to close at $334.58.
On the Commodity Exchange, silver closed at $3.688 an ounce, down from $3.739 late Tuesday. Silver traded in London at a bid price of $3.72 an ounce, down from Tuesday's $3.77.

HEADLINE: Fed Survey Finds an Upturn, but an Uneven One

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The economy is improving modestly but unevenly across the country, with retailers expressing optimism about the holiday season, the Federal Reserve said today.
In its periodic assessment of the state of the economy, the central bank said almost all regions were experiencing "a slight to moderate pickup in some or all sectors of the economy" while noting specifically that California was doing worse than other states. 
 The report, the latest in a string of favorable economic news, could reduce the pressures on President-elect Bill Clinton to give the economy a quick jolt with short-term economic stimulus measures. As he maneuvers to make sure that the public and Congress still back his call for long-term economic changes, Mr. Clinton has been saying over and over again that the economy remains in unsatisfactory shape. .
The report, known as the beige book, stated that sales for existing and new single-family homes were up throughout the nation. It added that manufacturing was increasing in just half the nation, with factories in New York and California continuing to face soft demand. Continuing cutbacks in military production remain a "notable drag on the recovery in some regions," the report said.
The latest beige book was noticeably more optimistic than the one issued five weeks ago. It is based on information gathered by the nation's 12 Federal Reserve District Banks before Dec. 1.
The central bank's chief policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, will discuss the report's conclusions when it meets to assess monetary policy on Dec. 22.
 
No Rate Action Seen
 "The report paints a positive picture, but you're also left with the impression that the recovery is subpar and is struggling to get off the ground," said Hugh Johnson, chief economist with the First Albany Corporation, a New York-based brokerage firm. "Still, I don't think, based on this report, that there is enough weakness in the economy to push the Fed to ease policy another notch."
In interviews last week, several Fed officials said they were so pleased with the low inflation and the pickup in growth that they saw no need to raise or lower short-term interest rates in the near future.
The beige book stated that "little to no general inflationary pressure is reported," although it noted that high factory operating rates were expected to lead to higher prices for steel and construction materials.
David W. Mullins Jr., the Fed's vice chairman, said in an interview last week: "We've made a lot of progress on inflation. The outlook for the future suggests further progress."
The report was most optimistic about the outlook for retailing and housing.
"Except in California, retailers reportedly expect 1992 holiday sales gains to be better than last year's," the report said. It noted that the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago said retailers in the region expected "the best performance in eight years" this holiday season, while the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said the sense among retailers was for a gain, but "nothing spectacular."
Construction and real estate, the report said, "tell a tale of two markets, with improvements in the residential sector, but continued stagnation on the commercial side."
 
A Problem Area
 In New England, the commercial real estate market "is very slow and shows no sign of recovery," the report said, noting that office vacancy rates continued to hover stubbornly near 20 percent.
For New York and New Jersey, home builders reported some modest improvement and office leasing activity rose strongly in midtown Manhattan, up 23 percent in the first nine months of this year from the level a year earlier. In downtown Manhattan, however, the pace of leasing activity has been flat.
According to the report, nonfarm employment has continued to decline in New York and New Jersey, although the rate of job losses has slowed. It noted that the Grumman Corporation planned to cut 500 more jobs on Long Island by the end of March, while the Miller Brewing Company will cut 180 jobs in upstate New York early next year.
The bleakest part of the report concerned California. "Cutbacks continue in aerospace and defense-related manufacturing, retail sales are sluggish and the state's fiscal condition has worsened," the report said.

Tax-Exempt Yields Plunge; Taxables Post Slight Rise

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Yields offered by tax-exempt money market funds were down sharply this week because of increased demand and a tightening supply of short-term municipal securities, according to the most recent survey by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, the newsletter that tracks money-market mutual funds.
But taxable money market fund yields rose slightly, the newsletter said. 
 The steep drop in tax-exempt yields followed a slight rise in the previous week. Still, assets increased $3.2 billion in the latest week, to a total of $101.1 billion. Analysts said corporations and other large institutional investors moved into the money funds to have a source of ready cash for mid-December corporate tax bills. Individuals moved into the funds to reduce tax exposure after taking gains in stocks and bonds.
The average number of days left to maturity of securities held in fund portfolios was unchanged from last week, at 62 days.
The seven-day average compounded tax-exempt yield was down 11 basis points, to 2.10, with the simple yield down 10 basis points, to 2.08 percent. IBC/Donoghue's statisticians calculate that over the course of 30 days, the average compounded yield is 2.18 percent, down 4 basis points, with the simple yield at 2.16 percent, also down 4 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Making no assumption for state taxes, the taxable equivalent of the seven-day compounded yield this week for investors in a 28 percent tax bracket comes to 2.92 percent and to 3.04 percent for those in a 31 percent bracket.
From its survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, IBC/Donoghue's said the Strong Municipal Money Market fund distributed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management was still outperforming the others, yielding 2.74 percent this week, down 11 basis points from last week's 2.85.
Among taxable money market funds, the average seven-day compounded and simple yields were both up 2 basis points, to 2.83 percent and 2.79 percent, respectively.
Assets of taxable funds were up $7.7 billion, to a total of $483.6 billion. About $6 billion of the increase came from funds open only to institutional investors, like pension funds and corporations, probably to prepare for tax payments, said Mary Sue Hoban, acting editor of the newsletter, based in Ashland, Mass. The remainder came from investors who took gains in other markets and want to remain liquid through the end of the year, she said.
IBC/Donoghue's analysts said the average days left to maturity of the funds' securities slipped to 60, from 62.
This week, bank money market accounts, which compete with the funds, had an average yield of 2.77 percent.

HEADLINE: Dole Expects Income Drop

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif., Dec. 9

 BODY:
The Dole Food Company said today that this year's earnings will plummet to $15 million from $134 million in 1991, citing tough times in the banana business, charges for accounting changes and restructuring costs.
Dole's shares lost $1.125, to $28.875, on the New York Stock Exchange after news of the company's earnings estimate. 
 "Dole's earnings are being reduced primarily by lower worldwide prices for bananas and lower market demand caused by a major global recession," David H. Murdock, chairman and chief executive officer, said.
It also forecast that its fourth-quarter earnings will sink to $4 million from $29 million a year earlier, adding that this "is primarily attributable to reduced prices in the company's banana operations."
The company said the fourth-quarter results will reflect a $12 million after-tax insurance recovery relating to the 1991 Costa Rican earthquake and a charge of $27 million to cover severance and other costs associated with a cost-cutting program. The cost- cutting program involves job reductions and plant consolidations, the company said. Dole said it would take a one-time charge of $50 million and a retroactive adjustment to prior earnings of $32 million to comply with new accounting rules covering future retiree medical benefits.

Free Agents Remain Anything but Free

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., Dec. 9

 BODY:
In a frenzy unprecedented in the 17-year history of free agency, clubs have signed 35 free agents in three days to contracts worth $225 million.
After 10 free agents signed on Monday and 16 on Tuesday, nine more signed today. Greg Maddux, the latest pitcher to spurn the Yankees, led the third-day parade, agreeing to a five-year, $28 million deal with the Atlanta Braves tonight. Among the free agents who joined him, Andre Dawson marched to Boston for two years and $9.3 million; Todd Worrell to Los Angeles for three years and $9.5 million; Mike Moore to Detroit for three years and $10 million, and Randy Myers to the Chicago Cubs for three years and $11 million. 
 The recent rash of signings brought to 64 the number of free agents who have signed new contracts. That total, too, is unprecedented for this date.
In 1989, 43 free agents had signed by Dec. 9. That was the previous highest number for this period. But the average number signed by this date in the first 16 years was 18.
The signing splurge struck particularly hard this week. The previous record number of free agents signed in a three-day period was 22. Those deals were made during the winter meetings in 1989. In the entire week of the meetings last year, a seven-day period from Saturday through Friday, only 13 free agents were signed.
 
A One-Day Record
 The 16 who reached agreement on new deals Tuesday were more than that entire week and were a one-day high for the 17 years since free agency began after the 1976 season. The previous one-day high was 13 last Dec. 19.
The number of free-agent signings, though, has not been the only significant development. The amount of money clubs have agreed to give the players also is astounding.
The richest contract, of course, is the $43.75 million gift the San Francisco Giants presented to Barry Bonds on Tuesday in a not-so-neatly wrapped package. Just a couple of hours later, the Kansas City Royals twisted David Cone's arm until he accepted a $9 million signing bonus to be paid this month. Cone hadn't even bought a lottery ticket.
And the series of signings hasn't even included Mark McGwire, Ruben Sierra and Jimmy Key.
Bud Selig, chairman of the executive council, whose Milwaukee Brewers lost Paul Molitor in the economic spree, was asked today about the development.
"Every club must do what they do," he said, speaking in unfamiliar thoughts for him. "Every club has the right to make business decisions. One of the problems we have in this industry is we have a group of clubs in association that have widely divergent characteristics. It's hard for some people to understand what others are doing."
But then he added, "It only points up why we need a different system."
The record three-day frenzy comes just days after baseball's economic study committee submitted its report to the 28 clubs and the Players Association. Although one of the four members dissented, the report paints a dire picture of the game's economy and recommends a new system in which clubs would share a greater proportion of their revenue and would pay players with a percentage of their revenue.
Furthermore, most of the money the clubs have committed themselves to spending in these new contracts will come from post-1993 revenues. Next season is the last of the national television contracts -- clubs will receive $401 million in 1993 -- and baseball and television people have predicted that income will plunge drastically.
The players wonder how accurate those projections can be when the clubs are agreeing to such mammoth contracts. The salaries and signing bonuses in the 35 contracts that have been signed in these three days total $225,335,000. The 48 guaranteed contracts that free agents have agreed to in the entire signing period are worth $365.3 million.
And those totals don't include the four-year, $24 million contract signed Tuesday by Seattle Mariners center fielder Ken Griffey Jr., who has had only four years in the major leagues, two years short of free agency eligibility. The Mariners apparently don't expect salaries to fall in the next few years; otherwise, why would they agree to pay Griffey $7 million each in 1995 and '96?
The Oakland Athletics, on the other hand, vowed to slash their payroll this winter, and they already have lost Moore and Dave Stewart as free agents and also could lose McGwire, not to mention Sierra, although they figure to sign one of the hitters.
The Braves tempered their signing of Maddux by immediately trading pitcher Charlie Leibrandt to Texas, thus freeing his $2.5 million salary to use for Maddux's signing bonus. But the Braves also will pay Maddux a $5 million salary next year, followed by salaries of $3.5 million, $5 million and $6 million each of the last two years.
Stewart jumped to the Toronto Blue Jays with a two-year, $8.5 contract Tuesday night. Moore reached agreement with the Tigers late today on a deal that will pay him a $1 million signing bonus and a $3 million salary each year for three years.
The Tigers, with a new owner, have joined other recently purchased clubs in spending sprees their previous owners did not make. The Mariners, the Giants and the Houston Astros also are in that nouveau spending clique.
Seventeen of the 28 clubs have signed the three-day wonders, some limiting themselves to low-paid players. The Blue Jays, looking to win another pennant, have not been one of the meager spenders. Stewart, Molitor and Joe Carter have cost them $41 million.
The Dodgers, like the Athletics, want to reduce their payroll, but they needed a closer in their bullpen so they gave Worrell a $1.25 million signing bonus and salaries of $2 million each of the first two years and $4.25 million the third. The Cubs signed Myers to be their closer for a $1 million signing bonus and salaries of $3.25 million each of the first two years and $3.5 million the third.
The Cubs, however, didn't want to spend to retain Dawson so the 38-year-old outfielder went to the Red Sox for a $350,000 signing bonus and salaries of $4.7 million and $4.25 million.
Other free agents who signed today were outfielder Milt Thompson, Philadelphia, 2 years, $2.75 million; pitcher Jim Deshaies, Minnesota, 1 year, $1 million; pitcher Kelly Downs, Oakland, 2 years, $1.3 million, and outfielder Dave Martinez, Giants, 2 years, $2.2 million.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: A Cabinet Begins to Take Shape;
CLINTON TEAM TAKES SHAPE WITH BENTSEN AND 4 OTHERS NAMED TO ECONOMIC POSTS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 10

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton began to give shape to his Cabinet today with the appointment of an economic team of old hands from Washington and Wall Street to help him fulfill his campaign promise of fundamental economic change.
The distinctly mainstream array of advisers that Mr. Clinton introduced at the old Arkansas State House, led by Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as Treasury Secretary, seemed intended to mobilize lawmakers and executives behind his economic program, and to signal that the Clinton Administration will be as serious about reducing the deficit as about any new spending programs.
 
Diversity in Jobs
 Along with Senator Bentsen, Mr. Clinton named Representative Leon E. Panetta of California, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, as director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, M. Alice Rivlin, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, as Mr. Panetta's deputy, Roger C. Altman, an investment banker, as Deputy Treasury Secretary, and Robert E. Rubin, the co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, as senior economic adviser. 
 As he spoke, Mr. Clinton was preparing to name a more diverse group to other top Administration jobs. On Friday, Clinton aides say, he will name Carol M. Browner, a former assistant to Vice President-elect Al Gore and currently Secretary of Environmental Regulation in Florida, as head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
The choice of Ms. Browner was something of a surprise. Earlier in the week, aides said the top candidate was Madeline Kunin, a former Vermont governor. But now they say that Mr. Clinton chose to let Mr. Gore take the lead in appointing environmental officials.
In addition, the Clinton aides say he will name Donna Shalala, chancellor of the University of Wisconsin and former head of Hunter College in New York City, as Secretary of Health and Human Services.
 
Looking at Foreign Affairs
 And they say he will name Laura D'Andrea Tyson, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, to head the Council of Economic Advisers, and Robert B. Reich, a political scientist at Harvard University, as Secretary of Labor.
Mr. Clinton is also said to have all but formally decided to name former Mayor Henry Cisneros of San Antonio as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; Senator Timothy E. Wirth of Colorado, who retired this year, as Secretary of Energy, and former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, a 1988 Democratic Presidential contender, as Secretary of the Interior.
In light of the crisis in Somalia and other pressing foreign affairs problems that have recently come to the fore, the President-elect is vigorously trying to narrow his choices for Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense and national security adviser, aides said.
Mr. Clinton's transition director, Warren M. Christopher; Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, remain high on Mr. Clinton's short list for the State Department, the aides said, but he keeps pressing for more names as well.
Asked today about General Powell, Mr. Clinton said: "I certainly think he is qualified to be Secretary of State." But he added with a smile, "I'll tell you who I am considering for that position when I announce my appointment for Secretary of State."
Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic national chairman, has been asked to consider the post of Ambassador to the United Nations, but has not responded, members of the transition staff said.
At today's news conference, Mr. Clinton seemed intent on focusing exclusively on his core economic advisers and on economic issues.
"Our nation faces two deficits, a budget deficit and an investment deficit," Mr. Clinton said as he introduced his first Cabinet appointments. "I am going to work my heart out with these people to construct a strong, long-term plan for economic growth, for jobs, for incomes, and to reduce our national debt."
As he promised during the campaign, Mr. Clinton also created a new post in the White House -- a senior economic adviser to coordinate foreign and domestic policy through a new National Economic Council. Mr. Clinton named Mr. Rubin to that post, which carries the same rank as the national security adviser. The new council is intended to coordinate foreign and domestic economic strategies in much the same way as the National Security Council does in diplomatic and security affairs.
The choice of Mr. Altman, a friend of Mr. Clinton from their days at Georgetown University, as Deputy Treasury Secretary, may prove to be delicate issue for a President who campaigned on saving jobs and fending off foreign encroachments on American markets an industries. He is vice chairman of the Blackstone Group, an investment bank specializing in international mergers and acquisitions. Like many companies of its type, the Blackstone Group has aggressively solicited business abroad, and several years ago ran a a full-page advertisement in a Japanese newspaper offering its services to Japanese companies interested in taking over American companies.
Over all, Mr. Clinton has chosen a team of Wall Street and Congressional veterans, known more for parliamentary skills and business experience than for economic innovation. While the words change and innovation were the hallmarks of Mr. Clinton's campaign oratory, the appointees, aside from Mr. Bentsen, are probably stronger advocates of deficit-reduction than big new spending programs.
As a Clinton adviser said: "The message to Wall Street was steady as she goes, nothing different or innovative to worry about. This is the establishment here, all people very concerned about the deficit. I think Bill feels that with regard to economic policy, he can be his own top adviser. He knows what he wants to do and these people will be good at implementing it."
 
His Own Top Adviser
 Mr. Clinton said as much when he told reporters, "I will be the chief economic adviser in my Administration and I would take responsibility for addressing both the short and long-term economic challenges facing us."
As always, though, Mr. Clinton offered no specifics about painful measures he might offer to American taxpayers to pay for his programs.
Mr. Clinton said he wanted his economic team in place in time to help oversee the economic conference he has called for Monday and Tuesday in Little Rock, which will bring together about 300 business executives from around the country to discuss the state of the economy and how best to revive it.
The economic program Mr. Clinton's team will be asked to put into effect, as it currently shapes up, looks like some version of the outline he gave during the campaign: tax increases for Americans making more than $200,000 a year, tax reductions for the middle class, an investment tax credit for businesses creating jobs and $20 billion in new spending on roads, bridges, highways and high-technology transportation and communications systems.
Mr. Clinton promised all of that plus halving the budget deficit within four years.
The first challenge for the group will be deciding in the coming weeks whether the economy is rebounding enough now or whether it needs an extra dose of economic stimulus. Then, if more stimulus is needed, how should it be squared with a credible program to reduce the deficit.
As if reflecting some advance agreement, each of the new appointees included lines in their opening statements clearly intended to play down expectations for a quick fix.
"The American people realize that these challenges did not develop overnight and won't be fixed overnight," Mr. Bentsen said.
"The structural economic problems facing this country are deep-seated and can't be solved overnight," Mr. Altman said.
"There remain some deep and fundamental problems in the economy," Representative Panetta said.
Mr. Bentsen, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Altman, are all millionaires, and Mr. Rubin in particular has been a big donor to the Democratic Party for years. Mr. Clinton was asked, but did not answer, why he was turning to such Washington insiders, for his top economic advisers.
When Mr. Bentsen, who was known for granting more than a few large tax breaks for special interest business lobbies as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was asked to respond to this question he sidestepped it. "I have heard all those stories about my being an insider," he said. "Let me tell you I felt like an outsider for 12 years, and I'm tired of the gridlock."
 
Defining Jobs
 One of the points that was not resolved in the news conference was exactly what Mr. Rubin will do, and how his role as economic coordinator will be meshed with the Secretary of the Treasury, who has historically served in that function.
Under President Bush, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was the head of the Economic Policy Council, a body that was abolished about a year ago and drew wide criticism for producing little in the way of policy initiatives.
Trying to explain it, Mr. Clinton said: "First of all the Secretary of the Treasury will be the principal economic spokesperson for the Administration after the President. Mr. Rubin's job will be to coordinate, facilitate and provide some direction to the deliberations of our economic council. It will be a larger group than the National Security Council because it will include some others like Commerce, Labor, Energy, and it is a very important job. But in the end I will make the ultimate decisions and be the ultimate arbiter.
"Because we want to bring in more people in a systematic way and reconcile what these departments are doing so they can reinforce and energize one another. I decided I needed someone on the domestic side to be that sort of coordinator and facilitator, but these departments will each stand on their own bottoms and the Treasury will still be the place where the President's economic views are spoken for."
 
Old Hands for Clinton's New Economic Team
President-elect Bill Clinton turned to the center of the economic and political specturm with his choice of Senator Lloyd Bentsen, at right, as Treasury Secretary and Representative Leon E. Panetta as Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the top two economic jobs, and by naming Robert E. Rubin to the new post of senior senior economic adviser, Alice M. Rivlin as deputy budget director and Roger C. Altman as deputy Treasury Secretary. The choice of centrists could be important at a time when economists and politicians on the left and the right are arguing that the budget deficit is of secondary importance and when the number at the center willing to advocate the bitter medicine needed to lower the deficit seems to be shrinking.
 
Roger C. Altman -- Vice chairman of the Blackstone Group, a New York investment bank who was a student at Georgetown University with Mr. Clinton in the 1960's...46...Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance in the Carter Administration and played a role in the rescues of the Chrysler Corporation and New York City...is among those who say that any financial stimulus to the sluggish economy must be applied with caution so as not to aggravate the Federal budget dificit or disturb the financial markets.
 
Alice M. Rivlin -- Economist...61...first director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1975 to 1983, where she earned considerable respect for professional and nonpartisan economic forecasts, options and analysis...former president of the American Economics Association...now an economist at the Brookings Institution and visiting professor of public policy at George Mason University...has long sounded the alarm over the huge budget deficits...in a recent book she called for for a shift from Washington and to the state capitals of programs like job training and public works, a sharp contrast to Mr. Clinton's position that his foremost responsibility as President is to promote economic growth and job creation..
 
Rep. Leon E. Panetta -- Democrat of California...54...elected to the House in 1976...chairman of the House Budget Committee since 1989...started as a Republican and switched parties in 1971...was a leading architect of the 1990 budget agreement aimed at reducing the deficit and has defended it against spending proposals, including those of many Democrats, that would pierce the agreement's limits...this year he drafted a long-term deficit-reduction plan calling for deep spending cuts and tax increases to pay for any new spending programs.
 
Robert E. Rubin -- Co-chairman and 26-year veteran of the investment banking firm of Goldman, Sachs and Company...54...has a reputation as a good manager who absorbs diverse opinions and then focuses on building consensus...not a particular ideologue, but many believe he would bring a willingness to balance concern about the financial markets with concern about economic and political needs...long-time Democratic fund-raiser who helped raise millions of dollars to finance the Democratic National Convention in July.

HEADLINE: The Transition: An Eye Toward Wall Street and Capitol Hill;
Promises Before Policies

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
With the choices he announced today, President-elect Bill Clinton indicated that the main responsibility of the top economic policy officials in his Administration would be not so much to develop new policy as to get his campaign promises enacted quickly.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen and Representative Leon E. Panetta have mastered tax and budget policy like few others in public life. The high regard with which they are held by their peers in Congress should prove invaluable to Mr. Clinton, who says he is determined to break the deadlock between the White House and Capitol. 
 Their intelligence and political skill aside, neither Mr. Bentsen nor Mr. Panetta has concentrated on developing views about preparing for the economy of the 21st century. Similarly, Robert E. Rubin, the investment banker who is to be the chief economics coordinator in the White House, is said to be a smart and efficient manager, and is not known as someone who offers new ideas about the economy.
 
Painful Measures Ahead
 Mr. Clinton apparently felt he did not need philosophers right away but sought the special talent of two accomplished politicians and a highly successful Wall Street investor to win approval of the painful measures necessary to lower the budget deficit.
The President-elect has already formulated a detailed plan involving higher taxes on the wealthy, a tax cut for the middle class, an investment tax credit for business and new spending on public works projects, and he has vowed to push this package through Congress in his first 100 days in office. That does not leave much room for further policy development for a while.
Mr. Clinton almost said as much at his news conference today. He said he had chosen Mr. Bentsen to be Treasury Secretary because of the Senator's "stature, dignity and respect." He said he had picked Mr. Panetta to be budget director to win "swift and effective implementation of our economic plan."
But if he succeeds at the outset, Mr. Clinton presumably will then begin to "chart a new course in the world economy," as he promised in his election campaign. How, for example, can American industries compete better with those of Europe and Japan? How should schools and job-training programs be improved? What steps will be needed in the next decade to prepare for a time early in the next century when the country has a much higher ratio of retired people to workers than it does now?
Mr. Clinton addressed such matters in broad brush during the campaign, but Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Panetta, perhaps because of their legislative responsibilities, have tended to look at economic issues more narrowly.
Mr. Bentsen's foremost initiative in the last few years has been to advocate a tax break to encourage upper-income taxpayers to save money. Whatever the merits of the Texan's proposal, no one thinks it would result in a fundamental change in the economy.
Mr. Panetta is one of the few lawmakers who have consistently argued that most Americans should pay higher taxes and relinquish Government benefits to lower the Federal budget deficit. But the California Congressman has rarely addressed the longer range question of what should be done once the deficit problem is licked.
 
In Line for Labor
 The economic philosopher among the Clinton insiders is Robert B. Reich, the head of the economics transition team. Mr. Reich (it is pronounced Reish) was not included in the first round of announcements today, but Clinton aides say he will be named Secretary of Labor. Mr. Reich, by virtue of being a close friend of Mr. Clinton, will probably be an influential force in the new Administration.
As Mr. Clinton selects people for top jobs in other areas where his campaign promises were less explicit and action less urgent than on the economy, he will be looking more for people he considers capable of developing broad approaches to policy questions -- visionaries, some of his advisers say.
That will be especially important in foreign affairs, where Mr. Clinton is on less familiar ground than he is with economic issues and where he will have the chance like no other President since Harry S. Truman to establish policies reflecting a completely changed world.
Boldness will also be needed in health care, where Mr. Clinton has promised to revamp the current system so that costs are controlled and everyone can get affordable insurance.
 
Turning to the Familiar
 But today, the spotlight was not on foreign policy or the medical system but on the economic choices and on the particular views, talents and liabilities of the people Mr. Clinton is putting into the top jobs.
George Bush, whose own background is in business, relied for economic counsel largely on advisers with a business perspective like Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and John H. Sununu, his first chief of staff.
Similarly, Mr. Bentsen, Mr. Panetta and Mr. Rubin are, like Mr. Clinton, lawyers, although none have practiced law for years. By picking Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Panetta for the top two economic jobs, and by naming Mr. Rubin, Alice M. Rivlin and Roger C. Altman to other important positions, Mr. Clinton turned to the center of the economic and political spectrum.
 
A Shrinking Center
 That could be important at a time when economists and politicians on the left and the right are arguing that the budget deficit is of secondary importance and when the number at the center willing to advocate the bitter medicine needed to lower the deficit seems to be shrinking.
The new line-up of advisers may dispel the notion held in some circles here and on Wall Street that Mr. Clinton is not completely committed to reducing the deficit, a view that developed because the President-elect has never said specifically what sacrifices he would ask Americans to make. But today's announcement will do little to reassure critics who hoped Mr. Clinton would look beyond Washington and Wall Street for his economic advice.
Mr. Bentsen has such stature as his party's Vice-Presidential nominee in 1988 and as the chairman of the most important committee in the Senate that he is almost certain to restore to the Treasury the influence the Department had when John B. Connally was Treasury Secretary in the Nixon Administration and when James A. Baker 3d held the post in Ronald Reagan's second term. Mr. Clinton made it clear at his news conference this afternoon that Mr. Bentsen would be his chief lieutenant on economic matters.
In the Bush Administration, Mr. Brady, whose political experience was limited, was generally overshadowed by Mr. Darman and others.

HEADLINE: Across the U.S., Immigrants Find the Land of Resentment

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
On her way home from school recently, a Chinese immigrant girl was attacked by other teen-agers who spray-painted her face black. She and her guidance counselors at the Seward Park High School in lower Manhattan were horrified, but they were not shocked. Attacks on newly arrived immigrants are a routine occurrence at their school, they said.
Similarly, a Salvadoran dishwasher, assaulted and robbed recently on his way into a money-transfer agency in Hempstead, L.I., was frightened but not surprised by the message of his assailants, who were black: "You steal our jobs, we steal your money." Tensions had been building between the entrenched black community and the Central American newcomers to the town. 
 And on Staten Island, when a group of junior high school students repeatedly vandalized the house of Indian immigrants, smashing windows and splattering blue paint on the facade, the final message, chalked on the driveway, was sadly predictable to the family. "Indians go home," it said. "Leave or die."
Across the country, immigrants say they are feeling the brunt of a growing and complex hostility, the same kind of antagonism that has cropped up periodically in United States history. As their numbers increase sharply and the recession lingers, immigrants find themselves the target of a mix of social anxieties: economic tension, free-floating anger seeking an outlet and the volatile ethnic discord plaguing many cities. And because most new immigrants are not white, there are racial overtones to the friction.
Even in New York, which proudly defines itself as a haven for immigrants, the "gorgeous mosaic" of diverse populations, as Mayor David N. Dinkins calls it, has its chips. Some New Yorkers, particularly those down on their luck, seem to resent the presence of so many immigrants, as if the American dream were in danger of becoming the exclusive province of newcomers.
"Unfortunately, immigrant-bashing is no longer an unpopular activity," said Dennis deLeon, the city's Human Rights Commissioner. "I sense that immigrants are being scapegoated for a lot of our problems. A certain kind of xenophobic bigotry has come out of the closet."
Most advocates for immigrants stress, however, that the United States remains markedly tolerant compared with those Western European nations now grappling with surging hostility and violence toward foreigners. And while they acknowledge that the historically explosive mix of record numbers of immigrants and a weak economy has generated undeniable frictions, immigration experts do not anticipate a return to the vehement nativism that followed World War I, or the overt hatred of the 1890's.
Most of the present antagonism is expressed in words, not violent acts, and most of the words are not reported to the authorities, immigrants and their advocates say. Rosa Perales, an immigrant from Mexico who sells flowers at an intersection in the Bronx, said drivers routinely spit at her and tell her to return to her country. And Sarah Benyaminova, a Russian refugee, said the antagonism she encountered while waiting in line at a bank in Queens last week was typical.
"I was staying in the line and we had some brief discussion about the candidate who became President," said Ms. Benyaminova, who runs the Russian Educational Bilingual and Cultural Association. "The lady who was standing behind me said, 'You better shut up because you came to this country and everything was given you for free.' I said: 'Oh, yeah? I'm working very hard from dawn to dawn. Could you point me out where I could get all this free lunch?' "
It is difficult to quantify anti-immigrant sentiment. New York City's police statistics on bias complaints do not even have a separate category for bias against immigrants. And the line between xenophobia and ethnic or racial hatred is a blurry one. Was the Seward Park High School student attacked because she was Asian or because she was a vulnerable newcomer? (Probably for both reasons.)
Further, most immigrants, and particularly illegal immigrants, do not make official complaints. For instance, M. K. Srinivasan, New York bureau chief for The Indian-American Magazine, told of a Sikh friend who said he was followed off a New York City bus recently by teen-agers who forcibly removed his turban and set it on fire. But he did not call the police because he was new to the country from India and feared they would be unreceptive.
Many advocates for immigrants believe that resentment toward immigrants built gradually in the late 1980's as the economy began to falter and as immigration reached its highest level since the early part of the century.
 
In U.S., Some Sticks, More Harsh Words
 This year as many as a million new refugees and immigrants, will enter the United States. And, if patterns from the 1980's hold, about 15 percent will settle in the New York metropolitan area. Nationally, a majority are from Mexico and Asian countries; in New York, the majority hails from the Caribbean and Latin America.
"It is not a coincidence that as the immigrant pool has darkened, hostility has grown," said Rolando T. Acosta, New York City's First Deputy Commissioner of Human Rights.
Across the country, there are a few extreme examples of anti-immigrant hostility. In Houston, for instance, two skinheads stomped a 15-year-old Vietnamese boy, Hung Truong, to death in late 1990. One of the assailants -- convicted of involuntary manslaughter while his partner was convicted of murder -- testified that Mr. Truong, dying, cried out: "God forgive me for coming to this country. I'm so sorry."
But some experts wonder whether the current problem is being exaggerated, whether some advocates for immigrants, shaken by the events in Germany and the nativist oratory of some American political candidates, have become hypersensitive to prejudicial slights that have always existed.
 
Nativism Used In Political Campaigns
 Nonetheless, in the last year and a half, political candidates, lobbyists, academics and writers who oppose current levels of immigration have capitalized on the frustration of some Americans. They have not advocated violence. "It was more a climate of hostility that was being created," said Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Forum.
Two politicians, Patrick Buchanan and David Duke, made nativism a key element of their campaigns, with a particular concern that new immigrants would "dilute," as Mr. Buchanan said, the country's European character. Then this summer, a spate of magazine articles raised questions about the value of immigrants to American society -- questions rarely voiced publicly in this land of immigrants.
The articles not only explored the idea of restricting immigration but of placing a moratorium on new immigrants, who were blamed for displacing Americans from jobs, draining scarce Government resources, and even worsening the smog in Los Angeles.
The riots in Los Angeles and Washington Heights, during which immigrants were denounced for inciting violence, provided further fodder for such antagonism. Advocates for immigrants steeled themselves for a public battle during the fall Presidential race.
"We were quite concerned that the anti-immigrant drum would beat so loudly that it might create a tide of xenophobia," said Mr. Sharry, whose organization collected scores of examples in a "Nativism Watch" last spring and summer.
But after the party conventions, even after the Republican Party plank called for "a barrier" -- a wall or trench -- along the border with Mexico, the issue faded. Immigration was scarcely mentioned by either George Bush or Bill Clinton. Those favoring a freeze on immigration were, however, not discouraged. "We assume that this last year has been just the beginning of a wave, and in the year to come, the justifiable backlash will solidify," said Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington-based group that supports a three-year freeze on most immigration.
In the metropolitan region, advocates for immigrants trace the first stirrings of a heightened antagonism to the 1986 law that created sanctions on employers who hire illegal immigrants.
"The sanctions became an excuse for people to discriminate under the cover of meeting their legal obligations," said Elizabeth Aivars, director of the New York City's Office of Immigrant Affairs.
For some New Yorkers, the employer sanctions seemed to validate their anxieties that low-paid immigrants had been stealing their jobs after all, advocates for immigrants said. And the recession only heightened those fears.
"At times, we feel like the community would just as soon put out a 'Not Welcome' mat," said Cecilia Moran, director of the Center for Central American Refugees in Hempstead, L.I. "Some people are jealous, I guess, that we are finding and keeping work."
Occasionally immigrants are willing to fight back, especially as a group. In New York City, three Egyptian elevator operators at the Museum Tower condominium filed a discrimination complaint after years of being harassed by a supervisor who called them "camel jockeys" and threatened to have them sent back to Egypt.
An administrative law judge, Linda A. Stagno, found they were subjected to a consistent barrage of slurs, awarded them $10,000 each in damages.
Similarly, several Hispanic immigrant cleaning women working nights at office buildings in Manhattan won damages after complaining that they were pressured to have sex by supervisors who threatened them with deportation.
But some immigrants, tired of being harassed, try to accommodate their offenders. Navpreet Satara, a 27-year-old immigrant from New Dehli, now avoids conflicts by wearing a baseball cap instead of a turban to cover his hair when he goes out on the town or to the beach. He is sick of being called "Ayatollah," "Saddam Hussein" or "Hare Krishna," he said.
A couple of years ago, when he was a graduate student at Temple University in Philadelphia, he arrived late at a college basketball game and as he was crossing the court to the bleachers a spectator rose and shouted, "Ali Baba." Then the entire crowd rose to their feet and chanted "Ali Baba, Ali Baba," he said.
"There is a lot of ignorance, I guess, and insecurity about all these people who come to America and hold onto their identity with pride," Mr. Satara said.
 
In New York City, A Different Climate
 Unlike in California, where mainstream politicians of both parties have blamed immigrants for the state's economic woes, it remains virtually taboo for public figures in New York to question the value of immigrants in society. There is usually an instant uproar.
For example, Hazel N. Dukes, the New York State president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was quickly pushed to issue an apology when she remarked in a radio interview in 1990 that black men have lost jobs to immigrants who do not speak English.
Similarly, in 1991, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, executive minister of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, appeared on the WABC-TV program "Tiempo" and suggested stopping "the influx of people into this city," adding "if it must come to this nation, send it elsewhere." But outrage began to build immediately, and Mr. Butts was quick to praise immigrants in opinion columns for El Diario and The Carib News.
And when City Councilman Jerome X. O'Donovan of Staten Island wrote the city's Office of Immigrant Affairs to suggest that the Immigration and Naturalization Service be asked to "identify and/or deport illegal aliens" who were a "strain on the economy," Mr. Dinkins sent a stern letter in response, remarking that all immigrants were a part of his "gorgeous mosaic."
Compared with other large city governments, the Dinkins administration takes an unusually strong advocacy position for immigrants, which many immigrants say sets a tone for public debate and prevents some confrontrations from escalating. For example, when residents of Woodside, Queens, complained about the immigrant laborers who hang out in their streets waiting for daily jobs, the city's Human Rights Commission found a church parking lot for their pickup point and made T-shirts for them saying "Trabajadores Unidos," or United Workers.
But public officials in New Jersey have not been so quick to defend immigrants, advocates for immigrants say. Responding to public outrage that illegal immigrants were allowed to obtain driver's licenses, the New Jersey Legislature is moving to forbid them licenses. The New Jersey Legislature also recently eliminated general assistance benefits -- $140 a month plus some medical benefits -- to illegal immigrants.
In response to antagonism, most immigrants choose to avoid confrontation at all costs.
"What can you do if the Americans laugh at you on the subway or look at you like you're an animal or insult you?" said Jonathan Lee, a Vietnamese refugee and caseworker at the New York Association for New Americans. "You must keep quiet and get away from them fast."

In an effort to fit in and avoid conflict, Navpreet Satara often sheds his turban and dons a baseball cap when he leaves his midtown leather-coat exporting business. "There is a lot of ignorance," he said. (Marilynn K. Yee/The New York Times) (pg. B4)

HEADLINE: Budget Option Would Raise Gas Tax in '96

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
The New Jersey Legislature and the Florio administration are studying a proposal to divert hundreds of millions of dollars from the state's Transportation Trust Fund over the next five years to balance the budget. The plan would require a 4.5-cent increase in the gasoline tax in 1996.
The proposal is the latest in a series of moves to divert money to the general fund to meet budget shortfalls without appearing to raise taxes, by tapping the bonding authority of various funds. 
 Under the plan, during the budget year that ends on June 30, 1993, the Legislature would reduce the state's appropriation to the Transportation Trust Fund by $176 million, cutting it from $331 million to $155 million.
That money would go into a surplus category and could be used to finance a growing list of supplemental appropriations bills passed by the Legislature to repair a budget that is increasingly out of balance. As much as $150 million is needed to meet a shortfall in the Medicaid budget, $20 million for corrections and another $20 million for general assistance.
 
Fund Would Need Help Sooner
 In the budget year that begins on July 1, 1993, the plan calls for reducing the appropriation for the Transportation Trust Fund from $331 million to $175 million and diverting $156 million to the general fund.
The reduced appropriations would mean that the Transportation Trust Fund, set up in 1984 to provide the state's share of capital transportation projects' costs, would have to be replenished sooner than expected.
Since the fund is supported by a 2.5-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax, the tax would have to be increased much earlier than anticipated.
The original trust fund plan called for consistent state appropriations of $331 million each year, and no increase in the gasoline tax was anticipated until 1998, when an increase of 3 cents was planned.
 
43 Percent State Tax Rise
 Under the alternative now being discussed, an increase would be necessary in 1996, and it would be larger, raising the tax to 7 cents a gallon.
The total state gasoline tax, including the trust fund part, is 10.5 cents a gallon and would rise to 15 cents a gallon under the latest proposal, a 43 percent increase.
The plan being considered by Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, and the Republican leaders in the Legislature is similar to a proposal by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to take $516 million from a transportation fund to balance New York State's 1993-94 budget.
New Jersey has turned to such proposals repeatedly in the last year to avoid politically unpalatable tax increases. Earlier this week, the Florio administration unveiled a bond refinancing plan that the State Treasurer, Samuel F. Crane, said would take advantage of lower interest rates, but would also allow the state to pay some of its debts by borrowing more money through bonds to pay the annual debt on existing bonds.

HEADLINE: Lithuania Seeks a Niche in High Technology

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

DATELINE: VILNIUS, Lithuania

 BODY:
Under the eyes of Russia's 107th Division and beset by countless other unwelcome remnants of the Soviet era, Lithuanian scientists, engineers and would-be business leaders are gambling on advanced technology to gain entrance to the industrialized world.
Once a major supplier of specialized military and industrial technology to the Soviet Union, Lithuania has lost most of its traditional Soviet-bloc markets while being forced to pay skyrocketing prices for oil, natural gas and other essentials. 
 For scientists formerly under the wing of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and its amply funded institutes, the change has been particularly hard. Many must hold second and third jobs to survive, and laboratories have obtained little or no new equipment during the two years of independence.
"The American Chemical Society at present is sending us all its journals free, which is a tremendous help," said Algirdas Vaskelis, director of the Lithuanian Institute of Chemistry. "But most scientists here are not so lucky."
In a sprawling industrial compound on the outskirts of Vilnius, built in the 1960's by the Soviet military establishment and still partly occupied by the Russian Army, Lithuanian administrators and scientists are designing computer components, developing new compounds for chemical research and preparing to undercut Japan in the production of high-quality medical instruments.
It is a painful process. Hallways are kept dark to save electricity, and even in five-story buildings many of the elevators have long ceased to run.
But despite all this, some voices for change exude optimism, and some very advanced research is in progress.
Viktoris V. Vasilionkaitis, a physician who directs the Lithuanian branch of Soveta-Baltica, a joint venture of Lithuanian, Polish and Italian partners, has published many papers on cardiovascular disease in Western medical journals. He is preparing to make and sell a range of clinical instruments, including heart catheters, clinical pumps and machines to administer medication automatically.
"We have a well-educated and skilled population in Lithuania," he said, "and wages here are low. Even by paying employees double the national average, we feel we can make and sell high-quality pumps costing only one-third what the Japanese sell them for." The average wage is equivalent to $30 a month.
The Government has provided money to Dr. Vasilionkaitis's enterprise and granted it two years' freedom from taxes. "By then, we'll be swimming or we shall have sunk," he said.
The most dramatic success story has been at Fermentas, a biotechnology enterprise founded by Arvidas Janulaitis.
Dr. Janulaitis and his colleagues, who began in 1975 by giving their products free to fellow scientists, now run a business earning $500,000 a year and employing 110 people, including 20 scientists.
Their products are restriction enzymes and related substances, which are used, for example, to develop pharmaceutical products or isolate the genetic material that enables certain bacteria to break down and metabolize oil spills.
The Fermentas group has explored many natural enzymes, including rare soil bacteria found in nearby fields, and now offers one of the larest selections of biological-engineering compounds in the world. Fermentas sells some products through an American company, New England Biolabs, a branch of A.T.&T. Bell Laboratories.
Viginius Siksnys, a senior chemist at Fermentas, said that the company's equipment was relatively simple and cheap, but that its products, mostly derived from bacterial cultures, were valuable.
Holding up a plastic vial the size of a thimble, he pointed to its contents -- a few drops that looked like pure water. "Could you guess that we sell this one for $240, and that many scientists are eager to buy it?" he said.
"I think a lot of Lithuanian enterprises now starting out will have a hard time at first, but I think we'll pull through, individually and as a nation," he added.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: Man in the News -- Lloyd Millard Bentsen Jr.;
Insider for the Treasury

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Lloyd Bentsen is almost everything Bill Clinton is not. He is a multimillionaire, languid and almost aloof, calm and not intensely driven. He got his political start proclaiming his record as a decorated bomber pilot.
Even their respective morning running routines reflect the basic symbolic difference between them. The President-elect jogs on the streets. The Secretary of the Treasury-designate stays indoors, on a treadmill. 
 As the consummate Senate insider, beloved of lobbyists, whom he once charged $10,000 in contributions for a monthly breakfast meeting (canceled after protests), the 71-year-old chairman of the Senate Finance Committee represents a lot of the things Bill Clinton ran against.
But as an expert Senate deal-broker who knows the tax laws thoroughly and is respected by almost all Senators regardless of party, he also represents Mr. Clinton's campaign promise to end the logjam and get things accomplished in Washington. The last tax bill he handled had Senate Republicans joining him in an unsuccessful campaign to get President Bush not to veto the bill.
 
Selection by Dukakis
 The same dignified mien that helps Mr. Bentsen "to command the respect of Wall Street," as Mr. Clinton said today, appealed to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in 1988, when he chose him to run for Vice President.
And the combination of his appearance, his record and his demolition of Dan Quayle that year in a Vice-Presidential debate when he said, "I knew Jack Kennedy; you're no Jack Kennedy," led many of his friends to urge him to seek the Democratic nomination this year. But like many politicians better known than Mr. Clinton, he declined to run against a President whose popularity had soared in 1991.
He acknowledged in an interview this March, when Mr. Clinton was struggling, that he often wondered if he had made the right decision. He was tempted to jump in, and speculated about what might happen if no candidate reached the convention in New York with a majority of the delegates.
But he never seemed as excited about a race as his friends were. Plainly comfortable in the Senate, he would shift political conversations to a pending piece of legislation and say, "That's what I hired on to do."
 
Defender of Oil Interests
 The Texans who sent him to the Senate four times, starting in 1970, have found him a reliable defender of such specific state interests as the oil and gas industry and international trade, including the pending North American Free Trade Agreement, which is expected to improve the economy of border areas near the Rio Grande, where he was born in Mission, Tex., on Feb. 11, 1921.
But Mr. Bentsen has also been a central supporter of tax preferences of real estate, an industry important not merely to Texas, and an unrelenting advocate of greatly expanding access to tax-free Individual Retirement Accounts.
Like any Finance Committee chairman, he has never had trouble raising lots of campaign money. He has something of a reputation for being tolerant of lobbyists' pleadings. But with a narrowly balanced committee of 11 Democrats and 9 Republicans, assembling a majority usually requires matching favors and senators.
Nor is the work finished in committee. Tax bills, its main body of work, usually confront scores or hundreds of amendments on the Senate floor, and then a conference with the House. His counterpart there, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called the Texan "a man of great integrity who has a strong sense of pride," and said, "I think he'll be a good Treasury Secretary."
They have shared a reluctance to get out front on national health care without having their party united behind them. Some critics see Mr. Bentsen in particular as having been too committed to step-by-step changes.
And while he tried today to silence the "insider" accusation by saying he had felt like an "outsider" during 12 years of Republican Administrations when Democratic plans to fight crime, overhaul election laws and create jobs were vetoed, he is not one of the Senate's foremost partisans.
Not only do his two Republican predecessors, Bob Dole of Kansas and Bob Packwood of Oregon, praise his fairness, but Mr. Dole also recalled defending the Democrat during his 1982 campaign. The Kansan was in Texas to appear for Representative James Collins, Mr. Bentsen's Republican challenger.
"They had me set up to call him a raging liberal," Mr. Dole recalled. "But I told them that's not the case."
Then in 1992, with Mr. Bentsen's permission, Senator Dole used a friendly quotation from the Texan in one of his campaign advertisements.
 
Early Years in House
 Mr. Bentsen has really had two Congressional careers. The first lasted from 1948 through 1955, when he served in the House. He had been elected to a district on the Rio Grande after winning a Distinguished Flying Cross as a B-24 pilot in Europe. That exploit figured heavily in his campaign literature, he recalled, which was closely copied from a flier used by a former Naval officer in a 1946 Massachusetts race, John F. Kennedy. Where Kennedy had used a P.T. boat's silhouette, Mr. Bentsen used a bomber's, but the language was closely copied.
In those years, Representative Lloyd Millard Bentsen Jr. was known for opposing the poll tax and for proposing to use the atomic bomb against North Korea, a view he has long since recanted, with some embarrassment these days.
He left the House, somewhat bored and eager to make money on his own, though his father was a wealthy land-trader. He had earned a law degree at the University of Texas in 1942, but went into the insurance business, with his father's financing.
He spent 15 years there, leaving Lincoln Consolidated to run against a liberal Democratic incumbent, Ralph Yarborough, in 1970.
It was a bitter campaign. Mr. Bentsen used television commercials that showed disorder outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention and seemed to hold Mr. Yarborough responsible. He defeated Mr. Yarborough, and then defeated Representative George Bush, the Republican. Blood feuds characterized Texas politics even more in those days than they do now. The liberals worshiped Mr. Yarborough and disdained Mr. Bensten for many years as a "Tory Democrat" who was concerned about the establishment, though they gave him credit for never race-baiting, and for looking out for the interests of black and Hispanic Texans.
But in 1988, when he was chosen to run for Vice President, Mr. Bentsen resigned from two Houston clubs because of their membership policies. But he rejoined them after the election. His press secretary, Jack DeVore, said on Wednesday that Mr. Bentsen had concluded that the River Oaks Club and the Ramada Club did not discriminate. Officials at both clubs refused to discuss their membership policies today.
Mr. Bentsen and his wife, the former Beryl Ann Longino, who is known as "B.A." live in an apartment in the Embassy area of Washington. They were married in 1943 in Lufkin, Tex. They have three grown children who live in Texas, Lloyd M. Bentsen 3d, Lan Bentsen and Tina Bentsen Smith.
Mr. Bentsen has been known occasionally to exit from parties by hoisting his wife over his shoulder and carrying her out. But last year he broke one of her ribs doing that and has said he has given up the practice.
John White, a former Democratic national chairman and a close friend of Mr. Bentsen for more than 40 years, today recalled recently declining an invitation to the movies with the Bentsens because he had already seen the film. He said Mr. Bentsen told him the next day "B.A. said you'll never cut it in this town if you turn down a chance to do a movie with the chairman of the Finance Committee just because you've seen it."
Mr. White got the message. "I'll go to a movie with the Secretary of the Treasury," he said today, "even if I've seen it 10 times."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fell 0.2% Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
In the best monthly inflation report since January, prices received by producers of finished goods fell two-tenths of 1 percent in November as energy and food unwound earlier increases, the Labor Department reported today.
At the same time, the department disclosed that first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell for the eighth time in 10 weeks, achieving the lowest level on a four-week average since the latest recession -- still not officially declared over -- began in July 1990. 
 Both reports were somewhat better than expected, even allowing for the fact that the Thanksgiving holiday was a major factor in the lower jobless claims.
 
 
Praise for the Data
 "It's the best of all possible worlds," Robert T. McGee, economist for Tokai Bank in New York, said. "We've got low inflation and an improving labor market."
The relative price stability for finished goods was matched by those at the intermediate and crude levels, both sectors also posting two-tenths of 1 percent declines for November. Nor was there anything very worrisome in the so-called core rate for finished goods, which excludes the erratic food and energy components. This edged up one-tenth of 1 percent last month after easing that amount in October and stood just 2 percent above the level for November 1991.
The encouraging price figures were seen by analysts as providing some additional leeway for the incoming Clinton Administration to pep up the economy with fiscal medicine that otherwise would risk unpleasant inflationary side effects. The Federal Reserve is also likely to be reassured, though most analysts believe that the central bank will make no change in monetary policy when its Open Market Committee conducts its final 1992 meeting just before Christmas.
"There's no inflation in the pipeline at all," David W. Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association, said.
Friday's report on consumer prices is expected to be almost as good as today's but is likely to show some increase because it, unlike the producer price indexes, includes health care and other services as well as imported goods.
 Finished energy goods dropped 1.5 percent at the producer level last month as prices for gasoline and residential electricity turned down after October jumps. Heating oil dropped 11.8 percent, far more than October's 1 percent decline. Partly offsetting these, however, was a 2.2 percent rise for residential natural gas that was bigger than in October.
In food, which posted a five-tenths of 1 percent overall decline, the main factor was a 33.2 percent plunge for fresh and dry vegetables that followed a 27 percent October surge. Among the most dramatic tumbles were 67.4 percent for cucumbers, 59.1 percent for lettuce and 46.7 percent for radishes.
Beef and veal turned down following an October rise, but eggs turned up sharply. Fruit and melon prices rose considerably more than in October, the report showed.
Elsewhere, passenger cars climbed 1 percent after falling 2.3 percent in October while tobacco products and prescription drugs partly reversed October rises.
Among goods at the intermediate stage, like a bolt of cloth, a 1 percent decline in energy helped push the index lower. Durable factory materials, however, fell much less than in October while prices of foods and feeds turned up in November following an October decline.
Hot rolled steel bars and flat glass edged up while copper and copper and brass mill shapes fell less rapidly. Aluminum mill shapes, lead, plywood and primary aluminum all declined.
Nondurable factory materials edged down one-tenth of 1 percent with declines paced by paperboard, processed yarns, plastic resins and gray fabrics. Basic organic chemicals, however, rose considerably.
 
 
Construction Materials
 After showing no change in October, construction materials rose two-tenths of 1 percent on increases for softwood lumber and for millwork, concrete and plastic products.
Over all, intermediate materials excluding food and energy were unchanged last month, the third in a row without any price increase.
For crude goods, slaughter broilers rose 4.9 percent following a 26.7 percent October jump, but raw cotton rose seven-tenths of 1 percent after an 11.8 percent October plunge.
Crude goods excluding food and energy fell nine-tenths of 1 percent compared with a 1.3 percent decline in October.
Today's report was "really a superb result," Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist for Morgan Stanley, said, noting a further ratcheting downward of prices since summer. "There's just no price pressure out there."

HEADLINE: For Crown Hts. Figure, a Life on Streets

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Ralph Nimmons is missing. But for the 25-year-old man at the center of the Crown Heights beating case, that is nothing new.
Mr. Nimmons, whose absence has threatened the grand jury investigation into his beating by Hasidim, has long drifted on the streets into and out of sight, his wife, Debbie, said the day he was beaten. Jobless and unable to support his family, he makes money by foraging for discarded clothing, bottles and cans, visiting his wife's home in Queens occasionally to change his clothing and then leaving again for days. 
 "Basically, he was a hustler in the streets," but not a burglar, said Mrs. Nimmons, who was introduced to him over the phone by a friend while he was in jail at the Rikers Island complex. "Whatever he could sell he would sell."
According to Mrs. Nimmons, her husband has often made his living off the streets, even as a youth helping his single mother, who reared him and two younger brothers in Brooklyn. His mother died when he was 16.
The Nimmonses were married on May 25, 1990, after knowing each other for about five months. Their romance was not conventional, Mrs. Nimmons said. She first met him while he was on Rikers Island after a friend of hers, also on Rikers, introduced them over the telephone. She became interested in the stranger on the other end of the line. "It was like a blind date," she said.
After they married, Mr. Nimmons moved in with her and her four children at her mother's two-family house in South Jamaica, Queens.
 
He Couldn't Find Work
 He had trouble finding work, she said, and bounced around from one job to another: a handyman for a beauty salon, selling clothing as a street vendor, passing out fliers and working with a construction crew in Brooklyn.
In May he was jailed for violation of parole and was released in October, Mrs. Nimmons said. Unemployed, Mr. Nimmons began living on the streets, in part because he felt he couldn't provide for his family the "way he wanted to."
Mrs. Nimmons, a certified medical assistant, wound up providing for the family.
Mr. Nimmons has a record of six convictions on charges including robbery, burglary, weapons possession and use of drug paraphernalia, according to a city law-enforcement official.
Hasidic leaders point to that arrest record as support for their claim that several Hasidic men only tried to detain Mr. Nimmons after he had been caught trying to break into a rabbinical school behind the Lubavitch headquarters.
Mrs. Nimmons said her husband has told her that on the night he was beaten he was simply scrounging behind the Lubavitch headquarters for discarded clothes to sell.

HEADLINE: University Seeks a Laboratory-Marketplace Link

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 10

 BODY:
The president of the University of California today proposed the creation of a for-profit corporation to help bridge the gap between the laboratory and marketplace for technology developed by university researchers.
Under the proposal, the university's Board of Regents would control a 51 percent stake in the for-profit company. The remaining shares would be sold to corporate and individual investors. The university would contribute technology, and money would come from foundation grants, gifts and outside investors. 
 The university is also asking the State of California to give up its 25 percent share of the university's fees from patents and licenses so it could be applied to the corporation.
Although a handful of other universities have taken similar steps in recent years through the creation of venture capital funds, university officials said the corporation would be the first of its kind dedicated to such early stage technology. Experts on the development and transfer of technology say the move redefines the traditional role of the university.
"The university is sort of the ground on which two large public policy issues collide," said Gary W. Matkin, an associate dean at the University of California's continuing education program, University of California Extension, and author of "Technology Transfer and the University." "One calls for the university to be more involved in the economic life of the state, while the other wants it to maintain its objective stance and not be pulled into the marketplace."
 
Proposal Discussed for 3 Years
 The university president, Jack W. Peltason, presented the proposal to the regents as the centerpiece of a set of initiatives intended to help invigorate the state's lackluster economy.
University officials have discussed the possibility of such a program for at least three years, but today's proposal was made just weeks after a group of state lawmakers sent a letter to Mr. Peltason asking him to consider steps the nine-campus university system could take to exert a greater influence on the economic life of California.
"I am launching an effort to more effectively deploy the brainpower of this university in direct service of the people of California," Mr. Peltason said. "We have a responsibility to put the knowledge of our faculty to work for society."
Officials say the university has at least 160 patented processes or products that promise significant public benefit. These have not been commercialized because traditional sources of financing consider them in too early a stage of development. A central purpose of the corporation would be to provide financing to develop a commercial prototype that could then be picked up by industry.
For instance, university researchers have developed a way to remove cholesterol from milk without affecting the taste or consistency. Before a company will spend the money for the rights to that process, it wants to know if it will work in its factory, not just in a university laboratory. To do that takes time and money that most investors are not willing to risk.
Through the proposal made today, university officials said they expect income from patent fees and royalties to increase to $222 million a year by 2001, up from a projected $26.9 million this year.
Officials said they hope the corporation would be in place by March 1993. A companion not-for-profit corporation would also be created to handle the logistics of the university's patent and licensing activities. The proposal must still travel through a set of committees before returning to the regents for a final vote.
Some faculty members in the past have expressed their fear that a pursuit of profits will compromise the university's mission of teaching and research. Others, though, are frustrated by the delays they see in turning their research into real products that could benefit the public.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: An Eye Toward Wall Street and Capitol Hill;
Clinton's Budget Office Will Differ From Bush's in Both Style and Substance

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
The Office of Management and Budget may remain an army of bean counters with eye shades under Leon E. Panetta and Alice M. Rivlin, President-elect Bill Clinton's choices as budget director and deputy budget director. But it will be a far different place than it was under the current budget director, Richard G. Darman.
For all his talk about the evils of the Federal deficit, Mr. Darman presided over years of record deficits. Mr. Panetta and Ms. Rivlin are known as deficit hawks. Indeed, during the campaign each criticized Mr. Clinton's budget plan as not being tough enough on the string of $300 billion deficits projected for the years ahead. 
 Mr. Darman is known as much for his arrogance as for his brilliance, and he spent much of his time browbeating Democrats in Congress.
Mr. Panetta, a Democratic Representative from California, is expected to play the friendly shepherd, nudging and cajoling former colleagues to enact Mr. Clinton's potpourri of tax cuts, tax increases and new spending programs.
 
'Tremendously Strong Team'
 Budget directors usually eclipse their deputies, but Mr. Clinton's aides say that Mr. Panetta and Ms. Rivlin will divide the labor. Ms. Rivlin, a respected economist who was the first director of the Congressional Budget Office, the legislative counterpart of the executive branch's O.M.B., will do a lot of the technical work, while Mr. Panetta, chairman of the House Budget Committee, does the heavy political lifting.
"It's a tremendously strong team," said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office. "You have two people strongly committed to deficit reduction, two people who are extremely knowledgeable on the details of the Federal budget, one who brings economic expertise and an academic perspective and another who brings the political dimension."
The primary charge of the Office of Management and Budget is shaping the Federal budget. It reviews requests for spending from Federal agencies and works with them in developing programs that will be reflected in the budget request the President sends to Congress. It also seeks to hold down their costs and tries to make the bureaucracy more efficient.
Under President Jimmy Carter, the O.M.B. started reviewing Federal rules and pressured agencies not to overregulate. It performed this task aggressively under President Ronald Reagan, when David Stockman and then James C. Miller 3d were budget directors, and far less vigorously under President Bush, during Mr. Darman's tenure.
One thing seems clear: Mr. Panetta will play a less important role in policymaking than Mr. Darman, who through his forcefulness and the absence of other strong voices on budget issues became the Bush Administration's most powerful voice in economic policymaking. With his strong views and extraordinary command of budget details, Mr. Darman turned the agency into a potent force that reached into every nook of the Government.
Asserting that President Bush stood on the sidelines when it came to the economy, Mr. Clinton has promised to be the first-string quarterback on economic policy. Mr. Panetta will be one of the backs, called on to carry the ball through the House and Senate. And unlike Mr. Darman, he is expected to bounce ideas off key members of Congress before the President's policies are set in concrete.
"Leon is well liked by virtually everybody on the Hill," said Mr. Reischauer. "He can push and cajole his former colleagues as Dick Darman never could."
 
Human Lightning Rods
 Still, there are plenty of areas where the Panetta-Rivlin team could soon find themselves in hot water.
Since the "M" in O.M.B. stands for managing the budget and the bureaucracy, Mr. Panetta and Ms. Rivlin may have to shoulder the burden of implementing Mr. Clinton's campaign pledge to cut administrative expenses by 3 percent a year and to cut 100,000 of the 3 million Federal workers.
Mr. Panetta and Ms. Rivlin have long urged deeper cuts in mandatory entitlement programs like Medicare, and that could quickly make them lightning rods for Congressional ire. And because many interest groups are eager to get a larger piece of the pie with the Democrats back in power, Mr. Panetta will probably have to slam the door on some old friends.
Four years as Budget Committee chairman seem to have prepared Mr. Panetta for this role. He once boasted it was an "enforcement committee."
The Monterey native is also frugal in his private life. He shared a tiny townhouse in Washington with four other Congressmen, and he uses frequent-flyer miles for much of his official travel.
Mr. Panetta, 54, was a Republican in his youth and worked for former Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York. He reportedly became a Democrat after President Richard M. Nixon dismissed him for being too vigorous as head of the Federal civil rights office. He was elected to the House 16 years ago.
This year, he led the campaign against a balanced budget amendment, calling it a gimmick that did not require members to make tough decisions to slash he deficit.
Ms. Rivlin, 61, showed a liberal bent for greater social spending while holding several positions in the Johnson Administration, but she showed she could be a solid, neutral economist as head of the Congressional Budget Office from 1975 to 1983.
A Radcliffe graduate, she is a fellow at the Brookings Institution and teaches economics at George Mason University.
Her recent book, "Reviving the American Dream," (Brookings Institution, 1992) conflicts with some of Mr. Clinton's philosophy in urging that states be given responsibility for managing and financing economic development programs, like job training and transportation spending. The book calls for a consumption tax, suggesting that revenues should be shared by Washington and state governments.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Norway Lets Crown Float, Adding to Strains in Europe

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Norway today abandoned its long battle to maintain the value of its currency and allowed the crown to float, putting new strains on Europe's monetary system.
Norway's decision came as leaders of the European Community prepared to gather for a two-day summit meeting in Scotland, starting on Friday, at which they will try to salvage their plans for greater political and economic cooperation, including the creation of a single currency. 
 Norway is not a member of the community, but has applied to join and was voluntarily keeping the crown at a semi-fixed rate against Europe's leading currencies. In recent weeks, it has sharply raised interest rates and used central bank reserves to buy crowns in attempts to bolster the currency's value.
With the Government no longer defending it, the crown's value immediately fell about 5 percent today.
 
 
Pressure From German Rates
 For months, high German interest rates have made the mark a more attractive investment than the currencies of nations with lower rates, creating greater demand for the German currency. The strength of the mark has pushed the relative values of most other European currencies to their lower allowable limits under the community's monetary system, encouraging investors to sell them.
Since September, Britain and Italy have left the community's monetary system after speculative onslaughts against their currencies, and Spain and Portugal have been forced to devalue theirs. Sweden and Finland, which, like Norway, had informally linked their currencies to the monetary system, have also allowed their currencies to fall in value.
In a signal that the strains on the European Exchange Rate Mechanism will not ease soon, Germany's central bank said today that it had decided not to lower interest rates.
Analysts said there was almost certain to be renewed pressure on weaker European currencies like the Irish pound. Denmark, the only Scandinavian nation that has not devalued its currency, will also face additional pressure in the markets, they said.
Analysts said that if progress is not made toward patching up rifts between the member nations at the European summit meeting, being held in Edinburgh, speculators may once again doubt the community's resolve to defend the currency system. In that case, they said, there may be a new round of market turmoil.
In other trading today, the United States dollar was mixed against leading currencies, rising against the German mark and falling against the yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 1.5795 marks, from 1.5725 late Wednesday, and it was quoted at 123.70 Japanese yen, down from 124.05 late Wednesday. A British pound cost $1.5540, down from $1.5660 late Wednesday.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $334.10 an ounce, up 50 cents. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $333.90, up 15 cents.

HEADLINE: California Moves to Revitalize San Francisco Bay

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 10

 BODY:
After years of dispute, the state of California moved today to repair one of the worst environmental calamities in the American West: the degradation of San Francisco Bay and its estuary, which supplies drinking water to 20 million urban Californians and irrigation for millions of acres of farms.
The State Water Resources Control Board in Sacramento ordered a series of new pumping rules and water standards for the pivotal region, which is the very heart of California, spurting water across the state through massive aortic pumps. 
 The more fresh water is pumped out, the more sea water flows in to the estuary. The region's environmental decline has paralleled the great growth of California over the last generation. The salinity brought on by overpumping has not only threatened drinking water supplies but has also pushed fish species to the brink of extinction.
The board's decision goes into effect after a 45-day period for public comment. It can be challenged in court, which it apparently will be.
 
Politically Sensitive
 Given the continuing drought that grips the West, the plan is politically sensitive, since it will likely mean less water for farms, cities and industry throughout most of California. Any change in the way delta water is allocated will have economic and social effects on the furthest reaches of this state of more than 30 million residents.
The plan envisions a reduction in the amount of water taken from the delta, depending on rainfall, that will range from 800,000 acre-feet of water in average years to 1.9 million acre-feet in very dry years. In recent years, the amount of water pumped out has ranged from about 5 million to 9 million acre-feet. (An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, or about enough to supply two typical households for a year.)
Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, ordered the plan after an earlier one offered last year was rejected as inadequate by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. The Federal agency had warned that it would impose its own plan if the state did not act soon to correct its violations of the Federal Clean Water Act, from excess salt that is killing fish and contaminating drinking water.
The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta estuary, a marshy region larger than Rhode Island that feeds into San Francisco Bay, is the source of drinking water for two-thirds of California. Melting snows in the high Sierra turn into great rivers that empty into the delta. At its southern end, great pumps reverse the flow of the rivers and shunt the water into a system of reservoirs, canals and aqueducts that supply seven million acres of farmland and cities to the south and west.
 
Delicate Balancing Act
 The standards imposed today, therefore, were a balancing act. "The board is confident the standards included in this decision will successfully answer Governor Wilson's call for immediate delta protective measures while insuring a water supply sufficient for the many Californians who depend on the delta for domestic, agricultural and industrial water use," said W. Don Maughan, the chairman, who retired Dec. 1.
Environmentalists like David Behar and Gary Bobker of the Bay Institute, a watch-dog group that monitors environmental problems of the San Francisco Bay, welcomed the move as a first step.
Gregory A. Thomas, president of the Natural Heritage Institute, a San Francisco nonprofit law firm that represents groups trying to preserve the delta, said the new guidelines appear to address many of the organization's concerns. "It looks like the right set of targets," Mr. Thomas said. "Whether it's enough to make a difference for the species at risk, we are going to have to make a technical evaluation of the numbers and see."
Farm interests warned it would further damage agricultural production.
"This is just another element in increasing the uncertainty of water management in California," said Jason E. Peltier, manager of the Sacramento-based Central Valley Project Association, which represents irrigation districts that serve farmers. "This draft report clearly puts the protection of the environment at the expense of human uses."
The pumping has had devastating effects on the fish that once flourished in the bay, the delta and its tributary rivers, particularly the now endangered winter-run chinook salmon. The salmon spawns in the upper reaches of the Sacramento River north of San Francisco but many of the young are now sucked south by the pumps and killed. Striped bass, once plentiful in the bay, are also scare now, as is the Delta smelt, soon to be listed as endangered by the Federal Government.
A major question over the years has been how much salt should be Suisun Bay, where the delta feeds into the San Francisco Bay.
 
Longterm Remedy Sought
 The new standards are meant to apply for up to five years while a longer-term remedy is devised. They apply mainly to the two huge water systems that divert water from the delta, the federally run Central Valley Project and the State Water Project. The main elements are:
*Pumping will be reduced in the late winter, spring and summer, when fish are migrating, and increased in the late fall and early winter, when they are less vulnerable. Reverse flows in the western part of the delta will be limited.
*Water users will be asked to release short flows of water, called "pulses," into the rivers at certain times to help the migration of young salmon and striped bass.
*New fees will be imposed on large irrigation districts to raise up to $60 million. The money will pay for such wildlife habitats as gravel beds for fish spawning and temporary hatcheries.
*New conservation requirements will be imposed on urban users.
*The Central Valley Project, criticized for delivering too much water for farmers during drought, will be required to use more conservative methods to predict the amount of water available.
The debate over what to do about San Francisco Bay and the delta is almost two decades old, and it has brought to the surface all the tensions that are California: North vs. South, farmer vs. city, environmentalists vs. industry. Demands on it have reached the breaking point with the state's huge population increase, more than 25 percent since the 1980 census.
The water board first tackled the problem in 1978, but its plan was rejected by the state courts in 1986 as inadequate. It tried again in 1988 with a plan that would have drastically limited exports to populous and politically powerful Southern California, but that collapsed under political assault.

HEADLINE: At the Bar

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
There are not many memorable moments in his 25 years in the Manhattan Surrogate's Court that Nathaniel Weiss has failed to record. Whether art experts were testifying in the Estate of Mark Rothko, or Al Pacino was testifying in the Estate of Lee Strasberg, or 15 workers were disrupting Estate of J. Seward Johnson, Mr. Weiss, his fingers dancing over the keyboard of his trusty stenograph, got it down.
Last May, however, something occurred that even Mr. Weiss missed documenting. In a cost-cutting measure, Matthew Crosson, chief administrator of New York's courts, replaced Mr. Weiss and 36 other court reporters in the state's Surrogates Courts with tape recorders. 
 Mr. Crosson, it is true, merely transferred Mr. Weiss and his colleagues to other local courts. But they face a far more implacable foe in New York's Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, who last month labeled stenographic reporting "an anachronism" and called for jettisoning it.
Court reporters, their views seconded by many judges and lawyers, argue that electronic recording is unreliable, cumbersome, and more costly. They note, too, that most of them, Mr. Weiss included, now use computers to transcribe their notes. But for court reporters seeking to defend their craft and preserve their jobs, Mr. Weiss himself is perhaps the best exhibit of all. For half a century, through a combination of erudition, wisdom, curiosity, conscientiousness and an insatiable love of words, he has given judges, lawyers and litigants what is by common consensus a most consistent and reliable recapitulation of reality.
Mr. Weiss is one of those increasingly rare reporters who need not spell out Brobdignagian or epimenorrhea or in pari passu phonetically until he can look them up in a dictionary. Better than just about anyone, he manages the increasingly difficult task of capturing and clarifying what decreasingly articulate lawyers and witnesses seem to say.
He is a nimble practitioner of linguistic triage, choosing what matters most when lawyers, judges and witnesses speak at once. He can understand mumbles, the jargons of various professions, the thickest Ukrainian accent. He knows whether laughter or tears or screams or italics belong in the record or whether they intrude on it. But his greatest attribute is his inconspicuousness.
By personality and temperament, Mr. Weiss's peers are no more given to hyperbole than he is. But to William Cohen, a 45-year veteran of the trade who works in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Weiss is "the finest court reporter in the English-speaking world." Befuddled periodically by some lawyerly malapropism or neologism or unintelligible burble, Mr. Cohen, like many others, invariably asks Mr. Weiss for help.
Perhaps because they rarely get the respect they deserve, court reporters stick together. They have their own clubs, their own publications, their own rituals and role models. Sometimes they are quite literally family; the profession is filled with siblings, husbands and wives, fathers and sons. Mr. Cohen's twin brother, Arnold, is also a renowned reporter; Mr. Weiss's son, Robert, works in Family Court.
In 1939, when the elder Mr. Weiss was still in Brooklyn College and the country did not quite realize it was out of the Depression, he saw shorthand as a route to a steady job. Three times, in 1958, 1959 and 1960, Mr. Weiss won the speed contest given by the National Shorthand Reporters Association. Twice he matched the mark for accuracy set in 1926 by one Martin Dupraw, who still transcribes part-time in Westchester County. After turning it down for years, in 1986 Mr. Weiss accepted the New York State Court Reporters Association's Louis Goldstein Memorial Award honoring contributions to court reporting.
His landmark 1963 guide to medical terminology, for instance, teaches reporters how, by understanding prefixes, suffixes and roots, they can differentiate between a colotomy, a colostomy, and a colectomy and handle an occasional jejunojejunostomy as well. His 1971 study of punctuation contains individual chapters on paragraphing, colons, semicolons, question marks and quotation marks, plus two chapters on different sorts of dashes and five chapters on commas.
The bar is a status-conscious breed, and throughout his career, Mr. Weiss has been largely overlooked -- or, on occasion, barked at -- by people who, for all their skills at bombast and legerdemain, may be nowhere near his intellectual equal. In no way has that, nor his professions' recent trials, diminished his enthusiasm.
"Anatole France said that 'children are the unrecognized geniuses of the world,' and reporters are the unrecognized human computers of the court system," Mr. Weiss said. "In their desire to economize, our critics are willing to throw away the baby with the bath water."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: A Cabinet Begins to Take Shape;
Excerpts From Clinton's Announcement of Appointments to Economic Posts

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a news conference yesterday in which President-elect Bill Clinton announced the appointment of Senator Lloyd Bentsen as Secretary of the Treasury and named other economic advisers, as recorded by News Transcripts Inc., a private transcription service: 
 PRESIDENT-ELECT BILL CLINTON Today, I have asked you here to announce the first members of our economic team. These people are seasoned, skilled, incredibly able and ready to work for the American people. I stress the word "team" because the success of our economic action agenda will depend not only on the talents of these people as individuals and those whom I will announce in the next few days, but also in their capacity to work together for the common good of all Americans.
They are deeply aware that we must not be the first generation of Americans to leave a worse economy to our children. And as I have said repeatedly, our nation faces two deficits, a budget deficit and an investment deficit.
I'm going to work my heart out with these people to construct a strong, long-term plan for economic growth, for jobs, for incomes, and to reduce our national debt.

 	 	 		. . .	 	My first appointment, intentionally, is the Secretary of the Treasury. In filling this post, I wanted someone who had the unique capacity to command the respect of Wall Street, which showing an unrelenting concern for the Americans who make their living on Main Street.
When Lloyd Bentsen agreed to serve as Secretary of the Treasury, it is safe to say I succeeded. In American politics when you say the words "stature, dignity, and respects," Lloyd Bentsen's name comes right to mind. I've known Senator Bentsen for many years, and, as a few of my folks know, I've had him in mind for this position for a long time, long before I was actually elected President.
I followed his work for years as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee; I know about the tax bills he tried to have written into law, which would have promoted more investment and less consumption; I know about the trade positions he's tried to convince our country to take which would have promoted more free trade but a tougher set of demand to open markets to American products.
But he, too, needs a team, and the team that will take the helm at the Treasury Department is truly exceptional, in part because of the creativity and quality of the person who will be appointed as deputy secretary of the Treasury, Roger Altman. Roger is a longtime friend of mine, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury, a preeminent investment banker. And he's been one of my closest economic advisers throughout this entire campaign.
As director of the Office of Management and Budget, Congressman Leon Panetta will bring integrity to this critical office and restore the confidence of the American people and their elected representatives that O.M.B. is shooting straight with the Congress and shooting straight with the American people, and doing its best to help us not only to have a responsible budget but to manage the massive American Government in a different and better way than ever before.
As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Leon Panetta brought a unique combination of strong leadership and superb technical skills. With Leon Panetta as O.M.B. director, I believe that agency can play the pivotal role we have to have it play in the swift and effective implementation of our economic plan.
I'm also delighted to announce that Alice Rivlin, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office and one of our nation's most respected budget experts, has agreed to serve as deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. Together, Alice and Leon promise to be the most dynamic team in the history of O.M.B. and to restore the confidence of the Congress that the executive branch is going to be a responsible partner in making the budgets of this country.
Finally, I have asked Robert Rubin to serve as assistant to the President for economic policy and to help to coordinate and to direct our new Economic Council. I've created this new role, similar to that of the national security adviser in the present White House, because the coordination of our nation's economic policy is every bit as essential as the coordination of foreign policy to our long-term national security.
Bob Rubin has enjoyed a brilliant career at his firm, and has throughout manifested concern for the welfare of all Americans, and a special concern for the welfare of the inner city poor for whom he has worked as a member of the Cuomo Commission and in other contexts. This new Economic Council which I will chair embodies our commitment to make economic prosperity the top priority of this administration and to sharply focus on economic policy in the White House.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Today's appointments are just the first of many. In the coming days and before too long, we will have appointed the entire economic team and the remainder of the Cabinet. When we are done, the American people know that I mean business when it comes to our campaign commitment to promote a high way, high growth, strong and vital economy, not only for today's Americans, but for the future generations as well.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. Can you tell us, who will be taking orders from whom -- Mr. Rubin from Mr. Bentsen, or Mr. Bentsen from Mr. Rubin? It's not quite clear what each one will be doing here.
PRESIDENT-ELECT CLINTON Well, I think it is quite clear. First of all, the Secretary of the Treasury will continue to be the principal economic spokesperson after the President for this Administration, just as it has traditionally occurred. Mr. Rubin's job will be very much like General Scowcroft's job on the national security side in this Administration. His job will be to coordinate, to facilitate and to provide some direction to the deliberations of our economic council.
It will be a larger group than the National Security Council because it will include not only these departments, but also some others which I have discussed with you before, like Commerce, Labor, Energy. And it is a very important job.
But in the end, I will make the ultimate decisions and be the ultimate arbiter when there has to be an arbiter. I think that if you go back to the campaign structure that we tried to provide, which really did defy past organizations because it was less hierarchical and more team work oriented, that's what I expect to provide here.
And I think that because we want to bring in more people in a more systematic way and reconcile what these departments are doing so they can reinforce and energy one another, I decided that I needed someone on the domestic side to be that sort of coordinator and facilitator but these departments, each will stand on their own. . . . The Treasury will still be the place where the President's economic views are spoken for after the President does it.
SENATOR LLOYD BENTSEN I've heard all these stories about my being an insider. Let me tell you, I felt like an outsider for 12 years. And I'm tired of the gridlock.
To do the things we've tried to do on campaign reform, do the things we tried to do on a tough crime bill, to do the things that we did in the last tax bill, to put economic incentives in there to create jobs, and to get this country moving again, and to see those kinds of things vetoed, I'm just delighted to see us be able to bring about the kind of change, to create those jobs now, with a Democratic President, a Democratic President like Bill Clinton.
I think you're going to see those hopes turn into reality. And to be able to pass those and put them into law is what I'm so pleased about.
And as far as the Secretary of the Treasury's job, I know you're probably looking for more maturity in that job. But I'll do what I can.
REPRESENTATIVE LEON E. PANETTA I think everyone that knows me as chairman of the Budget Committee and my work on the budget, we've been basically fighting the budgets that have been presented over the last 12 years concerned about the priorities that we part of those budgets, the failure to invest in our society, and the fact that they would ultimately produce the record deficits that they have produced.
So I've been fighting against those kinds of budgets in the time I've been in Congress, and I think the President-elect and I share a common commitment, not only to long-term deficit reduction, but to making the investments in education and health care and infrastructure and growth that this Administration has failed to make over the last few years.
Q. Governor Clinton, and also Senator Bentsen, for both of you, were you at all concerned in picking Senator Bentsen that his choice might lead to the loss of yet another Democratic Senate seat in Texas that might make your job of getting your program passed harder? And Senator Bentsen, did that play any part in your decision whether to take this position?
SENATOR BENTSEN Obviously that's something that would be of some concern to me. But the Democratic Party in Texas is in great shape and we have a very effective and attractive Governor who will be making that decision and that choice and who will play a major role in that campaign and I think the odds are just excellent that a Democrat will succeed me in that spot.
PRESIDENT-ELECT CLINTON I did give it some thought. It crossed my mind. I think that frankly the kind of leadership that has been provided in Texas by people like Ann Richards, Henry Cisneros, John Sharp, that they and many others have embodied the kind of new Democratic Party that we're trying to bring to the United States. And I think there's a good chance that Governor Richards will name someone senator who will have the confidence of the people of Texas. I thought about it. But I also thought that Senator Bentsen was the best choice for America for Treasury Secretary and I think the people of Texas will respond to that. But I don't think there's any reason to believe that the Democrats can't be highly competitive in that job.
Q. The Justice Department has decided not to appoint a special prosecutor in the Iraqgate case. Do you believe that there is a need for additional inquiries in that? And will you appoint, have your Justice Department appoint, a special prosecutor after you take office?
PRESIDENT-ELECT CLINTON I certainly think we need to know more about it than we now know. And what I intend to do is to appoint an Attorney General and then get a recommendation on it. And generically, let me make a statement, the special prosecutor law, as you know, either just did or is about to expire and I had to tell you, I think it should be reenacted. And I will support that.

 IMMIGRANTS MEET GROWING RESENTMENT 
 Across the country, immigrants say they are feeling the brunt of a growing and complex hostility. As their numbers increase sharply and the recession lingers, immigrants find themselves the target of a mix of social anxieties: economic tension, free-floating anger seeking an outlet and the volatile ethnic discord plaguing many cities. And because most new immigrants are not white, there are racial overtones to the friction. Even in New York, which proudly defines itself as a haven for immigrants, some seem to resent the presence of so many. A1.

HEADLINE: A DuPont Family Father-Son Fight Goes to Court

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RADNOR, Pa., Dec. 10

 BODY:
Edgar Newbold Smith has spent the last seven years trying to extricate his son, an heir to the Du Pont chemical fortune, from the extremist political organization of Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.
But Mr. Smith, a securities analyst here, has little to show for his efforts, apart from his son's enmity. And now Mr. Smith is scheduled to stand trial in Alexandria, Va., on Federal charges that he conspired with cult specialists to kidnap his 36-year-old son, Lewis duPont Smith, so the son could be "deprogrammed," or freed from Mr. LaRouche's influence. 
 The discussions among Mr. Smith and the specialists were revealed to the authorities by a private investigator who had been hired to follow Mr. Smith's son. Eventually the authorities tape recorded 60 hours of conversations. If convicted, Mr. Smith and the three cult specialists could receive sentences ranging from probation to life in prison. The trial begins Monday.
Mr. Smith denies there was a kidnapping plan, but he does not deny that he had considered abduction. "It's just like my son is being held hostage by terrorists in Lebanon, with very much the same set of emotions," Mr. Smith said as he and his wife, Margaret duPont Smith, were interviewed at their home in this affluent Philadelphia suburb.
"When I think of all that's been lost, it's tragic," said Mrs. Smith, who accuses the LaRouche organization of turning her son against his parents, sister, two brothers and childhood friends, not to mention the Du PontChemical Company, which the son, a shareholder, says is run by gangsters.
 
Declared Incompetent
 The younger Mr. Smith lives with his wife, Andrea Diano-Smith, in the fashionable Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia. Both work as fund-raisers for the LaRouche organization. In 1985, after Mr. Smith gave $212,000 to Mr. LaRouche, a Pennsylvania court, at the family's request, declared him incompetent to manage his financial affairs. A Delaware bank was appointed to act as financial guardian of his $10 million inheritance.
The LaRouche organization, based in Leesburg, Va., raises money for political campaigns and publications that promote Mr. LaRouche's theories of international conspiracies and his extremist views on how to fight drug trafficking and revive the economy. Mr. LaRouche is serving a 15-year prison sentence in Minnesota. He and six of his fund-raisers were convicted in 1988 of conspiracy to defraud elderly contributors of $30 million.
Mr. Smith appeared, elegantly dressed, for a recent interview saying he would spend only 30 minutes with a member of the "corrupt media," but he wound up giving a 2 1/2-hour discourse on his family's "humiliating" efforts to control his life.
 
Writing a Book
 He also spoke at length about Mr. LaRouche's conspiracy theories, including one that links Queen Elizabeth 2d to the international drug trade. On his family, he said he would tell all in a book he is writing. Its title, he said, would be "Blood Feud: The Story That's Rocking the Richest Family in America."
Civil libertarians say the Smith case raises disturbing questions about the LaRouche organization, some of which have followed it since its founding. Is the group a destructive cult that preys on the elderly and the infirm? Or is it a political party whose zealous adherents sometimes get in legal trouble by soliciting money to publish their unconventional theories?
Civil libertarians are also raising new questions: Is it an expression of mental illness to contribute money to Mr. LaRouche? And should the Government prosecute the elder Mr. Smith for considering, but not committing, a crime?
 
'Spiral of Thought Control'
 Experts on cults are sharply divided in their opinions of the LaRouche organization, and Stefan Presser, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Philadelphia, said civil libertarians are trying to keep an open mind.
Summing up his view of this case, Mr. Presser said: "The father doesn't like what the son is thinking and was considering imposing his own thoughts on the son. The irony is full circle now that the prosecutor is going after the father just for thinking about imposing his thoughts on the son. This is a kind of never-ending spiral of thought control that civil libertarians find intolerable."
Lawrence J. Leiser, the Assistant United States Attorney in Alexandria, Va., who is prosecuting the kidnapping charge, would not discuss the case, but he argued in recent court papers that many of these questions could not be resolved in court.
"The defendants will call their cult experts to say the LaRouche organization was a cult," Mr. Leiser wrote. "The Government will call its experts to say it was nothing more than a political organization. They will call their people to say 'deprogramming' works; we will call ours to say that it is ridiculous to suggest that you can 'deprogram' someone out of their political positions.
"We can listen to testimony that Lewis duPont Smith is incompetent and the defendants' 'purpose' was to save him as a result of that incompetence from an evil and corrupt political organization. The Government can call its experts to show that Lewis duPont Smith is not incompetent."
 
'Height of Irony'
 Mr. Leiser had summarized these thorny issues in an unsuccessful effort to exclude them from the trial and narrow the trial to legal issues surrounding the kidnapping itself.
The elder Mr. Smith's lawyer, John J. E. Markham 2d, said in court papers that it was "the height of irony" for Federal prosecutors to seek such a blanket exclusion because it was the United States Attorney in Alexandria that had prosecuted Mr. LaRouche in the first place.
Mr. Markham, in fact, is a former Assistant United States Attorney, and he was one of two prosecutors who handled the 1988 case against Mr. LaRouche. Mr. Markham has said in court papers that he will present the elder Mr. Smith as a father who was simply considering ways to rescue a mentally ill son from a criminal group and that he had come to no decision when he was arrested.
Judge Thomas S. Ellis of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia has decided to rule on the relevance of each issue as it comes up in the trial.
 
Accused of Fraud in 1989
 Charges similar to those in the 1988 criminal case against LaRouche were made in a 1989 civil suit against the younger Mr. Smith and several of his colleagues in the LaRouche organization. Lydia Baldasar, a 78-year-old widow in Northport, L.I., said in court papers that Mr. Smith and the others had defrauded her of $20,000 in cash and $50,000 in securities by telling her, in meetings, some of which lasted as long as seven hours, that her blue chip stocks were worthless and that the nation's banks and corporations were collapsing.
Ms. Baldasar said she was told that some of her money would be used to prevent the assassination of world leaders. The LaRouche organization settled the case by returning the woman's donation.
The younger Mr. Smith said he and his family had spent more than $1 million on court battles about his mental health. In the 1985 competency case, a state court held lengthy hearings before ruling, on basis of psychiatrists' testimony, that Mr. Smith was mentally ill, incompetent to manage his own financial affairs and prone to falling prey to others.
In his decision, Judge Lawrence Wood said that Mr. Smith had lost more than $100,000 in "ill advised" schemes involving silver mines and walnut trees, and that he had given $212,000 to the LaRouche organization, which, the court said, had "unusual, if not suspect, motives." The court appointed a financial guardian for Mr. Smith's $10 million trust fund and set his annual living allowance at $180,000.
The ruling was upheld in subsequent appeals, and the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the case in 1988.
 
All Plots, No Action
 In the current case involving the elder Smith, court papers do not suggest that a kidnapping was planned, only that Mr. Smith had seriously considered the idea and, his lawyer says, rejected it without committing any crime. But in transcripts of the Government's secretly recorded discussions, the consultants sound like characters in a Mickey Spillane mystery.
There is loose talk about a seductress, blackmail, sedative-laced drinks and the use of a motorcycle gang or mercenaries to kidnap the younger Smith and possibly his wife. There is talk about wrapping the unconscious son in a rug and putting him aboard the Smith family's 44-foot yacht for a voyage to a place where "bribery is king" and where the deprogramming would be tried.
Prosecutors say the defendants were ironing out the details of a kidnapping, a claim the elder Mr. Smith's lawyer disputes.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and a Government informant secretly recorded the discussions, as well as telephone conversations, last summer and early fall.
 
Life Sentence Possible
 Whether the evidence proves a criminal kidnapping conspiracy will be up to the jury. If convicted, Mr. Smith, who is 66 years old, and the three other defendants face sentences of up to life in prison.
The other defendants are Galen G. Kelly, 45, of Esopus, N.Y., a specialist in cultic groups; Robert Point, 38, a lawyer from South Amboy, N.J., who has worked on cult cases with Mr. Kelly, and Donald L. Moore, 45, a former deputy sheriff in Loudoun County, Va., where the LaRouche organization has its headquarters.
The matter came to the authorities' attention in July, after Mr. Moore hired Doug Poppa, another former deputy sheriff from Loudoun County, to monitor the activities of the younger Mr. Smith in Philadelphia. Mr. Poppa informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation and became a paid Government informant. He later recorded his conversations with the defendants.
The younger Smith said he pities his father but expects him to be convicted. He said it would be "poetic justice" if his father was required to share a cell with Mr. LaRouche.
"He would set dad right in no time," he said.

HEADLINE: Piermont Prospers From Makeover on the Hudson;
Location, Location, Woody and Mia Aid Transformation From Factories to Galleries

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PIERMONT, N.Y., Dec. 5

 BODY:
Howard Brawner vividly remembers the day in 1983 when he pointed his camera out his living-room window and captured Mia Farrow daubing on some makeup outside his family's home on Piermont Avenue.
Oddly enough, he may have recorded a pivotal moment in the comeback of this tiny Rockland County village. 
 Long an isolated, two-mill town, Piermont fell down hard in 1982 after its paper and cardboard factories shut down, eliminating about 1,000 jobs and testing the town's spirit.
Now Piermont is thriving again, having reinvented itself as a charming collection of upscale galleries, specialty shops and fine restaurants set against the serene backdrop of the Hudson and within easy reach of well-heeled consumers from New York City, Westchester County, northern New Jersey and Connecticut.
 
A Successful Rebirth
 "It went from being a depressed factory town with a dying factory to a booming village that attracts tourists," said Robert C. Samuels, president of the Piermont Civic Association. "Piermont used to be a place where some people were ashamed to say they lived. Now it has status in the real estate ads."
By formulating a new niche for its outdated main street in the era of the shopping mall, Piermont joined a growing list of communities that have been reborn as one-day destinations for shopping and dining. But where Piermont and such communities as Corning, N.Y., Oyster Bay, L.I., and Cranbury, N.J., have succeeded, just as many others have failed. And those who look for a fail-proof formula will find little agreement here about what turned things around.
When asked to tick off the reasons for Piermont's revitalization, each of its 2,163 residents seems to have a pet theory. But many first mention Ms. Farrow and Woody Allen, who came here briefly in late 1983 to film parts of "The Purple Rose of Cairo," Mr. Allen's fable about a character who steps out of a film and into the heart of a small-town waitress, played by Ms. Farrow.
Mr. Allen's production team -- which dressed up many of the vacant buildings on Piermont Avenue, the village's main street -- not only brought in a sizable crew but also attracted a flurry of tourists. All seemed to discover Piermont for the first time and many returned with family and friends.
Some of those who sensed untapped potential in Piermont, which is about 20 miles north of the George Washington Bridge, began buying and renovating dilapidated buildings on Piermont Avenue, fundamentally recasting the tone of the village's one-block downtown.
The names Armani, Ralph Lauren and Donna Karan have been stenciled in black on the front window of the old Coneys Grocery Store, which is now a resale dress shop named Abercorn Place. Nearby, the old Meyers Meat Market, the sawdust on its floor long since swept up, has been trimmed in terra cotta and converted into Hudson Valley Bazaar, which counts zucchini corers among its eclectic inventory of cooking utensils. And DeLorenzo's Shoe Repair has been reborn as Boondocks, which bills itself as "the environmental marketplace" and sells shoulder bags made from recycled inner tubes.
 
Prescience and Research
 Virtually the only establishments that predate the 1980's are the Community Market, a longtime general store that now carries squid-ink pasta opposite cans of Campbell's soup, and The Turning Point, a 16-year-old restaurant that offers live entertainment, including, on occasion, the singer Arlo Guthrie.
Piermont's success cannot, of course, be explained solely by the filming of a movie. Among other factors, people here cite the careful planning by village officials -- particularly in the mapping of a new shopping and condominium development on the old mill site -- and the prescient, grass-roots initiative of individual merchants. The village was also able to study the experience of Nyack, N.Y., a waterfront community about three miles north that had undergone a similar spruce-up several years earlier.
"In Piermont, they -- meaning the town, the individual businesses and the property owners -- identified their strengths and built on them," said Peter Mosbacher, executive director of the New York Main Street Alliance, a nonprofit group that advises municipalities on economic development. "They have the advantage of being surrounded by wealthy communities and people with a lot of disposable income."
Not surprisingly, change has brought some new stresses to Piermont, including the overcrowding of narrow Piermont Avenue on summer afternoons by tourists who can occasionaly be a bit brusque, some say.
Mr. Brawner, the 70-year-old shutterbug who snapped Ms. Farrow, and his wife, Ruth, 67, have had to post an "Absolutely No Trespassing" sign on the side of their purple home to deter bicyclists, who tend to use the 142-year-old house as a bike rack.
 
'We Still Say Hello'
 "Everyone is friendly, but I couldn't tell you the last name of one person who lives across the street" said Mrs. Brawner, who has lived on Piermont Avenue since she was 3 and has watched as young professionals have slowly replaced working-class families. "But we still say hello to everyone."
Nevertheless, the Brawners say that their gripes are allayed by Piermont's vitality. "I think it's nicer now than it was in earlier years," Mrs. Brawner said, to which her husband added, "I have no problem with the town at all."
While generally applauding the village government's shepherding of the transition, Mr. Samuels, of the civic association, laments the increase in rents, home prices and property taxes. A one-bedroom apartment, which might have rented for $300 a month 10 years ago, can now command $800 to $900. One home on Piermont Avenue recently sold for $425,000, village officials said.
Mr. Samuels said he wonders what will happen when people begin moving into Piermont Landing, the new condominium development that has replaced the old mills on a 35-acre peninsula jutting into the Hudson.
"We're concerned that most of the people who move into the condominiums will be wealthier than the residents who are here and have different values," he said.
But Mary Hardy, the village clerk for 23 years, defends the development, saying Piermont could not afford to let prime real estate that accounts for almost a third of the village tax base lie fallow. Ms. Hardy said the Mayor and the village board of trustees aggressively planned the conversion of the mill site, designating it as a mix of retail and residential zoning, keeping the concentration of units at a level far lower than many developers wanted.
"They really did their homework," said James Cymore, the deputy commissioner of planning for Rockland County.
The first residents are just now preparing to move into the development, built at an estimated cost of $50 million. The original developers found themselves stymied by a variety of problems including a sluggish real-estate market and a complicated review process as well as a lawsuit involving construction of the project so close to the river.
Chase Manhattan Bank took back the deed for the project rather than foreclose on it. Since then, the bank has concluded sales of 22 of the 62 condominiums that make up the development's first phase, said James R. Psaki, a Chase vice president. The units, which have been discounted 15 to 35 percent from the original prices, are being sold from $170,000 to $360,000, depending on size and location, he said.
In contrast with its earlier incarnations, Piermont has an urban sophistication now, especially with Xaviar's -- an elegant restaurant where waiters wear black tie -- and the recently opened Piermont Flywheel Gallery, a cooperative of 24 artists and sculptors.
"For me, as a European, it makes me feel very much like I'm in Europe," said Linda Majors, who was born in London and named her Piermont dress shop, Abercorn Place, after the street where she was raised. "In any given weekend, I can hear four different languages."

HEADLINE: Port Authority Budget Averts Rise in Fares

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey approved yesterday a $2.7 billion budget for 1993 that it said insures that fares on the PATH system and tolls on the authority's six bridges and tunnels will not increase for at least two years.
The budget reflects concerns that the region's economy will be stagnant for much of next year and represents the latest effort by the authority to address criticisms that its spending has been too luxurious in lean times. 
 Authority officials said the budget includes dozens of cost-control measures, ranging from eliminating 100 jobs through attrition to reducing insurance coverage for new staff members to consolidating office space. "Sacrifices have been made up and down the line," said Richard C. Leone, the authority's chairman. The current year's budget was $2.5 billion.
Because revenues from its bridges, tunnels, office buildings, marine terminals and airports have been flat, the authority had projected that by 1994 it would have a $150 million deficit that might require toll increases on its New York-New Jersey crossings, said John J. Collura, the director of management and budget.
But cutbacks and productivity improvements will enable the authority to delay increases at least until 1995, he said. The budget calls for raises for union and white-collar employees of between 3 and 4 percent. It also provides for $750 million in capital programs, including road reconstruction at Kennedy International Airport and construction of a monorail system at Newark International Airport.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Drop

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped by 38,000 in late November to the lowest level in more than three years, the Government said today.
The Labor Department said first-time applications for unemployment insurance totaled 324,000 in the week that ended Nov. 28, down sharply from 362,000 the previous week. 
 It was the smallest number of new claims since 323,000 were filed in the week that ended Sept. 23, 1989. Before today's report, some analysts had expected claims to fall only about 2,000.
Though part of the decline may have been due to a shorter Thanksgiving holiday work week, it represented the 10th consecutive week that claims remained below 400,000, leading analysts to believe that the unemployment situation was gradually improving.
The department reported last week that the jobless rate fell to 7.2 percent in November from 7.4 percent a month earlier and from the recent peak of 7.8 percent last June. At the same time, it said 105,000 new jobs were created last month.
The four-week moving average that smooths out the erratic weekly changes and is considered a more reliable indicator of the labor situation also fell.
The average was 361,500 in the period that ended Nov. 28, down from 369,250 a week earlier and the lowest since it reached 356,250 on July 14, 1990.
Forty-one states and territories reported declines in their weekly claims, while 12 reported increases.

HEADLINE: A Record-Breaking Year for Bank Profits

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Signaling a dramatic turnaround for the banking industry from the gloomy forecasts of just 12 months ago, Federal regulators said today that 1992 would be the most profitable year ever for the nation's banks.
As a consequence, they said, fewer institutions would fail in 1993 than had been expected, even though new regulations that go into effect next week require officials to seize weak, but solvent, institutions. 
 Officials said the industry's strong profits, $8.5 billion for the three months ended Sept. 30, reflect tougher regulations, tighter supervision and most important, the most favorable interest rate climate in decades.
 
 
Three Record Quarters
 The quarterly profits reported by the nation's 11,590 commercial banks were nearly double the industry's earnings for the comparable period last year. Having compiled three record quarterly profits in a row, the banks have earned $24.1 billion for the first nine months of the year. In 1988, the industry's best year since such records were begun during the Great Depression, the banks earned $24.9 billion.
Regulators said the industry had been plowing much of the record earnings back into reserves for bad loans and to capital that can be used as a cushion to absorb losses in worse times.
Since banks have been lending more money to the Government than to private enterprises, experts said, the industry's strongest returns have come from its growing investments in longer-term Treasury bonds, which continue to post yields of more than twice that of shorter-term Treasury bills.
Bankers have attributed the banner year to what they call the spread -- the difference between the rate they charge lenders and the rate they pay depositors -- which has been at its widest point ever as a result of the Federal Reserve Board's moves over the last year cutting interest rates to their lowest levels since the early 1960's.
While the industry still suffers from weak spots in California and New England and could suffer broader declines again if interest rates rise dramatically over the next few months, senior officials said the industry appeared to have put the worst behind it.
Bankers said the latest figures, which have indicated modest increases in loan demands, were a further indication of a rebounding economy.
"It's always easier to make money in the banking business when interest rates are lower, but the numbers also suggest a little more robust economy than most people had thought," said Daniel R. Smith, chairman of the First of America Bank Corporation, a $20 billion institution based in Kalamazoo, Mich.
But Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Banking Committee, warned that the latest figures "are illusory" and that the bank profits from large spreads reflect "enormous interest-rate gouging of many Americans."
And Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn,a senior member of the Banking Committee, said the banks' heavy reliance on Treasury instruments reflected the fact that there were few other long-term investments strong enough for investing insured deposits.
 
 
'Making a Mistake'
 "Any idiot can make money by taking in money at 3 percent and lending it at 7 percent," Mr. Schumer said. "But anyone who looks at the last four quarters and thinks the banking industry is back on track is making a mistake."
Twelve months ago, regulators acknowledged that the bank insurance fund, which protects insured depositors, was about to go deeply into debt, much as the savings association insurance fund had done years earlier. This precarious condition prompted Congress to adopt the toughest banking legislation in many years.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 11.62, to 3,312.19, In Busy Trading Session

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market gave ground yesterday in a busy session, yielding to sellers even in the midst of positive economic news.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had been up 47.28 points in the four preceding sessions, dropped back 11.62 points, to 3,312.19. 
 Declining issues outnumbered those advancing by about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume came to 240.6 million shares, compared with 230.1 million in the previous session.
Analysts said traders were cashing in on some of the market's recent gains, despite a favorable news background that depicted the economy strengthening without inflationary side effects.
 
Unemployment Claims Down
 The Labor Department reported that initial claims for state unemployment insurance dropped 38,000 in the week ended Nov. 21 to their lowest level in more than three years. The decline, which was much larger than analysts had been expecting, provided emphatic new evidence that the job market was improving.
At the same time, the department also said its Producer Price Index of finished goods dropped two-tenths of 1 percent in November, signaling an absence of inflationary pressures in the pipelines of the economy.
If trends like those continue, analysts say, President-elect Bill Clinton will have a lot of maneuvering room to direct his economic policies toward reducing the Federal deficit rather than seeking short-term stimulus for business conditions.
The market showed no pronounced reaction to the apppointments Mr. Clinton made to top economic posts in his Administration, including the choice of Senator Lloyd Bentsen as Secretary of the Treasury. Analysts noted that all the names had appeared in news reports over the last several days, and presented no surprises.
National Semiconductor ranked among the volume leaders, down 2 5/8, at 10 5/8, after reporting quarterly earnings that fell short of expectations.
Imcera Group tumbled 5 3/4, to 33 3/4. The company lowered its earnings projection for its 1993 fiscal year, citing a weaker-than-expected performance by its Pitman-Moore animal health subsidiary.
International Business Machines, still buffeted by talk that fresh restructuring and cost-cutting moves might be in store at the company, dropped 7/8, to 61 3/4.
Other decliners among the blue chips included General Motors, down 3/4 at 33 1/8; American Telephone and Telegraph, down 3/8 at 48 1/2; Philip Morris, down 1 at 79 7/8; Merck, down 1/2 at 47 1/8, and Eastman Kodak, down 1/2 at 40 1/2.
Micro Warehouse, making its debut in the over-the-counter market, jumped to 23 3/4 after an initial public offering of 2.85 million shares at 18. But some of the big-name software issues in the over-the-counter market ran into selling pressure. Microsoft fell 3, to 89; Borland International 3/4, to 20 3/4, and Novell Inc., which reported higher quarterly profits, 1/4, to 30 3/4.
National City Bancorp plunged 7 1/8, to 11 7/8, while Metropolitan Financial rose 1, to 16 3/4. The two companies called off a planned merger.
The Nasdaq composite index dropped 4.99, to 658.93. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was off 0.59 at 392.39.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Rockefeller Center Trust to Cut Dividend

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Rockefeller Center Properties Inc., the real estate investment trust that holds the mortgage on Rockefeller Center, said yesterday that it would cut its fourth-quarter dividend.
The dividend, payable on Dec. 30, was cut to 25 cents a share, from 48 cents the previous quarter. The board of the trust cited the "unfavorable real estate climate in midtown Manhattan" as a main reason behind the move. 
 Rockefeller Center Properties' principal asset is a $1.3 billion participating mortgage loan that it made in 1985 to the Rockefeller Group, which is 80 percent owned by the Mitsubishi Estate Company of Japan and about 20 percent owned by various Rockefeller family trusts.
 
Many Leases Expire in 1994
 The Rockefeller Group owns buildings that account for 6.2 million square feet, most of the office space in Rockefeller Center. Although the space is about 95 percent occupied, 42 percent of it -- some 2.6 million feet -- is on leases that will expire in 1994.
"No one is afraid that Mitsubishi won't make good on its debt," said Cornelius V. Sewell, an analyst with Argus Research. Mr. Sewell has had a sell recommendation on the Rockefeller Center Properties stock since September, when the board first announced it was reviewing its dividend policy. "They are worried about rental revenues," he said.
On the new York Stock Exchange yesterdy, Rockefeller Center Properties shares gained 75 cents each, closing at $8.875.
Earnings have stayed flat at about $1 a share annually, so the new 25- cent quarterly dividend is not much higher than the 95 percent of earnings that real estate investment trusts are required by law to pay out as dividends. Rockefeller Center Properties had been paying about 190 percent of its earnings as dividends.
At the time the Rockefeller Group bought the center from the Rockefeller family, the real estate market was tight, midtown space was going for about $40 a square foot and real estate experts expected that by the 1990's, $60 a square foot would be a reasonable asking price. Now, most brokers say the Rockefeller Group will be lucky if the space goes for as high as $30.
 
'Big Bonanza' Not Materializing
 "They figured they'd reap a big bonanza when the leases rolled over in 1994," said another analyst, who insisted on anonymity and has been recommending that clients sell the stock for a year.
The problem for Rockefeller Center Properties is that the participating mortgage calls for it to receive substantial cash flow only if gross revenues of Rockefeller Center top $312 million a year, which seemed easy to reach when projections were made in 1985. But last year the gross rentals were barely $230 million.
Rockefeller Center Properties, meanwhile, structured its own debt with those terms in mind. On Jan. 1, 1995, the annual interest rate on its convertible deventures is scheduled to increase to 13 percent from 8 percent. And it has a $200 million letter of credit from Credit Suisse that is due next May. It is trying to refinance a portion of that debt.
Richard M. Scarlata, senior vice president for finance and administration at Rockefeller Center Properties, said, "It is premature to say that the debt will be called." But the trust clearly is shoring up its cash position just in case. "We no longer have the expectations of additional interest from the mortgage participation that we once had," Mr. Scarlata said.

HEADLINE: A Theater Is Selected for 'Angels in America'

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
After weeks of agonizing by the playwright, feverish competition from theater owners and Kremlinology-like speculation by the theater world at large, the New York fate of Tony Kushner's two-part AIDS epic, "Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes," has finally been determined.
It was announced yesterday by Mr. Kushner and the play's producers, Jujamcyn Theaters and the Center Theater Group of Los Angeles, in association with the New York Shakespeare Festival, that the four-hour first part of the play, "Millennium Approaches," will open on April 25 at the Walter Kerr Theater on West 48th Street. The production, to be directed by George C. Wolfe, will thus bypass a previously announced Off Broadway engagement at the Joseph Papp Public Theater.
 
A Run in Los Angeles
 The second part, "Perestroika," which Mr. Kushner is still revising, is to follow at an unspecified date. The entire play recently completed a successful run at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, where the schedule included both marathon single-day performances and consecutive-night performances. The producers said the scheduling was undecided for New York. 
 Competition for the play, in the end between Jujamcyn and the Shubert Organization, was particularly striking for its vehemence and because, by virtually all accounts, a seven-hour nonmusical play on a homosexual theme is a considerable economic risk for Broadway, though the rumor mill already has it nominated for -- if not the recipient of -- a Tony Award.
Indeed, as negotiations went on, what became evident was the ever-smoldering rivalry between the upstart Jujamcyn group and the older, more powerful Shuberts. Finally the Shuberts offered Mr. Kushner one of its prime jewels, the Booth Theater, a stunning, intimate house in a desirable location on West 45th Street, which would have involved moving -- at considerable expense -- the Booth's current tenant, "Someone Who'll Watch Over Me."
"My life has been significantly shortened by the events of the last three weeks," said Rocco Landesman, Jujamcyn's president. "But I'm proud we're getting a show of this importance." Asked why the competition for the play escalated to the degree it had, he added: "To the extent any show can be, this show is news. Whatever the commercial outcome, it's going to be noticed and I think the people who are associated with it are going to be proud."
 
'He Was Very Upset'
 The final announcement, which was put off several times, came after Mr. Kushner met for two hours on Wednesday with Bernard J. Jacobs, the president of the Shubert Organization, who made a last-ditch effort to persuade Mr. Kushner to bring the play to the Booth. Obviously angry at the outcome, Mr. Jacobs declined to comment. Gordon Davidson, the artistic director of the Center Theater Group, who told Mr. Jacobs of the decision, said ruefully: "He was very upset. It's going to take a while to repair that relationship."
Mr. Davidson said the decision was difficult because both the elegantly restored Kerr and the Booth are extraordinary theaters, and equally suitable for the play. But, he said, Mr. Kushner "responded extra strongly to the Kerr."
Mr. Wolfe's acceptance of the directing job provided another discomforting development. To take the assignment, he pulled out of a commitment to the Hartford Stage Company to direct "Marisol," a play by Jose Rivera, enraging Hartford's artistic director, Mark Lamos, and its managing director. They issued a blistering statement through a spokesman, which said, in part, "We find this decision and the producers' encouragement of it reprehensible and an affront to Hartford Stage."
Mr. Wolfe responded, also through a spokesman: "I feel terrible about this. I love the play 'Marisol' and have offered to do it at a later date."
 
Fate of a Play
 "Angels in America," which had its world premiere in San Francisco last year and then a celebrated run in London, was scheduled to open at the Public Theater in February. But discussions about whether to move from Los Angeles directly to Broadway began last month after the play's enthusiastically received national press opening at the Taper. The possibility of losing "Angels in America," the centerpiece in the Public's season, had been viewed in the theater world as a potentially devastating blow. But JoAnne Akalaitis, the artistic director of the New York Shakespeare Festival, said yesterday that the festival would still be involved in the production, that festival subscribers would still be entitled to tickets at downtown prices and that she viewed the hole in the schedule as an opportunity. She said she was already talking to producers about other projects, but declined to name them.
"We have not lost the play to Broadway," Ms. Akalaitis said. "We have gained for our subscribers and community the chance to see it on Broadway. It's sort of a good deal for us, I think."
Mr. Davidson, speaking for himself and Mr. Kushner, said: "It's been difficult. We've been juggling a lot of elements, and a lot of feelings are hurt. But it comes out of the fact that so many people want to be involved."
In the wake of a particularly painful and hectic week, he added, "Now the problems begin."

Casting Crunch for a New Rabe Play
For four years now, ever since he finished it, David Rabe has been trying to cast his four-character play "Those the River Keeps" in a way that would make it viable for a Broadway production. Now it looks as though he's about to give up, making the possible Broadway run of a major work by a major playwright a casualty of star-system economics. 
 The play is about a middle-aged man who, having married a much younger woman, is visited by a colleague from his shady past and must choose between current comfort and the allure of dangerous days gone by. The problem has been the two male leads, Phil and Sal, the casting demands of which "are very, very particular," in the words of the playwright.
"It needs two men who can play Italians in their 40's and who can act onstage," Mr. Rabe said. "You start adding in the demands of Broadway, the renown or fame they need, and the talent pool gets pretty small. There's about four people who could do it."
That assessment is actually a little bleak. Of the four Mr. Rabe named, Robert De Niro was never a realistic possibility, but Al Pacino, Danny Aiello and Harvey Keitel have all done readings of the play. Their film commitments have kept them from signing on for a minimum six-month stint on stage. Joe Mantegna and Armand Assante have also been affiliated with the project at one time or another, but the producer, James B. Freydberg, said that as Mr. Rabe made changes in the play, the role of Phil emerged as central, and "therefore it's been more difficult to match two stars in it."
Mr. Freydberg added: "At one time, Joe Mantegna did a reading with Al Pacino. At one time it looked like it was going to be Joe and Aiello, but that didn't work because Joe got a film." Mr. Assante was interested in doing the play with Mr. Aiello, he said, but then it turned out that both of them wanted the same part.
The play's one production, almost two years ago at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., featured Burt Young and Anthony LaPaglia, but because "in some fashion Sal is the alter ego of Phil," Mr. Freydberg said, the disparity in the actors' ages -- Mr. Young was 50, Mr. LaPaglia some 20 years younger -- was an obvious flaw.
Of the once-interested performers, Mr. Aiello remains so. "I wanted to come back on Broadway," Mr. Aiello said, "but getting all the ducks in a row seems like an impossible thing. So David asked me if I'd be willing to do it Off Broadway. Who the hell am I? I'm too big to do that? I said, 'If it's the right house.' "
Now the problem is that Mr. Rabe and Mr. Freydberg are looking in another direction, committing to Off Broadway but casting two younger actors in the play -- John Turturro is a name that has surfaced -- which would leave Mr. Aiello, who is somewhere north of 50, out of it.
"I think it'll happen," Mr. Freydberg said. "But I don't know when. We've got to rethink."
 
Patinkin as Marvin in 'Falsettos'
 When Michael Rupert, who has since 1981 played Marvin, the lead character in various incarnations of "Falsettos," leaves the show in January to take on the Stephen Sondheim revue at the Manhattan Theater Club, the role will be filled by Mandy Patinkin. Mr. Patinkin, a longtime friend of the show's director, James Lapine, was on a concert tour recently in Toronto, where Mr. Lapine is directing a film. The offer to take over the role, Mr. Patinkin said, was made on a street corner after a serendipitous meeting.
Mr. Patinkin said that his contract for the show was open-ended and that his only other commitments were sporadic concert performances in the spring and a likely 10-week concert tour next fall.
 
Larry Gatlin Is the New Will Rogers
 The country singer Larry Gatlin likes to tell a story about the days between the time he and his younger brothers first saw fame in the early 1970's and the time he finally quit drinking and taking drugs in 1984.
"In 1976 or 1978," he said, "when we started getting real hot, I was the cockiest young son of a buck. I was drinking a little too much vodka, and I took too many funny substances. And some of the guys at the music publishing company" -- Combine Music in Nashville -- "they thought I was too big for my britches, and they were right."
"A funny thing happened," he went on. "At Combine, there's a chalkboard in the men's room in the basement. And on it somebody wrote a sign, in big capital letters, that said, 'Will Rogers never met Larry Gatlin.' "
The story is apropos because Mr. Gatlin, who has said that his touring days with his brothers, Steve and Rudy, with whom he has recorded 23 albums, will come to an end this month, has just been named to replace Mac Davis in the title role of "Will Rogers Follies," beginning Feb. 16. He has appeared as an actor a time or two on television, but never before onstage. Mr. Davis is leaving to resume his songwriting and performing career in Los Angeles, but he'll stop in Pittsburgh and Charlotte, N.C., on his way home to stand in for a vacationing Keith Carradine in the "Will Rogers" road production.
Mr. Gatlin auditioned for the part early this year and was the first choice of the producer, Pierre Cossette, to replace the original Will on Broadway, Mr. Carradine. Mr. Cossette said he had gone to Mr. Davis because Mr. Gatlin was unavailable until January.
In the sort of confluence that makes it seem as though celebrities were all born into the same large family, Mr. Cossette also said he got the idea for casting Mr. Gatlin from the same source he got the idea to cast Marla Maples: Frank and Kathie Lee Gifford, who are friends of both Mr. Gatlin and Ms. Maples's former fiance, Donald Trump.
"It's the Gifford casting system," Mr. Cossette said, adding that Mr. Gatlin's lack of acting experience didn't trouble him at all. "What this is, more than acting, is an entertainment piece. Larry has done two shows a night, seven days a week, all of his adult life. That's what Will Rogers did all of his adult life."
The 44-year-old Mr. Gatlin, who lives in Austin, Tex., spoke from a mobile phone there, where he was furniture shopping for the apartment he just bought in Trump Tower in New York.
"I like to say Donald made me an offer I didn't understand, and I took it," Mr. Gatlin said.
He said he felt no unease about appearing as an actor. "I'm thankful for the past, for all the people we've sung for, from the little road houses to the White House -- hey, that's pretty good -- and in between, but I feel like this is the next step for Larry Gatlin. I don't think it's a big stretch from Larry Gatlin, a Texan, to Will Rogers an Oklahoman."

Paris in Its Prime, Posing for Classic Images

BYLINE: By CHARLES HAGEN

 BODY:
Paris in all its romantic glory is the subject of a fascinating show at the Houk Friedman Gallery. Under the cumbersome title "De l'Ancien Regime aux Temps Modernes: Paris et ses Environs," the gallery has assembled a diverse and often beautiful selection of photographs of the city in its heyday. Most of the pictures in the show, which includes classics by Man Ray, Brassai, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Doisneau and many others, are from the period between the two world wars, when artists and writers flocked to Paris, drawn by its atmosphere of creativity and freedom.
By the time much of the work shown here was made, the great artistic achievements that earned the city its reputation were largely in the past. French society, too, was undergoing changes, which World War II would accelerate. But the point of the show is to record not the Paris of history but the mythical city, the Paris of "La Boheme" and Balzac. 
 The fabulous nature of this view of the city is made clear by pictures like Brassai's 1931 photograph of the Pont des Arts shrouded in mist, or Georges Blanc's nighttime shots from the 1930's of the lighted fountains on the Place de la Concorde. These and other photographs depict Paris as a kind of fairy-tale city.
Perhaps it is not surprising that so many of the photographers who portrayed this imaginary Paris were themselves foreigners. Andre Kertesz, from Hungary; Brassai, from what is now Romania; Ilse Bing, from Germany; Man Ray and Berenice Abbott, from the United States: they joined countless others from all over the world in portraying this idealized Paris.
Not only were many photographers from elsewhere, but their subjects often were, too. In an elegant shot from around 1925, George Hoyningen-Huene, a former Russian aristocrat, photographed Josephine Baker, coyly hiding behind strings of pearls and a glittery strip of cloth. In Kertesz's complexly geometric "Chez Mondrian" (1926), a lithe tulip in a vase sits next to the open door of the Dutch painter's loft.
What these and homegrown masters like Cartier-Bresson and Doisneau recorded in their images of Paris was not so much a place or even a society as an attitude toward life. In this view, sophistication and pleasure, whether intellectual or sensual, were among the highest values.
While photographers in the United States in the 30's recorded the ravages of the Depression, often to promote social change, their counterparts in Paris, on the evidence of the pictures here, paid little attention to economic or political reform. Instead, romance is all. The young lovers reflected in the mirrored walls of a cafe in Brassai's photograph from 1932 are too self-absorbed, too pleased with their own beauty and stylishness, to worry much about the problems of the world.
At the heart of this mythical Paris is the implicit notion of a kind of democracy based on talent and sensuousness. Even in Brassai's picture of a well-dressed young man surrounded by half-naked women in a brothel, there is little sense of inequality or anguish. Whatever the reality may have been, here the women confront the man as equals.
In this and other pictures, the frank acknowledgment of sex is accompanied by a deep sense of romance that at times tips over into sentimentality. Perhaps no picture better captures the dizzy feeling of young love that for many people defines Paris as Doisneau's "Kiss in Front of the Hotel de Ville" (1947), in which a young couple embrace on a busy sidewalk.
As this picture demonstrates, the romantic image of Paris easily survived World War II. It persists to this day, in part thanks to photographs like these. Increasingly, though, this impossibly alluring vision has taken on a nostalgic tinge. Two photographs here by Eugene Atget suggest that this sense of a lost golden age has long been part of the myth of Paris.
In one, taken at the Parc de St. Cloud in 1901, a line of trees and statues reflected in the calm waters of a pool at dawn has a lonely but fragile elegance. And in the 1920's, near the end of his life, Atget photographed a small Greek-style temple in a wooded park. A great dark bough sags across the frame like a mournful blot on the ideals of beauty and proportion represented by the building.
For all the vibrancy and exuberance of the pictures his younger contemporaries made in the 20's and 30's, they, too, have taken on an elegaic resonance, as the joyful and impossibly sophisticated Paris they describe, whether real or imagined, has faded into the past.
"De l'Ancien Regime aux Temps Modernes: Paris et ses Environs" remains at the Houk Friedman Gallery, 1094 Madison Avenue, at 82d Street, through Dec. 31.

Two Marines and Their Code on Trial

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
The role doesn't have to be big, but if it's good, and if the actor playing it is great, the results can be magically transforming. Witness Jack Nicholson's vicious, funny, superbly reptilian turn in Rob Reiner's entertaining "A Few Good Men," adapted by Aaron Sorkin from his hit Broadway courtroom drama.
Mr. Nicholson doesn't steal the film, which would mean that he somehow separates himself from everybody else in it. Rather, in the course of only a handful of scenes, he seems to suffuse the entire production, giving it a weight, density and point that might not otherwise be apparent. 
 The role, beautifully written, is made to Mr. Nicholson's order. It's that of Col. Nathan R. Jessep of the United States Marine Corps, a tough, bigoted Vietnam veteran, a career officer shaped by decades of cold-war politics. By chance, Jessep is stationed in that last corner of the earth where the cold war goes on as if there were no yesterday.
He's the commander of the marines stationed at the American naval base on the southwestern coast of Cuba at Guantanamo Bay, on a small bit of arid real estate protecting one of the best anchorages in the western Atlantic, a legacy of the Spanish-American War. It's there that the United States and Cuba, separated by barbed wire and command posts, have continued to co-exist through the Bay of Pigs invasion, the great missile crisis and a continuing, crippling economic embargo, in one of the strangest examples of symbiosis to be found in all of international relations.
This geographic fact becomes a central image in the film adaptation, which gracefully opens up the story of a military court-martial without allowing the tension to evaporate. There are times when the movie seems to force-feed the audience essential information, and when the audience might well wonder whether the emotional crises of the defense lawyers really are of more interest than the fates of the two men on trial.
Yet such things are built into the structure and nature of the drama, which is less about the workings of the military than about the mechanics of this particular inquiry. The story is this: in the course of what appears to be a hazing incident at Guantanamo, a Marine private has died, apparently poisoned by the rag stuffed into his throat before his mouth was taped. Two enlisted men are charged with the murder. As often happens during proceedings of this sort, the victim and the men on trial become less important than the politics surrounding the case.
The Marine Corps would like to wrap it up as quickly and efficiently as possible. To this end, a hot-shot young naval lawyer, Lieut. (j.g.) Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), is assigned to the defense with the understanding that he'll persuade the defendants to accept a plea bargain. Also assigned to the defense is Lieut. Comdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore), who acts as Kaffee's conscience, eventually persuading him that there is a strong possibility that the two enlisted men were, in fact, acting on orders from their officers.
The investigation, initially undertaken by Kaffee with some reluctance, uncovers the fact that the victim, Pfc. William T. Santiago (Michael DeLorenzo), had for some time been trying to transfer out of his unit. Also, that he had ignored both the Marine Corps code and its chain of command. He had written letters to Washington offering to testify that he had witnessed an incident in which a member of his unit had arbitrarily fired on a Cuban watchtower near the base.
As the investigation continues, Kaffee and Galloway, who clearly never go to the movies, read a book or spend much time talking to career service personnel, are surprised to discover a kind of military mind that, to them, seems prehistoric. The two defendants at first behave like automatons. Pfc. Louden Downey (James Marshall) is so taciturn that he seems seriously retarded. His co-defendant and spokesman, Lance Cpl. Harold W. Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison), refuses all offers of help. He will stoically accept whatever punishment is meted out. The two men simply parrot the Marines' code of fidelity to unit, corps, God and country.
On a fact-finding trip to Guantanamo, Kaffee, Galloway and their assistant Lieut. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak) have their first brush with Jessep at a scary lunch, during which the colonel cheerfully lies through his teeth. For Galloway's benefit, he also describes the special kind of high one can get when having sex with a superior officer. According to Jessep, that's one of the few benefits of an integrated service.
"A Few Good Men" doesn't pack the surprises of "Witness for the Prosecution," nor does it probe very deeply into the psyche of men who exercise the power of dictators in a society that congratulates itself on its freedoms. It's no "Full-Metal Jacket." "A Few Good Men" recalls something of "The Caine Mutiny Court Martial," though it is most troubling not for the questions it raises, but for the casual way it finally treats its two lost, utterly bewildered defendants.
The screenplay is a good one, directed with care and acted, for the most part, with terrific conviction. Among the supporting players who do exceptional work are Kiefer Sutherland, as a Marine officer who is a Jessep in the making; J. T. Walsh, as an officer fatally flawed by conscience; Kevin Bacon, who appears as the military prosecutor, and Mr. Bodison, a new young actor whose performance as the more prominent defendant gives the film its melancholy shock value.
Mr. Cruise, Ms. Moore and Mr. Pollak are perfectly adequate in less flashy roles, which, unlike the others, appear to have been constructed to keep the plot moving right along. They have to play it comparatively straight, which must be maddening when the actors around them are having such a colorful time.
Mr. Nicholson is in his own league. His Jessep is both a joy to watch because of the actor's skill, and an explanation of why the United States base at Guantanamo Bay, whatever its military value, continues to exist. "A Few Good Men" is a big commercial entertainment of unusually satisfying order.
"A Few Good Men," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has a lot of vulgar language and some violence.

Reflections in an Unflinching Eye: C-SPAN Meets Baseball

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
It's too bad C-SPAN could not provide coverage of yesterday's United States Senate hearings into baseball's antitrust exemption the way ESPN would do it. Where was the video? The replays of inflammatory comments? The studio analysis?
We know C-SPAN merely flips the camera on and leaves it alone until the hearing ends. That's fine for an arcane hearing on Keynesian economics as it relates to Federal Reserve monetary policy. But over five or six hours of baseball testimony, a dose of Chris Berman narrating dramatic video and the career stats of the antitrust subcommittee's chairman, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, Democrat from Ohio, would have been mighty welcome. 
 We're so used to clip-filled coverage of sports that we craved video of former Commissioner Fay Vincent at Candlestick Park during the earthquake-delayed Giants-A's World Series in 1989 each time the Giants' abortive move to St. Petersburg, Fla., was mentioned. Or clips of the padlocked spring training camps during the 1990 owners' lockout of players when talk of a possible 1993 lockout came up. Or footage of Barry Bonds.
What cried out most for action yesterday was the testimony of ex-pitcher Roric Harrison, who bemoaned how baseball's exemption from antitrust laws kept him the Baltimore Orioles' chattel. He said that in one season when he pitched five shutouts in a month and finished with a 15-5 record, he was never called up from Class AAA and the Orioles would not trade him elsewhere. Surely, ESPN would have had video of him during his stints with Atlanta or Minnesota.
As for the performances: Vincent was stern, animated and occasionally witty, punctuating his words with a motion that seemed as if he was breaking off imaginary sliders; Selig (with a cheering section introduced like stars in audience of "The Ed Sullivan Show") emerged as Boy Scout-faithful, but jumpy and tense; Sen. Connie Mack, Republican from Florida, displayed a bulldog-like intensity in pursuing his anti-exemption crusade, but forgot to wear his grandpa's straw boater, and Sen. Alan Simpson, Republican from Wyoming, praised himself effusively for not exceeding his allotted speaking time and mispronounced "Kuhn" (Bowie) as "Koon."
The verbal home run of the hearings came from witness Rick Dodge, assistant city manager of St. Petersburg, who reminded the remaining senators (most of whom had left early) that Selig, who benefited when the Seattle Pilots moved to Milwaukee, and Peter O'Malley, whose father moved the Dodgers from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, both opposed the Giants' move to St. Petersburg.
If ESPN were there, Dodge's words would have been accompanied by footage of wrecking balls at Ebbets Field or the Milwaukee Braves celebrating their 1957 World Series victory, eight years before shipping off to Atlanta.
COTTON SWITCH ANYONE? When we left this saga, NBC had its first Cotton Bowl on Jan. 1 at 1 P.M. featuring Notre Dame and Texas A&M competing with CBS's Blockbuster Bowl (Penn State-Stanford) and ABC's Citrus Bowl (Ohio State-Georgia). With ratings lure Notre Dame, the Cotton would presumably act as a strong lead-in to NBC's weaker Syracuse-Colorado Fiesta Bowl at 4:30 P.M.
But why sacrifice Notre Dame so early? Why not flip-flop the Cotton and Fiesta Bowls so the Irish-enhanced Cotton Bowl would go up against ABC's Michigan-Washington Rose Bowl.
If the Fiesta featured a Pac-10 team to avoid vying head to head with the Rose Bowl's Pac-10 team, such a switch would be contractually automatic. With more viewers watching at 4:30, NBC could strategically place Notre Dame in a more crucial and competitive time slot against the ever-popular Rose Bowl.
Nothing in NBC's contracts with the Fiesta and Cotton Bowls would preclude the time switch, but it won't be done, said Kenneth Schanzer, the executive vice president of NBC Sports, who said that using Notre Dame to lead off the bowl day on network television is of primary importance and that the Rose Bowl "isn't of such great cachet" that it requires Notre Dame's presence.
John Heisler, a spokesman for Notre Dame's athletic department, said he'd heard no suggestion of a time switch. "The Cotton Bowl people were here the other day and there was no talk about anything but a kick-off at 12:05 (Central time). Our priority was not time slot, but to play against a higher-ranked team. We can't play Miami, but we are playing Texas A&M."
 
AIR WAVES
 So much for speculation that a RIDDICK BOWE fight would be the Fox Network's Super Bowl halftime counterprogramming on Jan. 31; HBO has signed Bowe for a Feb. 6 fight, probably against ALEX GARCIA or ALEX STEWART. . . . JOE ACETI, the long-time CBS director most recently on baseball, is directing the World Professional Figure Skating Championships in Landover, Md., this weekend, which will air Jan. 29 on NBC. CBS bought him out of the remainder of his contract; he is now freelancing. . . . NBC's O. J. SIMPSON, working tomorrow's Heisman Trophy show at 3:30 P.M., praised candidate MARSHALL FAULK of San Diego State as a certain impact player in the pros who doesn't need further college time to improve. Simpson, who considered leaving Southern Cal after his junior year, said: "My senior year didn't make me a better player."

Say This For N.H.L.: Goofy, Eh?

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
WAYNE Gretzky was once moved to describe the New Jersey Devils as a "Mickey Mouse franchise." Needless to say, the next time his Edmonton team went gliding onto the ice in the Meadowlands, he was greeted with thousands of locals wearing little black ears.
The Great One need only look southward, under his rocking chair in Los Angeles. Coming soon to an arena near Wayne is the latest in Mickey Mouse franchises. The National Hockey League, which has added three teams in the last two seasons, is making loud noises about expanding again. 
 Just yesterday, the Walt Disney Company was conditionally granted a franchise in Anaheim, Calif., hard by the concrete Matterhorn and other cultural phenomena of Disneyland and Orange County. Within the next year or two, the league also plans a franchise in the hockey hotbed of Miami, where only two nights ago 12,842 fans watched the Rangers play the Tampa Bay Lightning in a neutral-rink experiment that is by no means a success.
There are a lot of things I do not understand about this proposed expansion: how can a league that does not yet have a president, and that is still stuck somewhere back in 1948 in its administration, make a decision to keep expanding? And what makes it think the Sun Belt is ready for all these hockey teams?
I also do not understand how hockey can expand when the North American economy is still shaky. Are we to take this expansion as a major endorsement of the economic policies of President-elect Clinton?
There are other possible explanations for this extremely optimistic -- you might even say grandiose -- move. The league meeting was in Palm Beach, Fla., where the temperature was well into the 70's. The lords of hockey sat around in their tennis shorts or plaid golfing pants, and called back to their offices in Winnipeg and Boston and even in New York, where it was fixing to snow. Orange County? Miami? Looked pretty good to them.
The other explanation is that the lords of hockey have already decided to elect Gary Bettman, the slick, young whippersnapper from the National Basketball Association, to be their president. Gil Stein, the league's lawyer, has been watching the store since John (Boys Will Be Boys) Ziegler was offed last spring, but maybe it's the Bush-Clinton thing all over again. A fresh start. Youth be served.
The lords of hockey may be hoping that Bettman will know how to market Lemieux and Lindros and Gretzky the way David Stern sold Magic and Bird and Jordan in the past decade.
That may be wishful thinking, but the hockey owners are on the right trail if they go for Bettman rather than maintain the status quo. The N.H.L. is drawing players from every major hockey country in the world. It should be selling television, merchandise and even official games like the N.B.A.
This expansion mania is contingent on the new ownerships coming up with the entry fees, $50 million, the same paid by the new Tampa Bay and Ottawa teams. The Disney Company obviously feels a hockey team in Anaheim would be a good way to promote its gigantic entertainment network, and Wayne Huizenga, the owner of Blockbuster Video and the new Florida Marlins baseball team, seems to think he has some money left over for a hockey team in Miami.
The other sports are not exactly feeling expansive. Even Stern is resting for a while. Pro football is reviewing the situation. And baseball, which once talked of a nice, neat 32 teams by year 2000, is going to hold fast at next year's expansion to a highly unwieldy 28 teams.
That is, if there is a next year. Baseball is currently mired in the deepest psychological depression ever suffered by a professional league. These owners may blunder their way into a lockout in 1993 that could wreck baseball forever.
The way the baseball owners were spending money for players at the winter meetings this week, they are either lying about their financial problems or they are crazy. I cannot make up my mind.
The hockey owners never struck me as crazy. They were a sour, conservative lot who didn't understand why nine-tenths of the United States population said: "Hockey? Isn't that the sport where people punch each other around on the ice?" It is a far better sport than that, when a couple of good teams are actually trying to score goals. The owners have recently tightened their rules about fighting and stick-holding, and you can sometimes attend a game without seeing two mugs mauling each other. Does this mean hockey is ready for expansion to the Sun Belt? Has anybody checked the hockey owners for sunstroke?

HEADLINE: The Clinton Anti-Gridlock Team

 BODY:
Teamwork. Coordination. Words like these dominated President-elect Clinton's news conference yesterday because they govern his choice of five top economic officials. All five are cut from the same fiscally conservative cloth; they should have little trouble working together.
They are also smart, experienced professionals who will pack clout in Congress and on Wall Street. That's Mr. Clinton's way of telling voters: No more gridlock. 
 As expected, Mr. Clinton nominated Senator Lloyd Bentsen to be Treasury Secretary and Roger Altman, a savvy New York investment banker, as his deputy. Representative Leon Panetta, the House Budget Committee chairman, was nominated to be budget director, with Alice Rivlin, the only economist in the group, as his deputy.
Mr. Panetta and Dr. Rivlin have lobbied hard for no-tricks deficit reduction. Dr. Rivlin has the added stature, as the Congressional Budget Office's first director, of having established its reputation for first-rate, nonpartisan technical analysis.
Perhaps the most significant appointment is that of Robert Rubin, co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street investment bank. He will head the new White House council charged with coordinating the Administration's economic policy. His job will be to focus Mr. Clinton's attention on the economic picture, in much the way the national security adviser focuses attention on geopolitics.
The President-elect might have gone a different route -- choosing someone who had already staked out hard policy positions. Mr. Rubin, however, can be expected to play the role of honest broker. His task is to coordinate the ideas of economists at Treasury, State, the budget office and the Council of Economic Advisers and give Mr. Clinton coherent policy choices.
Yesterday's selections leave important questions unanswered. For starters, advisers like Robert Reich and Ira Magaziner, who were most closely associated with the defining themes of the Clinton campaign -- training, education and infrastructure investment -- were notably absent.
But that's no reason to suppose Mr. Clinton has abandoned his economic program. Both men could surface in other key posts. In any case, Mr. Altman and Mr. Rubin helped write his campaign agenda. And, as Mr. Clinton said yesterday, he has already defined his policies.
He will also have to refine them. It's simply impossible to cut taxes on the middle class, raise public investments by $20 billion a year and create bold new education and training programs -- all while cutting the deficit in half. What Mr. Clinton most needed was a team to identify priorities and push them through Congress. These first choices make a good start.

HEADLINE: Fastest Growing Economies Cut Tax Subsidies;
Debtors' Folly

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Bad Breaks" (Op-Ed, Nov. 18) Ann Crittenden proposes levying a 5 percent "tax" on interest paid to foreigners on "investments" here. Interest is paid only to foreign lenders, not owners of real American assets. The latter are taxed here. "Taxing" foreign lenders would be like my trying to tax the bank that finances my house or car. The bank, of course, would simply not make the loan unless I agreed to increase the interest rate to cover any present or future such "tax."
Debt securities trade publicly in increments of .01 percent. A 5 percent "tax" would be 500 times this determining market measure. In real life it would function as a protective tariff, keeping most foreign loan funds out of the U.S., driving up domestic rates and collecting little revenue. 
 Owing as much as we do, we would be more than a little foolish to try to tax our creditors abroad for continuing to lend to us.

HEADLINE: Fastest Growing Economies Cut Tax Subsidies;
Advertising Body Blow

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President-elect Clinton is getting lots of "free advice" about how to lower the deficit and get the economy moving again. And some of it is worth about as much as it costs: while the suggestion of Ann Crittenden in "Bad Breaks" (Op-Ed, Nov. 18) to change the tax deduction for advertising costs was "free," such a policy shift would be terribly expensive for the economy and the American public.
Businesses rely heavily on advertising to compete and grow in a diverse marketplace. The last thing that American companies need, particularly during a recession, are tax changes that make it more costly and less efficient to communicate with consumers. 
 The advertising tax proposal Ms. Crittenden now espouses had been previously examined and specifically rejected by two Nobel Laureates in economics, Dr. Kenneth Arrow of Stanford University and the late Dr. George Stigler of the University of Chicago. In August 1990, after a thorough review of the economic literature, they concluded that "proposals to change the tax treatment of advertising are not supported by the economic evidence."
President-elect Clinton has stated that he wants to develop an economic stimulus package to jump-start the economy. Nothing could short-circuit this effort faster than to burden the selling process by making advertising more expensive.
With businesses continuing to struggle to emerge from the recession, and the media reeling from cutbacks in advertising revenues, to change the tax treatment of advertising would be a body blow to the economy, the media, thousands of businesses and millions of consumers alike.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: A Cabinet Begins to Take Shape;
CLINTON TEAM TAKES SHAPE WITH BENTSEN AND 4 OTHERS NAMED TO ECONOMIC POSTS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 10

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton began to give shape to his Cabinet today with the appointment of an economic team of old hands from Washington and Wall Street to help him fulfill his campaign promise of fundamental economic change.
The distinctly mainstream array of advisers that Mr. Clinton introduced at the old Arkansas State House, led by Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as Treasury Secretary, seemed intended to mobilize lawmakers and executives behind his economic program, and to signal that the Clinton Administration will be as serious about reducing the deficit as about any new spending programs.
 
Diversity in Jobs
 Along with Senator Bentsen, Mr. Clinton named Representative Leon E. Panetta of California, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, as director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, M. Alice Rivlin, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, as Mr. Panetta's deputy, Roger C. Altman, an investment banker, as Deputy Treasury Secretary, and Robert E. Rubin, the co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, as senior economic adviser. 
 As he spoke, Mr. Clinton was preparing to name a more diverse group to other top Administration jobs. On Friday, Clinton aides say, he will name Carol M. Browner, a former assistant to Vice President-elect Al Gore and currently Secretary of Environmental Regulation in Florida, as head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
The choice of Ms. Browner was something of a surprise. Earlier in the week, aides said the top candidate was Madeline Kunin, a former Vermont governor. But now they say that Mr. Clinton chose to let Mr. Gore take the lead in appointing environmental officials.
In addition, the Clinton aides say he will name Donna Shalala, chancellor of the University of Wisconsin and former head of Hunter College in New York City, as Secretary of Health and Human Services.
 
Looking at Foreign Affairs
 And they say he will name Laura D'Andrea Tyson, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, to head the Council of Economic Advisers, and Robert B. Reich, a political scientist at Harvard University, as Secretary of Labor.
Mr. Clinton is also said to have all but formally decided to name former Mayor Henry Cisneros of San Antonio as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; Senator Timothy E. Wirth of Colorado, who retired this year, as Secretary of Energy, and former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, a 1988 Democratic Presidential contender, as Secretary of the Interior.
In light of the crisis in Somalia and other pressing foreign affairs problems that have recently come to the fore, the President-elect is vigorously trying to narrow his choices for Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense and national security adviser, aides said.
Mr. Clinton's transition director, Warren M. Christopher; Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, remain high on Mr. Clinton's short list for the State Department, the aides said, but he keeps pressing for more names as well.
Asked today about General Powell, Mr. Clinton said: "I certainly think he is qualified to be Secretary of State." But he added with a smile, "I'll tell you who I am considering for that position when I announce my appointment for Secretary of State."
Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic national chairman, has been asked to consider the post of Ambassador to the United Nations, but has not responded, members of the transition staff said.
At today's news conference, Mr. Clinton seemed intent on focusing exclusively on his core economic advisers and on economic issues.
"Our nation faces two deficits, a budget deficit and an investment deficit," Mr. Clinton said as he introduced his first Cabinet appointments. "I am going to work my heart out with these people to construct a strong, long-term plan for economic growth, for jobs, for incomes, and to reduce our national debt."
As he promised during the campaign, Mr. Clinton also created a new post in the White House -- a senior economic adviser to coordinate foreign and domestic policy through a new National Economic Council. Mr. Clinton named Mr. Rubin to that post, which carries the same rank as the national security adviser. The new council is intended to coordinate foreign and domestic economic strategies in much the same way as the National Security Council does in diplomatic and security affairs.
The choice of Mr. Altman, a friend of Mr. Clinton from their days at Georgetown University, as Deputy Treasury Secretary, may prove to be delicate issue for a President who campaigned on saving jobs and fending off foreign encroachments on American markets an industries. He is vice chairman of the Blackstone Group, an investment bank specializing in international mergers and acquisitions. Like many companies of its type, the Blackstone Group has aggressively solicited business abroad, and several years ago ran a a full-page advertisement in a Japanese newspaper offering its services to Japanese companies interested in taking over American companies.
Over all, Mr. Clinton has chosen a team of Wall Street and Congressional veterans, known more for parliamentary skills and business experience than for economic innovation. While the words change and innovation were the hallmarks of Mr. Clinton's campaign oratory, the appointees, aside from Mr. Bentsen, are probably stronger advocates of deficit-reduction than big new spending programs.
As a Clinton adviser said: "The message to Wall Street was steady as she goes, nothing different or innovative to worry about. This is the establishment here, all people very concerned about the deficit. I think Bill feels that with regard to economic policy, he can be his own top adviser. He knows what he wants to do and these people will be good at implementing it."
 
His Own Top Adviser
 Mr. Clinton said as much when he told reporters, "I will be the chief economic adviser in my Administration and I would take responsibility for addressing both the short and long-term economic challenges facing us."
As always, though, Mr. Clinton offered no specifics about painful measures he might offer to American taxpayers to pay for his programs.
Mr. Clinton said he wanted his economic team in place in time to help oversee the economic conference he has called for Monday and Tuesday in Little Rock, which will bring together about 300 business executives from around the country to discuss the state of the economy and how best to revive it.
The economic program Mr. Clinton's team will be asked to put into effect, as it currently shapes up, looks like some version of the outline he gave during the campaign: tax increases for Americans making more than $200,000 a year, tax reductions for the middle class, an investment tax credit for businesses creating jobs and $20 billion in new spending on roads, bridges, highways and high-technology transportation and communications systems.
Mr. Clinton promised all of that plus halving the budget deficit within four years.
The first challenge for the group will be deciding in the coming weeks whether the economy is rebounding enough now or whether it needs an extra dose of economic stimulus. Then, if more stimulus is needed, how should it be squared with a credible program to reduce the deficit.
As if reflecting some advance agreement, each of the new appointees included lines in their opening statements clearly intended to play down expectations for a quick fix.
"The American people realize that these challenges did not develop overnight and won't be fixed overnight," Mr. Bentsen said.
"The structural economic problems facing this country are deep-seated and can't be solved overnight," Mr. Altman said.
"There remain some deep and fundamental problems in the economy," Representative Panetta said.
Mr. Bentsen, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Altman, are all millionaires, and Mr. Rubin in particular has been a big donor to the Democratic Party for years. Mr. Clinton was asked, but did not answer, why he was turning to such Washington insiders, for his top economic advisers.
When Mr. Bentsen, who was known for granting more than a few large tax breaks for special interest business lobbies as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was asked to respond to this question he sidestepped it. "I have heard all those stories about my being an insider," he said. "Let me tell you I felt like an outsider for 12 years, and I'm tired of the gridlock."
 
Defining Jobs
 One of the points that was not resolved in the news conference was exactly what Mr. Rubin will do, and how his role as economic coordinator will be meshed with the Secretary of the Treasury, who has historically served in that function.
Under President Bush, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was the head of the Economic Policy Council, a body that was abolished about a year ago and drew wide criticism for producing little in the way of policy initiatives.
Trying to explain it, Mr. Clinton said: "First of all the Secretary of the Treasury will be the principal economic spokesperson for the Administration after the President. Mr. Rubin's job will be to coordinate, facilitate and provide some direction to the deliberations of our economic council. It will be a larger group than the National Security Council because it will include some others like Commerce, Labor, Energy, and it is a very important job. But in the end I will make the ultimate decisions and be the ultimate arbiter.
"Because we want to bring in more people in a systematic way and reconcile what these departments are doing so they can reinforce and energize one another. I decided I needed someone on the domestic side to be that sort of coordinator and facilitator, but these departments will each stand on their own bottoms and the Treasury will still be the place where the President's economic views are spoken for."
 
Old Hands for Clinton's New Economic Team
President-elect Bill Clinton turned to the center of the economic and political specturm with his choice of Senator Lloyd Bentsen, at right, as Treasury Secretary and Representative Leon E. Panetta as Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the top two economic jobs, and by naming Robert E. Rubin to the new post of senior senior economic adviser, Alice M. Rivlin as deputy budget director and Roger C. Altman as deputy Treasury Secretary. The choice of centrists could be important at a time when economists and politicians on the left and the right are arguing that the budget deficit is of secondary importance and when the number at the center willing to advocate the bitter medicine needed to lower the deficit seems to be shrinking.

Altman -- Vice chairman of the Blackstone Group, a New York investment bank who was a student at Georgetown University with Mr. Clinton in the 1960's...46...Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance in the Carter Administration and played a role in the rescues of the Chrysler Corporation and New York City...is among those who say that any financial stimulus to the sluggish economy must be applied with caution so as not to aggravate the Federal budget dificit or disturb the financial markets.
 
Alice M. Rivlin -- Economist...61...first director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1975 to 1983, where she earned considerable respect for professional and nonpartisan economic forecasts, options and analysis...former president of the American Economics Association...now an economist at the Brookings Institution and visiting professor of public policy at George Mason University...has long sounded the alarm over the huge budget deficits...in a recent book she called for for a shift from Washington and to the state capitals of programs like job training and public works, a sharp contrast to Mr. Clinton's position that his foremost responsibility as President is to promote economic growth and job creation..
 
Rep. Leon E. Panetta -- Democrat of California...54...elected to the House in 1976...chairman of the House Budget Committee since 1989...started as a Republican and switched parties in 1971...was a leading architect of the 1990 budget agreement aimed at reducing the deficit and has defended it against spending proposals, including those of many Democrats, that would pierce the agreement's limits...this year he drafted a long-term deficit-reduction plan calling for deep spending cuts and tax increases to pay for any new spending programs.
 
Robert E. Rubin -- Co-chairman and 26-year veteran of the investment banking firm of Goldman, Sachs and Company...54...has a reputation as a good manager who absorbs diverse opinions and then focuses on building consensus...not a particular ideologue, but many believe he would bring a willingness to balance concern about the financial markets with concern about economic and political needs...long-time Democratic fund-raiser who helped raise millions of dollars to finance the Democratic National Convention in July.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about President-elect Bill Clinton's selection of his top economic officials rendered the name of his choice for deputy budget director incorrectly in some copies. She is Alice M. Rivlin. An accompanying article about the Office of Management and Budget misstated her alma mater. It is Bryn Mawr College, not Radcliffe; she received her Ph.D. from Radcliffe.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: A Cabinet Begins to Take Shape;
Excerpts From Clinton's Announcement of Appointments to Economic Posts

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a news conference yesterday in which President-elect Bill Clinton announced the appointment of Senator Lloyd Bentsen as Secretary of the Treasury and named other economic advisers, as recorded by News Transcripts Inc., a private transcription service: 
 PRESIDENT-ELECT BILL CLINTON Today, I have asked you here to announce the first members of our economic team. These people are seasoned, skilled, incredibly able and ready to work for the American people. I stress the word "team" because the success of our economic action agenda will depend not only on the talents of these people as individuals and those whom I will announce in the next few days, but also in their capacity to work together for the common good of all Americans.
They are deeply aware that we must not be the first generation of Americans to leave a worse economy to our children. And as I have said repeatedly, our nation faces two deficits, a budget deficit and an investment deficit.
I'm going to work my heart out with these people to construct a strong, long-term plan for economic growth, for jobs, for incomes, and to reduce our national debt.

 	 	 		. . .	 	My first appointment, intentionally, is the Secretary of the Treasury. In filling this post, I wanted someone who had the unique capacity to command the respect of Wall Street, which showing an unrelenting concern for the Americans who make their living on Main Street.
When Lloyd Bentsen agreed to serve as Secretary of the Treasury, it is safe to say I succeeded. In American politics when you say the words "stature, dignity, and respects," Lloyd Bentsen's name comes right to mind. I've known Senator Bentsen for many years, and, as a few of my folks know, I've had him in mind for this position for a long time, long before I was actually elected President.
I followed his work for years as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee; I know about the tax bills he tried to have written into law, which would have promoted more investment and less consumption; I know about the trade positions he's tried to convince our country to take which would have promoted more free trade but a tougher set of demand to open markets to American products.
But he, too, needs a team, and the team that will take the helm at the Treasury Department is truly exceptional, in part because of the creativity and quality of the person who will be appointed as deputy secretary of the Treasury, Roger Altman. Roger is a longtime friend of mine, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury, a preeminent investment banker. And he's been one of my closest economic advisers throughout this entire campaign.
As director of the Office of Management and Budget, Congressman Leon Panetta will bring integrity to this critical office and restore the confidence of the American people and their elected representatives that O.M.B. is shooting straight with the Congress and shooting straight with the American people, and doing its best to help us not only to have a responsible budget but to manage the massive American Government in a different and better way than ever before.
As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Leon Panetta brought a unique combination of strong leadership and superb technical skills. With Leon Panetta as O.M.B. director, I believe that agency can play the pivotal role we have to have it play in the swift and effective implementation of our economic plan.
I'm also delighted to announce that Alice Rivlin, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office and one of our nation's most respected budget experts, has agreed to serve as deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. Together, Alice and Leon promise to be the most dynamic team in the history of O.M.B. and to restore the confidence of the Congress that the executive branch is going to be a responsible partner in making the budgets of this country.
Finally, I have asked Robert Rubin to serve as assistant to the President for economic policy and to help to coordinate and to direct our new Economic Council. I've created this new role, similar to that of the national security adviser in the present White House, because the coordination of our nation's economic policy is every bit as essential as the coordination of foreign policy to our long-term national security.
Bob Rubin has enjoyed a brilliant career at his firm, and has throughout manifested concern for the welfare of all Americans, and a special concern for the welfare of the inner city poor for whom he has worked as a member of the Cuomo Commission and in other contexts. This new Economic Council which I will chair embodies our commitment to make economic prosperity the top priority of this administration and to sharply focus on economic policy in the White House.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Today's appointments are just the first of many. In the coming days and before too long, we will have appointed the entire economic team and the remainder of the Cabinet. When we are done, the American people know that I mean business when it comes to our campaign commitment to promote a high way, high growth, strong and vital economy, not only for today's Americans, but for the future generations as well.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. Can you tell us, who will be taking orders from whom -- Mr. Rubin from Mr. Bentsen, or Mr. Bentsen from Mr. Rubin? It's not quite clear what each one will be doing here.
PRESIDENT-ELECT CLINTON Well, I think it is quite clear. First of all, the Secretary of the Treasury will continue to be the principal economic spokesperson after the President for this Administration, just as it has traditionally occurred. Mr. Rubin's job will be very much like General Scowcroft's job on the national security side in this Administration. His job will be to coordinate, to facilitate and to provide some direction to the deliberations of our economic council.
It will be a larger group than the National Security Council because it will include not only these departments, but also some others which I have discussed with you before, like Commerce, Labor, Energy. And it is a very important job.
But in the end, I will make the ultimate decisions and be the ultimate arbiter when there has to be an arbiter. I think that if you go back to the campaign structure that we tried to provide, which really did defy past organizations because it was less hierarchical and more team work oriented, that's what I expect to provide here.
And I think that because we want to bring in more people in a more systematic way and reconcile what these departments are doing so they can reinforce and energy one another, I decided that I needed someone on the domestic side to be that sort of coordinator and facilitator but these departments, each will stand on their own. . . . The Treasury will still be the place where the President's economic views are spoken for after the President does it.
SENATOR LLOYD BENTSEN I've heard all these stories about my being an insider. Let me tell you, I felt like an outsider for 12 years. And I'm tired of the gridlock.
To do the things we've tried to do on campaign reform, do the things we tried to do on a tough crime bill, to do the things that we did in the last tax bill, to put economic incentives in there to create jobs, and to get this country moving again, and to see those kinds of things vetoed, I'm just delighted to see us be able to bring about the kind of change, to create those jobs now, with a Democratic President, a Democratic President like Bill Clinton.
I think you're going to see those hopes turn into reality. And to be able to pass those and put them into law is what I'm so pleased about.
And as far as the Secretary of the Treasury's job, I know you're probably looking for more maturity in that job. But I'll do what I can.
REPRESENTATIVE LEON E. PANETTA I think everyone that knows me as chairman of the Budget Committee and my work on the budget, we've been basically fighting the budgets that have been presented over the last 12 years concerned about the priorities that we part of those budgets, the failure to invest in our society, and the fact that they would ultimately produce the record deficits that they have produced.
So I've been fighting against those kinds of budgets in the time I've been in Congress, and I think the President-elect and I share a common commitment, not only to long-term deficit reduction, but to making the investments in education and health care and infrastructure and growth that this Administration has failed to make over the last few years.
Q. Governor Clinton, and also Senator Bentsen, for both of you, were you at all concerned in picking Senator Bentsen that his choice might lead to the loss of yet another Democratic Senate seat in Texas that might make your job of getting your program passed harder? And Senator Bentsen, did that play any part in your decision whether to take this position?
SENATOR BENTSEN Obviously that's something that would be of some concern to me. But the Democratic Party in Texas is in great shape and we have a very effective and attractive Governor who will be making that decision and that choice and who will play a major role in that campaign and I think the odds are just excellent that a Democrat will succeed me in that spot.
PRESIDENT-ELECT CLINTON I did give it some thought. It crossed my mind. I think that frankly the kind of leadership that has been provided in Texas by people like Ann Richards, Henry Cisneros, John Sharp, that they and many others have embodied the kind of new Democratic Party that we're trying to bring to the United States. And I think there's a good chance that Governor Richards will name someone senator who will have the confidence of the people of Texas. I thought about it. But I also thought that Senator Bentsen was the best choice for America for Treasury Secretary and I think the people of Texas will respond to that. But I don't think there's any reason to believe that the Democrats can't be highly competitive in that job.
Q. The Justice Department has decided not to appoint a special prosecutor in the Iraqgate case. Do you believe that there is a need for additional inquiries in that? And will you appoint, have your Justice Department appoint, a special prosecutor after you take office?
PRESIDENT-ELECT CLINTON I certainly think we need to know more about it than we now know. And what I intend to do is to appoint an Attorney General and then get a recommendation on it. And generically, let me make a statement, the special prosecutor law, as you know, either just did or is about to expire and I had to tell you, I think it should be reenacted. And I will support that.

HEADLINE: At Issue in School Battle: the Chancellor Himself

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
What began as a provincial battle over what is taught about homosexuality in a small patch of Queens has mushroomed into a battle over the survival of the Chancellor and perhaps the way New York City governs its schools.
 On Wednesday night, in its harshest rebuff ever of Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, the seven-member Board of Education, by a surprising 6-to-0 vote, reinstated a Queens school board that had adamantly refused to adopt any multicultural curriculum that promotes respect and appreciation of gay people. 
Behind that vote lay a complex web of threads that included personal slights, political ambitions, moral and religious creeds and even an educational consideration or two. But at the nexus of that web stood one person, the Chancellor, and the question of whether he should or would stay on when his contract expires June 30.
 The answer to that question has implications that go far beyond the fate of the Chancellor himself. Mr. Fernandez was brought to New York three years ago with a mandate to radically overhaul a failing school system. And with often high marks, he has introduced a host of changes -- from letting teachers and parents help run schools, to breaking large high schools into smaller ones to offering greater choice of schools for all students.
 If the Chancellor were to leave, all his initiatives would be placed in limbo. And his departure, in the face of the city's withering politics, economic uncertainties and many other demands, would raise a perennially troubling issue: How can New York hope to attract innovative people to a place that so often frustrates their innovation?
 In recent weeks, Mr. Fernandez has clearly laid down the gauntlet, warning the central board that he will not remain unless it smoothes over its internal quarrels and ceases what he insists is its repeated meddling in his managerial prerogatives. The significance of the vote on Wednesday night was that the board not only rejected that warning, but that it also did so with virtual unanimity.
 And in doing so, the board appeared to send Mr. Fernandez its own convincing message: You can remain as Chancellor, but under our terms, by adopting a less combative leadership style.
 That leadership style was at issue once again yesterday as the battle over the curriculum refused to quiet down. Mr. Fernandez gave School Board 24 in Queens until the close of business today to meet with him to resolve the curriculum issue or face the appearance of trustees on Monday who will impose a curriculum on the district that teaches respect for gay people. And Mary A. Cummins, president of the board of District 24 in Queens, said she rejected his ultimatum and would appeal the Chancellor's actions once again to the central board.
 Even Mr. Fernandez's staunchest supporters seem to have grown weary with two years of struggle over condom distribution, AIDS prevention lessons and now lessons about gay people and wish Mr. Fernandez would find a more conciliatory way of approaching such emotional issues.
 A pithy remark yesterday by Michael J. Petrides, who has repeatedly tangled with Mr. Fernandez, was expected. "To a large extent, finding consensus is a measurement of leadership," he said. "Leadership is not just carrying a two-by-four."
 But even H. Carl McCall, who until his vote on Wednesday night had stood firmly behind the Chancellor, acknowledged "maybe some people did believe they were slapping him on the wrist."
 No doubt, a host of other factors also played a role, from personal irritation with the Chancellor's scornful comments about the board in a new autobiography, to the realities of politics in a mayoral election coming up next year, to the simple desire to put a multicultural curriculum in place. But the chief factor appeared to be disenchantment with what some saw as the Chancellor's overly autocratic manner.
 Mr. Fernandez's aides firmly deny charges about his leadership style, pointing out that they have struggled for more than a year and half to carry out a resolution of the central board itself to teach lessons that would stem episodes of bias in the city.
 The fact is that Mr. Fernandez's style has also served him well. After years of Board of Education lethargy in dealing with schoolwide corruption and incompetence, Mr. Fernandez came into office in January 1990 in a fevered burst of activity, dismissing three principals and a superintendent, superseding local boards seven times, and beginning a host of educational initiatives.
 
Needing Cross-Section Appeal
 But some school board members feel Mr. Fernandez has not sought to learn what would be tolerable to a broad cross-section of the city's parents like the more conservative blue-collar and Roman Catholic ones in Queens.
 The vote on Wednesday night represented a sea change in the board's attitude that holds ominous prospects for Mr. Fernandez's survival as Chancellor. In the last year, Mr. Fernandez had lost votes over the content of the curriculum on AIDS prevention, but always by 4-to-3 votes.
 What was particularly stunning on Wednesday night was that two of Mr. Fernandez's most stalwart supporters on AIDS instruction, Mr. McCall and Dr. Westina L. Matthews, voted against Dr. Fernandez. Even the third constant supporter of Mr. Fernandez, Dr. Luis O. Reyes, abstained.
 The central board gave the Chancellor the power to replace the local board with his own trustees on curricular matters should the local board not agree to mediation of the dispute, but it barred those trustees from imposing any curriculum unpalatable to the local board until it -- the central board -- decided the appeal.
 It thus seized for itself, and took away from the Chancellor, the power to resolve what kind of curriculum would be taught in District 24. The Chancellor could have lived with a switch from a suspension to a partial takeover, something Mr. Petrides and Carol A. Gresser, the board's Queens representative, had suggested earlier in the day.
 But he could not abide the evisceration of his powers that came out of a tangled three hours of closed-door debate on Wednesday night and Mr. McCall's desire to create a unanimous consensus behind any action.
 Mr. McCall is believed by his colleagues on the board to be interested in re-election as board president and could not attain that goal by remaining in the three-person minority on important votes like that on the Rainbow.
 His mentor, Mayor David N. Dinkins, is believed by some board members to have grown worried that an insistence on carrying out the Rainbow guide for children as young as first grade was alienating many Hispanic voters at a time he may be losing Jewish voters over his stands in Crown Heights.
 Mr. Dinkins was also said to be worried that the Rainbow fight was damaging his chances for obtaining long-craved legislation in Albany that would allow him a greater voice in the selection of Board of Education members.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Clinton Widens His Circle, Naming 4 Social Activists

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 11

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton today broadened the political and ideological profile of his emerging Administration, choosing three academics and an environmentalist known for strong advocacy of social causes.
A day after he turned to Washington and Wall Street for a notably mainstream economic team, Mr. Clinton today reappeared in the Old Statehouse here with a group of Washington outsiders that included three women. 
 Dr. Donna E. Shalala, the 51-year-old Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin, was chosen to be Secretary of Health and Human Services. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, 45, would become the first woman to head the Council of Economic Advisers. And Carol M. Browner, 36, who is a protegee of Vice President-elect Al Gore and who heads Florida's environmental agency, was chosen to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.
 
Choice for Labor Secretary
 Robert B. Reich, 46, a political scientist at Harvard University who has advised Mr. Clinton on economic matters, was selected to be Secretary of Labor.
Transition aides confirmed tonight that Mr. Clinton would announce Saturday that Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, would be the Secretary of Commerce, making Mr. Brown the first black appointee for the new Administration.
Mr. Clinton, announcing his newest selections today, said that "while Washington stagnated over the past decade, states and universities have often been laboratories of innovation."
"My appointees today come from the top ranks of a new generation of American leaders," he said. "We can't look to government programs to solve all of our problems. These appointees know the limits of what government can do, as well as what government must do."
 
Reflection of America
 The new appointments reflected some of the influence wielded by two of Mr. Clinton's closest advisers: his wife, Hillary, and Mr. Gore. They also represented a concerted effort by transition planners to demonstrate that people other than white men would hold top Cabinet positions.
"I think when you see the whole Cabinet, it will be genuinely reflective of this country in racial and gender terms, and it will be very exciting to the American people," Mr. Clinton said. "I named these four people today because we're ready to go with these four appointments, and because together they represent the kinds of experiences and ideas, and the sort of generational movement that I sought to bring to this campaign. But I don't -- I wouldn't read too much into it."
The ideological contrast between the selection of activist social policy theorists today and more mainstream economic officials on Thursday seems to square with Mr. Clinton's campaign promise to seek innovation in solutions to social problems like poverty, homelessness, education and pollution after 12 years of Republican laissez faire. By contrast, his choice of tax and budget experts to top economic posts on Thursday suggests an emphasis on carrying out an economic program that is already well formed.
 
Sensitive to Criticism
 But Clinton transition aides have said they have been sensitive to criticism that no members of minority groups are represented in their early selections.
The appointment Mr. Brown, who had been offered but rejected the job of Ambassador to the United Nations, would complete Mr. Clinton's economic team in advance of a two-day conference that is scheduled to begin Monday. He is a native of New York City.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown agreed on the job he would take during a conversation at the Governor's Mansion here today.
Mr. Brown was widely credited for helping Mr. Clinton win the Presidential election by helping to build coalitions among widely divergent groups of Democrats, and his appointment was seen as a reward for those efforts.
Mr. Brown, a Washington lawyer and former head of the Washington office of the National Urban League, headed Jesse L. Jackson's 1988 campaign and was the first black person to lead the Democratic Party. He would also be the first black Secretary of Commerce.
 
New Stress on Environment
 Mr. Clinton let slip some of this awareness of the symbolic intent of today's announcements when he asserted incorrectly that Ms. Browner would be the first woman to head the environmental agency and was quietly corrected by Mr. Gore. Anne Gorsuch Burford headed the agency under President Ronald Reagan.
Mr. Clinton, as well as Mr. Gore, who wrote a best-selling book on the environment, has said he will support legislation elevating the environmental agency to the level of Cabinet department.
Mr. Clinton also used his news conference today to try to clarify an apparent difference of opinion with his newly appointed budget chief, Representative Leon E. Panetta of California, over whether short-term relief for the middle-income taxpayer should take precedence over long-term deficit reduction.
 
Reducing the Deficit
 "In order for our changes to have credibility, they have to be accompanied by a serious deficit reduction plan and I think you know, in that sense, I think we're in total lock step," he said.
Mr. Panetta and the complete team of economic advisers, led by Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Mr. Clinton's choice for Treasury Secretary, will join the President-elect here next week for a two-day economic conference. Transition aides have said that they plan to use the meeting to solicit ideas on how to tackle the problems of the economy.
Mr. Clinton warned again today that there should not be too much optimism about an early economic recovery.
"A lot of those months where the unemployment rate was dropping, the employment rate was not going up," he said. "People were dropping out of the unemployment pool. I hardly call that a recovery."
Dr. Shalala, who succeeded Mrs. Clinton as chairwoman of the board of the Children's Defense Fund, an advocacy group, acknowledged her debt to Mrs. Clinton as she accepted the nomination.
"We have spent most of our adult lives, often together, working to get this nation to understand that our future is inextricably tied to the health, welfare and education of our children, and their families," Dr. Shalala said today. "As I join the Clinton administration, I want her to know how proud and excited I am to have the opportunity to continue our work."
Unlike her predecessor, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, Dr. Shalala is not a medical doctor. But she said today that her work in children's advocacy and her service on the board of the National Institutes of Health had prepared her for the job she would hold.
 
Jobs and Environment
 Perhaps acknowledging the problems Mr. Clinton has had with his own environmental record as Governor of Arkansas, Ms. Browner said today that she was looking forward to a time "when we will finally move away from the trade-off and the debate that we have focused on for far too long between jobs and the environment, toward a sustainable economic future."
In Florida, Ms. Browner managed the nation's third-largest state environmental agency with 1,500 employees and a budget of $650 million. Under Gov. Lawton Chiles, she was the state's leading advocate for halting the construction of new hazardous waste and municipal waste incinerators because of unanswered questions about the potential environmental and health dangers from the pollutants they sent into the air.
It is likely that seeking answers to those questions will be among the first priorities Ms. Browner faces at the environmental agency. Mr. Gore, who is expected to exert a strong influence over environmental policy in the new Administration, is also concerned about the proliferation of incinerators.
Mr. Reich's appointment to be Secretary of Labor signaled the liberal Democrats who have advised and supported Mr. Clinton that they would not be left out of the decision-making process. A graduate of Yale Law School and a former Rhodes Scholar, Mr. Reich will fill a post that has generally not been considered a part of the White House inner circle in previous Administrations. But Mr. Clinton said today that Mr. Reich's job would be considered a part of his economic team.
"I'm excited about this job, because there is the possibility of working with a President who understands the importance of investing in people as a means of achieving economic growth," Mr. Reich said.
During the campaign, Mr. Clinton often said job-training programs would be a central part of his plan to revitalize the economy. But he has also appointed Robert E. Rubin, the co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company to be his senior economic adviser, a new position.
With the addition today of Ms. Tyson, who holds an opposite view from Mr. Reich on matters of international trade, Mr. Clinton has expanded the number of people who will have his ear on economic issues and set up potential overlap and conflict within his economic team.
Ms. Tyson, who has gained a reputation of favoring greater restrictions on trade to energize the economy, said she viewed her role as leader of the council as a chance to expand the role of the advisory body beyond forming monetary policy.

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges Stronger U.S. Stand On Enforcing Bosnia Flight Ban

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton offered indirect criticism of President Bush's foreign policy today, nudging the Administration toward a new United Nations resolution enforcing the ban on Serbian flights over Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Mr. Clinton, who had been deliberately circumspect until today when asked his views on the international crises he will inherit from Mr. Bush, signaled that he would take a tougher approach toward the fighting in the Balkans. He said the United States and its allies should do whatever it takes, apparently including air strikes, to enforce the flight ban. 
 Mr. Clinton's comments, made during a news conference in Little Rock, Ark., to introduce new members of his Cabinet, came after an intensive review of the Balkan situation by his foreign policy advisers. They have argued privately for days that because of the inaction of the Bush Administration, which remains deeply divided over what to do in the former Yugoslavia, and because of the continued fighting, Mr. Clinton could not wait for Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, to make his position clear.
 
No Ground Troops Seen
 "I have been in favor of enforcing the no-fly zone for some time," Mr. Clinton said, adding that enforcement "can be done from the air without a commitment of ground troops." He added, "Anything we can do to turn up the heat a little there, to try to reduce the carnage, is worth trying."
Both Britain and France, whose forces are part of a United Nations peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia, have been reluctant to allow American planes to enforce the flight ban over Bosnia, fearing that the Serbs would retaliate against United Nations forces on the ground. But Mr. Clinton said there might be some softening of British and French opposition.
Mr. Clinton's statement today goes further than what he said at a news conference on Tuesday, when he expressed sympathy for Mr. Bush's unwillingness to commit American forces to a ground operation, but added, "There may be other things which can be done." Mr. Clinton declined to be more specific, saying only that he would review his options "at the appropriate time" and that he did not think he "should say more about specifics at this time."
 
Position in Campaign
 During the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton argued that the United States should take the lead in seeking United Nations authorization for air strikes to protect the effort to deliver food and medicine to victims of the fighting in Bosnia and should consider whether to push for lifting the United Nations arms embargo that some contend unfairly hurts the Bosnians.
But until today, both external and internal factors had constrained him from outlining his solutions for any of the international problems he will inherit.
Mr. Clinton has said since the election that he would not compete with Mr. Bush's foreign policy during the transition period. He has also been determined to remain focused on the economy, but has acknowledged -- with more than a hint of frustration -- that he will have to spend more time on foreign affairs than he wants to.
 
No Policy Team Yet
 Finally, he has yet to put his foreign policy team in place, which has meant that there is no one in authority to help formulate policy and explain what he means when he does not want to do that himself.
Mr. Clinton's remarks today could put pressure on the Bush Administration, which has concluded that Serbia is routinely violating the United Nations ban on flights over Bosnia, to decide whether or not to initiate a United Nations enforcement resolution. They also put President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia on notice that the new Administration may not permit his policies in Bosnia to go unpunished.
Mr. Clinton may also be seeking to regain control of the debate over Bosnia from former Republican policymakers -- notably former President Ronald Reagan and former Secretaries of State Henry A. Kissinger and George P. Shultz -- who have called for swift, selective military action against the Serbs.
This week, Mr. Shultz, in a rare criticism of the Bush Administration, urged the United States to use force to stop the Serbian "ethnic cleansing" of Bosnia and punish Serbian war crimes. The normally cautious former Secretary of State even advised his hosts on the "Macneil-Lehrer News Hour" to run footage of World War II Nazi concentration camps the next time they broadcast a program on Bosnia. "The message is the same," he said.
Mr. Clinton already knows he will inherit an American military commitment in Somalia, which his advisers fear could raise expectations that he may respond with similar, decisive action in Bosnia. "You can't move on Somalia without having pangs of conscience about Bosnia," a senior aide to Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Clinton's remarks are also consistent with his stated desire for a "disciplined, aggressive," preventive approach to foreign policy to help head off global crises before they boil over and monopolize his time.
The Bush Administration is divided over whether to press for a United Nations resolution authorizing force to stop the Serbian flights, senior Administration officials said today.
The State Department, which favors quick action, had hoped to resolve the issue this week, so the Security Council could begin discussions before Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger meets with European and Arab foreign ministers in Geneva next week to discuss the Balkan situation.
 
Pentagon Is Opposed
 But the Pentagon has argued that until there is clear evidence that the Serbs are using their warplanes and helicopters in combat missions, there is no need for such strong action, officials said.
The Administration debate is reflected in a classified paper that discusses the consequences of enforcing the ban, officials said. The paper argues at one point that the lack of enforcement has made the ban meaningless and may embolden the Serbs to spread the war to the Kosovo region, which has been stripped of its autonomy by Serbia. But it also says the imposition of the Security Council ban has sharply decreased the number of flights over Bosnia and apparently stopped the bombing and strafing of villages in the former Yugoslav republics.
Aides to Mr. Clinton said in interviews that the United States had missed opportunities to curb fighting in the Balkans, and that American options were more limited than they would have been a year ago. But they added that his remarks today were not meant to be critical of the Administration or to push it to initiate an enforcement resolution in the Security Council.
Rather, one senior aide said, Mr. Clinton "is seriously concerned about the situation both with respect to continuing risk in Bosnia as winter approaches and the risk of a wider conflict if the Serbs act against Kosovo," the autonomous region with a largely Albanian population. "He understands it is something he will have to deal with when he becomes President."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
NATO Willing to Intervene
 PARIS, Dec. 11 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Secretary General of NATO, Manfred Worner, said today that the alliance was prepared to intervene in the former Yugoslavia if requested by the United Nations, adding that contingency plans for a military operation were under review.
But the United States Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney, speaking at the end of a meeting in Brussels of NATO Defense Ministers, said Washington remained opposed to committing ground troops unless the objectives were clearly defined. He also urged NATO to admit some East European countries as members to confront security problems in the former Communist bloc more effectively.
Mr. Worner, while stressing that the United Nations should continue to have the leading role in responding to the Balkan crisis, said NATO was ready to act. "I have no doubt that, if asked by the United Nations, the alliance would do what is necessary," he declared.
Contingency plans have been drawn up, Mr. Worner said, declining to elaborate. Later, he told the BBC that he believed that the time had come for military intervention, although the consequences for United Nations relief forces already in the Balkans would have to be reviewed carefully.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
U.N. Sending 700 to Macedonia
 UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 11 (Special to The New York Times) -- The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously today to send some 700 peacekeepers to Macedonia in an attempt to prevent hostilities from spreading into that former Yugoslavian republic.
The decision represents the first time the Security Council has deployed peacekeepers for preventive purposes, with the aim of stopping an eruption of violence before it has begun.
Few countries recognize Macedonia, which has also not yet been admitted to the United Nations because of a quarrel with Greece, which wants it to change its name.
But there are fears that the fighting in Bosnia could spread to Macedonia, which has a large Muslim minority of Albanian descent.

HEADLINE: Big Jumps Are Posted For Sales

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Reinvigorated shoppers drove up retail sales in November for the fifth straight month and spent at a much faster pace in October than previously estimated, the Government said today.
Analysts said the sales figures indicated that the economic recovery -- now more properly called an expansion, since ground lost during the recession has been totally recovered by most measures -- continued to gather momentum. 
 Other figures released today showed a hefty rise in average weekly earnings last month and another jump in consumer confidence in early December. Consumer prices, meanwhile, remained subdued.
 "This is a long awaited and long overdue revival," said James E. Annable, chief economist for the First National Bank of Chicago. He was referring mainly to the sharp increases in retail sales, an area that accounts for a third of the economy.
The November sales rise was four-tenths of a percent, but this was after an already substantial gain for October, of nine-tenths of a percent, was revised upward to 1.9 percent. This made October the strongest month since January, which began with a fractional advance but finished with a jump of 2.3 percent.
 
 
Average Earnings Up 0.9%
 At $165.8 billion, last month's retail sales were 7.7 percent above those of November 1991, without any adjustment for inflation or for, in some cases, price declines.
 In another report, the Labor Department said today that average weekly earnings rose nine-tenths of a percent last month, reflecting a longer workweek coupled with a rise in hourly pay. But those gains were partly offset by a rise of two-tenths of a percent in consumer prices for November.
 Consumer confidence, as surveyed by the University of Michigan, jumped to 91.4 for the first two weeks of December, from 85.3 for November. Assessments of current conditions eased slightly, but expectations about the economic future, a component of the Government's principal forecasting index, soared more than 11 points, to 89.6, according to Wall Street subscribers to the survey.
The bond market, sensitive to any hint of inflation that might accompany a stronger economy, took the figures in stride. Analysts said this seemed to be still another instance in which the market saw an economic rebound as diminishing the chances that the Clinton Administration would offer an overly stimulative fiscal program.
But even as various analysts scrambled to raise estimates of fourth-quarter growth in the gross domestic product -- the consensus 2 percent pace appeared headed for 2.5 percent, or 3 -- one big question was left with no clear answer: What are consumers using to pay their bills in what has become a spending spree?
To be sure, job growth and income growth have resumed, but not by enough to support such a rapid pace of consumer spending, which rose in the third quarter at a 3.7 percent annual rate and was accompanied by a sharp decline in the rate of savings, to 4.5 percent of disposable personal income, from 5.3 percent.
 
 
Borrowing on the Rise
 And there is evidence from two straight months of rising installment debt that consumers -- many of whom have refinanced homes or are benefiting from automatic interest-rate reductions in adjustable mortgages -- are again willing to step up their borrowing. In addition, Mr. Annable said his bank's credit-card sales were "exceptionally strong," rising at double-digit rates.
But numerous economists, like Edward Yardeni of C. J. Lawrence, said they remained puzzled. "Something's wrong with this picture," Mr. Yardeni said. "Things just don't add up."
Among the possibilities analysts raised were that there may be more jobs being created than are being picked up by Government surveys, that severance pay and other nontraditional income is greater than realized, or that the hurricanes that struck Florida, Louisiana and Hawaii had a greater impact in creating rebuilding activity than had been assumed.
 
 
Buyers May Be Raiding Savings
 It is also possible, some say, that consumers are further drawing down their savings, reflecting a perhaps irrational amount of optimism arising from the November elections.
"But however it's being financed, it's apparently really happening," Mr. Annable said of the sales gain, although some early December figures have been less buoyant than those of a month earlier.
 Today's retail report showed that sales of durable goods rose five-tenths of a percent and that sales in the larger category of nondurables increased three-tenths of a percent. When the automotive sector is excluded, the overall gain was three-tenths of a percent.
Among durables, increases of 1.7 percent for stores selling furniture and other equipment and six-tenths of a percent for automotive dealers were partly offset by a 1.7 percent decline for stores selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes.
 
 
Department Stores Gain
 In nondurables, there were gains of nine-tenths of a percent for department stores, seven-tenths for food stores, three-tenths for apparel and accessory stores, and one-tenth at gasoline stations.
Spending at restaurants and bars, which was revised sharply higher in October, edged down a tenth of a percent last month while spending in drug and proprietary stores was unchanged.
Compared with November 1991, automotive sales were running 13 percent ahead while furniture and apparel sales were each up 11 percent.
"There's a lot of thrust in the consumer sector," said Gary Ciminero, chief economist for the Fleet Financial Group in Providence. But he said he was avoiding raising his estimate of gross domestic product for the current quarter because he considered it likely that growth in the July-September quarter would be revised above the 3.9 percent already posted.

HEADLINE: Challenger Steps Up Attack on Serbian Leader

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NIS, Yugoslavia, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Promising peace and prosperity, the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia brought his campaign to oust Serbia's hard-line nationalist President to this republic's industrial heartland today, trying to build support in a onetime stronghold of the President that has been laid waste by economic decline and international sanctions.
"There has been enough destruction, enough death, enough impoverishment," the Prime Minister, Milan Panic, told several thousand enthusiastic and mostly young supporters at a rally darkened by cold fog. "No longer, at the end of the 20th century, can cannon be used to solve problems." 
 "This is a rich land, and someone has made it poor," Mr. Panic said, attacking the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic. "This is not a struggle between two men, but between two systems. We're here to build."
The crowd roared as Mr. Panic jabbed at the Communists who run this dreary industrial town. He was born in Serbia but immigrated to the United States 35 years ago, returning to accept his current post this summer.
 
Election on Dec. 20
 The Dec. 20 election contest has sundered Serbian society, dividing people who see Mr. Panic as a traitor for opposing Serbian aggression in other former Yugoslav republics from those who see him as a potential savior from the international economic sanctions that were slapped on Serbia.
Mr. Panic, who made a fortune in the American pharmaceutical industry, returned in July to become Yugoslavia's Prime Minister at the invitation of Mr. Milosevic and the federal President, Dobrica Cosic.
Mr. Milosevic's strategy was to use Mr. Panic in an effort to persuade world leaders to lift the economic sanctions. The United Nations Security Council holds the new Yugoslavia responsible for militarily aiding Bosnia and Herzegovina's Serbs in their territorial conquests and forced expulsions of hundreds of thousands of Muslims.
But in the five months since Mr. Panic arrived, during which he narrowly survived two parliamentary votes of confidence, he has attacked Mr. Milosevic for stalling free elections and refusing to relinquish control of the country's major news outlets.
 
His First Such Tour
 The present campaign tour is Mr. Panic's first attempt at building up grass-roots support in Serbia. The latest polling results show the Prime Minister with a slight lead in the race, but more than 15 percent of people surveyed said they were undecided.
 
Support for Milosevic
 Milosevic supporters at the fringe of today's rally showed the antipathy that Mr. Panic faces.
"Mr. Panic has traveled the world but done nothing for his people," said a 71-year-old former salesman, Petar Radenkovic. "He is the worst kind of livestock."
Mr. Radenkovic angrily added: "He is Bush's agent and thinks only about his foreign masters and his business. He wants to sell Serbia out."
Ljubisa Petkovic, a 26-year-old water-works employee, said: "The West wants to take off Milosevic's head because he is wise and will not compromise. The Serbs have given many lives for this piece of land, and we will give many more if we have to."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Clinton's Choice of Reich Hints at a Stepped-Up Role for Labor Department

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton's choice for Labor Secretary, Robert B. Reich, brings a detailed and perhaps controversial agenda to an agency that has long been an administrative backwater.
Mr. Reich's torrent of writings over the last decade makes clear that he will bring a commitment to the notion that America's work force can be made more productive through Government job-training and education programs. 
 He wants to provide apprenticeships for high school graduates who do not go to college; he hopes to require companies to provide more training for workers on the shop floor, and he wants to improve productivity through better labor-management relations.
 
Shades of Frances Perkins
 Thanks to his formidable energy and close friendship with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Reich could well become the most visible Labor Secretary since Frances Perkins, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's trailblazing Labor Secretary, who played a leading role in creating the Social Security and unemployment insurance systems.
Those who keep track of who is up and who is down in Washington took note today when the President-elect, in announcing four appointments, called Mr. Reich "one of my most trusted advisers and closest friends." Indeed, parts of Mr. Clinton's "Putting People First" economic program read like excerpts from one of Mr. Reich's many books. Mr. Reich is the director of the Clinton economic transition team and is a lecturer on public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
In his brief remarks today Mr. Clinton signaled his intellectual debt to Mr. Reich, saying he did not know of any American who had "done more to make the case for the need to invest in the skills and the training of our people than Bob has." The President-elect suggested a stepped-up role for the Labor Department, saying, "The position of Secretary of Labor is a vital part of my economic team because investing in the skills and training of our work force is central to our strategy for economic growth."
Mr. Reich's charge appears to be different from that of his predecessors; as the nation feels the heat of foreign competition, he is to help push new ideas for improving the work force. Several of his predecessors, especially John T. Dunlop under President Gerald R. Ford, were there for their mediating skills, while others, like Peter J. Brennan under President Richard M. Nixon, were there as bridges to the labor movement.
The last activist in the job was President Jimmy Carter's Labor Secretary, F. Ray Marshall, who focused on one of the biggest needs of the 1970's: providing jobs and training for the hard-core unemployed in the inner cities. Mr. Reich brings a 1990's focus: improving education and training for all workers.
Mr. Marshall said: "The reason the focus has changed was that if you asked experts in the 70's who had the best-educated, best-trained work force in the world, they'd say the United States. If you asked that today, I don't know anybody who'd say the U.S. has the best-educated work force."
In his book "The Work of Nations," published last year by Alfred A. Knopf Inc., Mr. Reich sketched a vision of a new world economy in which companies have no loyalty to their native countries and cavalierly move factories and jobs anywhere on the globe. The book asserts that the primary way the United States can keep and attract high-paying jobs is by improving the quality of the work force and the infrastructure, including improved telecommunications and safer, cleaner cities.
Mr. Reich had been on the short list to be the incoming President's senior economic adviser, some Clinton advisers said, but he balked at the job, seeing it as one for a neutral policy coordinator rather than a highly opinionated generator of ideas like himself.
Several aides said Mr. Reich also hoped to become chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, but was hindered because he has a law degree rather than a doctorate in economics.
While Mr. Reich may be regarded as an unorthodox choice for Labor Secretary, aides said he was nominated because Mr. Clinton wanted his valued friend and adviser at his side as he tries to get the economy back on track.

HEADLINE: Macy Reports a Narrower Loss in Quarter

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Losses at R. H. Macy & Company narrowed in the first quarter of its 1993 fiscal year, the bankrupt retailer reported yesterday. It added that holiday sales were running ahead of last year and slightly ahead of plan, but the company said it remained cautious.
For the quarter that ended on Oct. 31, Macy reported a loss of $135.8 million on sales of $1.5 billion, compared with a loss of $155.3 million on sales of $1.6 billion in the corresponding period a year ago. The first quarter of 1992 included sales at stores that have since been closed. 
 Excluding the effect of stores that have been closed, Macy said comparable-store sales fell by 5.7 percent in the quarter that ended on Oct. 31.
 
A 'Difficult' Quarter
 "We knew the October quarter would be difficult," Myron E. Ullman 3d, co-chairman and co-chief executive, said in a telephone interview.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a figure analysts of highly indebted companies watch closely, were $13.38 million, an amount Macy said was in line with expectations and that exceeded the minimum specified in bank loan covenants.
The company said borrowings from its $600 million debtor-in-possession financing were $124 million below expectations. Macy said it intended to repay all of its seasonal borrowings next week. The loans are used to pay for merchandise, utility bills, wages and salaries.
The credit line is being supplied by a bank group led by the Chemical Banking Corporation and the Bankers Trust New York Company.
Macy officials were guardedly optimistic about the important Christmas season.
In a statement announcing the results, Mr. Ullman and Mark S. Handler, co-chairman and co-chief executive, said: "Since Thanksgiving and the start of the holiday shopping season, we have seen an increase in store traffic. This has led to somewhat stronger-than-expected sales, particularly in Florida and Georgia."
But the executives said that economic conditions remained weak in California and the Northeast, areas where many Macy's stores are situated.
"For that reason, we continue to be cautious about the overall results for the holiday season," they said.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Ullman said that in addition to Florida and Georgia, "business looks very good in New York City and Washington, D.C." He said conditions in California were "very poor."
In New York, Christmas sales ofMacy's flagship store at Herald Square have been particularly strong, Mr. Ullman said, but added, "We planned very conservatively for this Christmas."
 "In terms of our ability to return to profitability, Christmas 1993 will be a much better barometer," he said.
Reflecting this year's conservative approach, Macy said inventories continued to be tightly managed, which analysts said should allow the company to avoid heavy price markdowns during the Christmas rush.
"Everybody has been playing it pretty close to the vest in terms of inventories," said Jan L. Dillow, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. "That means you have a chance to bolster your profit margins. But I am not sure that Macy's will participate to the same extent as other retailers in a stronger Christmas."
Macy, whose executives confidently took on billions in debt in the late 1980's, filed for bankruptcy protection last Jan. 27.

HEADLINE: Environmental Truce Clears Smoke in Rice Fields

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RICHVALE, Calif., Dec. 4

 BODY:
It is nearly winter in the wide, fertile valley of the Sacramento River in Northern California, a time when the poplars and willows turn golden and the rice farmers normally send up a ghastly pall of smoke over the valley as they burn the stubble of last season's crop.
But it will be different this winter. More and more farmers, with the blessing of state and Federal water officials and environmentalists alike, will get rid of their stubble not with fire but with water, flooding their fields to rot the remaining straw. 
 That this is happening is the result of an extraordinary truce in the environmental wars. Under the truce, the farmers get an environmentally benign way to clear their fields and relief from bad publicity and the environmentalists get new wetlands for migrating waterfowl. Everybody, it seems, wins.
 
Some Strange Bedfellows
 On this day a cast of strange bedfellows crowded into the board room of the Lundberg Family Farms, rice growers for more than half a century. There were Dennis B. Underwood, the Commissioner of Reclamation; leaders of the rice industry; representatives of leaders of duck and waterfowl groups; the Nature Conservancy, and environmentalists.
Most notable among the environmentalists gathered here was Marc Reisner, who in 1986 wrote "Cadillac Desert," a history of water use and misuse in the West, and has long accused rice farmers of wasting Government-subsidized water by growing a monsoon crop in the desert that is California.
But Mr. Reisner now calls the rice growers "the most progressive" of California's agricultural interests on environmental issues. "I am in the awkward position of being pals with my former enemies," he said.
The group had assembled to unveil a three-year pilot project by which about 12,000 acres of rice fields are being flooded to test its effect. If it works, it is expected that about 200,000 acres of new winter wetlands can be created.
The fields are already attracting great flocks of Canada geese, swans and mallards, whose numbers have dwindled because 95 percent of California's wetlands have been turned into farm land or residential tracts. The Sacramento Valley is the main wintering habitat along the Pacific Flyway, the migratory route that extends from the Arctic to Central America.
The participants in the project, called the Ricelands Habitat Venture, are the Nature Conservancy, the California Rice Industry Association, Ducks Unlimited, the National Audubon Society, the California Waterfowl Association and Mr. Reisner. Under the plan, the fields are to be flooded from December through February, a time when they are fallow anyway and when the birds come south for the winter.
Conservationists have long talked about cooperating with their opponents in industry and agriculture to reverse environmental degradation, but the rice truce is one of the few successes.
Mr. Underwood, who heads the Bureau of Reclamation, a Federal agency that is part of the Department of the Interior, called the truce a "fabulous marriage" in which economic and environmental values alike are promoted, at little financial cost.
The bureau, which operates the largest water supply system in California, is contributing $300,000 in matching funds for research and 5,000 acre-feet of water for the test. An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, or about enough to supply two typical households for one year.
What makes the rice project so unusual is that it allows the rice farmers, who have been criticized by Mr. Reisner and others for using too much water, to use even more.
 
A Crucial Question
 But a crucial question remains: Will there be enough water for the winter flooding, given that state hydrologists recently predicted a seventh consecutive year of drought? Ideally, with a normal rainfall, the flooding would be done in the fall and winter when the rivers are swollen, then the fields would be drained in mid-February after the stubble had decomposed and the birds had started north again.
While rice is not a major part of California's agricultural economy, it is the main crop here in Butte, Colusa and Sutter counties, where the adobe clay soil permits little water to percolate down. Nearly 500,000 acres a year are planted, with a cash value of about $250 million.
The crop is planted in April and May and harvested in September and October, after which the remaining straw is usually burned before replanting in the spring. But a new state law requires the farmers to end most burning by 1998, and that deadline has pressured them to come to terms with opponents of the rice industry.
Mr. Reisner said the "peace offensive" began two and a half years ago, when the rice industry invited him for a "good will" tour. He has since been retained by the Nature Conservancy to work out the pilot program.
In fact, environmentalists have taken a new view about the value of rice farming. Although it requires inordinate amounts of scarce water, the 300 pounds an acre of grain left after the harvest provides ideal food for migrating birds, according to Frederic A. Reid, a biologist with the Western regional office of Ducks Unlimited, a wetlands conservation group.
 
Added Storage Capacity
 The project also has another potential advantage: the flooded fields will add to the region's capacity to store water during the wet months without building costly dams and reservoirs.
According to Douglas P. Wheeler, Gov. Pete Wilson's Secretary for Resources, the program may serve as a national model for resolving environmental conflicts. "This has made allies out of former enemies," he said. "It is a model that we have not seen before in which each of the participants can be so well rewarded."
Some farmers are skeptical about flooding as an alternative to burning. But Doug McGeoghegan of Maxwell, Calif., a farmer in Colusa County who has been flooding his fields for years, says his yields are just as good as those on burned fields. And Gordon L. Brewster, manager of the 3,200-acre Lundberg farms, which have not burned straw since 1960, called flooding "most effective" as long as there is rain.
For their part, the chief concern of environmentalists is the flooding's potential effect on endangered species of fish. The Sacramento River is the spawning ground of endangered fish like the winter-run and spring-run chinook salmon. Mr. Reisner says the "most worrisome" aspect of the project is that water diverted from the river to the rice fields will further damage the spawning grounds.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
An Unorthodox Choice For Economic Adviser

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The new chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, is a decidedly unorthodox choice. And least of all because she is the first woman to head the council since it was created just after World War II.
The head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers has historically been the most mainstream of mainstream economists, hewing to an economic middleground. Yet Professor Tyson, a prolific author who is 45 and has a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says the United States is "teetering on the abyss of economic decline." She is almost certainly the first person to head the council who believes that managed trade is often preferable to free trade and that industrial policy works. 
 "It shows that the Clinton Administration is really trying to listen to someone with new ideas, someone with global views on the economy," said Lawrence B. Katz, an economist at Harvard University. "It's forward looking."
 
Focus on Economy
 Of course, Mr. Clinton has brought the economy to center stage for the first time in a long while, and the President-elect has set up a new structure, an economic coordinating council that will be over the Council of Economic Advisers in the White House hierarchy.
Professor Tyson, whose original specialty was the economics of planning, Eastern European style, outlined her views in a new book, "Who's Bashing Whom: Trade Conflict in High Technology Industries" (Institute for International Economics, 1992). In it, she contends that the nation with the initial edge in an important industry, whether camcorders or computer chips, often keeps that edge.
In her book, she strongly advocates using Government policy to make sure the United States gets this economic edge: subsidies to industries that are developing new technologies, especially if other governments are doing the same; tougher trade tactics, and channeling money into commercial research. The point is to hang onto high-wage manufacturing jobs.
But as chairwoman of the council, she is most likely to be asked immediately to make several judgments about the domestic economy. First, whether the economic expansion is weak enough to warrant short-term stimulus. And, second, how different strategies to reduce the deficit would affect the economy.
 
Not Worried About Deficit
 On such issues , Professor Tyson's views are not as widely known.
She does, in principle, support short-term stimulus to get the economy moving and has recently expressed the view that there is no necessary connection between the Federal deficit and economic health. "It's not the most important issue," she has written. And, she has does not fear that much higher taxes on the richest Americans will stifle economic growth.
"In direct contradiction to 12 years of Republican ideology, there is no relationship between the level of taxes a nation pays and its economic performance," she said in The Los Angeles Times, where she is a regular columnist.
Such positions are controversial. But what is beginning to draw attention is her longstanding relationships with Silicon Valley companies that stand to benefit from the policies she advocates.
The Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy, which Professor Tyson has helped found in the early 1980's and now serves as a co-director, is a trade and technology research institute at the University of California that has received research money both from individual companies and trade organizations.
 
Attuned to Clinton
 Some wonder whether Professor Tyson's influence in the Administration may be too limited to fuss about. Such doubts may be premature, however, in large part because it ignores how compatible Professor Tyson's brand of Democratic supply-side economics and her approach are with those of the President-elect.
"The role of the chairman depends very much on what the President wants," said Herbert Stein, who served as President Nixon's chief economic adviser. "Alan Greenspan was an important C.E.A. chairman because he and Gerald Ford used to watch football together."
Consider the Professor Tyson's initial meeting with Governor Clinton last August when she and four other economists were invited to come and talk about the economy for two and a half hours. The least academically distinguished of the group, which also included a Nobel laureate, James Tobin, as well Lawrence Summers of the World Bank, Alan Blinder of Princeton and Paul Krugman of M.I.T., she nonetheless stole the show.
"She really shone," Professor Krugman said. "It would be a mistake to underestimate her."
"There are no curlicues and exfoliations of intricate details," said Erik Tarloff, her husband and a Hollywood screenwriter and novelist, "but she manages to abstract the most important issues and she has a really impressive intuitive grasp of the way that economic policies affect real people."
Besides, her husband points out, she's a mystery addict. Just like the President-elect.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Trading in Dollar Is Mixed As Pressure Builds in Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday in foreign exchange trading, as the market was jarred by new uncertainty in the European currency system.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $335.20 an ounce, up $1.10 from Thursday. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $335.10, up $1.20. 
 Traders said the renewed pressure on Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism, which sets limits for the fluctuation of member currencies, was intensified by Germany's announcement on Thursday that it would not lower interest rates. Germany's high rates have made the mark an attractive investment, prompting speculators to sell other currencies and stock up on marks despite worries about the German economy.
The European Community summit meeting in Edinburgh, Scotland, also caused uncertainty in the markets.
Dealers said trading was active, with Germany's central bank confirming its support of the French currency by purchasing the franc against the mark.
Norway's decision on Thursday to let its crown float freely against other currencies caused more turbulence.

HEADLINE: Climbing His Way Back, With Help From Neediest

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
One day Larry K. was wearing expensive suits, hatching deals for a prominent brokerage firm and dating a woman he loved. The next day he woke up in a mental hospital and his life began a seven-year plunge that left him an angry and confused man cut off from family and friends.
After that first breakdown, he wandered the country for years, working at menial jobs as a series of doctors tried to treat him. "It was a tough time," he recalled the other day. "I fought with everybody and I was always wrapped up in my head. I was a total basket case." 
 Doctors finally diagnosed manic-depression in 1988 and he began taking lithium, which cured him of the worst symptoms. Now, at the age of 43, he is struggling to start over with help from Metro-House, a shelter financed in part by United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, a charity aided by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
 
'I Don't Have to Worry'
 Metro-House, which opened earlier this year, assists mentally ill people who are trying to fit back into society after leaving hospitals. About 40 men and women live at the transitional shelter at 117 West 70th Street in Manhattan, which is run by the Metropolitan New York Coordinating Council on Jewish Poverty.
Metro-House provides Larry K. with a room and meals while he searches for his first stable job in more than a decade. When he feels nervous about his return to the workaday world, he can seek out counselors there for advice and support.
"I'm constantly getting better now," he said. "This place has been very helpful. It gives me a place to stay, so I don't have to worry."
This year's Neediest appeal, the 81st, comes during a relentless recession in New York City that has heaped added burdens on charities like U.J.A.-Federation. Many are trying to aid growing numbers of the newly unemployed while also caring for people like Larry K.
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund was born in 1911, when Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The Times, decided that his readers would be eager to improve their city if they only knew about the poverty around them. The 1992-93 campaign ends on Feb. 28.
The Times pays for the fund's overhead, so all contributions are given directly to the seven charities, which must rely more and more on private donations because of strained budgets and reduced government help.
Now that his illness is under control, Larry K. wants to find a job at a brokerage, even though he would have to start slowly and could not put in the long hours he was accustomed to before his first breakdown.
"I loved that work and I was good at it," he said. "I feel like I have the chance to pick up with the rest of my life. This has been a very difficult and trying period. But now I feel good. I get along with people. My head is clear. I feel like I've gotten a new lease on life."

HEADLINE: Tapping the Rich May Prove Tricky

SERIES: Tax Politics: Second of four articles

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
As Bill Clinton's new economic team considers how best to turn his campaign promises on taxes into legislative proposals, it may feel the ground shifting.
His campaign tossed around a host of proposals on Government financing, from spending cuts to getting more tax revenue from corporations and individuals, all aimed at getting the resources to accomplish goals ranging from middle-class tax relief to public works to halving the deficit. But the consensus among experts was that many of the proposals were unrealistic, and that the proposal most likely to yield significant new money was tax increases on the wealthiest taxpayers. 
 Getting the really rich -- the people who reaped an outsize share of the economic gains of the 1980's -- to pay more was a major plank of the Democratic campaign. For Clinton tax purposes, a couple with income of $200,000 and a single taxpayer with $150,000 count as rich.
 
Likely to Fall Short
 The problem is that while higher tax rates on high incomes are likely to provide a good deal of new money, they are not likely, barring an unexpectedly buoyant economy, to generate the $92 billion over four years that the Clinton camp has claimed.
Many experts had been skeptical of that claim from the start. Congressional Budget Office estimates put the added revenue at a maximum of $80 billion over four years and estimates from Treasury officials and the Republican side of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress are even lower.
But even as long-term deficit projections are looking gloomier, so also is the outlook for collecting as much from the rich as had been projected even in the lower estimates.
Perhaps the biggest consideration is one raised in a new study of how very rich taxpayers react to higher taxes. The study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, strongly suggests that extremely rich people -- the top slice of the top 1 percent of taxpayers -- have considerable flexibility to expose less of their income to taxation.
Just how much flexibility they have has recently become apparent. Those who can have raced to take bonuses now rather than next year, to cash in stock options -- as Michael Eisner, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company did -- and to move income forward in any way possible.
Economists have long known this type of behavior takes place, and there are some, like Lawrence Lindsey, a Federal Reserve governor, who suggest that it was a big factor in accounting for the sizable growth in income among the very rich in the 1980's as tax rates came down.
What the new study by James Poterba at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Daniel Feenberg at the National Bureau of Economic Research, suggests, however, is that it may have been an even bigger factor than many believed -- and may be a big obstacle now to raising revenues from the rich.
"If there's a significant change in rates, say from 31 percent to 41 percent, people will change their behavior to take advantage of ways to defer income," Professor Poterba said. "It would set into motion a return to pre-1986 tax shelters."
Another reason for thinking that the rich will yield less revenue than Clinton tax planners had hoped is that the rich may not possess as many riches as they used to. The latest Internal Revenue Service summary of tax returns, for 1989, released this year, shows that many high fliers -- real estate empire builders, retailers and newly redundant executives -- had their wings clipped during the last four years of economic drift.
The number of taxpayers reporting pretax income of $1 million or more dropped from 62,000 in 1988 to 58,000 in 1989, and their share of total income shrank from 5.5 percent to 4.7 percent. What is more, their income in excess of $1 million, which would be subject to a surcharge under the Clinton plan, dropped 13 percent in 1989.
 
$200,000 Threshold For the Rich
 Under the Clinton campaign tax proposals, the top tax rate would jump to 36 percent from 31 percent for people with gross pretax incomes of $200,000 or more. The plan would also impose a 3.6 percentage point surtax on incomes of $1 million or more, making their top rate 39.6 percent. It would also stiffen the alternative minimum tax, enacted a decade or so ago to wring dollars from taxpayers with big write-offs.
Some temporary provisions of the 1990 budget pact lifted the top marginal rate about a percentage point above the 31 percent already on the books, so the proposed increase would expose wealthy lawyers, rock stars and entrepreneurs to a rate just above 40 percent on their incomes of more than a million dollars. While still well below the 50 percent top rate during the first Reagan term and still on the low end of the spectrum for industrial countries, economists say such a rise is far from trivial.
"Higher rates always have incentive effects on work and saving," said Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan. He added, however, that the negative impact on such decisions is not nearly as high as the Reagan-era tax-cutters argued.
Under the Clinton plan, the effective rate paid by the very rich -- the average share of income that is actually paid in taxes -- is also apt to climb a couple of percentage points, from about 22 percent now back to the 25 percent rate of the Carter years.
 
Capital Gains Factor Could Skew Results
 Yet another factor that could lead to a smaller-than-expected increase in tax revenues from the very rich is the prospect that the Clinton Administration may opt not to raise the capital gains tax rate in tandem with the top tax brackets. Capital gains account for nearly half of the income of taxpayers in the $1 million-plus category and one-third for those with incomes between $200,000 and $1 million. As long as capital gains are taxed at a substantially lower rate than ordinary income, the richest taxpayers will have a strong incentive to convert ordinary income into capital gains income.
"It doesn't take a genius to see what the result would be," Harry L. Gutman, chief of staff of the Joint Economic Committee, recently told an audience of accountants.
And the early assumptions of the Clinton team could also be shaken by the sharp turn for the worse in the prospects for reducing the Federal deficit. In the spring, when "Putting People First," the Clinton campaign's economic manifesto, was drafted, the Congressional Budget Office was optimistically predicting that the 1990 budget pact would tame the deficit monster. Using those projections, the Clinton team could contend that the deficit would fall by half without imposing much pain on the middle class.
Now, however, Mr. Clinton's strategists must find roughly $100 billion a year through permanent tax increases or spending cuts to fulfill his deficit-shrinking pledge. The latest Congressional Budget Office projections suggest that if the economy and policy follow current projections the annual deficit will still be more than $250 billion in 1996 and rising fast.
 
Middle-Class Relief Has Its Doubters
 Where does that leave the middle-class tax cut? Robert Reich and other spokesmen for the President-elect keep insisting that the middle class -- which accounts for three-fourths of total taxpayer income -- deserves tax relief. But the consensus view among economists is that the Clinton Administration will have to prune the proposal radically or even drop it altogether merely to avoid inflating the deficit further.
"Even without the middle-class tax cut, the plan is mildly deficit-increasing." said Paul R. Krugman, an M.I.T. economist. "It would be nice to get a sense from Little Rock that there are some hard choices being made."
Mr. Clinton said again yesterday that he would not back off from a middle-class tax cut, even though increasing numbers of experts say that the stimulus of a tax cut may not be needed since the economy has recently shown some healthy signs. But Mr. Clinton said a tax cut was a matter of "fairness," because in his view the middle class has borne too large a share of the tax burden.
Actually, Mr. Clinton made two proposals during the campaign. One was to grant $60 billion of relief to middle-class taxpayers, that is those with incomes under $80,000 for a couple. Such relief, spread over 60 million taxpayers, would amount to $300 a child, $200 for couples without children and $100 for singles.
The second proposal, really a part of Mr. Clinton's welfare reform program, is to raise the reward of working by expanding the popular earned-income tax credit for poor workers with children. Estimated costs are $2 billion to $3 billion a year.
Taken together, the two changes, if carried out on this scale, would swallow up the revenue raised from the rich and then some.
 
Uncertain Outlook For Merely Affluent
 Despite a blanket promise not to raise the tax rates of anyone but the really rich, some question whether Mr. Clinton will be able to spare entirely the 5.6 million merely affluent taxpayers, those with incomes between $80,000 and $200,000. That group commands some $600 billion in pretax income, even more in the aggregate than the over-$200,000 crowd.
There is also no explicit promise that his plans to get more revenue will be limited to raising top income-tax rates. Limiting the mortgage deduction or taxing fringe benefits could cast a wide net and bring in big money; such steps would, however, face formidable political obstacles.
Nobody knows what Mr. Clinton will actually propose, even less how Congress -- with new leaders in tax-writing committees and an influx of newcomers -- will dispose. His team is compiling a book of policy options to present to the President-elect after the so-called economic summit meeting next week.
One safe prediction, analysts say, is that higher rates will probably give a strong impetus to more special breaks for individual saving and investments.
"The driving force of the 1986 tax reform was to create a level playing field," said David Cutler, a Harvard economist. "This says the level playing field is wrong. There are some things that have much bigger social rates of return than other things, and this is a cheap way to get more of them."
Two possible candidates for adoption are a capital gains tax cut and expanded individual retirement accounts. The capital gains tax could be trimmed either by indexing capital gains for inflation or excluding from ordinary income a fraction of the capital gains from a start-up new business, prospects that excite some supply-side supporters of Reaganomics sufficiently to bring them into the Clinton camp.

HEADLINE: The Dow Declines by 8.11 As Storm Crimps Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks were trapped in a 10-point trading range yesterday as a severe storm in the Northeast brought Wall Street trading to a virtual standstill, squeezing volume to the lowest level in two weeks.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 8.11 points, to 3,304.08. For the week, the Dow rose 15.40 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a meager 164.5 million shares, the lowest level since 106.1 million changed hands Nov. 27, the day after Thanksgiving. Trading compared with 240.6 million shares Thursday.
Losing issues outnumbered gainers by 919 to 840.
Drenching rain, heavy winds and flooding caused early-morning commuting delays, depleting Wall Street's staff and later causing several firms to evacuate their offices.
 
Storm the Big News
 Investors ignored news of more Clinton Administration appointees and positive economic reports, focusing instead on storm and commuting updates.
"The weather was considered bigger news than the Presidential appointments today," said Robert Stovall of Stovall/21st Advisers.
In individual stocks, Maybelline, a new issue, ended at 26 3/4. It was priced at 23 1/2.
Among Nasdaq stocks, Novell lost 3 1/4, to 27 1/2, after reporting slightly disappointing fourth-quarter results. Several analysts cut earnings estimates and ratings.
Shares of QVC Network jumped 4 1/8, to 37 1/8. Barry Diller, former Fox Inc. chairman, has agreed to take a nearly 3 percent stake in QVC as part of a group he heads. A rival, Home Shopping Network, added 1 1/4, to 8 3/4.
Biogen rose 3 3/4, to 47. It said it expected to earn more than $1 a share in 1992, compared with 15 cents in 1991. It also forecast a significant increase in revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 0.91, to 433.73. The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.99, to 393.38.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.34 point, to 238.63. The Nasdaq index fell 3.14, to 655.79.

A 'Messiah' Looks Back to Premiere in Dublin

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

 BODY:
Handel's "Messiah," which had its premiere in Dublin 250 years ago, has throughout its history been a touchstone of the vicissitudes of Baroque music. One of few works from the era to circulate prominently through the ages, it held its own by evolving with progressive times, from Mozart's fluffy orchestration to the elephan tine inflations of the late 19th century. Some streamlining took place in the 20th century even before current notions of historical correctness began to take hold about four decades ago.
The result has been an incredible shrinking "Messiah," epitomized by the likes of the performance presented by Christopher Hogwood and the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston on Wednesday evening at Avery Fisher Hall. Using the musical text of the Dublin premiere, Mr. Hogwood deployed a chorus and period-instrument orchestra of 34 each, and seven relatively small-voiced soloists. The performance illustrated the achievements of the early-music movement as well as its besetting problems. 
 As the movement has shown, it is possible to turn the clock back on performance style to some extent (a more limited extent, to be sure, than many of its exponents have argued). But it is not possible to function within economic or social circumstances like those of earlier periods. Steven Ledbetter, in notes for the Hogwood performance, writes that in Dublin, "a hall designed to seat 600 actually accommodated 700" for the premiere. Whatever that first performance may have sounded like, it must have had greater visceral impact than Mr. Hogwood's hardy little band could muster in this 2,700-seat hall.
Still, the wee sound was lovely. The chorus was ravishing, solid yet transparent, singing with excellent intonation and balance. The orchestra represented a particularly fine assemblage of players from the Boston-New York early-music axis. (The principal oboist was, of course, the estimable Stephen Hammer, not "Rammor," as listed in the program.) Only at the end of the evening did the string sonority grow a bit attenuated.
Developing suitably punctilious soloists of real temperament and stature has been another problem for the early-music movement, one not solved especially well here. David Thomas, who sings on Mr. Hogwood's Oiseau-Lyre recording of "Messiah," was perhaps the best-known soloist, but his bass once again proved a blunt instrument and not notably strong. From Sharon Baker, Judith Malafronte, Derek Lee Ragin, Johnson Flucker, Douglas Johnson and David Murray, mere competence prevailed.
Mr. Hogwood's use of the Dublin edition had a poetic aptness in this anniversary year. (His recording is based on the London version of 1754, and his performance with the society four years ago at Avery Fisher Hall played off later London accounts.)
But the edition entails severe losses for the "Messiah" fan. The chorus "Their Sound Is Gone Out" disappears altogether, and the magnificent aria "But Who May Abide" is restored to a piddling recitative. Of one of Handel's grandest inspirations in the work, the lift to soprano in the second part of the alto aria "He Shall Feed His Flock," there is no trace.
Mr. Hogwood's pacing was brisk and knowing. A few interpretive touches verged on the precious, like the showy diminuendo on the last chord of Part 1, for the word "light," as in burden. As added tone-painting, it seemed belated and gratuitous.

 BODY:
JOSIE NATORI, the founder and president of the lingerie and fashion company that bears her name, gets lots of invitations, especially at this time of year, so nothing seemed exceptional to her about one that arrived in her office the other day.
"It went to the bottom of a pile of mail, and I didn't even notice it," she said yesterday, explaining why she had given short shrift to the hottest ticket in town: a summons to President-elect BILL CLINTON's high-level economic meeting in Little Rock tomorrow through Tuesday. "My secretary finally brought it to my attention saying, 'You didn't respond to this and your husband thinks you should go,' " she said. "I brushed past her, telling her: 'This is a last-minute invitation. It's a fax, but find out what it's all about.' " 
 When it sank in that she was one of only 300 people invited to help the President-elect formulate economic policy, Ms. Natori canceled a slew of business meetings and social engagements. Tomorrow she is off to Little Rock.
She may have been late with her R.S.V.P., but she's going well prepared. "I think I represent several angles," she said. "I am a woman, an Asian -- I was born in the Philippines -- and I run a small business. I want to tell him that he must consider the effects of his policies on small business as well as on I.B.M."
And in the future, she said, she will probably pay closer attention to invitations.

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton's Pragmatists

 BODY:
President-elect Clinton's announcement of four more high-level appointments yesterday made it clear that he intends to run a problem-solving Administration -- creative but not ideological, energetic but not confrontational. His managers, he said, must know "the limits of what government can do as well as what government must do."
Three of the four are women, reflecting Mr. Clinton's pledge for a diversified Administration. Laura Tyson, an economist at Berkeley, will head the Council of Economic Advisers. Carol Browner, Florida's top environmental official and a protegee of Vice President-elect Al Gore, will run the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 Donna Shalala, chancellor of the University of Wisconsin, will lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The Harvard lecturer Robert Reich will become Labor Secretary.
Ms. Tyson describes herself as a "cautious activist." She has been accused, wrongly, of protectionism. But she does call for retaliation against protectionism by other countries. And she would subsidize U.S. industries that promote advanced research, train skilled workers and otherwise spin off large benefits to the rest of the economy. All this gives heartburn to many economists who preach free, unsubsidized markets and multilateral solutions to trade problems.
Unlike Ms. Tyson, Mr. Reich opposes selective subsidies for industry. Yet he too champions major investments in education and workplace skills. That's the centerpiece of Mr. Clinton's strategy for spurring growth by "putting people first" -- a strategy Mr. Reich helped design.
Ms. Shalala is a more curious choice. A skilled backstage negotiator, she received high marks for her stewardship of New York City's Hunter College and the University of Wisconsin. Yet she is primarily an educator. The two most pressing tasks facing her department are reforming the welfare system and overhauling medical care.
Ms. Browner, the choice for the E.P.A., faithfully reflects Mr. Clinton's vision of artful activism. Few officials face more difficult choices -- choices between jobs and environmental protection, between committed environmentalists and businessmen who, as Mr. Clinton observed yesterday, are often disheartened by complex and sometimes contradictory regulations.
Ms. Browner won compromises on several thorny issues in Florida, satisfying environmentalists without enraging industry. Her strength was her ability to steer all parties toward agreement by balancing competing interests and avoiding ideological combat -- a defining and useful trait in all of Mr. Clinton's appointments thus far.

HEADLINE: Why Political Democracy Hurts Russia's Economic Freedom

 BODY:
To the Editor:
William Safire makes an important point about the need for Russia to push ahead with a comprehensive and not half-hearted economic reform program ("Visions in Collision," column, Dec. 3). His second point, however, that Russia should reject the Chinese model of reform -- authoritarian political rule coupled with increasing economic freedom -- is more problematic. 
 Certainly, political democracy and economic freedom are preferable to authoritarian rule and economic freedom. But in the real world, unfortunately, political democracy often works to undercut economic freedom and often leads to anarchy and lawlessness or authoritarian rule. The result: neither political democracy nor economic freedom.
Are the people of Somalia, for example, better off since they were granted political independence? Are their fellow Africans throughout the continent enjoying higher standards of living because they adopted the principle of one man one vote? Has either the political or economic situation in Brazil and Peru improved because these two countries embraced democracy?
It is not my purpose to belittle democracy. It is, as Churchill noted, the worst form of government except for all the rest. But stable and successful democracies such as exist in the United States and Western Europe can only emerge with the development of an entrepreneurial middle class. Indeed, the existence of such a class in these countries made real and sustainable democracy possible. There, the prosperous middle classes appealed to democratic principles to preserve their way of life. Economic freedom naturally led to political democracy; and the two concepts reinforce one another.
Similarly, the Communists may rule China today, but their days are numbered; and as history shows, it is only a matter of time before real, sustainable democracy gains sway in one of the world's oldest and potentially most dynamic civilizations.
Democracy has failed, by contrast, in those countries that have yet to agree on the rules under which they should be governed. Or they have agreed to rules that cannot work.
Russia is a case in point. By its actions thus far, it has committed itself to a post-Socialist economic order that is destined to fail. And political democracy, unfortunately, has proved itself not up to the task of dealing with this problem.
More than 90 percent of the reforms thus far in Russia, for example, have been enacted through executive decree -- that is, President Yeltsin's exercise of dictatorial powers. Mr. Yeltsin has never exercised his decree power to the extent necessary to put the Russian economy on a sound footing. His power to rule by decree expired, moreover, on Dec. 1, and is unlikely to be extended by the Congress of People's Deputies.
It is well and good for Mr. Safire to "root for the amalgam of political and economic freedom." But the unfortunate fact of life in Russia today is that political freedom now is the enemy of economic freedom and, ultimately, sustainable political freedom. As Russian inflation spirals out of control, and as Mr. Yeltsin's economic reform program is further watered down to buy peace from his opponents, it will become increasingly likely that Russia will have to choose between economic freedom and political democracy. For the sake of both, it must choose the former and not the latter.

HEADLINE: S.I. Ferry Clock Would Overshadow the Battery

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your editorial "The Big Clock" (Nov. 23), which followed Sunday's thoughtful critique by Herbert Muschamp in the Arts and Leisure section about the winning scheme for the New Staten Island Ferry Terminal, over-romanticizes an unnecessarily oversized design. 
 Considering that this is a terminal for commuters (not a gateway for newcomers to the city, like the old Pennsylvania Station or the airport terminals), and is to be built at the tip of lower Manhattan (an area of the city not lacking in architectural heroics), a ferry slip with the equivalent of 18 stories of construction to celebrate crossing the Upper Bay seems to be overdoing it. While the view north from approaching vessels is famous the world over, at this point in our city's development the vista from the mainland may be even more critical. Imagine walking south through the dark canyons of Wall Street and emerging from Whitehall to be faced with the north side of a giant billboard (the Big Clock) where once there was a grand open sky.
It is especially ironic that as the hearings proceed on the New York City Department of City Planning's Comprehensive Waterfront Plan, a plan meant to conserve open space and discourage large-scale construction, the design appears to be sending the wrong message.
It would indeed be wonderful for New York to finally have a Robert Venturi/Denise Scott Brown building, but a much smaller one would not only save money but would also preserve the valued openness of the Battery.

WEYERHAEUSER SETS PULP MILL MODERNIZATION

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
The Weyerhaeuser Company said yesterday that it had approved a $400 million modernization of its pulp mill in Longview, Wash., which is expected to provide a boost to the area's sagging economy. The project was approved by the timber company's board of directors. 
 "This project is the largest dollar expenditure and modernization in Weyerhaeuser-Longview's 63-year history," said Gary Healea, vice president and Longview mill manager. Weyerhaeuser had considered shutting down the mill if the modernization had not been approved by the board. At its peak last year, the mill employed 1,400. The work force has been gradually reduced to about 1,300.

HEADLINE: Tackling Problems We Thought We Solved

BYLINE: By Perri Klass; Perri Klass is a pediatrician in Boston. Her most recent book is "Baby Doctor: A Pediatrician's Training."

 BODY:
'So this Salvadoran woman calls up and she has a 9-month-old baby with diarrhea, and the doctor on call gave her the right advice, said go to the pharmacy and buy Pedialyte. She had Medicaid, the doctor called the pharmacy, but when she got there, they said they couldn't give it to her for free without a written prescription. So she takes the kid home, and over the next 36 hours the baby gets worse. She doesn't call back -- she should have called back. The kid appears in the emergency room 36 hours later, moribund, and dies three days later." Alan Meyers, M.D., is an assistant professor of pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine, and one of the primary care pediatricians at Boston City Hospital. The baby he is describing was a patient in the primary care system at this hospital, the child of an immigrant mother, growing up in inner-city Boston.
"My wife and I drove up there to that neighborhood, we went to every pharmacy. The rehydration solutions cost up to $6.30 a liter. It's obscene charging this much for a product that ought to be cheaper than Coca-Cola -- it has less in it." A baby dies of dehydration from diarrhea in an American city in the last decade of the 20th century. A mother cannot afford $6 worth of water and electrolytes, does not understand where to go for help. It is a particularly sad, pointed illustration of what anyone who cares about children already knows: growing up in extreme poverty is bad, stunting, dangerous. 
 Is there anything else to be done with this urban life-and-death story, any lesson to be drawn? Is there a way to translate these well-known truths of poverty into information that cannot be ignored? Those who offer medical care to the children of poverty find themselves using their research projects to demonstrate that poverty is not only damaging, but quantifiably damaging to infants and children, searching for specific indices of growth and development, individual health and family function, which will allow them to measure the parameters of growing up at the bottom of our society. And then, having gathered their data, these researchers find themselves using their medical degrees and their data to call attention, again and again, to the forces that threaten to destroy our cities from the inside out, to children who seem to be invisible to society.
Dr. Meyers and his colleagues reported the baby's case in an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association. He reflected on what he had learned on trips to the third world, where diarrheal dehydration is a leading cause of death in children under the age of 5. There the usual treatment is oral rehydration -- replenishing fluids orally rather than intravenously, as is done in this country. The treatment is a prepackaged mix of sugar and electrolytes, which parents then dissolve in water. Some doctors feel these parents should be trained to use a solution they can make themselves from rice gruel. Meyers says he thinks this home mix could be used here in the United States: "A homemade rice-based mixture," he says, "may be more effective at stopping diarrhea than the commercial solutions currently available." He is looking for financing for a study, to be conducted at Boston City Hospital, that will compare two different commercial formulas with the homemade mixture. His enthusiasm is obvious as he speaks of the "reverse flow of technology coming from the third world to the first world."
Those who practice pediatrics at Boston City Hospital become accustomed to these jumps: the clinical case, often a case that does not seem to belong to this country, even to this century, leads to a research project aimed at the same disadvantaged population that spawned the case, and then to social policy, political action and advocacy. Boston City Hospital serves the impoverished inner city, and the department of pediatrics takes care of its children. While some are the children of the working poor or even of the lower middle class, many are the children of the underclass, some exposed to drugs before they are born, some growing up amid violence and even murder, some the children of parents who are themselves only children. They are the children who may go hungry because there is not enough money in the house, and the babies for whose parents $6.30 may mean the difference between following the doctor's advice and taking the baby home without the medicine.
The people who work in this department are engaged as academic doctors, studying poverty and its effects on the growth and development of children. While almost any study in academic medicine is accepted as a contribution to knowledge, an end in itself, these studies are immediately turned around and used in advocacy work, in fierce and often passionate arguments that the situation could be changed, if our society cared to make those changes. At a moment of deep disillusionment and profound anxiety about the economics of health care in America, the researchers feel they must prove over and over what everyone should already know.
Children who grow up in dire poverty can be trapped in many dangerous cycles: the malnutrition-infection cycle, the children-having-children cycle, the abused-mother-abused-child cycle. To be useful to these children, research must do more than tease out the damage done at every turning of the wheel. The study of poverty and its traps must also become the study of ways out, ways around, ways through. And, because too much bad news can bring on a sense of fatalism, along with the message of the grim facts of the inner city there sometimes has to be, paradoxically, also the message of hope and resilience.
'WHAT BROUGHT ME BACK TO THIS place," Meyers says, "was that it was a department that could accommodate my noodling around in poverty issues, in policy." Meyers spent a year getting a degree in public health at Harvard before he came back to Boston City Hospital, where he had done his residency in the early 80's.
I had done my residency in pediatrics a mile or two away, at the Children's Hospital of Boston, and come to Boston City for a fellowship in pediatric infectious diseases. Children's also serves many poor inner-city children, but it is a very different hospital, private rather than public, and heavily oriented toward tertiary care: subspecialty care, all the miracles of modern pediatrics. In the emergency room and in the well-child clinic and on the wards, we cared for children with ordinary everyday pediatric problems but we also took care of children whose parents had flown up from South America specifically for heart surgery or a bone-marrow transplant, children who had come from a Persian Gulf emirate for a second opinion on a perplexing skin condition. This was a Harvard teaching hospital, which placed a very high value on research and perhaps the highest value of all on so-called basic science, investigations carried out in the laboratory, away from the ambiguities of patient care. Basic science is the reason childhood leukemia is gradually being conquered, the reason prenatal diagnosis is now available for cystic fibrosis. The mixture of clinical practice, clinical research and political activism at Boston City Hospital was new to me, as were some of the realities of working with a population of children who were almost all poor.
Joel J. Alpert, M.D., has been chairman of the department of pediatrics for the last 20 years. This past year he announced his resignation as chairman. When he thinks back on his early days at Boston City Hospital -- he also came from Children's -- he recalls being told by his chief, the distinguished pediatrician Charles A. Janeway, "If I stayed at Harvard, I would teach the people who taught, if I went to B.C.H., I would teach the people who did." In his first week at the hospital, back in 1972, Dr. Alpert saw two children on the wards with oral gonorrhea, "and then we had a power failure -- change was not going to be easy."
Over the past 20 years the department has grown from 12 faculty members to 40, a tribute to the resourcefulness of Alpert and the people he gathered around him. This year the department can claim 57 active grant programs, for a total dollar value of $38 million, and a high degree of academic productivity, with 135 research papers and 47 abstracts published by department members during the 1991-92 medical year. That productivity, while testimony to the energy and versatility of people who carry a heavy clinical load, is also the department's collateral for future grants.
The grant money is intended for research, and related research is designed to provide patient care: some programs study the developmental progress of babies exposed prenatally to cocaine, while others provide them with good medical care and regular developmental assessments; some study the best ways to support teen-age mothers, and others establish clinics they can attend with their babies. "We're a vulnerable department," Alpert says. "No endowment, no pots of gold. We had to practice the Willie Sutton rule: we went for where the money was. And fortunately, the money was in the right place -- early on, in primary care training, and later in child development and AIDS."
Public interest and possible financing often go together; the perception that the social fabric is threatened may translate into a push for more studies. Consider the recent news media leitmotif "crack babies" -- the shame of our cities, the death of our schools. Brain damaged, uncontrollable, unlovable and unable to love. Drs. Barry Zuckerman and Deborah A. Frank have argued that the loud public discussion of the effects of maternal crack use on the developing fetus is largely scaremongering, based on incomplete scientific evidence, and has disturbing political consequences. By portraying these children as permanently damaged, we make them into "throwaway children," as Dr. Zuckerman puts it, children for whom society is not responsible. In the medical journal Pediatrics this year, they staked out their position: Prenatal drug exposure is only one of multiple treatable or preventable biologic and social "stressors" experienced by children living in poverty. By focusing on cocaine and not on lack of adequate nutrition, health care and education, we conveniently can blame mothers and not the conditions of poverty.
Drs. Zuckerman and Frank go on to criticize the study that sounded the alarm: sample size too small (only 18 babies), confounding variables (babies exposed to many drugs), nonblind examiners (medicalese referring to the fact that the people doing developmental assessments of the babies in the study knew who had been exposed to drugs). In another study they point to, by a team including Ira J. Chasnoff, the president of the National Association for Perinatal Addiction Research and Education, children who were prenatally exposed to cocaine and then received good follow-up care, including family support services and developmental programs, did as well on developmental testing at the age of 2 as other children of similar socioeconomic class who were never exposed to cocaine. But both groups of children scored below the national average. In other words, children growing up in poverty, with or without the disadvantage of prenatal cocaine exposure, do not develop as well as they should.
A large prospective study of infants exposed to cocaine is underway at Boston City Hospital. It involves setting up elaborate programs, which regularly assess the effect not only of prenatal drug exposure but also of many of those other biologic and social stressors. At the same time other hospital programs follow up on these careful assessments, trying to mitigate the effects of the risk factors. This is the dialectic of the pediatrics of poverty: the study that may be financed partly because it is the stuff of dire headlines, the results that must offer more than information, must point the way to social policy. These are the medical problems that cannot be solved by science alone.
AND THEY ARE MEDICAL problems. Children who are severely malnourished may suffer neurological problems. They are vulnerable to infections (which may in turn interfere with growth and development). They are more vulnerable to lead poisoning than properly nourished children.
The staff at the Failure to Thrive Clinic meets at the start of the day. Sitting around the table are Deborah Frank, who is the clinic director, social workers and nutritionists and a home teacher. This is a clinic for children who don't grow, don't gain weight properly. Here the secrets of the poor are discussed, the contents of kitchen cabinets, family budgets, household dynamics, parent-child interactions. The staff runs through the list of patients who are expected that day:
"We've seen him since he was a toddler -- not one of our great successes. The mother has boundary issues -- when we gave him a nutritional supplement, she drank it. We have to give them enough for them both."
"I did a home visit, and the little girl isn't taking the Pediasure" -- a high-calorie nutritional drink -- "but she will take vanilla Instant Breakfast. Her mom says she's eating. We worked on substitutions -- if not peanut-butter crackers, give cheese crackers. And it's getting warm out, so give ice cream."
Frank interrupts a story of a child in a shelter to editorialize, "Homelessness is probably just a major growth knocker-offer. We have a number of families where a kid who was born or was a toddler at the time the family was homeless is still doing poorly. And this shelter is just an old-fashioned poorhouse. They won't let children have snacks without a written letter from a doctor!"
"The kid had strep and got put on penicillin. Mom came in and got her high chair. We're working on adding fats."
"This is the mom who I told, her mantra was going to be no diet soda for her or for her kid for a whole week -- we'll see if they survived."
"This girl is actually ready for discharge from a growth point of view. I'm just concerned about her affect: she's very anxious, won't take her clothes off, keeps her coat on. It's a dysfunctional, chaotic family, and I worry about sexual abuse."
"This is a mom who gets up at 6 A.M. to feed her baby. She works part time, leaves the baby with the other kids, leaves a meal. I think they don't give her the meal, they give her a cookie. They have no medical insurance, they have food shortages -- I brought her groceries on my last visit. All the kids were there, all dressed and clean and extremely social and nice."
A first visit, a baby newly referred to the clinic: "Mom is a scared little teen-ager who was removed from her own mom, and was nomadic and homeless during the pregnancy. She has untreated pelvic inflammatory disease, she doesn't keep her appointments. She's not a hostile kid, just lonesome and young."
Frank's formal title is director of the Growth and Development Program. "I would go bonkers if I wasn't very active in advocacy, I would feel so futile," she says. She sits in a big and somewhat gloomy office, behind a messy desk, next to a shelf of baby food. "I use my clinical knowledge and experience to inform public debate around children. I have quite good medical and academic credentials, I have a knowledge of what malnutrition does to children's health and development. Your grandmother knew this, my grandmother knew this -- but when I articulate this, people say, oh doctor, how courageous of you to tell us this! I feel a little silly wrapping myself in my M.D. degree to tell something mothers and grandmothers know. But the people who need to hear it make public policy, control funding."
Frank started out as a fellow in developmental pediatrics at Children's Hospital, a protegee of T. Berry Brazelton, the distinguished Harvard developmentalist. In the Failure to Thrive Clinic there, she became aware of the developmental and behavioral effects of inadequate caloric intake in children, the ways that malnourished children reduce their activity and their interactions with the environment. She came to Boston City Hospital in 1981. In the Reagan years, she began seeing a deterioration in children in the program who had been doing all right. "We started to see kids who had been better, but had been cut from WIC or food stamps, kids I had worked with for a year -- malnourished because they were cut off federal feeding programs. I got so angry. I decided writing my Congressman was not enough. I'm mad. You don't mess with my patients."
Since then, Frank has traveled around the country as part of the Physician Task Force on Hunger in America. She operates a food pantry for which she solicits donations from churches, schools and synagogues. And she runs Boston City Hospital's Failure to Thrive Clinic, which she founded in 1984. It has served more than 600 families, and takes care of about 150 at any given time. The waiting time for an appointment is two months.
Failure to thrive is a complicated syndrome, occurring not only in the poor but also in families with enough money, where children may develop what are called interactive feeding disorders, or behavioral feeding problems. Frank estimates that perhaps 10 to 20 percent of the children in her clinic have such problems. Many of the rest, she says, are malnourished because of poverty. The problem is getting worse as hard economic times continue and social services are cut; in the first nine months of 1992, the clinic treated more children than in all of 1991.
"I trained at Children's in Seattle, then at Boston Children's," she says. "There were lots of kids with horrible rare diseases. But at least you knew everything had been done, the limits of medical knowledge had been applied and you were up against God. We sit and watch kids being destroyed by things we know how to fix. That was awful, this is worse. It's not that nothing more could be done. There's a great deal more that could be done, but we can't do it."
ROBERT NEEDLMAN, M.D., and Kathleen Fitzgerald Rice, an educator, are co-directors of a program called Reach Out and Read, which has volunteers reading to children in the waiting rooms, and pediatricians in the primary care clinic giving away picture books at check-up visits and encouraging parents to read to their children. When Dr. Needlman and his co-workers tried to measure the efficacy of their "interventions," they found, as they published in the American Journal of Diseases of Children in 1991, that parents who had been given a book were four times as likely as parents who had not to say they had looked at books with their children over the past 24 hours, or to list looking at books as among their children's three favorite activities.
The success of the R.O.A.R. program is testimony not only to the power of books, but also to the impoverishment of some children's lives, and to the possibility of making a difference with a small, nonglobal, nonmedical change. But Needlman doesn't want anyone to get the idea that just because society gives a child a book, all obligations are fulfilled. "Simple answers don't work and simple programs don't work," he says. "Kids need comprehensive services, adequate social services and jobs and housing and medical services. This is a small part. It's one other thing that pediatricians can do that moves things in the right direction and is nice. But it's no substitute for substantive changes."
AGAIN AND AGAIN AT Boston City Hospital, the question comes up: what kind of parent do you become after a blighted childhood? This is perhaps the most numbing cycle of them all, and those parents who attempt to break it need long-term assistance and practical, hard-nosed encouragement.
"I hear mothers' stories of how they were abused, the violence they saw. These parents have the same stories as the children I take care of," Zuckerman comments. "When we started our clinical work, we were impressed by how hard addicted mothers will work to take care of their children, even at times when they can't take care of themselves. We have to acknowledge how important their children are to them." When they give the mothers and children clay to play with, he says, "the mothers have to make their own models before they can make them with the kids; they haven't had a childhood."
Six mothers and their ten children, all of whom are in the Women and Infants Program, are gathered in a small circle at the Family Development Center. Everyone is rubbing on hand lotion, an activity that provides a chance to touch yourself and your child, gently. Carol Seval-Brooks, a registered nurse who is co-director of the program, explains that it was established three years ago, as a place where addicted women and their drug-exposed children could receive treatment in a single visit: medical care and drug treatment for the mothers, pediatric care and developmental attention for the children. Treatment programs that take children into account are difficult to find. Most of all, though, it's meant to use the mothers' concern for their children as a way of treating the whole family. This concept -- modeled on "one-stop shopping" -- is also applied in other clinics, where people who would themselves avoid the medical system will bring their children for help and accept help themselves while they are there. This one-stop approach is highly desirable for patients for whom every trip to the hospital means overcoming the obstacles that loom large in the lives of parents without money and without social supports: transportation and child care, money, fear of the streets, fear of venturing into any large institution.
Of the 13 women that this program recruited three years ago, 8 are still involved, these 6 and 2 others who aren't here today. All had a history of abusing cocaine as well as other substances. "Our philosophy is: the best way to help the child is to help the mother," Seval-Brooks says. Although two of the eight women have lost custody of their children, Seval-Brooks ticks off some of the program's successes: Most of the women are using birth control, pregnancy rates are down to zero (following what she says was a 100 percent rate of repeat pregnancy in the first year), all the children are immunized, none has had any serious health problems thought to be the result of neglect. The mothers are in various stages of drug recovery -- a couple have gone for years without relapsing, the others have had periods of relapse more recently. When they relapse, they may go into more formal all-day treatment programs, but they stay part of this group.
The women range in age from 23 to 36. "All come from extraordinarily dysfunctional families -- two witnessed murders as children, several were sexually or physically abused," Seval-Brooks says. Echoing Zuckerman, she adds, "What I believe is, what comes around goes around -- my clients were their children 20 years ago. Each time it goes around, the children get less."
She passes out vials for urine samples, which will be checked for drugs. Matter-of-factly, each woman goes off to the bathroom, leaving coat and purse behind; people have been known to switch vials. A woman hands over her sample with a grin: "It's clean -- just don't make no mistake and give me somebody else's that's dirty!" There are shouts of laughter, and then the group settles down. There is some catching up, some discussion of the women who aren't there -- someone was in detox and then maybe got arrested, someone else is doing really well, some discussion of halfway houses and shelters.
The conversation turns to children: one mother announces that she was ready to push her son's head through the wall the other day, and others chime in with stories of similar frustration. Before Seval-Brooks can say anything, one of the women pleads, "Please don't say not to touch them; that's the worst thing not to do!" There is general agreement; laughing, the women tell stories on themselves: "They had to tell me, stop shaking that boy -- or else, girl, we will be visiting you in the joint!"
"I beat 'em all down. One of them I had on the walls. . . ."
"That's my child, I can do whatever I want to, and if the state of Massachusetts doesn't want me to hit my kid they can take him and raise him themself!"
"No," says another mother, "you know you be crying." She turns to another, quieter woman. "You just got yours back."
Seval-Brooks tries to make the case against hitting children, beating children, the case that when you beat children you only teach violence. The women listen to her patiently, but it is clear that she is a long way from convincing them.
"None of you got appropriate parenting," she reminds the group. "None of you had a mother and father who treated you with respect and dignity."
AT THE TEEN-TOT clinic it all comes full circle, and much too soon; the pediatric patients, some growing up without the physical and spiritual nourishment that should have been provided by their parents and their society are having their own children. Patients who have not yet outgrown their pediatricians are producing children of their own. This program provides pediatric care to teen-age mothers and their offspring. One-stop shopping once again. Here they study ways to keep the repeat pregnancy rate down, but they also study the strengths of young parents, their resources and their coping mechanisms. Again, the members of a multidisciplinary team sit around a table -- doctor, nurse-midwife, social worker, family planner, public health home-visiting nurse and pediatric nurse practitioner. Another barrage of patient stories:
"She started talking about the attack -- all I asked for was her address. This pregnancy was the result of a rape."
"She's coming to parenting class Monday. She's the one who disappeared down south six months ago, comes back pregnant again. Her mother's a poly-drug abuser."
"I've written a letter recommending that the baby be removed from the home. The grandmother was arrested, and the mother is clearly incapable of taking care of the baby."
"I like teen-agers," says Marie Hayes, the nurse-midwife. "We have to give our teen-agers different messages, help them believe that having babies is not all they can do. Actually, my sympathies are more and more leaning toward the grandmothers -- they're in the trenches. But they say, well, I had you at 16 and I did O.K. But what's O.K.? We never starved is O.K., the bare essentials is O.K."
"I don't think anyone knows how to break the cycle," says Leslie Ramsay, the pediatric nurse practitioner. "One doctor talked about lap time -- a lot of kids don't get enough lap time. Our kids love it, they love for you to hug them."
Tesi Kohlenberg, M.D., is the director of the Teen-Tot Clinic, which cares for about 400 teen-age mothers and their 500 children. She sees more in her patients' stories than just the relentless tragedies of abuse and the stunting of promise. She sees evidence of what she considers almost miraculous human resiliency. Of one young patient she says, her "heart and her health is in her role as a mother, a very good mother given that she has a very active, healthily impulsive 2-year-old. There's no question in the mind of any observer that she's doing a good job." Dr. Kohlenberg says she believes that these parents could be helped to give their offspring a very different childhood.
"It is possible to break the cycle, and it is cheaper in dollars than not breaking the cycle, but it's a choice our society has not been ready to make," she says. "Say you intervene with a young mother -- give her five years in a structured residence with four or five other troubled young women, two or three full-time staff. You then have all of her children likely not to have to go into foster care. Even if you just save her kids at the cost of five years of intervention, you more than make it back if the kids are functional and don't need social services for the rest of their lives."
"WE HAVE TO REMIND ourselves," Alpert says ruefully, "that despite our successes, our kids are worse off, and young doctors aren't standing in line to train here." In the recent past, the Boston City Hospital pediatrics program had done very well in the national residency "match" -- that is, the internship candidates that the hospital most wanted were also the ones who wanted to come. This year the match was much more disappointing for the hospital. This may have something to do with the declining number of doctors going into primary care medicine, a problem for the whole profession. Alpert boasts that 75 percent of the residents who graduate from his program go on to practice primary care pediatrics, and that half of those are taking care of the underprivileged.
There are, of course, pitfalls to doing research with a political agenda -- or with any agenda save that of allegiance to truth. Many of the subjects that are studied in the inner city lend themselves easily to sensational treatment: there are not only crack babies and their mothers to be vilified but also innocent victims of starvation to be pitied. Sentimentalism, like sensationalism, has nothing to do with good science.
But there are also studies that can tell a harsh truth more vividly than any political speech. There was Frank's "Heat or Eat" study, which found that more underweight babies were seen in the emergency room during the three months after the coldest month of the winter. Meyers talks about a study of children from low-income families that showed that their standardized test scores improved if they were given breakfast. "The press went nuts," he says. "We're gathering data so that advocates can load their guns, but we have to maintain good science." He shrugs, shakes his head. "Proving that poverty is bad for you -- we need to do that?"
"How do you work with families like these?" Kohlenberg asks. "You experience not only powerlessness and sadness and horror but tremendous excitement, a spiritual experience of human resilience. The fact that anything can repair this kind of injury is very moving. That you can turn and see an abused young mother smiling with delight as her baby tries for the 17th time to open a closet he was told not to. What's called the self-righting tendency of the organism, the tendency to grow toward the light.
"People are very scared of inner-city teens, seeing them as violent, uncaring, irretrievably damaged, and my experience is that isn't true. We know that people can change. We don't need to be afraid of these children."

Rap After the Riot: Smoldering Rage And No Apologies

BYLINE: By Jon Pareles

 BODY:
Ice Cube does some gloating on his new album, "The Predator." "Anything you wanted to know about the riot was in the records before the riot," he says in an interview-style interlude. "All you had to do was go to the Ice Cube library and pick a record."
He's right: "Death Certificate," released on Halloween in 1991, not only articulated the rage surrounding the beating of Rodney King, but showed exactly where the flashpoint would be in the April riots in Los Angeles. The album included "Black Korea," which revealed the deep resentment between Korean shopkeepers (whom Ice Cube, in one ignorant flourish, described as "chop-suey-eatin' ") and blacks, who felt they were being treated more like potential criminals than customers; when the riots came, Korean businesses became targets. 
 The album was vengeful and divisive, airing deep-seated prejudices and treating ethnic groups as if they were warring gangs that could never share turf. But it was also prophetic, which may be one reason "The Predator" shot to No. 1 on Billboard's album chart upon release at the end of November. In the wake of the riot, people had been waiting for rap's next bulletin from the front.
Before South-Central Los Angeles went up in a billion dollars' worth of flames, the only voices from the area that most Americans had heard were the swaggering storytellers of gangster rap. Taking violence for granted, flaunting ugly attitudes toward women and homosexuals, savoring gory details, gangster rappers weren't documentarians or responsible spokesmen; they were pulp auteurs, exploiting America's appetite for violent entertainment while dropping enough local details or "reality" to sound credible.
When Los Angeles burned, the reality dwarfed gangster rap's tales of drive-by shootings and petty but deadly feuds. Yet amid the violence, the rappers suddenly seemed like experts. And as the immediacy of the riots faded, rappers are again the voices most likely to be heard outside the ghetto. They are not diplomatic or conciliatory with the outside world; they have little to say about the riot victims or about rebuilding burned-out areas. That's for politicians and community leaders to take care of. Rappers talk about how they feel.
Hip-hop is by far the most topical zone of popular music, so it was inevitable that the riots would make their way into rap's fall releases. For the most part, Los Angeles rappers have preferred to stay with their usual postures and material, with increasingly redundant tales of crime, sex and battling machismo. Although explicit post-riot raps are greatly outnumbered by more typical gangster material, they have been emerging on new recordings over the last month. They suggest that the acquittal of the police officers who beat Rodney King has left enduring anger and that racial and ethnic polarization has only increased.
There are no apologies, just a few second thoughts. On recent releases, gangster rappers like Ice Cube vent rage and vow retribution, while noting with approval the post-riot truce between the two most entrenched Los Angeles gangs, the Crips and the Bloods. More politically inclined rappers, like Paris (from Oakland, Calif.), ricochet between fantasizing about terrorism and trying to draw broader lessons from the carnage.
The usually outspoken Public Enemy (from New York) plays defense. In "Tie Goes to the Runner" on the new album "Greatest Misses," Chuck D says he's "not suprised at all about the riots," but his only word about the situation is to insist that raps like "Black Korea" didn't create the problems: "This was predicted, not self-inflicted/ By the rap out of the 'hood that kicked it good." Sound bites from news coverage of the riots also appear as signs of authenticity on efforts like "Whut? Thee Album" by Redman, a performer from Newark who starts the album by placing himself in a "psycho" ward, talking out his sociopathic fantasies. The album includes "News Break," in which a fictitious interviewer asks Redman about reaction to the riots. "Yeah, they still mad," he says, and threatens the interviewer.
As with the rest of hip-hop, pluralism reigns. But the sentiment they share is that it took an all-out insurrection to get the attention of a white power structure.
Ice Cube, the best-known voice of South-Central, is involved not just on "The Predator" but on a forthcoming album by a rapper called Kam, due in February, and on an all-star post-riot single called "Get the Fist," which Mercury Records released but made little effort to promote. Sales of the single, a sequence of snippets by Ice Cube, Yo-Yo, Cypress Hill, Kam and others, benefit the Brotherhood Movement, which was formed in the aftermath of the 1965 Watts riots and is currently working to rebuild South-Central. But it's obvious why Mercury didn't try to turn it into another "We Are the World"; "Get the Fist" is probably the most belligerent charity single ever made.
It starts with on-the-spot defiance -- "I'm black and I'm proud to be lootin' in your face" -- and moves on to calls for black unity against the police and whites: "Not black on black/ The other color gets beat." "Get the Fist" also includes part of Ice Cube's riot commentary from "The Predator," "We Had to Tear This -- Up." In the complete song, between news bulletins about the verdict and the riots, Ice Cube raps about looting ("Now I got a laptop computer") and fantasizes about killing the policemen who beat Mr. King and the jury members who acquitted them. His conclusion is that the riots were necessary for blacks "to get some respect."
Kam's single "Peace Treaty," due in January, praises the gang truce but starts out discussing the riots: "It wasn't just the blacks, everybody was looting and had each other's backs. . . . We all had a hand in the cookie jar and took it far enough to make a statement."
Paris echoes that sentiment on his second album, "Sleeping With the Enemy": "Don't be tellin' me to get the nonviolent spirit/ When I'm violent is the only time you devils hear it." Those lines are part of "Bush Killa," Paris's vision of assassinating the President, a calculated provocation to draw attention to what he sees as genocide against American blacks ("I hope he thinks of how he done us when he's laid to waste/ From guns given to my people for my own kind").
Talking about the riots themselves, in a simulated telephone conversation that opens "Long Hot Summer," Paris and a friend dismiss those who are looting sneaker stores as "tired" and worries that in the aftermath of the riots, blacks will benefit as little as they did after the Watts riots. "If we don't think about things that we need to do for ourselves," he says, "this is just going to happen again and again and again and again." But in the rap that follows, he plays a gun-toting guerrilla stalking cops, with a chorus of "rat-a-tat-tat from my gat."
In cities where pistols are used to settle schoolyard arguments, it's pointless to wish for gun control in rap lyrics. And while no one should take such songs literally, they do reflect a pathology born of all-American myths and of smoldering frustrations. Weaned on the image of the frontier gunslinger who can single-handedly clean up a town, or the Rambo who can refight and win the Vietnam War without a shirt, rappers aren't the only ones who long for decisive action backed by armed force.
Rappers have all sorts of motives, ethical and unethical, to remind the outside world about their frustration, and in the commercial realm of popular culture, no motives are entirely unmixed. A rapper can identify with his or her community, hoping to shock listeners into paying attention to real troubles, and simultaneously realize that contention and notoriety and sensationalism will publicize and sell recordings. For rappers who portray their characters as gunslingers and guerrillas, there's also a large component of machismo, the determination to convince the archetypal street-level listener that the performer is as "hard" as the competition.
Post-riot raps don't offer practical solutions to urban unemployment, declining education, drugs and crime, any more than governmental bodies have. Instead, they shout and snarl about an escalating desperation that makes all sides seek scapegoats, raising friction and shutting off the possibility of dialogue.
Amid the gunplay and vengeance fantasies, the raps make one thing clear. While April's flames may have been quenched, the hostility that ignited them has not gone away. "I do want the white community to understand our community more," Ice Cube says on "The Predator." "I've given so many warnings on what's gonna happen if we don't get these things straight in our lives." His conclusion: "Armageddon is near."

Gehry's Disney Hall: A Matterhorn for Music

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
Walt Disney is a trademark. Walt Disney is an empire. But Walt Disney is also the name of a popular American artist whose subject was enchantment. A pumpkin grows into a coach. A kiss breaks the spell. Trick photography makes the bud blossom. Disney's enchantment was America's. His images of wonder were metaphors for a nation that, in his time, was as blessed as any magic kingdom. Then, like American moral authority, the Disney magic waned. The padded Mickeys, the bloated theme parks, the denatured wholesomeness came to seem like desperate overcompensations for curdled American innocence.
Last week, ground was broken in downtown Los Angeles for a building that will recast that lost enchantment in a bold, contemporary form. Walt Disney Concert Hall, designed by the Los Angeles architect Frank Gehry, is by no means innocent of worldly ambitions. The $80 million, 2,400-seat hall, the future home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, doesn't shrink from civic booster scale. Like the Museum of Contemporary Art, its neighbor on Bunker Hill, Disney Hall is expected to help revitalize the city's downtown district and lift its cultural profile. Fortunately, Gehry has resolved not to be crushed by the burden of such exemplary goals. For once, an architectural imagination soars to the level of the highest civic hopes. 
 Frank Gehry has often looked to artists for inspiration, so it is not surprising that his design takes more from Disney than a name. (Disney Hall, which is not affiliated with the Disney Corporation, is a beneficiary of a
$50 million donation from Lillian Disney, the artist's widow.) Yet the design offers no nostalgic escape into the realms of Tinkerbell or the Seven Dwarfs, or a Main Street that never was. Nor does it rely on smoke, lasers, hidden machines or the theme park's cordon sanitaire. Gehry's fiercely idealistic design creates a place of wonder in the city's hard, contentious core. It turns the pumpkin of family entertainment into the coach of art.
Like Fantasia, Disney Hall is an epic of music visualization, though what Gehry has set out to visualize is both more and less concrete than a musical score. Acoustics and empathy are the two forces driving the design. The building's acoustical structure is straightforward. The ideal concert hall, say experts, is a shoe box lined with wood and plaster. But, as those who've felt the panic of premature burial at Avery Fisher Hall can attest, it takes more than measurably good vibrations to make concertgoing a joy. Gehry and his project designer, Michael Maltzen, have worked closely with the noted acoustician Minoru Nagata on the design, and they've adopted the basic shoe box shape. But this is a box fit for Cinderella's slippers.
The walls of the box slope outward, shaping the auditorium into a trapezoid. It resembles the hull of a primitive ship, an effect heightened by the convex slope of the seating that surrounds the orchestra on three sides. Gehry has described the hall as a "ceremonial barge for music," and ship shapes play subtly throughout the house. The ceiling, sculptured in gentle scallops, resembles billowing sails but also a theater curtain's festive swags. A bank of organ pipes rises at the "prow," though in their jumbled profusion the pipes could also be a Baroque altarpiece remodeled by Duchamp.
The ship image, though intuitively arrived at, is not an arbitrary symbol. It holds meanings in tune with the Romantic spirit of the symphonic repertory: adventure, discovery and, ultimately, survival -- the idea that art is not a pastime but a necessity of life. For Gehry, creativity is not a Romantic abstraction but an imperative of his time and place. In his most important public work to date, he has fashioned a symbol of social harmony for a city that has come to stand for the dissonance of contemporary life.
It has been said, and not unfairly, that Frank Gehry is the poet of this troubled condition, that the fragmented forms of his buildings speak of the breakup and dispersal of the traditional urban center. It is a paradox, then, that he has been called upon to design a project intended to symbolize the rejuvenation of downtown Los Angeles. But, in fact, fragmentation is just as much the rule downtown as further out along the freeways. The fragments are more concentrated and they sprawl not only horizontally but in the jagged verticals of the skyline.
Gehry has responded to this context by enlarging to civic scale the layering techniques he employed when remodeling his own Santa Monica home in 1978. There, he wrapped an existing suburban house with screens of glass, chain-link fence and corrugated metal. At Disney Hall, the auditorium is clad with stainless steel panels, then partly wrapped with walls of French limestone. Or, rather, unwrapped, for the effect is like a gift from which the paper has been torn by an impatient birthday boy.
The "wrappers" peel away from the auditorium in curves subtle and pronounced. Some rise vertically to a height just above the hall's roofline. Others form curving horizontal strips at the building's base. Glass walls bulge forth from breaks between the wrappers, or rise above them in towering crystalline cages of Coney Island contour.
The main hall is not the only gift within this elaborate presentation. Like Mother Ginger, Gehry has tucked an array of surprises into the areas between the wrappers and the auditorium: lobbies, terraces, foyers, a cafe and gift shop, a "pre-concert" room for smaller musical events, a founders' room, and two areas Gehry calls "the baggages." Free-form containers, slung off the sides of the auditorium like saddlebags, they provide space for stairways, elevators and restrooms.
You can, if you like, read the fragmentation of these forms as an expression of social breakdown. Actually, what the design breaks down is the hierarchical order that large civic buildings traditionally express. The asymmetrical wrappings, the fissures that open up between them, the hall's off-center axis and its thrusting diagonal lines break up the building's imposing mass without recourse to classical scaling. Instead of proceeding toward a monumental entrance framed by a symmetrical facade, people will enter through movable glass panels that further erode the barrier between inside and out. More than simply providing access, the design promotes accessibility.
In the past, Gehry has relied on ostentatiously humble materials to convey a populist ideal. Humility, perhaps, is not the first thing French limestone will bring to mind. But the stainless steel segments that push through the wrappers will reveal a blue collar beneath the formal dress. And Gehry hopes to line the interior of the hall with Douglas fir. With the right lighting, this staple of weekend carpentry takes on a candle glow.
The cumulative impression of these complex forms is less building than landscape: a Matterhorn for music where thousands can gather to take the ride. Mrs. Disney requested that a garden adjoin the hall, and Gehry has laid out a sumptuous one. But he has also turned the entire city block that the site occupies into an urban park. Its cascading stairways, planted terraces and plazas are as ample as the foyers and staircases of the old Paris Opera, with the added advantage that they are set outside. You won't need a ticket to enjoy them. Nor will you have to quit the outdoors entirely to attend a concert. Skylights will admit natural light into the hall during the day.
What is most democratic about the design is the mutability of the images its forms give rise to. Gehry has not included fish, the creature that has occupied a place in his work analogous to the mouse in Disney's. Yet his grappling with those slippery shapes is discernible in the mercurial images that slither through Disney Hall's wavy contours. A ship. A cello. An unfolding flower. Hands thrust upward in delighted surprise. These images never crystallize. They surface and submerge like "the thing that dashes through the water," as Virginia Woolf once termed elusive insight.
The building is generous both in inviting such images and in refraining from making them explicit. It does not restrict the capacity of individual viewers to quarry their own figures and abstract images as they move through the building's serpentine spaces. That empathic approach is the essence of this building. It achieves unity by provoking multiple perspectives, and inviting them to co-exist in one place. The place will be the sum of the perceptions it invokes. That is why, when people climb the steps to Disney Hall, it is not a magic kingdom they'll be entering. It is a magic democracy.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Public Housing;
Seeking to Improve Quality in Shelter

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
REMEMBER the principle of economic mix in the tenancy, say the managers of large publicly assisted housing developments. It is one of the keys to success in providing decent housing to lower-income people over time.
The theme has been sounded again of late by Sally Hernandez-Pinero, chairwoman of the New York City Housing Authority for the last 10 months. "New York is working hard at keeping to the one-third, one-third, one-third mix on admissions," she said. She defined that in general terms as one-third elderly, one-third working families and one-third publicly assisted families. 
 Many pressures work against this effort. Some come from the state level. The situation takes on special significance at a time when the incoming Clinton Administration is likely to give a new look to housing policy and the way it is implemented at the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington.
The ability to sustain a desirable economic and social mix of tenants is one of the keys to the long-term quality of publicly assisted housing, housing managers say. There are others that also involve Washington's policies: adequate operating subsidies to compensate for declining rents; a reasonable amount of new production to ease the pressure on admissions; rules that give flexibility to competent local managements.
The principles apply to assisted rental housing in general. The Housing Authority is only one among many managers of low-income housing.
Quality, oddly enough, has gotten short shrift in recent years. In Washington the political pressures from opposite sides of the ideological spectrum threaten to push public housing heavily into the position of houser of very-low-income tenants only. Last year the Housing and Community Development Act attempted to reverse this trend by giving local authorities more discretion to achieve a diverse population.
In New York City, court rulings that effectively require local government to provide permanent housing to homeless people on demand have also had the effect of increasing the proportion of the dependent families in assisted housing generally.
The question is, will H.U.D. in the Democratic Administration start working collaboratively with local managements? Or will ideological issues continue to draw attention from the need to improve the quality of shelter?
The economic and social mix issue will be one test. Many public housing officials feel that in the 1980's the Department of Housing and Urban Development viewed public housing too exclusively as a preserve for the most disadvantaged tenants. At the same time, many advocates for the homeless were driving a Federal response that made the policy a reality.
Seven years ago, 35 percent of the new admissions to public housing in New York City were from the neediest segment of the population, with income from public assistance programs only. By last year this component, called Tier 1 by the Housing Authority, had reached 53 percent, roughly half the 4,000 new admissions each year.
Partly this was the result of Federal admissions standards under a five-year-old admissions preference program. Starting in 1987, housing agencies had to give preference on their waiting lists to people who are involuntarily displaced, people who live in substandard housing and people who pay more than 50 percent of their income for rent. By accelerating these families on waiting lists, new admissions have been weighted toward the lowest-income applicants.
DURING most of the 80's, 90 percent of new admissions had to meet these preference standards. Under the 1992 housing act, Congress authorized the Department of Housing and Urban Development to allow local housing agencies to adopt local standards for as much as 50 percent of new admissions. Once implemented this could lead to better economic and social balance in new admissions.
Meanwhile, public housing in New York has grown less attractive to many eligible working people, and certificates and vouchers have helped make alternatives feasible. These working families are defined as low income because they earn between 50 to 80 percent of areawide median income, or roughly $20,000 a year for a family of four. Currently they constitute only 16 to 18 percent of the total waiting list, the Housing Authority says. About 11 percent of new admissions are working families from this income tier. A typical household profile is a working mother with one or two children, earning about $15,500 a year.
The failure of Congress to make economic mix a consistent goal of housing policy has contributed to the problem nationally, many specialists agree. But the solution hardly lies in Washington exclusively. By agreeing to provide emergency shelter some years ago to any family on public assistance who requested it, New York City has found itself overwhelmed with demand for permanent housing from a heavy flow of families moving into limited but improved transitional housing facilities. Much of the rehousing burden has fallen on public housing, which also seeks to place young families doubled up within its own buildings.
In the last four years 25 percent of all new admissions to public housing were from the homeless population in transitional housing. In August the authority and the office of Mayor David N. Dinkins agreed that the authority would accept an annual allocation of only 1,670 homeless families, which would be 20 percent of total annual admissions.
On the production side, Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said she has no desire to move back to the days of large new housing projects. Instead she wants to use production allocation for renovating buildings supplied from the tax-foreclosed city-owned housing stock, or buying existing new but untenanted privately developed buildings, or acquiring housing units within developments produced under the New York Housing Partnership program of for-sale homes or the low-income buildings developed with tax-credit financing by the Local Initiative Support Corporation and the Enterprise Foundation.
Quality comes into play here as well. The most desirable new developments have turned out to be gut rehabilitations, built internally to Federal standards, of handsome older apartment buildings acquired from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development's tax-foreclosed housing stock.
The Housing Authority also hopes to be able to get HUD's permission to acquire newly developed privately owned buildings for public-housing tenants, said Deborah Wright, a board member who oversees development. "We've been made aware of buildings in Queens and Staten Island that were built for the market and then the market collapsed," she said. Buying them would be cheaper than building them.
That is the type of activity that has been difficult to carry out under Washington's thumb. Accordingly, the Housing Authority seeks more independence of action.
The Housing Authority runs about 180,000 apartments in public-housing developments. It also gets 61,000 certificates or vouchers that are issued to low-income housing seekers looking for apartments in privately owned buildings. In New York City in particular, with its huge housing stock and a large population unable to afford the rent necessary to sustain that housing, these Federal subsidies under the Section 8 program have proved particularly valuable.
Vouchers are more flexible than certificates, in that they allow tenants to pay more than 30 percent of their income as rent and are usually more "portable" than certificates because they are always issued to a tenant rather than a building. In both cases the Government makes up the difference between what the tenant can afford and what it calls the "fair market rent," the rent required for operation.
"WE have no problem issuing certificates and vouchers," said John Nelson, general manager of the Housing Authority. "We get about 1,000 new ones each year." The fact that tenants want them and find them usable suggests that this mechanism of serving the housing needs of lower-income people has been a success in New York. If the tenant cannot find a suitable apartment within 60 days, the certificate or voucher must be returned.
Another area in which public-housing advocates hope for a change in policy by the Clinton Administration is Federal spending on modernization of existing buildings. Programs to stimulate the economy, they say, could lead to an increase in spending over the $3.1. billion that Congress aleady appropriated for fiscal 1993, according to Maryann Russ, executive director of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities. In fiscal 1992 H.U.D. spent $2.5 billion.
"Money put into public housing modernization will create a lot of jobs," Ms. Russ said.

HEADLINE: Talking: Tax Planning;
Taking Advantage Of the Law

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
AT the close of the calendar year, along with partying and Santa Claus, comes the need for tax planning. For anyone who owns a home this means finding out about the tax deductions that might be available for use on the 1992 income tax return and doing something about those items that may need attention before year-end.
These can differ from year to year, as much as a result of changing personal circumstances as of alterations in the tax code. For one, "We've had a lot more people who became landlords for the first time because they couldn't sell," said Timothy Morse, a tax manager for KPMG Peat Marwick, the national accounting firm. And that change alone makes a dramatic difference in the tax status of property. 
 Martin M. Shenkman, a tax attorney in Manhattan, recommends starting by separating any bills, receipts or canceled checks for any improvements made during the year, putting them in an envelope with the year noted on the front and adding this to any existing folder containing documents connected with the property.
When a home is sold, the seller's accountant seeks the full "cost basis" to help minimize taxes due on the profits (if the gains cannot be deferred). The cost basis may include all subsequent improvements in addition to the original purchase price.
Because improvements may have been made over time -- new wiring here, a built-in bookcase there -- they are not easily documented, or even recalled, unless those papers are separately filed, said Mr. Shenkman.
William J. Greenberg, a certified public accountant in Manhattan whose practice is limited to co-ops and condominiums, reminds owners of these units that they can include as an improvement any special assessment levied to improve common areas such as a roof or lobby. However, an assessment used to make up a shortfall in cash flow -- perhaps because a growing number of owners have been delinquent in paying their common charges -- cannot be added to the cost basis.
Any home improvements that are being financed generate a more immediate tax benefit. Even though it's now common knowledge that the origination fees -- points charges -- connected with refinancing a mortgage are not fully tax deductible in the year in which they are incurred, this is not true of any additional mortgage financing being taken out for home improvements.
Mr. Shenkman provided the following example. Say, for example, a couple had an outstanding mortgage balance of $90,000. They decided to increase the loan balance to $120,000 to cover the $30,000 cost of a new kitchen -- a typical move in 1992 since the low interest rates made it possible to do so without sharply higher monthly payments. Points charges on the transaction came to $2,400.
The points charges directly applicable to the $30,000 being used for the improvements ($600) would be tax deductible. The tax deduction for the remaining fees would have to be amortized over the life of the loan.
Anyone who rented out a home during the year because he couldn't sell it should be aware that all expenses connected with its ownership and operation are now tax deductible as a business expense, said Mr. Morse. Under such circumstances even condominium common charges, formerly nondeductible, can be factored in. So can the full cost of co-op maintenance charges.
Anyone who might have lost a job during the year and who has since used part of the home as a home-based office should brush up on the tax benefits of doing so.
These benefits are now more easily calculated and identified as a result of a form (Form 8829) the Internal Revenue Service introduced last year. Its stated aim is to help the homeowner make the correct calculations, although critics say its goal was also to prevent abuses through more detailed reporting requirements.
Getting a copy of this form early in the season, either through an accountant, an office supply store or the I.R.S. itself (listed in the Blue Pages), should help the new home-office user better understand the regulations and gather the documents and data.
IF, on the other hand, a personal residence is about to be sold in 1993 and was being used as a home office, it might be better to disqualify the office by introducing domestic activities in the year of sale, such as a child's toy box, said Julian Block, a tax attorney in Larchmont, N.Y., and author of "The Homeowner's Tax Guide," available for $14.95 from Runzheimer International by calling (800) 942-9949.
If it remains a qualified office at the time of sale, noted Mr. Block, the taxes due on any profits attributable to that portion of the home -- say, 20 percent -- could no longer be rolled over into another residence. Instead, they would have to be paid immediately.
Thus, for example, if the sale generated a profit of $100,000, the disqualification could add a tax bill of $5,600 (20 percent of $100,000 x 28 percent) to any income taxes due, plus state of local levies.
Another common mistake, said Mr. Block, is to misunderstand the regulations that govern the once-in-a-lifetime capital gains tax exemption of $125,000 available to anyone over 55 years of age who may have sold a primary residence in 1992 or intends to do so in 1993.
To qualify, the owner must have passed his or her 55th birthday before the actual sale takes place -- not anytime during the year in which the sale is completed. Also, if the owners are a married couple they cannot each qualify for a $125,000 exemption. Only if they are divorced before the sale takes place, or the owners are not married, can each qualify for a separate $125,000 exemption.
Mr. Block also noted that this year may have been one of the first occasions when a substantial number of sellers failed to buy another residence of the same or higher value within the two-year period provided by the I.R.S. to qualify for tax deferment on the profits of the previous sale -- a consequence of the uncertain property market.
If so, he said, they will need to amend the return for the year in which that sale took place (probably 1990). When doing so, he said, they should be sure to include any offsetting capital losses available to them at the time of sale. Subsequent losses cannot be used to offset the profit.
Those capital losses may have come from the sale of stock, limited partnerships, investment real estate or a business failure.
Finally, despite recent Congressional attempts to change current law, losses incurred from the sale of a personal residence remain ineligible for tax benefits.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Concierges;
The Concierge Comes to Office Buildings

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
ONE recent morning, Bernadette Hakin, the office manager for Trebol International Corporation, walked into her office in the Seagram Building to a rather daunting sight: a pair of six-foot skis, with a note asking her to send them to her boss's son in Colorado. Sounds easy -- except how do you wrap skis, is the post office the cheapest way to get them there, do they need insurance, do they . . . ?
Ms. Hakin had no idea. So she made one call, to Penny Wallberg, the building's full-time concierge. Ms. Wallberg, in turn, made many calls. Result: The skis went out Federal Express two-day economy service, which Ms. Wallberg decided was the cheapest and safest way to get them there. 
 Now Ms. Hakin says she plans to "inundate" Ms. Wallberg with requests for flowers, for help with last-minute Christmas shopping, for mail services, for aircraft leasing, even for selling some excess furniture.
"Having a concierge is like having another employee," Ms. Hakin said.
Geoffrey C. Rockhill, the 38-story building's asset manager, loves hearing kudos like that. "For the cost of a salary plus benefits, we can cement our image as a high-service building," he said.
The Seagram Building is just one of a small but growing number to take a tip from the top hotels and put full-service concierges in their lobbies. There's one at 650 Fifth Avenue and another at 14 Wall Street. Management at One Exchange Plaza is talking about putting in an abbreviated concierge service that would offer such amenities as dispensing umbrellas on rainy days.
In all cases, the concierges are part of management's desperate search for ways to attract and retain tenants in a market where the competition grows ever fiercer.
"We wanted this building to be a distinct environment and that meant more than taking care of the elevator mechanicals," said John Wheeler, a managing director of Galbreath Riverbank, which manages 14 Wall for GE Investments.
Herbert Yellin, a managing director at Koppel, Tener, Riguardo, which manages 650 Fifth Avenue, is more blunt. The 36-story building is about 94 percent rented, but Mr. Yellin is by no means cavalier about lease renewals.
"We can't let anyone look at this building as just another office-space commodity," he said. "Sooner or later, if you're in a commodity business you fail." 
Indeed, with the glut of office space showing few signs of abating, even buildings that once rented on reputation alone are no longer trusting their laurels as resting places; many are replacing their carpeting and windows, overhauling their roofs and elevators, sprucing up their lobbies.
And now a handful also are looking for ways to humanize themselves to tenants by providing the type of one-on-one service that is more generally associated with the most expensive condominium apartments and residential hotels.
The Seagram Building, for example, has always been a prestigious address. The 34-year old landmarked building was designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and was one of the first to have a plaza out front.
But when new luxury office buildings like 712 Fifth Avenue and the Swiss Bank Tower at 10 East 50th Street came on stream a couple of years ago, the Seagram Building's management recognized that cachet was no longer enough. It is carpeting the common corridors and upgrading the air-conditioning. And, it reasoned, a concierge service would be particularly welcome to the 140 tenants, most of them individuals or small companies with meager support staffs.
"OUR best way to differentiate ourselves is to do everything we can to make life better for small tenants," Mr. Rockhill said.
Similarly, 14 Wall, whose location across from the New York Stock Exchange used to be selling point enough, has seen tenants and potential tenants siphoned away by the World Financial Center and other lower Manhattan buildings. The 33-story building has about 115,000 square feet of vacant space out of a total of 950,000, and 10 percent of its leases are rolling over in the next 12 months. Since GE Investments took the financially ailing building over in March, it has replaced the roof, the windows, the sidewalks. And even though its 25 tenants are primarily large companies, with large secretarial staffs, it has installed a full-service concierge.
One reason: The secretaries and events planners who held their jobs during the last decade's rash of corporate downsizing have had to assume many of the duties of those who lost theirs. That, in turn, has left them with far less time to meet the broad spectrum of requests that bosses can make.
"Concierges help the private secretaries meet their bosses' needs," said Mr. Wheeler.
Considering the low cost, full-service concierges are surprisingly rare in New York office buildings. There are a few in buildings in Philadelphia and Washington and probably at some scattered buildings elsewhere (there is no national organization of concierges, so it is impossible to track where they exist).
But New York has remained a hard sell. Some years ago a short-lived business called Concierge Services of America set up shop in New York, offering to supply trained concierges to office buildings for a fee, but it could not drum up enough interest to stay afloat, which Mr. Wheeler, for one, did not find surprising.
"There is no tangible bottom-line justification for a concierge, and most owners balk at even a low cost when they can't do a cost-benefits analysis on results," he said.
Many Class A buildings in New York have lobby people who carry the title of concierge. But rarely do they actually fulfill that function. Far more often they are adjuncts to the security desk and serve as uniformed repositories of information about the tenants and the area. Although they are happy to answer tenant's questions, they spend far more time dealing with visitors to the building.
At 712 Fifth Avenue, for example, Edward A. Van Sickle serves as concierge cum tour guide. He is supremely knowledgeable about the statuary in the lobby, the architecture, nearby restaurants, what's good to buy at Henri Bendel -- which has an entrance in the building -- and, of course, which tenant is on which floor. But as such he is more the building's face to the outside world, a greeter of visitors, than a service to tenants.
In contrast, concierges like Ms. Wallberg at Seagram, Ellen Starsia at 650 Fifth Avenue and Lisa Motzfeldt at 14 Wall Street serve the same function for tenants as their hotel counterparts do -- plus more. They will get theater and concert tickets, make restaurant reservations, order flowers. They will hold buildingwide functions like concerts and seminars and coordinate food and blood drives. And they neither expect nor accept tips for anything they do.
"Basically, tenants need just phone me with a project and I'll take care of the details and the work," Ms. Motzfeldt said.
Requests are not always run-of-the-mill. Ms. Motzfeldt has had to find pink lawn flamingos and an Uncle Sam poster ("Sounds simple? It took me three days before I found one, in a secondhand book store" she recalled.) and once shipped a hero sandwich overnight as a birthday present.
Ellen Starsia recently helped Diana Komito, an office administrator for Ithaca Industries, a tenant, find a $15 throwaway bridal bouquet and a place with a view for a reasonably priced office lunch (they went to the executive dining rooms on top of the Time-Life Building, a place Ms. Komito never thought of). She's been asked for gourmet baskets for people on restricted diets and welcome packages for relocating executives.
She even helped a maid working for a tenant at 650 Fifth Avenue find inexpensive uniforms. And she found a dry cleaner who could take care of the designer Joseph Abboud's ultra-expensive tuxedo in a few hours.
"Even if I'd known where to go, which I didn't, I couldn't have gotten such quick service," said Mabel Lovett, Mr. Abboud's executive assistant. "They know I'm a one-shot customer, but they probably figure she could provide repeat, volume business from an entire building."
In fact, since so many of the tenants at 650 Fifth are in the fashion business, cleaning services have become a staple request. "Ever try to find a laundramat in midtown?" asked Ms. Komito, who recently needed to get some fashion samples washed quickly. Ms. Starsia found a place near Second Avenue. "If Ellen can't find it, no one can," Ms. Komito said.
Even for services that are relatively easy to find, the concierges often can wield clout that small companies don't have. Carrie Webster, personnel administrator for GFT USA Corporation, recalls checking out a few catering places and restaurants when she needed to cater some in-house lunches. The prices seemed exorbitant, so she asked Ms. Starsia to see what she could turn up.
"Not only did she take the responsibility off my hands, but she got us great deals on everything from the sodas to desserts," Ms. Webster said. "She was calling with the clout of an entire building behind her, and that really made a difference."
Similarly, Interactive Data, a subsidiary of Dun & Bradstreet with offices at 14 Wall Street, wanted to hold a meeting, with meals, for about 65 people last month. Ms. Motzfeldt gathered brochures about facilities nearby, even visited a few. They wound up going to the Shearson Lehman Conference Center on Beach Street, a facility no one at Interactive Data knew existed.
"Lisa said, 'Tell us your needs and budget,' and she took it from there," said Debra Marty, Interactive Data's office manager.
It all sounds too good to be true -- and in fact, many tenants think it is. Although the concierge service is free (except for lengthy errands, for which most concierges charge about $15 a half hour), and available to anyone working in the building, from mailroom personnel to chief executive, many tenants remain skeptical.
"People always assume there's a cost associated, that you can't get this kind of service for free," said Ms. Webster of GFT, who says she's still having trouble persuading colleagues to ask Ms. Starsia for help.
INDEED, all the concierges say they have had to really drum up business for themselves. Ellen Starsia probably has the easiest time of it: She is the third concierge in two years (the two others weren't "proactive" enough, Mr. Yellin recalled), so although tenants say they hardly ever used her predecessors, the concept isn't entirely alien to them. She worked in the management office before becoming concierge, so most of the tenants knew her already. And while her building is hard to find -- the 650 Fifth Avenue address notwithstanding, the only entrance is on West 52d Street -- her glass-enclosed office, directly to the left of the entrance, is impossible to miss.
Still, she leaves nothing to chance. She held a cocktail party for tenants to remind them she was on call. And each week she invites a vendor to display wares for sale in her office. One week it's vintage jewelry, another it's handcrafted pens, others it's ceramic works, artistic birdhouses, sterling silver jewelry, teddy bears or even brownies from Greenwich Village. Ms. Starsia collects the money for the vendor, without commission.
"It's another way to get tenants to drop by the office," she said.
Ms. Motzfeldt, who just signed on in August, is starting from scratch. What's more, her Art Deco wood desk is obscured from the entrance by the security desk, although the huge bouquet she always keeps on it can be seen from the front door. So she has sent a newsletter to tenants introducing herself and describing the services she can provide. She will send out newsletters every few months.
SLOWLY, tenants are starting to test the waters, calling on her for some distinctly unconcierge-like duties.
"People walk past the desk, see Lisa and say, 'Oh, by the way, I meant to call the building office. The paper towels are out in the 21st floor men's room or a faucet is dripping,' " said Mr. Wheeler. "She's facilitating communications between the tenants and building management, and that's a fringe benefit we did not anticipate."
Tenants echo that theme. Ward Mauck, president of the American Institutue of Marine Underwriters, still books his own airline reservations and gets his own theater tickets. But one thing he simply had not been able to do for himself: get mangement to list his name on the directory at 14 Wall. So he asked Ms. Motzfeldt to take care of it. She called management, and the name is now up.
"It's a lot easier to just tell Lisa something than to deal with the building manager by phone," Mr. Mauck said. "And she gives the building a sense of class."
Ms. Wallberg has probably the most formidable getting-to-know-you task. She just joined the building fresh from the Regency Hotel in October. She sits at a large rectangular desk at the back of the lobby, behind the elevator banks, easily spotted from the side entrances but practically invisible from the front. (The management plans to move the desk up front soon.)
So Ms. Wallberg has sent a note around to tenants introducing herself and listing all the services she's ready to provide. "I'm still only getting a couple of calls a day, but it's starting to pick up," she said.
Indeed it is. There was the gourmet basket and African violet she found for one office that wanted to send it to the boss's hospitalized wife. There were Ms. Hakin's skis.
And there were the Four Seasons reservations she got for Janel Moll, credit manager at Korff USA, who says she never really saw a need for a concierge service.
"She got me the best table in the house," said Ms. Moll, now a convert to the service.

HEADLINE: Tale of Two Cities: Yonkers and 'Yonkers'

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
THIS is a story about Hollywood make-believe. It is the story of one city that wants to be a star and another that lost a chance for stardom. It is also a glimpse at how one movie was made and the trail of disappointment it left behind here.
The story begins in the imagination of Neil Simon, the playwright who wrote "Lost in Yonkers." His story, which won a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award -- about two young brothers sent to live above a candy store with their grandmother -- takes place in the Yonkers of 1942. Most of the play is set inside an apartment, where the boys are swept into a tangle of bewildering family relationships. 
 Cut to the environs of Cincinnati, where "Lost in Yonkers," the movie, was filmed last summer. Cincinnati is hilly, like Yonkers. Like Yonkers, it has a river running alongside it. Unlike Yonkers, however, Cincinnati is not in high-priced metropolitan New York City. So, for financial reasons, said Martha Coolidge, the director of "Lost in Yonkers," Cincinnati won out as the location.
Speaking from Culver City, Calif., where the film is being edited, the director said she had wanted to make the movie in Yonkers and was disappointed when she couldn't. "I didn't want to lose the atmosphere," Ms. Coolidge said, adding that she had extensively photographed the city and communities to the north along the river.
 
Cincinnati Area 'in a Time Warp'
 Joe Caracciolo, the movie's executive producer, said he had also hoped to film here but trying to lower labor costs and other expenses became "an exercise in futility." Trying to create a 1940's look in Yonkers or Nyack would have been especially expensive, he said, while areas around Cincinnati are "more or less in a time warp."
"Lost in Yonkers," which was produced by the Raystar Production Company of Culver City, is scheduled for release by Columbia Pictures in August. Mr. Caracciolo would not divulge the movie's budget, but it was reported to be $13 million, not high by today's standards.
The Directors Guild of America, which has offices in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, also wanted the film to be made here. Alan S. Gordon, Eastern executive secretary of the guild, which represents nearly 10,000 motion picture and television directors and their assistants, said Yonkers's loss was part of the "terrible, devastating loss" in film production that the New York City area had experienced since the spring of 1990, when a disagreement with unions led to a seven-month boycott of the region by major film studios.
The Directors Guild intervened on behalf of Yonkers last spring, trying to help the producers make deals with the unions, said Mr. Gordon, a Scarsdale resident. He added, "We had a big battle to change their minds, but we got into it too far down the road, when the psychological decision to shoot somewhere else was already made."
 
No Calls Received
 Mr. Gordon added that the guild tried to fill a leadership vacuum in Mayor David N. Dinkins's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, which had been without a director since last April. (The position has since been filled by Richard Brick, a member of the Directors Guild, who began work on Nov. 30.) It is Mr. Gordon's view that if the Manhattan office had lobbied aggressively to keep "Lost in Yonkers" here, it might have succeeded, although Patrick Pleven, an assistant director for broadcasting in Mayor Dinkins's office, said the guild "never called us about anything" regarding the film.
Yonkers's loss may be measured by Cincinnati's recent boom as a film- production capital. Lori Holladay, executive director of the Greater Cincinnati Film Commission -- which encompasses parts of Kentucky and Indiana -- said the filming there of 12 motion pictures in the last five years had pumped $30 million into the local economy and created 10,000 jobs. The films, which include "Eight Men Out" and "Little Man Tate" as well as "A Rage in Harlem" and "The Public Eye," both of which are set in Manhattan, generated "lots of tax dollars, from payroll taxes to sales taxes to hotel taxes," she added.
The commission, which didn't exist five years ago and is now staffed full time only by Ms. Holladay, is "looking into building a studio here to better accommodate production companies," she said. She is an enthusiastic saleswoman who has persuaded producers in Manhattan and Los Angeles that Cincinnati can look like any city anywhere at just about any time they would like.
Indeed, said Ms. Coolidge, director of such films as "Rambling Rose" and "Real Genius," Cincinnati has "entire neighborhoods that have been arrested in periods from the 1750's, 1850's and 1950's." She added, "It's an amazing place to shoot period films."
 
Other Sites Also Used
 But as Cincinnati's star rises, and other cities like Toronto, Pittsburgh and Wilmington, N.C., aggressively market themselves as New York and California look-alikes, what is the cost to film authenticity? Yael Woll, an award-winning film and television director who serves as national vice president of the Directors Guild, thinks the artistic cost is high. "The bottom-line budget in the larger scheme of things is virtually irrelevant to the eventual success of a project," said Mr. Woll, a Bedford resident. "To put up four walls and call it a room -- that's converting everything into mass entertainment."
Films about Manhattan and its suburbs should be shot there to capture the area's true ambiance, he added, although New York will "never compete with Cincinnati or Dallas" on an economic level. "The real problem," Mr. Woll said, "is how to convince the studio people that there is a life here -- a creative energy that ought to be exploited."
Ms. Coolidge said she is happy with how "Lost in Yonkers" looks, but turning suburban Cincinnati into Yonkers was no small task. (Much of the movie was shot in Ripley and Wilmington, Ohio, and Ludlow and Augusta, Ky.) For one thing, she said, the Ohio River runs in a "curvy east-west" direction instead of "straight north-south" like the Hudson. "We could never find a location where the sun crossed the river properly" and set over what was supposed to be New Jersey, the director said. Furthermore, there were no Palisades.
The Southern accents of the bit players also posed a problem for the movie, which stars Richard Dreyfuss, Mercedes Ruehl and Irene Worth. Ms. Coolidge said the local actors received coaching lessons in how to talk like New Yorkers.
 
Photographs Made Available
 If the movie captures the feel of mid-century Yonkers, in large part it will be thanks to a group of city employees and longtime residents who provided the film makers with historical facts and reminiscences. Michael Rebic, the principal historic preservation planner with the Yonkers Department of Planning and Economic Development Bureau, said that last winter, before the decision was made to film in Cincinnati, he and others met with Lillian Michelson, an independent California research librarian contracted by Ray-
star. They gave her a tour of the city, provided her with photographs of Yonkers in the 1940's and a videotape of municipal films from the period and put her in touch with people like Philip R. Pistone and Jerry Wiffler.
Mr. Pistone, a 68-year-old retired Yonkers Planning Commissioner, said he had lived over a grocery store on Palisade Avenue here as a child and could identify with the movie's characters. He said he had "had a grand time" with the Hollywood group, inviting them into his home and having dinner with them. All Yonkers needed was "a little dressing up and cleaning up and it would have been just fine," Mr. Pistone said wistfully. "I thought it was a fait accompli."
Mr. Wiffler, a 28-year-old member of the Yonkers Landmarks Preservation Board and a fifth-generation resident of the city, said he made his personal collection of photographs available to Ms. Coolidge when she visited here and was one of her tour guides. Mr. Wiffler, who is also a trustee of the Yonkers Historical Society, said he showed the director buildings that looked "virtually unchanged since the 1940's," which he felt captured the flavor of the story.
Communication between the film makers and city officials cooled once the crew moved to Cincinnati, but requests for help continued to arrive at City Hall and at the Hudson River Museum and the Yonkers Public Library. Mr. Rebic said a new researcher in Cincinnati replaced Ms. Michaelson and in an imperious way asked him to send "a laundry list of details" to the film makers.
 
'The Play Was Wonderful'
 The list included questions about "the color of the street signs, the color of the median lines painted in the streets in the 1940's and what the parking meters looked like, if there were any," Mr. Rebic said. He added:
"I was taken aback by the tone. I faxed back that what she had asked for would take several weeks of research and that the city didn't have the staffing or ability to do this. I suggested that if they wanted to send someone here, we would be happy to cooperate. That was the last I heard."
Dee Barbato, the city's public information officer, said the episode had let Yonkers down a second time. The first time was when Mr. Simon, the playwright, turned down an invitation to visit the city after "Lost in Yonkers" opened on Broadway.
About her brush with Hollywood, Ms. Barbato said, "We were really quite excited about the whole venture and equally disappointed that it fell through."
Neither she nor anyone else here bear the film makers hard feelings, however. "I will absolutely see the film," Ms. Barbato said. "It's Yonkers. The play was wonderful. If the movie is half as good, I'm sure it will be a success."
Having lost in Yonkers, the city can perhaps content itself with something else: the good opinion of people who live 3,000 miles away. Ms. Michaelson, for one, called her experience in Yonkers "one of the high points of my life."
The people she met here, she said, "had the epitome of Southern hospitality in their bones."

HEADLINE: A Church in Scarsdale Losing All 3 Ministers

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: SCARSDALE

 BODY:
TWO years after rebuilding its sanctuary in the wake of a suspicious fire, the Hitchcock Presbyterian Church here must withstand another trauma. All three of its ministers have resigned, including its ecumenical-minded senior minister, the Rev. Robert S. MacLennan.
Sitting amid packing clutter in the church office he has occupied for nine years, Dr. MacLennan, who has forged strong bonds with the county's Jewish community, said irreconcilable differences among the ministerial staff had led to his resignation in mid-October. The Rev. Norman Stanton and the Rev. Shannon White, associate pastors, announced last month that they would also resign. 
 The resignations, which were said to stem from personality clashes and no particular single event, have made public deep rifts in the Hitchcock congregation, which pulled together after the 1986 fire to raise $6 million for a new sanctuary. "There are open wounds," said Jim Oberhelman, a Hitchcock elder who serves as an assistant church administrator.
The three ministers took part in counseling sessions with a mediator to try to avert the present crisis. Ms. White, who has served as a youth minister since joining the staff three years ago, likened the church to a family in which there are often conflicting relationships.
 
A Leader in Interfaith Relations
 "The church has been struggling for centuries" with such conflicts, including those among its clergy, she said, adding that Hitchcock's present situation was "not out of the ordinary."
Dr. MacLennan, a biblical scholar, earned his doctorate in early Christian texts on Jews and Judaism. He is a recognized county leader in interfaith relations and known for organizing such events as ecumenical Thanksgiving Day services at the church and a service in both Japanese and English to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Dr. MacLennan is also a co-chairman of the Westchester Holocaust Commission and Foundation, which sponsored the Garden of Remembrance in White Plains.
The minister said he plans to move with his wife, Jane, a lawyer, to Princeton, N.J., where he will consult on church affairs, write and teach and continue his present volunteer work at the Princeton Theological Seminary. He said he would remain on the advisory board of Moral Rearmament, an international peace group, and would continue his connection with the Holocaust Commission.
Phyllis Goldman, who directed the Holocaust Commission and is president of the county chapter of the American Jewish Committee, said Dr. MacLennan's work to build bridges between Christians and Jews had made "a tremendous impact" on the community and that his leaving would create "a true void."
 
'Growing and Constriction Pains'
 "Who is going to stand up and fill that void?" she asked. "We're in such troubled times now. I hope there are others who will stand up and take this on."
Mr. Oberhelman said that if he could "describe in one word what Bob has meant to us, he is a teacher, capitalized and italicized -- probably one of the finest biblical teachers I have ever come across. He speaks and understands Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek and Latin and reads for us from all of the texts in the original language."
Mr. Oberhelman, a self-employed businessman here, said that like many other traditional Protestant churches, Hitchcock was experiencing "growing and constriction pains" in a changing society. "We have looked at ourselves over time and have figured out we're not the church we were 25 years ago when there were 2,500 members and no financial problems," he said of the 850-member congregation. Besides new economic stresses, he said, "We need to start confronting questions about the changing multiracial and ethnic makeup of our congregation."
The formerly all-white congregation now includes several black families and many Japanese and Korean families, Mr. Oberhelman said. "How do you reach out to these other communities as white Anglo-Saxon Protestants?" he asked. "How do we grow the church when the traditional ways no longer apply?"
A committee is looking for two interim ministers to take over when Dr. MacLennan and Mr. Stanton leave this month. Ms. White will remain on the job at the church until February. Meanwhile, Dr. MacLennan, who described the present turmoil as "embarrassing, diminishing and sad," continues to preach Sunday sermons and keep on with a semblance of normal church life.
He will deliver his final sermon at Hitchcock next Sunday at 11 A.M., on the topic, "Why Is the Birth of Jesus So Important?" Before that, on Saturday from 4 to 6 P.M., religious leaders from churches and temples in the area will gather for a farewell service and reception for Dr. MacLennan. The event is open to the community.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Christmas 1993: Store Sales Up, Stocks Down

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
FOR the first time in three years, it looks as though Christmas will be a merry one for the nation's retailers. But on Wall Street, that already is being treated as old news. Share prices in the big store chains peaked within a day or two of Thanksgiving, the traditional kickoff of the shopping season.
That performance appears to provide another piece of evidence of how the stock market can be a leading indicator, showing knowledge of what is going to happen long before the economists or the politicians figure it out. Retail stocks began to leap just as summer, along with rhetoric about how bad the economy was, began to heat up. 
 From the end of June through Thanksgiving Day, an index of 12 retail shares rose 18.1 percent, while the Standard & Poor's 500 was up just 6.3 percent. But since then, the S.& P. has continued to move up, while the retail index has fallen 2.2 percent.
It is that underperformance that perhaps should be attracting attention now. Maybe it is nothing more than a momentary setback, a blip in a continuing recovery. Or maybe it is a warning that the surge in consumer spending is not destined to be long-lasting.
For those looking for signs that the recent rally in share prices is going to falter, the turnaround in retail stocks is not the only available indicator. While the Dow Jones industrial average registered a small gain last week, indexes of small stocks turned lower. The Nasdaq composite declined after rising for eight consecutive weeks. The drop was not large, but it came, as Robert Farrell, Merrill Lynch's chief market analyst, noted, amid virtual unanimity that small stocks were the place to be. The market has a way of frustrating such widely held opinions.
In any case, the strong Christmas season does appear to be here, whatever happens on Wall Street. "Things are going very well, unless you happen to be in California," said Daniel Barry, Merrill's retail analyst, who is forecasting that this season's sales for the industry will be up 8 percent from last year, after falling 1.5 percent in 1990 and rising just 1.3 percent last year. Some retailers are scrambling for merchandise, a problem Mr. Barry said was especially acute for J. C. Penney's catalogue operation.
Mr. Barry was a big booster of retail stocks for most of 1992, but he has turned cautious, noting that sales in the first few months of this year were pretty good, so comparisons will be tough in early 1993.
An important question for retail stocks, and for the economy as a whole, is whether consumer confidence, which spurted after the election, will keep rising. One possible negative will be the result of George Bush's failed effort to stimulate the economy earlier this year. Then he changed the rules on tax withholding, increasing the take-home pay of millions of workers by a few bucks a week. In early 1993, those workers will find out they will be getting smaller tax refunds than they are used to receiving. That fact is not likely to make them want to spend more.

THE ECONOMY
 
Clinton's Team Looks a Lot Like Cuomo's 

Aside from Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, whom President-elect Clinton tapped for Treasury Secretary, and Representative Leon E. Panetta of California, his choice for budget director, Mr. Clinton's dream team of economic advisers all have the same pedigree: they were part of the economic brain trust of Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York. Mr. Clinton's team of pinstripes and mortarboards -- Robert B. Reich, Labor Secretary; Robert E. Rubin, senior economic adviser; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Roger C. Altman, Deputy Treasury Secretary all advised the Cuomo Commission on economic competitiveness, said Vincent Tese, Director of Economic Development for New York. What kind of policies will the dream team promote? "They'll be working on a growth strategy with investment tax credits as the cornerstone," Mr. Tese said. "The idea is for G.D.P. to grow at 3 percent a year or better."

Taking the Deficit Pledge
 
"The economy, stupid" may have been what brought President-elect Clinton to Washington, but now that the economy's breath is once again fogging the mirror, what will Mr. Clinton do? Last week at a meeting in Washington, Mr. Clinton said he would make good on his pledge to leave the country with a "substantially smaller" budget deficit at the end of his term, but he refrained from promising how small the deficit would be. The deficit is expected to reach $340 billion in 1993. And while recent statistics may be showing that the economy has left its comatose state, Mr. Clinton cautioned the country not to confuse signs of life with economic health. The "evidence is more mixed," he said, adding that long-term problems, like the nation's slow productivity growth, must still be addressed.

Cable's Next Rival
 
For decades, cable TV systems have had no competition. That is beginning to change. First the Federal Communications Commission said it would let local phone companies carry "video dial tones" and now it has approved a new microwave technology that uses super-high-frequency radio waves to transmit 49 channels of television. The new system sends signals over the airwaves and is far less expensive to install than cable. The F.C.C. proposed offering licenses to two companies in each market and gave Cellular Visions of Freehold, N.J., which developed the technology, the choice of a license in either New York or Los Angeles. "It's another form of competition that we're prepared to face," said Carole Shandler, a spokeswoman for Cablevision Systems, based in Woodbury, L.I.

Finally, a Rosier Forecast
 
The nation's purchasing managers are to the economy what the groundhog is to spring. The National Association of Purchasing Managers surveys its 300 members' corporate buying activities and forecasts future economic activity. Last week the association's members overwhelmingly said they expected business activity to pick up next year -- but with a caveat. Though business will be better, it will not boom. The group forecast a 5.2 percent increase in revenues for the companies, after inflation. But while the upturn won't be robust, at least it will be widespread. "There wasn't a single industry that predicted a decrease in revenues in 1993 over 1992," said Robert Bretz, chairman of the group's business survey committee.

Keeping Inflation in Check
 
Outside of Detroit, few businesses are bold enough to raise prices when the economy turns sluggish. As a result, according to the Labor Department, prices at the producer level fell 0.2 percent in November, after inching up by a barely perceptible 0.1 percent in October. "Inflation is well contained," said Donald Kohn, director of monetary affairs at the Federal Reserve.
 
Those incredibly shrinking prices at the producer level have had a salubrious effect on consumer prices. According to the Labor Department, the Consumer Price Index increased by 0.2 percent in November, after increasing by 0.4 percent in October. Inflation for the year is running at 3.1 percent.

Out of the Woodwork
 
It may be a green Christmas after all. Retail sales grew by 0.4 percent in November, the fifth monthly gain in a row. "This raises the possibility that real G.D.P. in the fourth quarter could be as high as 3 percent," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.

 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Why Yeltsin Is Stymied
 
When President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia failed to get his Congress to approve his economic plan along with his choice for Prime Minister, Yegor Gaidar, he accused the legislative body of seeking to return the country to the dark days of Communism. Then Mr. Yeltsin proposed holding a national referendum next month to determine who is the country's boss -- the President or the Congress. But not everyone agrees that Congress is against reform; some say it's just Mr. Yeltsin's current plans. "Who gave Yeltsin special powers to conduct his economic reform? Congress," said Vladimir Kvint, a professor of international business at Fordham University. What annoys Congress now is that Mr. Yeltsin's reforms have been badly executed, Mr. Kvint said. "When Gaidar started the reform process, inflation was 150 percent. Now it's 1,850 percent a year."
 
Stopping Soviet Brain Drain
 
While Mr. Yeltsin and the Congress wrangle, Russia's scientific establishment continues to crumble. To keep former Soviet scientists working, George Soros, the American investor and philanthropist, said he would give $100 million over the next two years to support the researchers. "To lose them because of economic difficulties would be really a loss for mankind," Mr. Soros said.

A Japanese Chip Coup
 
Cramming ever more memory capacity onto a wafer of silicon is a high-stakes business. Taking the lead in that race were four Japanese companies -- Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC and Toshiba -- which disclosed they had independently developed chips that store 256-megabits of information, 64 times more capacity than current chips. But that does not mean they will have the market to themselves. "You can assume that other makers have comparable levels of technology," said Hiroyuki Mizuno, an executive at rival Matsushita Electric Industrial Corporation.

 
 
COMPANIES

 
Lockheed's Longer Reach
 
With the Pentagon's budget shrinking, the nation's arms makers have been scurrying around to consolidate their operations and pare down their work forces. Last week, in the largest consolidation so far, the Lockheed Corporation said it would acquire the General Dynamics Corporation's military aircraft division for $1.53 billion in cash. Lockheed, which already has the lion's share of the contract to build the Air Force's next-generation F-22 fighter, will now also be responsible for putting together the F-16. The sale is part of the General Dynamics strategy of shedding military businesses where it does not retain dominance. "There is massive overcapacity in the industry and this merger is the first real step toward rationalizing that capacity," said William A. Anders, chairman of General Dynamics.
 
The Big Three Join Forces
 
Electric cars are the vehicles of the future. At least they are in California, where tough new emissions standards go into effect in 1998 requiring at least 2 percent of each manufacturer's cars to have zero emissions. Trouble is, developing those cars takes a lot of scratch, the one commodity Detroit is short of right now. To remedy that, Detroit's highly competitive Big Three have already wired together an alliance to develop lightweight, long-lasting batteries. Last week they said they were also exploring ways to work together to develop a common infrastructure for recharging tomorrow's battery-powered cars.
 
Iacocca to the Rescue?
 
Ross Perot may not be the only one with a rescue complex. What about Lee A. Iacocca? Mr. Iacocca, who will retire as chairman of the Chrysler Corporation later this month, left a cushy job at the Ford Motor Company to nurse Chrysler back to health in the early 1980's. And last week he was in New York talking to investment bankers and members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers about forgoing a cozy, perk-filled retirement to battle Trans World Airlines back to health. T.W.A. is struggling to emerge from Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Why ask Mr. Iacocca to be the rescuer? "There are only a few people with his ability to instill confidence," said Brian Freeman, an investment banker working with T.W.A. Will he do it? Mr. Iacocca said he is not looking for a full-time job.

What's Next? McBroccoli?
 
The newest "burger" being tested by the McDonald's Corporation contains all the trimmings and none of the meat. But McDonald's is doing its best to play down the significance of its new meatless fare so it won't scare off any hard-core carnivores loyal to Big Macs and MacDLT's. "It's only a five-restaurant test in the Netherlands," said Richard Starmann, senior vice president at the company's headquarters near Chicago. Health-food advocates, vegetarians and animal rights activists have applauded the test burger, which is made of potatoes, peas, carrots, onions and spices. Peas and carrots? Aren't those vegetables? The test will expand to 84 stores next month. "But that's only 84 stores out of nearly 13,000 worldwide, 1 country out of 63," Mr. Starmann explained.

Serious Cutting at Northwest
 
Like most domestic carriers, Northwest Airlines has had its share of recent disappointments. Not only did this year's fare war sap its earnings, but it ran out of credit last month. Northwest managed to get a new $250 million line of credit, but to regain its altitude it must also trim expenses. It's doing just that. It got an agreement with lenders to defer $340 million in payments in 1993 and began talks with its unions. But the deepest cuts came when it canceled $3.5 billion worth of aircraft orders from Airbus Industrie.

Risk-Reward in Latin Debt Funds

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
SEEKING to capitalize on investors' frustration with rock-bottom yields in the United States, a trio of closed-end bond funds that invest in Latin American debt and yield roughly 11 percent have come to market in the last five months.
The yields are high, of course, because the risk is high. Combine Latin America's long history of political turmoil with illiquid fund holdings and some leverage, and "you've got a pretty dicey investment," said Thomas J. Herzfeld, who specializes in closed-end investment and analysis in Miami. Invest only small amounts in these funds, analysts warn, and only when their share prices fall from premium levels. 
 Analysts call the 1980's in Latin America the "lost decade," but the outlook has changed as many controlled economies converted to free markets. More recently, Latin American equity funds multiplied to the point of satiety, so closed-end sponsors have turned to debt.
The Latin America Dollar Income fund, managed by Scudder, Stevens & Clark, came to market in July. The Emerging Markets Income Fund, managed by Salomon Brothers, began selling in October, and the Alliance World Dollar Government Fund started up in November.
The Latin funds reduce currency risk by buying dollar-denominated bonds -- mainly Brady bonds, issued under a program designed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady in 1990 to help developing countries refinance their debt. In most issues, the principal is guaranteed by zero-coupon United States Treasury bonds; in many, 12 to 18 months of interest is also guaranteed.
The Scudder fund invests mostly in Mexico (32 percent), Argentina (21 percent), Venezuela (19 percent) and Brazil (17 percent).
The Alliance fund invests mainly in Mexico (20 percent), the Philippines (15 percent), the United States (15 percent), Venezuela (10 percent), Argentina (10 percent) and Brazil (5 percent).
Emerging Markets focuses on Mexico, Argentina, the Philippines and Morocco, Salomon Brothers said, refusing to be more specific.
Because the funds own mostly government securities, investors may think they are as safe as United States Government bond funds. Not so. They are basically junk bond funds, especially vulnerable to sudden policy shifts -- Brazil's recent refusal to negotiate with the International Monetary Fund is one example. And there are coup attempts, as in Venezuela recently.
The danger of default in Latin America dates back to 1890, when the House of Baring, a prosperous London financial firm, guaranteed interest on its loans to Argentina. When the issues defaulted, a panic ensued. British investment trusts, predecessors of today's closed-end funds, suffered large losses. Latin American defaults came in the 1980's, too.
Then there is the danger of leverage. The Latin America Dollar Income fund, which is authorized by its prospectus to leverage up to one-third of its portfolio through bank borrowing, has already taken $10 million in loans against its $92 million in assets. As 80's survivors learned, leverage is bad news indeed when interest rates rise.
Share-price volatility is also a problem. Because Brady bonds are long-term issues, share prices will move sharply when interest rates shift, falling markedly if rates climb.
Add to that the usual concerns about buying new closed-end fund issues: that underwriters' costs are built into the offering price and that initial investors also bear the transaction costs to assemble the portfolio.
The Latin America Dollar Income fund, for example, traded at a 6.9 percent premium at inception. The premium rose briefly to 12 percent, then disappeared this month. Since July, the share price has fallen 12 percent.
But the biggest risk comes from taking advantage of an accounting method used by the funds to bolster income. To yield 10 percent, for example, a fund might earn 8 percent from its underlying bonds and then count in 2 percent more from the year-by-year increase in value of its zero-coupon bonds. That's fine, unless the zeros hit a stretch before maturity where their values drop, and you want to sell.
Finally, a restructuring of the debt or a setback in the United States Treasury markets, to which the Brady bonds are tied, would create capital losses that would come out of shareholders' pockets.
Mr. Herzfeld is considering buying the Latin American Dollar fund as a short-term play. He assumes it will fall to a discount of 5 percent to 10 percent before year-end as people dump shares to lock in tax losses. He then expects prices to rebound, enabling him to sell at a profit in January.
Michael Porter, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham, says that if President-elect Clinton stimulates the United States economy and investment yields move back up, why not wait to buy United States issues rather than risking Brady bonds? For investors who insist on Latin America, he recommends Latin America Dollar, even at a slight premium, but for no more than 5 percent of a portfolio.
Ron Olin, president of Deep Discount Advisers, in Houston, says the Latin American debt funds are just too pricey and advises not buying until they trade at discounts of 10 percent or so.

The Britain-First Cure Is Working

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
It is only technically accurate to call what occurred in rural Vermont last weekend a retreat. True, some 50 A-list women, influential in policy, economics, the women's movement and plain old politics, gathered away from the ambitions and distractions of everyday life to develop an economic plan attendant to the needs of women.
But by all accounts the proximity of what most of the participants would call the Clinton millennium, at least for now, gave the gathering the kinetic force of an advance rather than a retreat. In the week since the meeting ended, members of the group have revised an outline into a working paper they will circulate at President-elect Bill Clinton's "economic summit" in Little Rock, which begins tomorrow. 
 "It was the best meeting I've been to in 20 years," said Betty Friedan, one of the weekend's organizers, who has been to her share of meetings in 30 years of feminist advocacy.
Hyperbole? A return to influence after a long exclusion from power can be intoxicating. But it seems quite possible that the meeting in Vermont may turn out to be a watershed feminist event.
It represents a departure from the defensive position women's groups have been forced into generally since the last Democratic Administration. And though the women's movement has roared back in the last couple of years from a political coma, much of its specific agenda -- the struggle to protect reproductive rights, for example -- is still reactive.
"Working on reproductive rights wasn't our agenda," said Linda Tarr-Whelan, executive director of the Center for Policy Alternatives and a major force behind the meeting. "It was put on the table by the right wing."
The weekend, Ms. Tarr-Whelan said, was dedicated to developing a "pro-active" agenda for the first 100 days of the Clinton Administration. When the call went out a few weeks ago, invitees scrambled their schedules to make room for the trip to Vermont.
Organizers invited a long list of eclectic, high-powered but apparently mellowed feminists. "Egos were checked at the door," said Sarah Kovner, a member of the Clinton transition's economic cluster, who was there. Others present included movement veterans like Bella Abzug, Ms. Friedan and Carol Bellamy, at least two corporate executives, several foundation representatives and academics, and one or two other Clinton people. Diana Meehan and Gary David Goldberg, Hollywood F.O.B.& H., donated their estate.
The luster of the stars apparently did nothing to disguise the tarnish on the American economy and the worry it causes. "Clinton tapped into concern and anxiety in the general population," said Heidi Hartmann, director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, a Washington research organization. "This is a logical extension of that."
Impetus for the weekend came in part from the results of a bipartisan, multi-ethnic poll sponsored earlier this year by the Center for Policy Alternatives and the Ms. Foundation for Women. What issues, pollsters asked, do women really care about?
The poll revealed that women, like most Americans, worry most about the economy and jobs. Health care ranked second, with crime and education close behind. More than half the women surveyed reported that they had "fallen behind economically" during the previous year. Four-fifths said that discrimination in pay is a problem and about three-quarters favored tougher anti-discrimination laws. The family values movement aside, few were interested in full-time homemaking. "Women are totally committed to work and family," said Ms. Tarr-Whelan. "They are looking for the ability to control their own time."
The group emphasizes that its suggestions are designed to complement rather than contradict proposals already on the policy table of the new Administration. Proposals in the seven-page document are organized into five categories:
* Flexible work structures, including flex- and part-time arrangements, job-sharing and compressed workweeks.
* Equal pay for work of equal value.
* Expanded entrepreneurial opportunities for women.
* A redefinition of "infrastructure" to include people and communities, so that women and families benefit from increased government investment.
* A rethinking of welfare from subsistence-level support into a program that could provide economic security.
The group asks, for example, that Mr. Clinton issue an Executive Order mandating flexible work arrangements in Federal workplaces and one requiring Federal contractors to implement equal-pay-for-equal-work schemes. The working paper calls for stronger enforcement of anti-discrimination laws, a move, Ms. Hartmann argues, that would increase productivity and income. "It goes to women's purchasing power," she said.
 MS. FRIEDAN and others argue that many of the group's initial proposals are low-ticket items that could be done cheaply and easily, a contention possibly designed to forestall any eye-rolling, "there you go again" responses from the deficit-reduction types appointed to the Clinton economic team last week.
Innumerable feminist working papers have emerged from countless meetings over the last two decades, all on an express train to the archives. The women's economic policy working paper is already getting a hearing. Members of the group have met with a representative of the transition team and some of the women present in Vermont -- Ms. Tarr-Whelan and Ms. Meehan, for two -- have been invited to the summit meeting. The sense of liberation so many experienced last weekend wasn't just the effects of that clean Vermont air.

The Britain-First Cure Is Working

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
WHEN it abandoned the heart of its economic strategy in September and allowed the pound to float in value outside the European system of semi-fixed exchange rates, the British Government said it was adopting a new policy tailored for the needs of Britain, not of a unified Europe.
The new approach, which has consisted primarily of slashing interest rates and paying little attention to the tumble in the pound's value, has not yet lifted the nation out of its three-year recession. But, by reducing the costs of borrowing, it seems to have given a kick to the economy, and it has been an undeniable winner on the London stock exchange, where share prices rose to their all-time highs at the beginning of this month. 
 Having bottomed in September at 2,281, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares surged 22 percent over the following two and a half months, peaking on Dec. 1 at 2,792.
It has since slipped somewhat on profit taking, on concern about the effect of an economic downturn in Germany and on a growing consensus that rates will not fall any further in the next several months. Share prices fell last week, and the index closed on Friday at 2,716.2, down 43.2 for the week.
The rapid run-up in share prices during the fall was fueled by interest-rate cuts that pushed the benchmark base lending rate from 10 percent in September down to the current 7 percent. Now investors are wondering whether they have bet correctly that lower rates will bring a rebound in the economy and in corporate profits next year, and whether the market will surge further.
Economists and analysts said the evidence is mixed. Inflation has continued to fall. There have been some tentative signs of an upturn in consumer spending and confidence. Retail sales and car registrations, for example, have both started rising in the last several months. Retailers reported more early Christmas traffic in many locations, with consumers showing a somewhat greater willingness to spend despite continued concerns about rising unemployment -- now at 10 percent -- and falling home prices.
Because most homeowners in Britain have adjustable-rate mortgages, falling rates have left more cash in their pockets each month. The Government has tried other tactics as well to get the economy going; one was to eliminate a tax surcharge on new-car purchases.
Companies are benefiting directly as well, because lower rates mean reduced debt-repayment costs. The weaker pound has given a big boost to exporters, whose products can now be priced more competitively in markets like the United States and Germany. The signs of an incipient upturn in the economy of the United States are also good news for large British companies, many of which have large presences in the United States and earn significant portions of their profits in dollars, which can now be translated into pounds at very favorable rates.
But the British economy has shown signs before of shucking the recession, only to lapse once again. As a result, analysts said, investors remain somewhat wary that share prices have gone too high, and are still seeking concrete signs that the recovery will take hold in the new year as strongly as they are assuming. At about 17 times projected 1992 earnings, the market is near the top of its historical standards, but not, in the view of most analysts, overpriced.
"The big risk to the market, which I don't attach a great deal of importance to, will be if we get to March or April and we don't have better news on the economy," said Sushil Wadhwani, an equity strategist at Goldman, Sachs in London. "Even on simple valuation indicators the market is still, even after the rise of the last several months, somewhat undervalued."
Some economists think the risk to British investors lies not in the domestic economy but in Europe's other economies, particularly Germany's. The Bundesbank said on Thursday that it would not cut official interest rates, despite growing signs of a recession, because of its deep-rooted fear of inflation.
Economists think the Bundesbank will eventually change course and ease its monetary policy, but probably not for several months at least, increasing the risk that exporters to Germany -- Britain's largest export market -- may see demand slacken.
"To some extent you're trading off the consumer recovery at home versus recession in Europe," said Andrew Bell, an equity strategist with Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. "The risk on earnings estimates for 1993 still seems to be on the down side."
Mr. Bell said he thinks that the British economy will expand by about 1 percent next year, and that the market should hit 3,000. He said, though, that because the market tends to surge in January, all of the gain could come at the beginning of the year.
Mr. Wadhwani at Goldman, Sachs said he thinks that the market will hit 3,100 in the next year, and that it could be "meaningfully higher by the end of January."
He said some of the best investment opportunities were in retailing, where companies such as Sears (not related to Sears, Roebuck in the United States) and Next remained undervalued compared with the market. Among companies with heavy exposure in the United States, he said, Hanson P.L.C. remains a good bet. With the overall British economy ready to turn around, he said, companies in the chemicals and metals industries also offer good opportunities for profit and share-price growth.

HEADLINE: Profile/William Amherst Vanderbilt Cecil;
Opening His Door to 700,000 Visitors

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

DATELINE: ASHEVILLE, N.C.

 BODY:
WILLIAM AMHERST VANDERBILT CECIL owns the largest house in the nation, more than three times the size of the White House, with a yard more than nine times the size of Central Park.
Problem is, the place is too small. 
 Mr. Cecil has turned the 255-room house, called Biltmore Estate, built by the Vanderbilt family a century ago, into a thriving tourist attraction. More than 700,000 people, most of them paying $21.95 each, will visit this year -- never mind the out-of-the-way location here in western North Carolina. When 10,000 of those guests all wanted to come the day after Thanksgiving, the wait stretched beyond two hours, with visitors cramming the parking lots, ticket office, gift shops, restaurants and house.
Mr. Cecil, through his Biltmore Company, has achieved his improbable business success by making the contradictory seem logical. An aristocratic heir to an aristocratic home, he commissions marketing studies to make sure he can appeal to commoners' tastes. To keep the house private he has welcomed ever-larger throngs of the public, adding dining halls and shops, a winery, Christmas music, candlelight tours and more bathrooms than he can count.
"George Vanderbilt never envisioned 700,000 people a year flushing his toilets," he said, gesturing with a sweep of his arm to the entryway crowd as he called to mind the grandfather who finished the house in 1895. The White House may get twice the tourists, but then Biltmore is far removed from any urban downtown.
Now, at age 64, Mr. Cecil is facing his greatest challenge since he first turned a money-losing, deteriorating estate into a showplace more than two decades ago. When he dies, the tax collector will want his family to pay 55 percent of Biltmore's value in estate taxes. This would probably force his family to sell or develop the property, or turn it over to a foundation or government agency unlikely to afford the upkeep, he says.
"In today's climate, where you have homeless, you have poor, you have far more important, quote unquote, things to look after, where does the legislature cut?" he said. "Maintenance would fall apart."
And so, a man who prides himself on getting along without Federal grants, subsidies, tax breaks, anything -- "We're a contributor to the economy," he said -- has begun lobbying for kinder treatment: a tax deferral until his family sells the estate, or at least a 10-year period in which to pay the taxes.
People like Mr. Cecil, you see, really aren't supposed to flourish in these United States. Alexis de Tocqueville, a French visitor, observed more than a century and a half ago that American conditions, laws and ideals barred the development of a European-style gentry passing vast estates from generation to generation. "The soil of America absolutely rejected a territorial aristocracy," he wrote.
Mr. Cecil laments that Americans show so little attachment to their land. "Europeans have a different outlook on property than we do here," he said. "We're a mobile nation. Most of us Americans move five or six times in a lifetime. Europeans are sticks in the mud."
To meet Mr. Cecil is to begin learning about how he resolves the conflicts that have shaped him and his business. His words are somehow clipped and drawled at the same time, reflecting a parentage and upbringing half American, half British. He was born at Biltmore in 1928, the son of George Vanderbilt's daughter and a father descended directly from Lord Burghley, Queen Elizabeth I's Lord High Commissioner.
The estate's grounds, originally 125,000 acres but now 8,000, were landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted, whose preparation for the Biltmore job included Central Park. The architect was Richard Morris Hunt, who piled on so many towers and turrets and gargoyles and spires that he needed to raid the designs of at least three of the greatest Loire Valley chateaux.
In recent years, Mr. Cecil has spent less time on the estate than in his office building five miles away, a stark corporate fortress of concrete and tinted glass, designed by I.M. Pei, that he bought second-hand.
The sense that he is sometimes talking down to visitors and employees there comes from both height (6 feet 4 inches) and hauteur: "Let me correct one mistake," he began. "It's not the Biltmore. It's Biltmore. Biltmore House. The Biltmore is a hotel."
His staff whispers that he is reluctant to go to the estate too often because his health and size have hobbled him. He says that he is afraid he will be asked to sign guidebooks and brochures: "I don't do windows and I don't do autographs."
BUT he does do balance sheets and marketing plans. "I never had any qualms about making this a serious business," he said.
To emphasize that it's a family business, not a family playground, he lives in a house off the estate, with his wife, Mary. "There's no way you can say Biltmore is a private home," he said. "It's a private corporation. My daughter wanted to get married there. I said, 'Hell no. It's not your home.' She'll never forgive me."
His son and daughter, William Jr. and Diana Pickering, both in their 30's, have been in the business for several years. His own path back to Biltmore was more circuitous.
His parents divorced, and he went off to Britain in 1936. After a stint in the Royal Navy and a degree at Harvard, he joined Chase Manhattan, advancing in a few years to run the Spanish, Swiss and French desk, then the Washington office.
A family friend and judge who was managing Biltmore was meanwhile getting on in years. Against the advice of New York friends and Chase executives, Mr. Cecil left for Asheville in 1960.
 BILTMORE had been grudgingly open to the public for 30 years. But after three decades, revenues from 50,000 visitors a year were falling $250,000 short of maintenance costs. There are 16th-century tapestries to repair with silver and gold thread, Renoirs to clean, hundreds of rooms to heat. Only a profitable dairy on the estate made it possible.
Mr. Cecil began providing a hearty welcome. Advertising and marketing until then had meant a page in the annual agriculture and travel issues of The Asheville Citizen-Times. Mr. Cecil made Biltmore familiar in advertisements and billboards for hundreds of miles around, buying space himself to save the 17.5 percent agency commissions. He churned out news releases, taking photographs himself. He opened more rooms.
In 1968, he had 200,000 visitors and his first profit, $16.34. "It was a lot more fun than losing a quarter of a million dollars a year," he said.
Mr. Cecil courted tour operators and local hotel owners. He added restaurants, gift shops and other attractions, which together generate about 40 percent of the estate's $29 million in annual revenues (with a pre-tax profit margin, one Biltmore executive said, of about 12 percent).
His is on a continual quest for new revenue sources, always with an earnest reference to the sanctity of the nation's history and his grandfather's intentions. "I could put condos, I could put factories on the property," he said. "But are you then preserving the patrimony of the United States?"
By 1985, he had hit upon a more fitting source of new sales after he noticed visitors munching some of the grapes in his gardens. The winery he opened that year is now the most visited in the United States, he says, with about 500,000 guests. (A professional's sampling of three of his best bottles indicated that his genius may lie more in marketing than wine-making. "Robert Mondavi has nothing to fear," said Frank J. Prial, wine critic for The New York Times.)
Other plans include a new visitor center, restaurants, more parking and larger shops. Drexel Heritage will introduce a Biltmore Estate Collection of furniture.
Besides talking to Washington about the inheritance laws, Mr. Cecil wants the Smithsonian to use part of the estate to display oddities it can't show under its own roof. Not an unprecedented move, Mr. Cecil said. During World War II, the National Gallery, fearing an attack on Washington, sent choice objects to Biltmore for safekeeping.
If Mr. Cecil's marketing of his family's past remains exceptional, his grandfather's monumental ambitions are not. Modern-day Vanderbilts are even now busily building. The $35 million home William H. Gates III of Microsoft is erecting near Seattle may not be as large, but the house's high-resolution computer display screens are every bit as advanced as Biltmore's plumbing and circuitry were in their day.
Who knows but that in another century, William H. Gates V will be looking for ways to attract more visitors while he arm-wrestles the Government to keep a historical estate in the family? And just maybe, he will call William Amherst Vanderbilt Cecil IV for advice.

 
 
THE SHEKELS OF CHRISTMAS
 ATTRACTING motorists and tour buses to Biltmore Estate when the nearby Great Smokies are in spring bloom or fall color is one thing. Doing so in Christmas season, when the region's other attractions boil down to the outlet stores in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., is another. Yet William Cecil has made Christmas his busiest time of year.
It took some doing: Mr. Cecil began tentatively, putting up a Christmas tree or two 15 years ago. Then he added a couple more.
This season there are 30, including one more than three stories tall that still fits comfortably in the medieval banquet hall. These decorations help Mr. Cecil collect an extra $3 a head, or $24.95, and still attract more than 100,000 December guests.
As the crowds grew, and the house didn't, he added candlelight evening Christmas tours a few years ago, with tootling musicians and an admission charge of $27.95. Some dates sell out weeks in advance.
To further spread the Christmas cheer, Stephen P. Miller, a Biltmore senior vice president, did some marketing research about raising the decorations, and the admission charge, by Nov. 16. "Not only didn't people think it was too commercial, but they actually liked it," he said. "It gives them more flexibility."
Mr. Cecil reluctantly went along, but not before asking, "Are you going to put it to Aug. 1 next year?"
By early this month, Mr. Cecil was fully convinced, having seen November attendance jump 31.7 percent. "Now," he asked himself, "how are we going to beat that?"

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Saab Updates Its 9000-Series Sedan

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
LET'S say you don't know where to go for your next vacation. Tokyo is too expensive, and the Bahamas are . . . well, too close. But how about Trollhattan?
That might be just the place, in fact, if you are in the market for a new car or, more specifically, for a new Saab. 
 Trollhattan is home to the Swedish company's headquarters, and it is one of 13 delivery sites in Saab's current "International and Diplomat" sales program. It is also one of two sites -- the other being Gothenburg, Sweden -- where buyers receive a complimentary arrival package.
The package includes free airport-to-hotel transportation, a night's accommodations, breakfast and dinner for two and tours of the company's museum and assembly plant. More to the point, though, the program will save a customer as much as $5,000 on the car's purchase price, while eliminating the need for a rental car.
Saab also has designated 28 drop-off points throughout Europe, with free shipment back to the United States from two of them, Gothenburg and Bremerhaven, Germany. Fees from the other 26 locations can be as low as $50, and buyers are spared the cost of customs clearance, duty and marine insurance.
The program is available through any of Saab's 305 American dealers and encompasses the company's entire line, including the newly redone 9000 series.
All of this largess doesn't mean that Saab is rolling in kronor, of course. Quite the opposite, and Saab is merely doing what it can to stimulate sagging sales, while rethinking its marketing strategies in the United States.
Saab, which is a 50-50 venture between General Motors and Sweden's Saab-Scania, lost $4 million more in the third quarter of this year than the $88 million loss that was posted for the same period of 1991. As a result, the company has announced that it needs an infusion of cash from its owners, and that it has embarked on a massive cost-cutting program, including layoff of 22 percent of its workforce.
At the same time, the prices of some 1993 models have been held to '92 levels, and the 9000 CD sedans actually have been reduced. Of particular note is the fully equipped CD Turbo, whose price has dropped to $35,745 from $37,615.
The big news for '93, though, is the addition of the 9000 CS and CSE sports sedans. The cars, which replace the 9000, 9000S and 9000 Turbo, have a changed profile, with new treatments at front and rear, bodies that are almost 4 inches longer and a 25 percent increase in structural rigidity.
The new body incorporates door beams, strengthened crossmembers in the floor and reinforced roof pillars. A roll-bar has also been added behind the rear doors. According to the company, all that creates a resistance to side impacts that exceeds the Federal standards that will go into effect in 1997. All '93 Saabs also have standard antilock brakes and driver-side air bags.
The tester was a bright red CSE Turbo, a four-door hatchback that is the top of Saab's line. The car had blackout trim and molded wheels, and it carried a black spoiler across the hatch. For '93, there also is a new high-mounted brakelight, and the taillights extend all the way across the car's rump.
The hatch itself rises from the cargo floor, which has a sturdy cover to keep prying eyes off any valuables within. The split rear seats fold down, allowing 23.5 cubic feet of carrying capacity.
While interior space means that the Government rates the car as "large," its exterior dimensions really aren't all that big, with a wheelbase of 105.2 inches and an overall length of about 188 inches. All the same, the test vehicle offered good room in the rear and comfort aplenty up front.
Bucket seats for the driver and front passenger are power adjustable, and the driving position is excellent. The tester had black leather upholstery, although wool now is an interior option.
Options, in fact, are part of Saab's '93 marketing approach, and a company spokesman said the "new" program takes a leaf from the Detroit manufacturers, allowing various equipment packages to satisfy different tastes and budgets. A sunroof and leather seats are now available in the least expensive models, for example, while a turbocharged 9000 can be had without the full range of luxury features.
The red CSE was thoroughly well-dressed, however, with complete power equipment, automatic climate control, central locking and a superb sound system, including a compact-disk player.
One problem, at least as far as I'm concerned, is the location of the buttons for the power windows. As usual with Saabs, the buttons are down between the seats, along with the button for the flip-or-slide sunroof, and they are inconvenient.
Amazingly, though, the rear buttons send the back windows all the way down, a rarity in modern automobiles and a feature that merits applause.
The tester's main gauge was a 140-m.p.h. speedometer, flanked by a 7,000-r.p.m. tach and gauges for temperature, fuel and turbo boost. When the turbo cuts in, the car with its standard five-speed stick is quick off the mark and fast on the road. But the four-cylinder engine does require some stirring of the gears in city traffic.
Actually, two engines are available in any of the new CS and CSE models. Both are 2.3-liter fours and both breathe through four valves per cylinder. The base powerplant, naturally aspirated, produces 150 horsepower, while the intercooled and turbocharged version puts out an even 200.
The turbo also features something that Saab calls "Trionic," a new 32-bit microprocessor that integrates ignition, fuel injection and knock-control systems for improved efficiency and reduced exhaust emissions. Economy ranges from 18 miles per gallon in the city to 27 highway.
Either of the engines can be teamed with a four-speed automatic transmission, a $920 option. Other options, like leather and power seats, can also raise the car's price considerably.
The bottom line for a base 9000 CS is $25,725. The CSE starts at $31,060, and the CSE Turbo is $35,055. One way to save, of course, is to go on vacation.

HEADLINE: Lincoln Square

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Trading Low-Income Housing for Bonuses" on Nov. 1 cites the city's inclusionary housing bonus program, which enables developers to build up to 20 percent additional floor area in exchange for constructing permanent low-income housing, as a major contributor to the size of the Lincoln Square project. While the program did provide the project with a zoning bonus, the problems with the height, massing and commercial usage of the building reflect the developer's marketing and financial objectives. 
 The Westside commmunity has raised legitimate concerns over the Lincoln Square development. Therefore, City Planning has initiated a review of the zoning regulations of the Special Lincoln Square District to insure that future developments are more appropriate additions to one of New York's most vibrant and vital mixed-use neighborhoods. This review will examine a number of urban design and planning issues, including the impact of retail and commercial uses, which cause far more congestion than residential development. In addition, we believe revised envelope controls could package the bulk of new buildings in ways that are more compatible with the neighborhood.
The inclusionary housing program and the City Planning Commission's precedent-setting approvals of Riverside South and Brighton-by-the-Sea, which mandate economically integrated new communities, reflect our belief that, as a principle of sound urban planning, communities need to include a variety of housing available to occupants with different income levels.
It would be a mistake to eliminate the inclusionary housing program in a misguided attempt to regulate the physical form of building. There are far more effective ways to mandate more sympathetic urban design and planning guidelines than to restrict a necessary, unique and important way of constructing the low-income housing New Yorkers so desperateely need.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Calls to Restrict Immigration Come From Many Quarters

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
IN the last year, many politicians have sensed that the national mood -- frustration -- permitted the kind of complaints about immigrants that are traditionally considered un-American. Senator Robert C. Byrd, for example, took to the Senate floor last June to offer some highly public trepidations about the changing face of America.
"I pick up the telephone and call the local garage," said Mr. Byrd, a Democrat from West Virginia. "I can't understand the person on the other side of the line. I'm not sure he can understand me. They're all over the place, and they don't speak English. Do we want more of this?" 
 With the economy on the decline and the number of new immigrants on the rise, the U.S. welcome mat has become somewhat worse for wear. Across the country, and particularly in California, Americans have felt freer to voice a rude inhospitality that at other times they might have considered racist or at least xenophobic. Advocates for immigrants cringe and call it scapegoating but expect a mellower tone in the coming year. Those who call for a freeze on immigration, however, saw the sour mood of the past year as a harbinger of a new conservatism ahead.
The question is where such talk can lead. In recent history, political conservatives have been repeatedly unsuccessful in pushing through any measures restricting the legal flow of immigrants. Indeed, Congress's most recent move increased immigrant quotas by 40 percent. And advocates are skilled at playing to the nation's sense of itself as a land of immigrants, at promoting the benefits of diversity and discounting what they say are unproven theories that immigrants take more than they give.
Nonetheless, in the last year and a half, in political campaign rhetoric, magazine articles and legislative proposals, the tenor of public conversation about immigration has changed, with emphasis shifting from romantic rhapsodies about the melting pot to anxiety attacks about the dwindling resources of an economically strapped nation. In such, some Americans have found a way not only to vent their frustration but to express racist discomfort with the nation's darkening complexion, as most immigrants are Latino and Asian.
Tenuous alliances, too, have been forged between anti-immigration groups, some environmentalists and some civil rights advocates. In California, the Sierra Club, concerned that immigrants are causing a population explosion harmful to the environment, joined forces with three groups that favor immigration restrictions to create the Coalition to Stabilize Population. And in Congress, a proposed Constitutional amendment that would deny citizenship to the American-born children of illegal immigrants was sponsored by 12 Republicans and two Democrats who are civil rights advocates, Representatives Charles Rangel of New York and Anthony C. Beilenson of Los Angeles. Many civil rights leaders are torn between their conscience and their constituents, as American-born blacks worry that immigrants are displacing them from jobs and political power.
It became particularly trendy in California for politicians to blame the state's economic woes on immigrants, and especially on illegal ones. With Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, claiming that immigrants were bankrupting the state by using more in services than they pay in taxes, Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange counties all commissioned studies to determine just how much new and illegal immigrants cost taxpayers.
And during the campaigns there was much tough talk from Republicans and Democrats alike about "defending the border" with Mexico. When Senator John Seymour, a Republican, proposed hiring 1,500 additional border patrol officers, Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat who defeated him, said she wanted to see the Army help reinforce the border.
The New Jersey Legislature eliminated public assistance benefits to illegal immigrants and appears to be moving swiftly to deny them the right to a driver's license. In New York's suburban Suffolk County, the welcome of more generous times has given way to such negativity that when a principal in Elmont, N.Y., reported two of his students, the children of illegal immigrants, to immigration authorities, he was applauded by his local school board.
Advocates have been alarmed by the ugly repercussions of this attitude change, which was exacerbated by the participation of Hispanic immigrants in the riots in Los Angeles and Washington Heights. Bias incidents and biased comments against immigrants multiplied, they said. And few Americans came forward to protest President Bush's May executive order that forced the repatriation of Haitians fleeing their country by boat.
But for Patrick Buchanan and a contingent of conservative academics and writers, the mood was ripe for exploitation. "Look, we have to speak up when we can, when we're least likely to face the charges of racism that are our occupational hazard," says Dan Stein of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which lobbies for a freeze on immigration.
Mr. Stein is usually careful to base his fear about increasing immigration on arguments about scarce resources. He often voices concern about immigrants displacing black and Hispanic Americans from jobs. But others, Mr. Buchanan, for example, also resent the "dilution" of their European heritage. "If present trends hold," Mr. Buchanan noted during the campaign, "white Americans will be a minority by 2050."
And in "Time to Rethink Immigration?" a cover story in a June issue of The National Review, Peter Brimelow, a senior editor at Forbes magazine, compares the immigration service waiting room to the subway, "an underworld that is almost entirely colored." In articles in conservative policy journals, immigrants were portrayed, variously, as displacing Americans from jobs, draining government resources, crowding cities with their large families, importing drugs and disease and threatening the dominance of English.
Even Eugene McCarthy, the former Presidential candidate and Senator from Minnesota, criticized U.S. immigration policy as a "virtual entitlement" of "ethnic interest groups" to be "defended at all costs" in his new book, "A Colony of the World: The United States Today," (Hippocrene Books). Mr. Stein's group has offered to finance the book's advertising campaign.
After George Bush and Bill Clinton scarcely mentioned immigration during the campaign, advocates hoped the national bad mood would blow over with an economic improvement and a new President. But anti-immigrant groups foresee two opportunities to capitalize on Americans' souring toward foreigners and refugees: debate on the North American Free Trade Agreement and a potential exodus from Haiti.
Still, now more than ever the United States is a multicultural society, and the inter-ethnic clashes of the last year could be seen as growing pains. Certainly the antagonism of the moment pales in comparison to the vehement nativism that followed World War I, or the overt hatred of the 1850's and 1890's. And few expect the situation to boil over into the bloody tensions and closing borders of some European countries. Ill will is ill will, observers say, but it is not a shut door.

HEADLINE: What Counts Is Productivity and Productivity

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
TOPIC A at Bill Clinton's economic extravaganza next week in Little Rock will no doubt be the recession. But as the President-elect told everyone from newspaper executives to Congressional leaders last week, it is productivity that will mark the success or failure of his economic policies. And most economists, it is safe to say, would agree with him.
Recessions come and, mercifully, always go. However, the only way to raise living standards and pay for dreams like universal health care and welfare reform is to increase productivity -- how manycars, hamburgers and everything else Americans make per hour. 
 And for reasons poorly understood, this vital fire of progress has dimmed to an ember since the early 1970's. The business-sponsored Committee for Economic Development's new report, "Restoring Prosperity," estimates that if labor productivity had grown as anemically in the century before 1972 as it has in the two decades since, Americans would live no better than Brazilians.
The route back to a more productive future is uncharted. But Mr. Clinton is apparently prepared to fulfill his campaign promises by investing serious political capital in fostering growth. And he may benefit from a business climate sobered by hard times and fierce foreign competition.
Political battles over economic policy usually focus on who gains and who loses from taxes, subsidies and regulation. But over decades, trends in wages have far more impact on the typical family's living standard than the way government reshuffles the economic deck does. Wages, in turn, are more or less tied to output per hour worked. "Productivity isn't everything," concludes Paul Krugman of M.I.T., "but in the long run it is almost everything."
From 1948 to 1973 productivity in private business rose 2.9 percent annually, nearly doubling average wages along the way. But since the mid-1970's the pace has slipped to just 1 percent, and wages have been in virtual gridlock. Most of the continuing gain in living standards during the Reagan years came from the fact that more women were putting in more hours in paying jobs. Much of the rest has come from lower savings, as both families and the Government responded to leaner times by spending beyond their means.
Economists, alas, are better at figuring what didn't take the wind out of the productivity sails than what did. Higher energy costs, the alleged source of the slowdown in the 1970's, could not have had much to do with it since productivity did not perk up when oil prices plummeted in the 1980's. And Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, finds little substance in the argument that increased government regulation was at fault. Environmental controls have indeed begun to bite. But the resulting drag was partially offset by productivity gains in industries that benefited from deregulation -- notably the transportation and energy industries.
More plausible explanations focus on investment -- or, rather, the lack thereof. Alicia Munnell, director of research for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, pins some of the blame on government's pennywise policy toward public investment. Between 1970 and 1990 the total value of everything owned by government -- from highways to computers to office buildings -- fell from about half of the gross national product to just 41 percent. That left the nation with traffic-choked roads, crowded air routes, and perhaps as a consequence, lower productivity growth in private industry.
 
Diplomas Guarantee Less
 The link between education and worker performance is hard to measure. But the 3 R's must matter. And research by James Heckman of the University of Chicago suggests that a high school diploma or its equivalent is less of a guarantee of basic workplace competence than it used to be. What's more, notes Van Doorn Ooms, the research director of the Committee on Economic Development, the rapid entry of women and young workers into the labor force has reduced average experience levels, and presumably diluted the pool of skills gained on the job.
Some also blame the what-me-worry ethos of the 1980's. With personal and corporate thrift on the wane and Washington running deficits unprecedented in peacetime, the overall savings rate went from about 8 percent of income in the 1950's and 1960's to just 2 to 3 percent in the last decade.
A great tide of foreign investment -- about $900 billion in the 1980's -- did pay for the computers, airplanes and machinery needed to keep an industrial economy humming. Foreign investment did not, however, make up the entire shortfall. The result, estimate Ethan Harris and Charles Steindel of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was a half-percentage point drop in productivity growth -- a giant difference in the post-60's world of just 1 percent growth.
And the impact may be even stronger than the Fed economists suggest. Bradford DeLong of Harvard and Lawrence Summers, the chief economist for the World Bank who is now working for the Clinton transition team, are convinced that equipment investment is the great catalyst for technological change.
Most economists concede they are not really sure what slowed productivity growth. Robert Solow, the Nobel Prize-winning growth theorist, once remarked that discussions of the puzzle usually end "in a blaze of amateur sociology." But the economists' one consistent theme, that sluggish investment in machines and people made a big difference, has not been lost on the Clinton team. And it is no secret where Mr. Clinton is heading.
During the campaign he pledged to spend an additional $20 billion annually on public infrastructure and plow billions more into education and job training. He will almost certainly also add rich incentives for investment in business machinery -- most likely a tax credit for purchases beyond a firm's average over the past few years.
Mr. Clinton also pledged to halve the deficit, and again last week insisted that he would hold Congress' feet to the fire on deficit reduction. But this less direct route to private investment will probably rate a lower priority. After all, he could only make good on the pledge by raising taxes for the middle classes or by making a frontal assault on well-armored spending.
The Clinton capital blitz is unlikely to yield a quick payoff. Robert Gordon of Northwestern University notes that the returns on some of the most promising investments are bound to trickle in over decades. "Money going into Head Start," he jibed, "will raise productivity during some Republican Administration 30 years from now."
And in any case, 3 percent productivity nirvana may simply be beyond the reach of the mature American economy. William Baumol of New York University believes roughly half the decline in productivity growth since the early 1970's represents a return to the very long term trend -- that the quarter-century of growth above 2 percent was a one-shot phenomenon, a delayed exploitation of great science and engineering advances from plastics to pesticides to radar that accumulated during the Depression and World War II.
But President Clinton may be in a better position to deliver the bacon than is commonly understood. Productivity growth always looks good coming out of a recession, since when orders go up, businesses are generally able to reduce the slack in their operations. And some economists, among them Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley, think the exceptionally large bounce in output per worker during the third quarter of this year signals more enduring changes -- in Mr. Roach's words "a trend breaker."
If Mr. Roach is right, the ongoing restructuring of competition-battered businesses, services like banking and industrial dinosaurs like General Motors, will add a shade less than a percentage point to the rate of productivity growth for several more years. Clintonomics could thus look like a winner, whether or not Mr. Clinton's initiatives to spur investment, innovation and savings prove to have much kick.
By this not-unhappy scenario, the Clinton productivity boom may resemble the serendipitous taming of inflation during the Reagan Administration. President Reagan, after all, got the credit for the success of unpopular anti-inflationary monetary policies dictated by the Federal Reserve during the Carter Administration.
Felicity, however, has its price. Like President Reagan, President Clinton may confuse good luck with policy acumen. And like Mr. Reagan, Mr. Clinton may be tempted to delay the tough measures needed to lock in higher productivity growth -- notably deficit reduction -- when he is still popular enough to push them though Congress.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
DEMOCRATIC LEADER AND CLINTON FRIEND GAIN MAJOR POSTS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 12

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton reached back to Hope, Ark., and into the corporate lobbying culture of Washington today to fill two more top jobs, naming his oldest childhood friend, Thomas F.McLarty 3d, as chief of staff, and the Democratic Party chairman, Ronald H. Brown, as Secretary of Commerce.
In picking a self-effacing boyhood chum for chief of staff, a job that in recent years has been filled by ambitious empire builders, Mr. Clinton signaled that he wanted an apolitical referee to reconcile competing factions, not an advocate for any particular point of view. He was also determined to pick someone who could keep a secret, a specialty of the press-shy Mr. McLarty, whose friends call him Mack.
 
Concerns of Real People
 "The people of America will learn, as I have over the years, that they can trust Mack McLarty to bring the real concerns of real people to the table," said Mr. Clinton, his eyes watery with tears as he introduced his friend to the nation. "I trust him to build a team in the White House. He is a chief executive officer who knows how to get things done. The American people can feel confident that he will make sure everyone's voice is heard before I make an important decision and that everyone pulls together once that decision is made." 
 In naming Mr. Brown, Mr. Clinton was simultaneously paying off a big political debt and working to fulfill a campaign vow to have a racially diverse cabinet. Mr. Brown, who is black, works for one of the most powerful lobbying law firms in Washington, and was instrumental in engineering Mr. Clinton's election by uniting the fractious wings of the Democratic Party behind him.
Speaking of the need for a national strategy to bolster the economy and make it more competitive, Mr. Brown, who could face a tough confirmation battle because of his lobbying for foreign Governments in recent years, said his mission at Commerce would be "to bring business and labor and government together for the benefit of all of our people."
At his news conference today, Mr. Clinton said he intended to make the Commerce Department, which is responsible for promoting trade, economic growth and technological advancement, more important than it had been in recent years. "I am nominating someone who will make the Commerce Department a powerhouse," he said.
The naming of Mr. McLarty, chairman of Arkla Inc., a natural gas conglomerate, to the job of chief of staff, appeared to make the appointment of Mr. Clinton's current transition director, Warren M. Christopher, as Secretary of State more likely, aides said. Mr. Christopher has been expected to be named to either one of the jobs.
 
Half the Jobs Filled
 In the last three days Mr. Clinton has named roughly half of the members of his cabinet and senior staff. Thus far it is shaping up as a political Noah's ark, with veteran Washington and Wall Street insiders, newcomers from the left wing of the Democratic Party and the academic world, appointees placed both by his wife, Hillary, and the Vice President-elect, Al Gore, and now one old friend from Arkansas.
Mr. McLarty, 46 years old, was an important fund-raiser for the Clinton campaign. He has been serving on Mr. Clinton's transition board, but his friendship with Mr. Clinton dates back to kindergarten in Hope, where Mr. McLarty was born two months before Mr. Clinton. Mr. Clinton's mother, Virginia Kelley, has been quoted as saying that the two of them always introduce each other as "my oldest friend."
For the last few weeks Mr. Clinton has been asking members of his staff to research how the chief of staff's job has been handled in the past and how it might be reorganized to fit his own consultative form of decision-making. He made clear that he did not want an ideological warrior like John H. Sununu or an ambitious political animal like James A. Baker 3d, two of Mr. Bush's chiefs of staff. As Senator David Pryor of Arkansas put it after today's news conference: "I cannot imagine turning on 'Crossfire' and seeing Mack McLarty there. I just cannot imagine that." Mr. Sununu is the co-host of the highly combative television interview show.
 
Style of Management
 Mr. McLarty, who is a former state legislator and Democratic chairman of Arkansas, described his management style as collegial.
"As his chief of staff I will do whatever I can to help him organize, manage, facilitate and carry out the duties of the President of the United States," Mr. McLarty. "And as his friend I will always be straight with him and he knows that. Bill Clinton has my complete loyalty and trust -- always has and always will.
"I am by formal definition not a Washington insider. I have lived my life in the heartland but through my experience as a citizen and as a business person, I do know Washington fairly well and I've learned something about how to make organizations work."
Mr. McLarty said he would divest himself not only of all his Arkla stocks but also of all common stocks to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest in his future role.
 
Former Chiefs of Staff
 The chief of staff's job is a relatively new one, dating to 1946, when John R. Stedman, serving with the title of Presidential assistant, ran the White House for Harry S. Truman. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson did without a chief of staff; Ronald Reagan had four, and for part of his Presidency divided the job into thirds.
While the chief of staff is usually described as a gatekeeper, deciding who and what comes before the President, chiefs of staff have also become important policy advisers. Many have boasted of doing Presidential dirty work: dismissing aides, confronting issues and people the President prefers to dodge, and taking the blame for Presidential mistakes.
In recent years they have usually, but not always, enjoyed great influence on the President, a tradition Mr. Clinton's appointee today is expected to observe.
"There is no case where a President has reached back to such an old childhood friend for his chief of staff," said Michael Beschloss, a historian of the Presidency. "What that would suggest is that this person will have a great deal of power, because of his unique relationship with Clinton, because of the weight of the position itself and because Clinton has made clear that his is going to be a White House-led Administration."
 
Surrounded by Strangers
 It also seems to suggest that Mr. Clinton is sensitive that in Washington he will be surrounded by people he does not know well. Much like Jimmy Carter, who named his old friend Bert Lance to be his budget director, Mr. Clinton is pulling in a man upon whose loyalty he apparently feels he can always count.
He is also choosing someone who is neither part of any of the factions of Mr. Clinton's entourage nor allied with any Democratic Party constituency.
Mr. Brown is a partner in the quintessential Washington corporate lobbying firm Patton, Boggs & Blow and has represented a number of foreign clients. One of the firm's partners, Tommy Boggs, the son of the late Louisiana Congressman Hale Boggs, was recently pictured on the cover of the National Journal magazine, a weekly on politics and government, under the caption: "Ready to Cash In on Clinton," with the firm's name alongside him.
Among Mr. Brown's clients have been Japanese companies seeking to buy American firms and Jean-Claude Duvalier, the former Haitian dictator who was run out of office for corruption.
Asked about his years as a lobbyist and how he will deal with that at his confirmation hearings, Mr. Brown said: "I will deal with it very forthrightly as you would expect me to. I have been a practicing lawyer for over 20 years and am proud of my skills as a lawyer and as an advocate."

HEADLINE: Puerto Rico's Coastline: New York's Back Door

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AGUADILLA, P.R., Dec. 8

 BODY:
For tens of thousands of Dominicans who dream of a better life in New York, the long road to Washington Heights or Queens begins here on the rugged, reef-lined shores of Puerto Rico's west coast.
With the help of smugglers, they cross the perilous Mona Passage in rickety wooden boats called yolas, arriving under cover of darkness in groups as large as 175, and are put ashore on isolated beaches. If they manage to evade the United States Border Patrol agents assigned to this corner of America's Caribbean frontier, they will make their way to San Juan. After earning enough money for plane fare, they will try to continue on to New York. 
 Separated from the Dominican Republic by only the Mona Passage, a 90-mile stretch of water, Puerto Rico is regarded by Dominicans as an increasingly attractive route to the American mainland.
 
Smugglers' Back Door
 Immigration officials say Dominicans have constituted the largest group of immigrants to New York in the last decade, numbering at least 500,000 in the metropolitan area. Many of those who have arrived in the United States illegally since the mid-1980's entered this convenient back door.
"I don't think there is a single town in my country that doesn't have someone who made it to New York by going through Puerto Rico," said a Dominican construction worker in San Juan who gave his name as Wilfredo Villegas and who said he arrived here nine months ago. "Everybody knows that this is the best way to get there."
But the route is dangerous and costly. Dominicans typically pay $500 each to smugglers to cross to Puerto Rico from the east coast of the Dominican Republic, and passengers often drown or are eaten by sharks when their small and overcrowded boats sink or when unscrupulous captains force them to jump into the seas just offshore.
 
Passing for Puerto Ricans
 "This time of year especially, the waters are really, really nasty," said Michael H. Wimberley, a Border Patrol senior agent here. "This is where the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea collide, and 10-foot swells are common in winter."
Dominicans are willing to take that risk because Puerto Rico offers them unique entree to the United States. Puerto Rico's residents speak Spanish with a similar accent and have a similar culture and racial composition but enjoy the benefits of American citizenship. Many Dominicans feel they can pass themselves off as native Puerto Ricans, with the right to travel to the American mainland without a passport or the usual immigration formalities.
Estimates of how many Dominicans are living illegally at any one time on this Caribbean island of 3.6 million people vary widely, ranging from 100,000 upwards to 300,000. "We only know what we catch," said John A. Abriel, deputy district director of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service in San Juan. "Anything else is a guess."
 
A Growing Presence
 During the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the immigration service and the Border Patrol expelled 4,093 Dominicans from Puerto Rico, compared with 1,958 in 1988. But immigration officials acknowledge that those figures represent only a fraction of the actual influx of Dominicans, and they do not include another 2,953 people whom Coast Guard vessels have intercepted in the Mona Passage this year.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the Dominican presence in Puerto Rico is widespread. Some areas of San Juan, like Barrio Obrero and sections of Santurce, are now predominantly Dominican, as demonstrated by the proliferation of exchange houses that wire money back to relatives in Santo Domingo, merengue clubs and even offices of the Dominican Republic's major political parties.
Dominicans account for more than 90 percent of the illegal immigrants captured here. Immigration officials said their agents also caught "a sprinkling" of other Latin Americans, mostly Colombians or Ecuadorans, as well as Haitians and some Chinese, Pakistanis, Koreans and Indians.
 
Coordinating Efforts
 Since the Border Patrol began operating here in October 1987, it has more than tripled the number of agents assigned to Puerto Rico, from 10 to 33, and has worked out a system of cooperation with the Customs Service and Coast Guard, which supplies most of the information on boat movements that lead to interceptions. In addition, the immigration service has 17 field officers assigned to Puerto Rico, whose activities range from inspecting departing passengers at airports to raiding neighborhoods where illegal immigrants are believed to live.
But Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon argues that Washington needs to do even more. The Border Patrol presence here, he said, "is totally insufficient to limit the entry of Dominicans." In addition to a shortage of manpower, he said that not enough money has been devoted to halting an influx that Puerto Ricans regard with growing irritation. The Border Patrol is expecting delivery of a new 41-foot vessel next spring that will give it more mobility on the high seas, but while Congress approved expanding the number of the patrol's agents, it has refused to appropriate the necessary money.
 
Economic and Social Ills
 The Dominican presence on the island "has increased" in recent years and "is creating problems," especially in terms of employment, Governor Hernandez Colon said.
News commentators and community groups throughout Puerto Rico say Dominicans are also responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime and drug trafficking on the island, and many have called for harsher sanctions against "the usurpers." Last year legislation was introduced in the Puerto Rican legislature to fine the government of the Dominican Republic $1,000 for each illegal Dominican apprehended here, and organizations like the Committee Against Foreign Migration to Puerto Rico and Citizens United for Rapid Action have sprung up here and in New York.
 
'These Are Desperate People'
 But the immigrants and their defenders respond that the vast majority of Dominicans here are hard working, honest and willing to take jobs that local people do not want. "When you see a guy dangling from the 10th floor of a building, you don't even need to ask his origins," said Andres Moreta Damiron, the Dominican Consul General in San Juan. "You can be sure he is a Dominican."
Immigration officials said they, too, find the Dominicans to be unusually tenacious. Border Patrol agents report incidents in which Dominican immigrants have attacked them with knives, tried to seize their weapons, scaled barbed-wire fences or kicked out bus windows trying to avoid capture.
"These are desperate people," said Joseph B. Bennett, the Border Patrol chief in Puerto Rico. "After investing all their money in a dangerous boat ride, they don't want to give up."
Border Patrol officials estimate that at best they capture one of every five Dominican vessels that land here. "Our priority is to intercept them out there on the water," said Mr. Wimberley, the Border Patrol agent, "because once the yolas make landfall, the people disappear into the jungle or get picked up by vans or buses before we can get there."
 
Timing of Capture Crucial
 Once on Puerto Rican soil, the Dominicans do their best to blend in, mimicking a Puerto Rican accent and vocabulary and adopting local names for fruits and animals. In some cases, they are aided by criminal groups that steal blank Puerto Rican birth certificates from government offices here, or that print false documents of their own. The certificates are sold throughout the island and in the New York metropolitan area.
"It's easier to catch them up when they're fresh off the yola," said Manuel Flores, a Border Patrol agent from San Antonio who has been here for two years. "After six months, they learn to talk just like Puerto Ricans, and it gets much harder."
The smuggling organizations that bring Dominicans here are run by Dominicans and Puerto Ricans, both cooperatively and independently, and some promise to get their customers all the way to New York for prices as high as $3,000. Courts here have convicted 165 smugglers since 1988, but immigration and Border Patrol officers say the laws limit their ability to stop and interrogate suspected illegal immigrants on the street.
 
Avoiding Rights Violations
 "Since the people we are talking to are on U.S. soil, we have to be very careful about who we question and how we question them," Mr. Abriel said.
Mr. Bennett added: "You can't just stop someone on the basis of a sixth sense. You have to be able to articulate the reasons you think someone is here illegally, and that gives them quite a bit of an advantage over us."
For its part, the Dominican government argues there is little it can do to halt the flow. "We cannot prohibit the departure of our citizens," Mr. Moreta said. "We can only discourage those departures because they cause problems with our neighbors and contribute to the disintegration of the Dominican family.
"We do not have a naval force capable of patrolling all of the hundreds of miles of our coast. That would require the 6th Fleet, and I do not think the United States is going to help us that way."

HEADLINE: Chelsea Strikes Back at Influx of Pornographic Video Stores

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
When a new adult video store put up its Welcome sign a few weeks ago on the corner of 22d Street and Seventh Avenue, amid sedate brownstone residences and near a public school, community reaction was swift and angry.
In the last few months, seven new pornographic video stores have appeared in Chelsea -- three opened by one owner -- making a total of 10 and angering residents and tradespeople, who fear their neighborhood will become "42d Street South." 
 Led by the newly formed Chelsea Action Coalition, residents have picketed the video stores, signed petitions, sent appeals to their community board and called for a meeting with landlords to persuade them to remove their unpopular tenants.
 
'An Invasion'
 "We believe in First Amendment protection, but what we object to is the overwhelming presence of these porn stores," said Susan Herman, a leader of the coalition, recently. "One is an eyesore. Ten are an invasion."
William H. Daly, director of the Mayor's Office of Midtown Enforcement, said that a similar expansion in the porn video trade is occurring in other parts of the city. In 1990, he said, there were only five adult video stores in midtown, but as of May, there were 20. Last year, in Chelsea -- from 14th to 29th Streets -- there were three.
To explain the proliferation of such stores, Mr. Daly noted that sex-related business are highly profitable. He suggested that the AIDS epidemic had stimulated a rise in "electronic voyeurism -- people who prefer not to participate in sex, but just watch." And, he said, landlords who have been stuck with vacant storefronts during the recession might be more willing to rent to anyone.
Many Chelsea residents say that the video stores will ruin their neighborhood, drive away business and make families with children uncomfortable.
The Chelsea Action Coalition, which has about 70 members, plans to lead a protest march on Dec. 20. to one of three video stores opened in Chelsea in the last two months by Ike Bova. Mr. Bova, a 26-year-old Israeli businessman who owns three other sex video stores in Manhattan, said this week that he wanted "to apologize to the community and make a new start."
In an interview, Mr. Bova said he would reopen his shop at 210 Seventh Avenue next week as a regular video store "with a very small porno section in the back." In addition, he said he would make 50 percent of the stock in his store at 725 Sixth Avenue standard videos, but would retain the adult videos at his other stores.
Michael Kramer, vice-chairman of Community Board 4, which covers the West Side from 14th Street to 59th Street, met with Mr. Bova but was not satisfied. He said it was clear that Mr. Bova did not understand that Chelsea was "a close-knit community, with strong family values."
The board has asked the City Council and the City Planning Department to regulate the stores. The requests include zoning sex-related businesses, limiting the concentration of such businesses, regulating exterior signs and windows, and requiring the notices barring anyone under 21 years old.
Lonnie Soury, a spokesman for the City Planning Department, said, "It's legally possible to regulate adult uses but very difficult because of constitutional limits." He said such regulations had been rejected by the Board of Estimate in 1977.
 
'New 42d Street'
 Chelsea merchants resent what they see as Sixth Avenue becoming "a new 42d Street." Marianna Vitale, who owns a pizzeria at 761 Sixth Avenue, said business was down and that it might be because of the influx of porn video stores.
"These video places don't realize people live here and have children, who are curious," Mrs. Vitale said.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark. Dec. 12

 BODY:
As President-elect Bill Clinton begins to fill out his Cabinet appointments, a spate of political knife fights have broken out behind the scenes between interest groups trying to cut their people into the new Administration, and their opponents out.
Already, this ideological combat appears to have dimmed the prospects of Lawrence H. Summers for a top economics job, and of John Young, a business executive who was once the leading candidate for Commerce Secretary. And it is endangering the chances of others. 
A flavor of this combat was given by one potential candidate, who said he received an anonymous phone call on Election Day on his home answering machine.
"You don't know me," the voice said, "but I know your work and I was flying on the shuttle between New York and Washington today, and someone sitting just behind me was doing business very loudly on the airplane phone and you were the subject."
 
Intense Competition
 The Clinton prospect, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the caller then revealed that the man behind him on the plane was organizing a meeting of interest groups to plot a blocking action against the appointment and signed off: "I thought you'd like to know."
This sort of competition for jobs takes place with every Administration but seems particularly intense this season. Not only are Democrats all pushing to the fore at once, having been out of power for 12 years; different ideological wings of the party that banded together to elect Mr. Clinton are now redrawing old battle lines. Moreover, interest groups have proliferated since the last time the Democrats took the Presidency, 16 years ago.
In the spirit of the times, The New Republic has taken to running a series of articles not on people who are getting jobs but on those the authors hope will not. The column, "Hit List," has featured Paula Stern, the trade lawyer and lobbyist; Mickey Kantor, who was Mr. Clinton's campaign manager; Representative Lee Hamilton of Indiana, and Robert Reich, who was named Friday to head the Department of Labor. The magazine's editor, Martin Peretz, says he is now receiving phone calls from Clinton hopefuls lobbying not to be mentioned.
One of the first people to find himself in the gun sights of ideological opponents was Joshua Muravchik, an American Enterprise Institute scholar who contributed to Mr. Clinton's human rights platform during the campaign. Mr. Muravchik is said to be a candidate for Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights.
But as a prominent member of the circle of "neo-conservative" thinkers during the cold war, Mr. Muravchik was at odds with some human rights groups, notably Americas Watch, over his emphasis on defeating communism as the primary goal of human-rights efforts. He had argued that the most important human rights issue was defeating communism, because nothing would liberate more people; his opponents argued that while the cold war was crucial, so were human rights abuses by America's allies.
 
Letter of Disapproval
 Several such groups sent a joint letter three weeks ago to Mr. Clinton's transition office titled "Criteria for Assistant Secretary for Human Rights," which those familiar with the issue say was aimed against conservatives like Mr. Muravchik.
The letter, drafted by a board member of Amnesty International and first published by the weekly journal Jewish Forward, said, among other things, that "The candidate must not have been previously associated with the defense of abusive governments" and must demonstrate "commitment to a single standard for fundamental human rights reporting."
Asked for his reaction, Mr. Muravchik said: "Between me and some of these people there was a lot of antagonistic history that had to do with the cold war. But the cold war is over. And I think that the whole significance of the Clinton campaign was that it got us beyond these old fights. If these people were looking forward instead of backward they would understand that we now have a lot in common: insuring that human rights remains on the front burner of American foreign policy."
Another increasingly active foreign policy interest group is the Jewish Peace Lobby, which is eager to make sure that no Clinton Middle East advisers are drawn from the ranks of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a more conservative lobby known as Aipac. Aipac in recent years tilted in favor of the right-wing Likud Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and has been pushing its own favorite appointees.
The Jewish Peace Lobby sent Mr. Clinton's transition team a letter describing its criteria for the ideal Middle East advisers. "What he must avoid," the letter said, "are appointees closely associated with groups that blindly supported the Shamir government, and analysts who crossed over into advocacy for the positions of the Likud."
On a different front, The Washington Blade, a newspaper aimed at gay readers, broke the story two weeks ago that Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, had asked two aides a decade ago to give up their high security jobs because of their homosexuality.
Senator Nunn confirmed the account, saying he had no choice because the two men were dealing with sensitive data and were deemed security risks by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon. He said he now employs openly homosexual aides in nonsecurity related jobs.
But Tanya Domi, a former army captain now heading the civil rights project for the National Gay Lesbian Task Force, said the action should disqualify Senator Nunn for any Cabinet post. "Having Nunn in the cabinet would be a very difficult thing to swallow for the gay and lesbian community," she said.
Another potential Clinton choice that has fallen victim to the political mores of the 1990's is Mr. Summers, who is on leave from his post as chief economist of the World Bank. He was the early favorite to be Mr. Clinton's Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Several environmental groups, led by the Worldwatch Institute, sent letters to Vice President-elect Al Gore, noting that Mr. Summers once wrote that it might be more economically efficient for heavily polluting industries to move their factories from the industrialized world to developing countries, where there is less concern about such matters.
Mr. Summers says this thought was taken out of context from a draft document in which he was simply musing aloud about different alternatives. Nevertheless, a few days later he was out of the running for that job.
 
Attack on Educator
 The conservatives are in this game, too. They made a pre-emptive strike last week against Johnnetta Cole, the president of Spelman College, the black women's college, who heads the Clinton transition group dealing with education, arts, labor and humanities. The national conservative weekly Human Events carried an article headlined "Clinton Chooses Extremist" that said Ms. Cole "has been actively involved in support of Communist dictatorships in Cuba and Grenada."
Ms. Cole referred all inquiries to Dee Dee Myers, Mr. Clinton's spokeswoman, who said: "She is a lifelong academic, a member of the board of Coca-Cola and a respected member of her community. These charges are silly."
Republicans and liberal Democrats also seem to have helped kill the candidacy of Mr. Young, the president of Hewlett Packard, who was an early Clinton favorite to lead the Commerce Department. Hewlett Packard technology was found at Iraqi military installations after the Persian Gulf war. While the sales were legal and approved by the Commerce Department, anti-arms export groups were incensed at the prospect of Mr. Young's running the Commerce Department.
On Dec. 4, Mr. Young took himself out of the running for a job, saying it "might create the appearance of a conflict of interest because of my financial holdings."

HEADLINE: Eagleburger Says U.S. Now Wants Ban on Serbian Flights Enforced

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STOCKHOLM, Dec. 12

 BODY:
In a stiffening of the Bush Administration's position on the war in the Balkans, Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said today that the United States would support a United Nations resolution to enforce the ban on Serbian flights over Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He also said the Administration was rethinking its opposition to lifting a United Nations arms embargo that has the effect of benefitting the well-armed Serbian forces. 
 Mr. Eagleburger's statements came a day after President-elect Bill Clinton, speaking of President Bush's policy, may have nudged the Administration toward a new resolution enforcing the flight ban. Mr. Eagleburger's remarks reflected an apparent desire within the Bush Administration to leave office having done what it could to ease the crisis in the war-torn remnants of Yugoslavia.
Speaking to reporters en route to Stockholm, where he will meet with European foreign ministers to discuss the Balkan crisis and other issues, Mr. Eagleburger explained why the United States had changed its position. He cited the deterioration of the situation on the ground in Bosnia and added that, as in Somalia, the United States could not "simply ignore it and leave it to the next Administration."
The Administration, he added, had to deal with the crisis in the Balkans so it would be "containable and manageable."
 
'History Doesn't Stop'
 "We cannot obviously make commitments that tie down a new Administration," Mr. Eagleburger said. "On the other hand, history doesn't stop between now and the 20th of January."
At a news conference in Little Rock, Ark., on Friday, Mr. Clinton said the United States and its allies should do what it takes, apparently including air strikes but not the deployment of ground troops, to enforce the flight ban. During the election campaign, Mr. Clinton also said he would consider recommending an international call to end the arms embargo.
[Asked about his Friday remarks at another news conference on Saturday, Mr. Clinton said he had not criticized the Bush Administration policy. "I did not question the Administration's policy," he said. "I pointed out that the reason this no-fly zone had not been enforced in the past is not because the Bush Administration had not been willing to, but because of the concerns the French and the British had about putting their soldiers at greater risk because they are on the ground in Bosnia and we are not."]
Mr. Eagleburger acknowledged that there was still opposition within the Administration to enforcing the ban on Serbian flights as well as resistance by both the French and British Governments, which are concerned that the safety of the troops they have committed to the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia could be jeopardized.
"We would like to see an enforcement resolution passed," he said, adding that he would discuss the issue at meetings in Stockholm, Geneva and Brussels next week. But he added, "I am not going to go in there with a baseball bat and say we are now going to go for an enforcement resolution."
 
Serbs Violate Ban
 The Serbs routinely violate the ban on flights and have flown both warplanes and helicopters more than 200 times since it was imposed in the fall. There are reports from United Nations military observers that Serbs have used helicopters in combat missions against targets on the ground in recent weeks, but no independent confirmation from United States intelligence officials.
Until now, the Bush Administration has remained firmly opposed to lifting the United Nations arms embargo in the Balkans, arguing that any move to allow arms to flow to either side would only increase the level of violence and prolong the fighting. But in recent days the State Department has drafted a memorandum that argues both sides of the issues, senior Administration officials said.
The United States, Mr. Eagleburger said, is prepared "to examine with others whether it would be wise to move away from the solid position we have all taken of a flat arms embargo with regard to the Bosnian Muslims."

HEADLINE: Juggling Jobs and the Deficit: Executives Doubtful

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Many of America's senior executives say job creation is the Government's most important immediate task and the budget deficit the nation's most important economic problem. But foreshadowing what is almost certain to be a major economic conflict of Bill Clinton's Presidency, the executives say that the President-elect will not be able to address those two concerns simultaneously.
Those views, on the eve of Mr. Clinton's economic summit in Little Rock, Ark., this week, surfaced in a New York Times/CBS News poll of 499 senior executives in early December and in follow-up interviews with a dozen of them. Both the poll results and the interviews revealed some enthusiasm for the new President. While 53 percent of the executives voted for George Bush, a whopping 71 percent said the President had not displayed as much concern for the economy as Clinton had during the campaign. And 81 percent said the Clinton election has increased consumer confidence and spending. 
 "Clinton will speed up the economy initially because he has a lot of people feeling good," said John R. Albers, chairman of the Dr Pepper-Seven Up Companies, the Dallas-based concern that makes the concentrate for the two soft drinks. "A lot of people, including myself, would have preferred Bush as a proactive President, but he was not. Clinton is satisfactory, he is proactive, and we will see what happens."
 
'Mutually Exclusive Goals'
 But faulting Mr. Bush is one thing and voting for Mr. Clinton -- only 21 percent of the executives did -- or endorsing his proposals is another. The executives stressed the importance of job creation, with 63 percent calling it the more important immediate task. Thirty-nine percent labeled the budget deficit as the nation's most important economic problem. Fifty-three percent, in fact, opposed increasing the deficit next year to create jobs and stimulate the economy through public-works spending.
John Watson, chairman of the Horizon Potash Corporation, which has a potash mine in New Mexico, said: "The key issue is, Can you create the jobs and control the deficit? And the answer is that these are mutually exclusive goals. The only way the Government can do it is to create jobs through public-works projects, and that is wasteful spending. A Democratic President and Congress will spend; that is a certainty. But they cannot tax people enough to cover their spending."
No theme is likely to be more hotly debated during the early months of the Clinton presidency than the tradeoff between public spending and the deficit. The executives, as well as the Federal Reserve, argue that deficit spending on highways, fiber-optic networks, high-speed trains and the like damages the economy over the long run by driving up the inflation rate and with it, interest rates. Seventy-four percent of the executives polled said they expect the inflation rate to rise during the Clinton years.
Top Federal Reserve officials have recently asserted that the economy has in fact surged since October, but the rapid growth, they say, will soon slow. And a slowly growing economy is preferable, they say, even if slow growth limits job creation.
Mr. Clinton has not come down clearly on either side of the tradeoff between public spending and the deficit. He has mainly argued that his proposal for $20 billion a year in additional public-works spending -- needed not only to help re-employ idle Americans but also to rebuild the nation's infrastructure -- will be self-financing, partly through new tax revenues. But 62 percent of the 499 executives said Mr. Clinton would not be able to create jobs and reduce the deficit in the next four years, and 58 percent added that he is unlikely to reduce the deficit.
 
'A Leap of Faith'
 What's more, most of those in the follow-up interviews rejected a key assumption of the Clinton camp -- that public spending, if properly directed, helps Americans and thus adds to the national wealth.
"Intuitively, a better railroad system should have some benefit by moving people and goods more efficiently," said Robert Harris, senior vice president of the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company of Radnor, Pa. "But I am fearful that Mr. Clinton will revert to the spending programs that have been in place with Democrats before, without figuring out which are productivity-improving and which are wasteful."
Not everyone agreed. Roger W. Johnson, chairman of the Western Digital Corporation of Irvine, Calif., insisted that Mr. Clinton can break a pattern of wasteful Government spending. "There are prudent reductions in defense and health care costs that can be made," said Mr. Johnson, who campaigned for Mr. Clinton and voted for him. "This will not reduce the money spent, but it means that money badly spent can now be spent by the Government on more productive things. This has not been the history of our Government. It requires a leap of faith, and the American people took that leap in electing Bill Clinton."
The 499 executives represent a cross-section of American industry, from multibillion-dollar corporations to small family concerns. Optimistically, 60 percent of them said the economy was getting better, while 34 percent said it was neither improving nor deteriorating. That response compares with a more pessimistic view held in late February, when 47 percent of 490 executives polled found the economy getting better and 44 percent said it was staying the same.
 
'Our Best Year Ever'
 Seventy-nine percent of the executives said their own companies had been doing well lately, often better than their surrounding communities. For example, Charles Updegraff, president of the Citizens Trust Company in Coudersport, Pa., said, "We are having our best year ever."
He noted that profits were up because the interest rates that Citizens Trust charges for the mortgages and consumer loans in which it specializes are so much higher than the rates paid for deposits. But loan demand remains weak. "Consumers have so much debt that they don't qualify for more," Mr. Updegraff said.
The executives polled in early December were more sanguine than the general public. Only 29 percent of all American adults say the economy is getting better, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll last week.
"I travel to our branches a lot, and our customers tell me that the country is in a big recession, but they are doing better," said Benjamin F. Edwards, chairman of A. G. Edwards Inc., a stock brokerage firm based in St. Louis. "I thought the economy was getting better in March, and I still think so."
Thirty-seven percent of the executives participating in the latest poll, which was conducted by telephone from Dec. 1 to Dec. 9 -- before President Clinton announced his new economic team -- said they planned to increase employment over the next year, while 54 percent said they planned no changes. Those percentages were virtually the same as those in the late February poll, and since then the number of Americans holding jobs has hardly changed. Both polls had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 6 percentage points.
A few executives interviewed, including Mr. Edwards, have hired workers in recent weeks, but most said they had either frozen hiring or shrunk their staffs in recent years. They achieved this mainly through automation or other efficiencies so they could maintain production with fewer workers and thus cut costs and compete more effectively.
 
The Main Message
 But the executives' main message for Mr. Clinton's economic conference tomorrow, expressed most clearly in the follow-up interviews, appeared to be this: Although civilian jobs have increased only 1 million during the Bush Presidency, or one-tenth of 1 percent, job creation should nevertheless be mostly the domain of the private sector, and Mr. Clinton's economic policies should be channeled to encourage the private sector, mainly through tax incentives.
Ninety-two percent of the executives polled, for example, favored a tax credit that would reduce the cost of new investments in factories and machinery. This, however, is not necessarily the proposal put forth by Mr. Clinton, who wants to reward mainly the investment that results in expansion and more jobs. Only 62 percent of executives said that an investment tax credit, whatever the form, would actually prompt them to invest.
"Clinton does not create jobs; private business does," said Mr. Albers of Dr Pepper-Seven Up. "He can only do this through public spending, which runs up the deficit and is wasteful." But Mr. Albers also said that the private sector was still cutting costs, largely through labor cutbacks, and that until that process is completed job creation in the private sector would be minimal. His own companies, for example, are now hiring, but only after having reduced the work force from 1,200 in the late 1980's to 980 people today.
Regarding taxes, the executives had some strong views. Apart from favoring an investment tax credit, 67 percent of them endorsed higher taxes on foreign companies operating in the United States, a Clinton proposal. By a narrow margin they opposed another Clinton plan: higher taxes on family incomes exceeding $200,000. The verdict was 51 percent to 48 percent.
Fifty-nine percent of the executives favored a Clinton proposal to cut the taxes paid by middle-class families, with most of the support coming from senior executives at small companies.
Seventy-seven percent of the executives expect expect retail sales during the Christmas season to be better than last year, a prediction that appears to be holding up in the early returns from retailers.
And many executives were more optimistic than they had been in February about stock prices. In February, the executives expected the Dow Jones industrial average to rise to 3,388 by the end of this month -- an expectation that right now is just short of being reached, at 3,304. Now they expect the Dow to rise to 3,426 by December 1993.
That is not much of an increase. But then Arnold M. Nemirow, chief executive of the Wausau Paper Mills Company in Wausau, Wis., says the economy is not yet all that strong, either. "We have not recovered yet," he said. "There are just beginning signs. We need to run with this recovery for a year to see what happens."
 
 
 
HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED
 The New York Times/CBS News Poll of American business executives is based on interviews with 499 senior executives at companies throughout the United States, interviewed by telephone from Dec. 1 to Dec. 9.
The sample of companies and executives called was provided by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services and was randomly drawn from those listed in its nationwide data base of private and publicly owned companies.
Companies with $5 million or more in annual revenues were eligible for the survey. Within each company one executive at a senior level was interviewed. Titles eligible for the poll included owner, partner, chief executive, chairman, president, executive vice president and senior vice president, with first opportunity for an interview given to the most senior official.
The completed sample included 245 interviews in companies with $5 million to $99 million in annual revenue, 120 interviews in companies with $100 million to $499 million, and 134 interviews in companies with $500 million or more. The completed sample was then weighted by revenue size to reflect the actual distribution of all listed companies in the country because small companies predominate.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, results based on such samples will differ by no more than six percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out senior executives at all listed companies in the country with annual revenues of $5 million or more.
The potential sampling error for smaller sub-groups is larger. For example, for the biggest companies, those with $500 million or more in annual revenue, it is plus or minus nine percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey can introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
In Mayor's Race, Gay Vote Is Appealing

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The raucous debate over whether New York City's schools should teach first graders to respect homosexuals, and how they might do so, has probably obscured other and clearer signs of the growing political power of the city's gay voters.
Both Mayor David N. Dinkins and his all-but-certain Republican challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, have gone out of their way to appeal for the votes of gay New Yorkers. 
 The Mayor tried to demonstrate his commitment last week by joining the national debate over a constitutional amendment approved by Colorado voters last month that overturns laws prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals. Mr. Dinkins had already said that in response to the amendment he would not attend a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors planned for next June in Colorado Springs. Last week, he turned up his efforts, writing a letter to the mayors' group asking it to relocate the meeting outside Colorado. (He mentioned that New York might make a nice alternative.)
While the Mayor declined to agree to an economic boycott, in which the city would refrain from buying goods and services, he did impose a ban on travel by city employees to Colorado. The ban, of course, is largely symbolic, since city officials don't exactly flock to the Rocky Mountain State on municipal business.
Mr. Giuliani is also acutely aware of the importance of symbolism when it comes to attracting New York's rainbow of voters. The former Federal prosecutor got together two weeks ago with four Republican City Council members to endorse a proposed city bill that would enable victims of bias attacks, including homosexuals, to seek civil damages of as much as $100,000 from their attackers through the city's Human Rights Commission.
 
Little Rock Talk
 Several people from the New York metropolitan area have figured in the discussions over the emerging shape of the Clinton Administration. Dennis Rivera, the head of Local 1199 of the hospital workers' union, will be among those invited to Little Rock tomorrow for the President-elect's economic summit. Mr. Rivera, a progressive Democrat, is one of only four national labor leaders invited to participate, according to an aide.
Some local officials have also been rumored to be under consideration for cabinet posts and other jobs in the new Administration. The city's Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez has ruminated publicly about the honor of national service.
In Hartford, there was talk that some old Washington friends of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. were lobbying on his behalf for a Federal post. Like Mr. Fernandez, the Governor did nothing to discourage the speculation.

As a brutal wintery storm continued its assault on the metropolitan region yesterday, retailers and public officials began assessing the financial costs, ranging from wind and water damage to thousands of homes and businesses to a setback on what had been brisk holiday sales. While the total impact on the region was impossible to measure, large losses seem certain on several levels of its economy. For large retailers in all three states, the storm all but obliterated sales for at least 24 hours, with empty department stores in New York City and malls closing in surrounding areas. By yesterday, customers were returning and stores were reopening in much of the region, but malls in Connecticut reported a drop-off in the number of patrons because of the snow that had started falling.
Glen Wielgus, marketing manager for the South Street Seaport, said that the storm came at "a very unfortunate time."
 
Immense Costs of Cleanup
 "It's particularly unfortunate at the time between Thanksgiving and Christmas," he said. "For most major retailers, this time can be upwards of 20 percent of annual sales. So to lose one busy, one good Christmas Day is very unfortunate.
"It was definitely a blow, but it was not a major blow," he said. 
 Stephen Byron, a manager of the Monmouth Mall, with 160 stores in Monmouth, N.J., agreed. "If this was a hurricane and we sustained damage that closed us for a week, it would have been a different story."
In beachfront communities throughout New York and New Jersey, residents and businesses feared a far greater problem than a short-term loss of business: an expensive and prolonged effort to repair severely eroded beaches and thousands of watefront homes.
Even before the storm had subsided, officials in all three states had said the cost for cleanup and repair of tunnels, bridges, roads, breakwaters, sea walls, and eroded beaches would be immense.
"One lost day is not going to wipe us out, but this will be expensive," said Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, an agency that was, perhaps more than any other, at the economic eye of the storm.
It was forced to close La Guardia Airport from Friday until midday yesterday, canceling 400 flights. It closed the New Jersey PATH system, affecting 50,000 riders, and the system's flooded train tunnels were still being pumped out yesterday. Two of its major bridges, the Outerbridge Crossing and the Goethals bridge, reopened yesterday after being closed on Friday.
'Every available body we have is either on call or out there working," Mr. Brezenoff said yesterday afternoon. "I'll tabulate the cost later."
"It is safe to say that the damage is worse on the New Jersey shore than anything we've had in years," said Jon Shure, a spokesman for Gov. Jim Florio.
He said it will take at least until tomorrow to tabulate even preliminary estimates of damage.
In a host of ocean-front communities along the Jersey Shore, the South Shore of Long Island, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Westchester and Connecticut, homeowners were just beginning to assess the damage.
"I've been here 30-odd years, and this is the worst," said Ted Hommel, whose home in Long Beach, on the south shore of Long Island, was flooded yesterday. His heat and telephones were out, and his yard was strewn with the tangled flotsam of splintered docks and Styrofoam.
Damage to many homes was even more severe.
"There were some that the ocean just blew through, in the back and out the front," said Mary Lou Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Ocean County Office of Emergency Management in New Jersey.
In ways that were scattered and sometimes perverse, there were glimmers of a silver lining in the storm. With thousands of commuters stranded in New York City on Friday night, hotels reported crushing demand for rooms, business was brisk at restaurants, and bars were packed wall-to-wall with unfamiliar patrons.
Restaurant and theater managers in the Theater District of Manhattan said the surge in business seemed to carry over to yesterday.
Video stores were also meccas for customers. On Friday, "there were twice as many people in here, maybe three times as many as normal," said Karim Baez, manager of the Blockbuster Video store at Eighth Avenue and 17th Street in Manhattan. The reason: legions of people in his neighborhood, as throughout the region, simply stayed home when the storm began gaining force.
Other merchants said they benefitted by providing shelter from the storm to commuters with nowhere else to go.
"One woman said at least the mall was warm, and she could get her kids something to eat," said Daryl Hasko, marketing manager of the Seaview Square Mall, just west of Asbury Park, New Jersey. "While she was here, she decided to do some Christmas shopping."
But those finding reason for solace in the storm were far outnumbered by those who said the storm's legacy would be a huge costs to businesses, homeowners, insurance companies and taxpayers.
"It's worse than any hurricane we've had," said Mary Cavanaugh of Long Beach as she surveyed the severe damage to her waterfront deck yesterday. Not far away, a stray canoe was surging in the waves and trapped between the pilings of what had been her deck.
With a laugh , she added, "At least I got a new boat out of it."
At Westfarms Mall in West Hartford, the number of shoppers on Friday was about normal, but it dropped yesterday as snows that missed central Connecticut in the first leg of the storm began falling in earnest, according to Dianne Noth, the mall's general manager. At the Danbury Fair Mall, shoppers scared away by Friday's severe weather apparently stayed scared yesterday.
"Yesterday was a disaster," said Leo Rogoza, the assistant general manager at the mall. "Today is even worse." Mr. Rogoza said the mall would typically attract 25,000 or more shoppers on a pre-Christmas Saturday. He estimated that only several hundred shoppers had made it into the 238-store center by late morning.
Many companies and stores that closed Friday reopened yesterday, only to find their own basements or showrooms damaged by floodwaters and wind.
"There is no one down here," said Joseph Caraballo, manager of the Fulton Market Retail Fish store at the South Street Seaport.
His store, like others on the building's lower floor, were flooded on Friday, and clean-up efforts were in high gear yesterday.
"It's killing us," Mr. Caraballo said. "Things were already bad because of the economy, and we didn't need this storm.

HEADLINE: MISSION TO SOMALIA;
Seared by Faces of Need, Americans Say, 'How Could We Not Do This?'

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BROOKVILLE, Ind., Dec. 9
<

 BODY:
Huddled against the cold outside the Franklin County Agricultural Co-Op, his 18-wheeler loaded with pig innards, Todd Schuppert doesn't consider himself an expert on foreign affairs, but he knows exactly what he thinks about the decision to send American troops to Somalia.
"I think it's a pretty doggone good idea," said Mr. Schuppert, a 31-year-old truck driver from Pekin, Ind. "You just have to turn on a television to see that those people need help, and no one else is going to help them but us." 
 Americans may have spent an endless political year stressing the primacy of domestic concerns over international ones. But interviews this week from a military base in Alabama to the "American Gothic" towns of Indiana, from an embattled housing project in Atlanta to a festive downtown mall in Cincinnati, indicate that the desperate images of starvation halfway across the world have produced a moral clarity for people like few issues in recent years.
There are dissenters, and many people seem aware that time could make the issues more complicated than they seem now. But like a shadow Christmas, never quite absent from the joyous one unfolding at home, the hellish images from the Horn of Africa have left most Americans with a feeling that action is appropriate if only because inaction is unthinkable. A New York Times/CBS News poll taken Dec. 7-9 found that 81 percent of those polled favored sending American troops to Somalia.
 
Disquiet Beneath Compassion
 Thus, as he and his 3-year-old grandson, Matthew, admired a towering Christmas tree and model railroad exhibit at a shopping plaza in downtown Cincinnati, Lee Hoskins came back three times in a 10-minute talk to the same thought.
"You see those starving kids on TV," said Mr. Hoskins, a 59-year-old route salesman for a dairy company, who lives just across the Ohio River in Villa Hills, Ky. "And you think, 'How could we not do this?' "
Of course, some people see the issues as more complicated, compounded by questions of race, politics and economics. Some see a quintessentially American naivete in the idea that United States military action can be safe, brief and successful. Others see something more troubling than comforting in the way television has made the world's suffering as inescapable as a four-alarm fire next door.
But in a season suffused with indelible imagery, Americans clearly see timeless images of themselves -- more Jimmy Stewart than John Wayne -- in the military action under way in Somalia.
 
New Wave of Idealism
 Paul L. Simon, a history professor at Xavier University in Cincinnati, said he thought the Somalia mission could be more protracted and "stickier and nastier" than many people think. He said changes in the post-cold war world should make Americans rethink their role as an international Lone Ranger, whether in humanitarian operations or bellicose ones. And the nation's inaction in the equally horrific but far less manageable nightmare in the former Yugoslavia underscores the fact that practical considerations as well as humanitarian ones are involved.
But Professor Simon said the Somali operation and the initial reaction to it resonated with the nation's historic sense of itself. "Here again we have another one of those waves of American idealism, of Woodrow Wilson and others," he said. "Make the world safe for democracy, make the world safe, spread democratic principles, spread kindness in this holiday season. That's us, that's what we do."
Of course, in a time of economic distress at home, some people are looking askance at another enormous American effort to send help elsewhere. The Times/CBS News poll found that 48 percent of the 1,333 respondents said the troops should stay only so long as it takes to set up supply lines, while 44 percent said they should stay as long as it takes to make sure Somalia remains peaceful. Forty-two percent of those polled said they were "very concerned" the United States could become involved in a civil war there. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
"I'm not pleased with it," said Pam Suver, 40-years old, who owns a straw brokering and baling business in Circleville, Ohio. "I don't think we know what we're getting into. There are ways we can help, but I don't think we should be sending our troops there."
 
Problems Right Here
 Aliton Murphy, the 38-year-old manager of the agricultural co-op's store here in this county seat and farming town of 2,500 people where the parking meters downtown still take pennies, worries that the operation is another case of the United States taking on a role other nations should play. He said the Government should set a deadline of early January for other nations to take over the operation and should leave then, regardless.
"Americans are a caring and a giving people, but we shouldn't be taking all the risk," he said. "We need to get others, particularly African nations, involved and then pack our bags and get out of Dodge. You can only ride a free horse for so long."
The most often-cited reason for opposing the operation is that the United States has enormous problems of its own it should be addressing.
"People here need help," said a 30-year-old deliveryman from Cincinnati who would give his name only as Coy. "It's like me helping you get your car fixed when mine doesn't work. I don't feed your kids when mine are hungry. We have too many problems of our own."
 
More Holidays Far Away
 Seldom, if ever, have the miseries of a people half the world away been as omnipresent as they were in the United States this week. In the otherworldly face of a starving Somali child staring out from the cover of Time magazine and the skeletal bodies waiting for food on TV screens, Somalia's agony seemed to be everywhere.
In the PX of the United States Army Aviation Center at Fort Rucker near Enterprise, Ala., a half dozen televisions turned to CNN's Headline News beamed out the pictures from Somalia.
Many of those looking on had a particular interest, like Specialist 4 Glen Williams, 24 years old, and Pfc. Sara Smith, 20 years old, both water sanitation specialists with the United States Army Aviation Medical Center here. Fort Rucker, so far, has not been a part of the military buildup.
With memories of the December buildup before the Persian Gulf war so fresh, many military people shudder at the thought of another holiday-season military action.
"I just hate to have another Christmas war," said Private Smith. "It's pretty rough."
 
Rebuke to Budget Cutters
 But she and Specialist Williams see the operation in Somalia as both an important use of the American military and a telling warning against too rapid a reduction in the nation's forces.
Kris Reese, a 29-year-old warrant officer candidate training to be a helicopter pilot, was one of the few people interviewed at Fort Rucker who voiced strong reservations about the Somalia mission. He worried that it could set a burdensome precedent and that the situation there was less manageable than people expect.
"We have a mission, and we have to carry it out, but I have very mixed feelings about it," he said. "For me, the question is who's the enemy? Are people going to be smiling at you one minute and then shooting at you the next? You don't know."
More common was a combination of post-gulf war pride and a sense the Somalia mission, unlike intervention in Bosnia, was both worthwhile and manageable. Several saw it as a harbinger of the changing role the military can play in a post-cold war world.
 
Not Slaughtering, but Saving
 "There are a lot of things the military can do beyond combat," said Specialist 4 Patrick Gross, a 22-year-old soldier from Chicago. "I think this shows a better side of the military than just a force that's good at slaughtering people. The military is more than trained commando killers. It can also be a force for good."
To some people, particularly some blacks, the question is not whether the United States should go in, but why it didn't do it sooner.
"I think we should have moved faster," said Joseph Arrington, a 45-year-old mail carrier and retired Army sergeant-major from Enterprise. "I'm retired military and a whole-hearted flag waver, so I hate to read racist overtones into things, but it's like with the Haitians, we move slower when people of color are involved."
Most Americans were less critical. In the latest Times/CBS News poll 73 percent of the respondents approved of the way President Bush has been handling the situation in Somalia. Mr. Bush's overall job rating stood at 50 percent approval; that was up from 37 percent approval just before Election Day, and was the highest level measured for Mr. Bush in any Times/CBS News poll taken during 1992.
For many of the black poor, like the residents of the East Lake Meadows housing project in Atlanta, a forlorn vista of boarded-up buildings where the frigid wind whips the wash hanging out, intervention was an easy decision.
"As an ex-soldier, I think they're doing the right thing," said Luther J. Wells, who was one of the first black soldiers called to duty in World War II. "I would volunteer today if I could."
 
TV's Bully Pulpit
 While doubts sometimes surface, more common is an almost awestruck sense of the ways in which the crisis in Somalia highlights an ever smaller, more intimate world. To some, there is something troubling in television's ability to set a national agenda simply by the force of the images beamed into America's living rooms.
"I really believe this is our fourth branch of government," said Wasif F. Abboushi, a political science professor at the University of Cincinnati. "We can control Congress, the President, we can yell and scream, but we haven't devised a way to hold the media accountable to the people."
But for many, this is a case where television has been a force for good, appealing to the world's conscience.
"I really don't think this has anything to do with race or religion," said Kathy Johanneman, 51 years old, who was shopping in Cincinnati. "There's a lot of hatred in the world, a lot of prejudice, but this is the kind of thing that reminds you how the world keeps getting smaller and closer every day. We can't afford not to help each other anymore."
 
Parable for the Season
 There are already signs the operation may become more complicated than people expect, and the moral certainty of December could easily become the political quagmire of February. But for many people Somalia has become a Christmas-season parable, making it difficult to look at the commercial icongraphy of plenty -- golden arches, all-you-can-eat steak joints and manic Big Boys bearing overstuffed burgers -- without thinking twice.
If there's a bottom to American life, Kenneth Moss lives there. For two months he's been homeless and living on a vacant lot in southeast Atlanta. He keeps warm by a roaring fire in an industrial barrel, blocked from the wind by two pieces of plywood, and begs for spare change for food. But even here, the case for intervention in Somalia seems obvious.
"Even though we've got people starving here, I feel it's necessary for us to go," he said. "I'll survive. But you've got kids starving to death over there."

HEADLINE: Jaruzelski Faces Accusers, or Is It Vice Versa?

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the last Communist leader of Poland, sits impassively at the head of a long wooden table in Parliament. Arrayed behind him are the balding and gray-haired Communists who, on Dec. 13, 1981, crushed the Solidarity movement with a show of force they called martial law.
It is a cathartic scene, one that 11 yeas ago could have been no more than a fantasy to Solidarity leaders: General Jaruzelski and his aides summoned to account for themselves by a democratically elected Parliament. 
 But the reality, unfolding in a series of hearings this fall, has proved far less emotionally satisfying for a country that has been more reluctant than its neighbors to pursue the old Government.
Thus far, the committee's grand hopes for ferreting out the truth about martial law from Polish and Soviet archives have proved unavailing.
Meanwhile, General Jaruzelski has been using the inquiry as his own bully pulpit, restating that he was a patriot who saved Poland from civil conflict or Soviet intervention.
Edward Rzepka, the lawyer who is chairman of the Commission on Constitutional Responsibility, said: "We're in an extremely difficult situation. We must operate within the limits of the law. We can do nothing that would be seen as restricting the rights of the defendants."
One focus has been on such arcane questions as whether the Constitution permitted the imposition of martial law while Parliament was in session.
The legalistic tone has infuriated the political leaders who feel that Poland has dragged its feet in settling accounts with the Communists.
But the public seems decidedly unmoved. In one recent survey, a majority agreed that General Jaruzelski was a patriot and that Ryszard Kuklinski, the Polish Army officer who disclosed the martial law plans to American intelligence in 1980, was a traitor.
Initially, the case was based on a section of the Polish code relating to abuse of office that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.
When the defendants contested this statute, the commission said it would consider charges of treason under a law that makes it a crime to take away Poland's independence or overthrow the "social-economic system." Penalties range from a minimum of five years in prison to execution.
Solidarity, Eastern Europe's first free trade union, born in 1980, challenged the Communists' monopoly on power.
By December 1980, the Soviets were poised to invade Poland, and American intelligence detected troop movements on the border. A stern warning from President Carter, already a lame duck, dissuaded Moscow.
The following year, General Jaruzelski became Communist Party chief in Poland. In his book "Martial Law: Why," he recounts hints from Moscow that an invasion was imminent in December 1981.
Recently released Soviet documents suggest that, in fact, Moscow never had any intention of invading Poland in 1981. Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader, has confirmed this fact in recent interviews, but he added that General Jaruzelski had no way of knowing it.
Arguments about martial law quickly become cerebral. Did the Soviets bluff General Jaruzelski and his Government into the crackdown? Or are the Communists creating after-the-fact justifications for what amounted to a coup d'etat?
Many Poles see a basic question of fairness in charges against the Communists who played a role in their own demise.
Under the leadership of General Jaruzelski, Poland's Communists were the first in Eastern Europe to relinquish power, and they did so through "round table" negotiations in 1989. The general remained as President, resigning in 1991.
In his testimony, General Jaruzelski betrayed no anger. At one point, though, he reminded the committee of his role in smoothing Poland's transition to democracy. "The round table did not drop out of heaven," he said, looking Mr. Rzepka squarely in the eye.

HEADLINE: Trenton Reports Tax Revenues Are Up Slightly From Last Year

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
New Jersey tax revenues are up slightly, even though the state reduced its sales tax this year, the state treasurer, Samuel F. Crane, reports.
The state revenues were bolstered by higher-than-expected income tax collections, reflecting money received by Nov. 30. 
 While Mr. Crane said this "suggests an increase in economic activity," he added a caution.
"It would be premature to attach too much significance to these collections," Mr. Crane said. "I am encouraged by the income tax collections, but we need to see sustained growth over a number of months before we can get optimistic about economic recovery."
In total, state revenues were up by 0.4 percent. The income-tax revenues collected from July 1 to Nov. 30 are up by 10.9 percent.
"To me, that indicates more employment," said State Senator Robert E. Littell, chairman of the Senate budget committee. "Our unemployment is still high, but there's also been an increase in employment."
The sales tax, which was reduced from 7 percent to 6 percent on July 1 by the Republican-controlled Legislature, produced about $140 million less than last year over the first four months of the fiscal year. The figures for sales tax released Friday are through Oct. 31 because these collections lag by one month.
Projected over the year, the sales tax would be down by about $420 million -- less than the $608 million shortfall predicted by the Florio administration earlier this year.
Mr. Crane said the sales-tax revenues were "on target" with his predictions, noting that the Christmas retail season -- not included in this report -- represents a large share of that tax. The January and February revenue reports will include Christmas season sales, he said.
Corporation taxes are also up by 3.5 percent for the first five months of the fiscal year.
Mr. Littell said he thought the state revenue picture would improve by "8 percent or 9 percent" in the coming fiscal year.

Teams Open Wallets And Insert New Faces

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
A year ago, the Mets, the Cincinnati Reds and the Kansas City Royals were the most active off-season teams, the ones that made the most dramatic moves. The results, however, did not match the expectations. The Mets stumbled their way through the season and finished fifth, the Reds' injuries undermined their effort, and the Royals never recovered from 16 losses in their first 17 games.
The Mets, whose 1992 payroll was more impressive than their performance, decided to play a more reserved game this off season. But the Reds and the Royals would not be deterred and once more are among the teams that have taken the most significant steps to try to improve their chances for the 1993 season. 
 Bob Quinn was the general manager last year when the Reds acquired Greg Swindell, Tim Belcher, Scott Bankhead and Bip Roberts. Jim Bowden is the general manager who has orchestrated the team's recent moves.
The Reds have replaced the departed Swindell with John Smiley, also a left-handed free-agent pitcher, and they have tried to bolster their offense with the acquisition of Kevin Mitchell and Roberto Kelly. To achieve their offensive aim, though, the Reds will need Mitchell and Kelly to produce considerably more runs than they did this year.
Herk Robinson, the Royals' general manager, continued the renovation project he began last year when he obtained three-fourths of an infield -- Wally Joyner, Keith Miller and Gregg Jefferies -- plus an outfielder, Kevin McReynolds.
This time Robinson has traded for second baseman Jose Lind and signed shortstop Greg Gagne as a free agent. In his biggest coup, though, he signed David Cone for the starting rotation, which missed the stabilizing influence of Bret Saberhagen, the staff ace Robinson traded a year ago.
The Boston Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs have been active, too. The Red Sox have signed a big hitter, Andre Dawson; traded for another hitter, Ivan Calderon, and signed an effective reliever, Bankhead. They also have added second baseman Scott Fletcher.
The Cubs, who let Dawson go, have plowed through the free-agent market nonetheless. They have signed one starting pitcher, Jose Guzman; two left-handed relief pitchers, Randy Myers and Dan Plesac, and an outfielder, Candy Maldonado. They also have obtained a starting pitcher, Greg Hibbard, in a trade.
Then there are the three clubs whose new owners joined the spending spree their previous owners had resisted. The Houston Astros signed Doug Drabek and Swindell, the Detroit Tigers signed Mike Moore and Bill Krueger, as well as retaining Lou Whitaker and Bill Gullickson, and the Seattle Mariners (with money they didn't use while wrapping up Ken Griffey Jr. for four years and hiring Lou Piniella as manager) signed Chris Bosio and Mike Felder. They also acquired a bullpen leader, Norm Charlton, while shedding Mitchell's large salary.
 
The Blue Jays' Strange Moves
 The most debatable ventures belong to the Toronto Blue Jays. By keeping Joe Carter from defecting to the Royals, then coming back later the same evening last week and snatching Paul Molitor from the Milwaukee Brewers and luring Dave Stewart away from Oakland the following evening -- all for $41 million -- the Blue Jays caught everyone's attention.
But there might have been more style than substance in their dramatic maneuvers. Are the Blue Jays, on paper, now a better team than the one that won the World Series in October?
No.
First, they have substituted Molitor for Dave Winfield as their basic designated hitter. Molitor, five years younger than Winfield, may be more productive than Winfield next season or three seasons from now, but it's not very likely that he will provide more punch than Winfield did last season, when he batted .290, hit 26 home runs and drove in 108 runs.
Second, although Stewart's supporters believe he has solid seasons left despite his 23-21 record the past two seasons, he cannot replace both Cone and Jimmy Key, who have departed as free agents.
Third, Tom Henke hasn't officially departed, but he is expected to. They have Duane Ward to replace him as their closer, but Ward cannot be as good as Henke and Ward together have been for Toronto.
Which is not to say the Blue Jays won't be the favorite to win the American League East championship a third consecutive time. The Brewers, by losing Molitor and Bosio and possibly Robin Yount, and the Baltimore Orioles, by remaining relatively inactive, could insure the Blue Jays' preseason position at least.
 
The Yankees' Values
 Do not overlook the Yankees' activity. No team has made as many offers -- rich offers -- to free agents and emerged with so little. The Yankees have improved their starting rotation with Jimmy Key and Jim Abbott; they have added a veteran shortstop, Spike Owen, albeit one with limited range and a below-average arm, and they have acquired a left-handed hitter, Paul O'Neill, who, if he remembers how, could hit some home runs.
But the Yankees continue to astound other clubs and agents alike with some of their offers to free agents. The Yankees have come to believe that they must pay a premium to lure players to their clubhouse, but what they did in signing Owen was reminiscent, on a smaller scale, of their pursuit of Danny Tartabull last year.
At the time the Yankees put a fullcourt press on Tartabull, he had one offer -- from the Texas Rangers for three guaranteed years at $11 million. They gave him a guaranteed $25.5 million for five years.
The Yankees gave Owen $7 million for three years, but no one else was prepared to give him half that much. Furthermore, the Yankees' offer was so overwhelming, they could have asked him to wait until last Tuesday to sign. That would have given the Montreal Expos a chance not to offer salary arbitration, and the Yankees could have avoided giving up a draft choice as compensation.
The premature and unnecessarily expensive signing of Owen shows what happens when a general manager is superseded by a managing partner who has no baseball training and whose father-in-law many people suspect is calling the shots three months before he is permitted to become involved again.
 
A No-Load Right-Hander
 David Cone will pay more income tax on the $9 million signing bonus he will receive from the Royals this month than most people earn in a lifetime. Do not feel bad for him, however. Baseball's biggest-ever signing bonus will nevertheless be kind to Cone.
After paying 31 percent Federal tax and 6 percent state tax, Cone will still have $5.8 million. If he were to do nothing more adventurous than invest the entire amount in 6-percent triple-tax-exempt municipal bonds, Cone would receive $350,000 a year for as long as he maintained the investment.
The median salary in the major league this year was $400,000.
 
New Member for P.R.C.
 When Richard Jacobs, owner of the Cleveland Indians, was added to the Player Relations Committee board of directors last week, Bud Selig was asked why only hard-line, anti-union owners are put on the board. Douglas Danforth of the Pittsburgh Pirates was the last owner added before Jacobs, and he has an anti-union reputation from his tenure as chairman and chief executive officer of Westinghouse Electric Corporation.
"That's not a fair characterization in both cases," said Selig, who disputed the assessment of the owners as hard-line and anti-union. Selig is owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and chairman of the P.R.C. board and the executive council.
However, a year ago, when the Mets signed Bobby Bonilla to a then-record $5.8 million-a-year contract, Jacobs told then-Commissioner Fay Vincent that he should have fined them.
 
A Baseball Dictionary Addition
 With the owners' reopening of the collective bargaining agreement, the terms revenue sharing and revenue participation will become as familiar in coming months as split-fingered fastball and grand slam.
Revenue sharing is what clubs do with each other; revenue participation is what clubs want to do with players. However, revenue participation is, in the view of many, simply a nicer way to say salary cap, though it is no less unappealing to the players by any euphemism.
A proposal that Richard Ravitch, the clubs' chief labor executive, has presented to the owners includes an increased amount of revenue sharing and the adoption of revenue participation. The report of the economic study committee recommends that the clubs share a greater proportion of their revenue, but it remains neutral on a salary cap.
The committee report lists advantages and disadvantages of a salary-cap plan. Among the disadvantages, it says if player salaries were tied to revenues, the players "would insist on the right to have an equal voice in the negotiations and decisions which the clubs now make unilaterally," like television contracts, ticket prices and franchise sales.
The committee also notes that such a partnership would "require a relationship of trust" in the accuracy of clubs' financial statements that the union does not have at present.

HEADLINE: Battle Lines Drawn For Major Struggle Over Rent Control

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
"RENT control is like a drug," said Jim Whelan, Atlantic City's Mayor. "Once you're on it, it's very difficult to get off it."
In the two decades since New Jersey's municipalities began enacting rent-control ordinances in large numbers, local officials have become increasingly disenchanted with the laws that limit rent increases. They say that rent control, which exists in 119 communities, has shifted an increasing share of the tax burden onto residential and commercial property owners and led to the deterioration of rental housing in many areas. 
 But few municipal officials are willing to express their opposition to rent control on the record. "There are a lot more tenants than there are landlords," Mr. Whelan said. And those tenants represent votes.
Landlord and tenant groups, however, have been anything but bashful about presenting their positions and battling for advantage. For example, landlords have helped persuade many communities to adopt some form of vacancy decontrol, softening their rent ordinances by allowing an owner to charge higher rates for a controlled apartment after it has been vacated.
And in recent months, both sides of the rent-control issue have begun gearing up for a major confrontation next year.
A 600-member taxpayer association has sprung up in Hudson County with the express intent of persuading officials to modify or eliminate rent controls. "We're going to make our presence felt at every board meeting of every city in this county," said Robert G. Sacks, the group's president.
Last month, a bill that would exempt all new multifamily housing from local rent controls passed unanimously in both houses of the Legislature. The bill extends for five years an expired five-year exemption for such properties.
Meanwhile, advocates of tenant rights are planning their own countermoves. "We know the attack is coming," said Phyllis Salowe-Kaye, president of the New Jersey Tenants Organization, based in Hackensack. To meet what she called "a major mobilization to get rid of rent control," her group is organizing a statewide voter registration drive and a series of forums on tenants' rights.
Ms. Salowe-Kaye and other supporters of rent control say controls to protect tenants from rent-gouging landlords are needed as much as ever, if not more, particularly in light of New Jersey's dismal economy and chronic high unemployment.
"The fact is that landlords have made a bunch of gains in the past few years with vacancy decontrol," Ms. Salowe-Kaye said. Currently 85 municipalities with rent-control ordinances have some form of vacancy decontrol. She is also concerned, she said, that the Republican-dominated Legislature will attempt to "get rid of" rent control. Traditionally, she said, Republicans have been less sensitive to tenant issues than Democrats.
Opponents of rent control say it has caused an unfair tax shift in many municipalities. Because landlords' rental income is limited, they can often persuade officials to reduce the assessed value of their property, which lowers their real-estate taxes. As a result, the remaining owners of single-family homes and commercial properties end up paying a higher proportion of the municipal taxes.
Opponents also charge that rent control has led to the deterioration of rental housing in many areas because landlords who receive below-market rents for their apartments are more likely to cut corners on maintenance and capital improvements.
Rent control has also inspired some landlords and tenants in controlled apartments to strike illegal, clandestine agreements under which tenants pay higher rents than the law permits.
While several municipal officials interviewed for this article expressed opposition to rent control, they spoke only on condition of anonymity. One local official in northern New Jersey said that in his municipality, "Rent control is killing the tax base."
A municipal rent-board administrator in the southern part of the state referred to rent control as "a tax on the immobility of real estate." He said any attempt to set pricing controls on a local supermarket, for example, would be met by "the supermarket picking up and moving to the next town." Such an option, he said, is not available to property owners.
Only Mr. Whelan was willing to go on record. "I'm one Mayor who's not afraid to say that I have reservations with rent control," he said. "I'm not sure that it works, I think it has helped deplete our rental stock, and I think it is a strong disincentive to investment."
Yet officials are of two minds. "If you repeal rent control, you create havoc," Mr. Whelan said. "You end up having a lot of people who can't afford to live where they're living."
 
Neighborhood Stability Seen
 Ms. Salowe-Kaye of the tenants' organization would be the first to agree. "Rent control lets people who can't afford to buy homes know that they can stay in their apartments for a reasonable rent," she said. "Strong rent control means you get stability in a neighborhood."
Mr. Sacks, the head of the newly formed Hudson County Taxpayers Association and a Jersey City real-estate agent, said his group intended to bring pressure on communities to repeal their rent ordinances.
"People who own rent-controlled buildings are not making any money," he said, "so they have a choice: they either walk away from their buildings or they fight. One of the ways to fight is to appeal their taxes. And in case after case they're successful."
But cities still need the same amount of money in their budgets to provide necessary services, Mr. Sacks said, adding: "So who picks up the burden? The guy who owns a one-family house. The people who are living almost scot-free in rent-controlled apartments are living off the fat of the land. They're freeloading off the community, and it's unfair."
Ms. Salowe-Kaye said her tenants' organization would combat efforts to derail rent control. "We are starting a major education process, a huge voter registration drive statewide," she said, "and we're going to do a series in January of regional educational forums for tenants on tenants' rights."
 
Formula for Increases
 Most rent-control ordinances establish a base rent for each apartment in a building and then allow set increases each year. Those increases range from as little as 2 percent a year to as much as 7 percent.
Some ordinances allow for direct "pass-throughs" to tenants for expenses like real-estate taxes and for surcharges covering such expenses as heat and water. Many communities permit landlords to apply for rent increases if they can prove that the controlled rents they receive are causing them financial hardship.
Joseph Pojanowski, a Ramsey Councilman and a lawyer who often represents landlords before local rent and tax boards, said such hardship provisions typically do not work.
"In order to get a hardship increase, some towns have formulas that are impossible to achieve," he said. "It is a hardship in itself to file the appeal."
Moreover, he said, landlords forced to charge artificially low rents often attempt to cut their losses by trimming expenses rather than engaging municipalities in protracted legal battles.
"They take the easier road," Mr. Pojanowski said. "They eliminate preventive maintenance, they let their buildings get run down, and they file tax appeals." And that, he said, depreciates the quality of existing housing stock in a municipality.
 
'Three Elements' of Control
 Proponents of rent control, however, say that rent-control ordinances allow honest landlords to make a fair return on their investment while providing them with the ability to maintain their buildings properly.
"Rent control has three elements," Ms. Salowe-Kaye said. "Yearly increases, hardship increases and capital improvements." If landlords really wants to fix up buildings, she said, they can get more rent. "But where landlords have milked the property for years and years," she said, "surely the repairs that are necessary are not going to be covered."
Supporters of rent control also challenge the proposition that controls have led to a shifting of tax burdens to owners of private homes and commercial real estate.
"What we found is that tax shifts tend to be universal," said Mitchell Kahn, executive director of the Bergen County Housing Coalition and professor of social work and social policy at Ramapo College.
Mr. Kahn said he had recently conducted a survey of all 70 Bergen County municipalities to determine whether towns with rent control had greater tax shifts than those without. He discovered, he said, that rent control had no discernible effect on shifting taxes, and that "even towns that had no apartments had tax shifts."
On the other hand, Joseph W. Hottendorf, executive vice president of the Hudson County Board of Realtors, said his dissection of the tax history of an area of Bayonne had yielded a different result.
"We took one of Bayonne's three wards and looked at every apartment building in that ward," Mr. Hottendorf said. Using assessments made during a citywide revaluation in 1991, he said, he found that the assessed values of the 66 apartment buildings in the ward had decreased by 12.1 percent.
At the same time, Mr. Hottendorf said, the assessments on single-family homes increased by 32.25 percent.
"I know what that says to me," Mr. Hottendorf said. "It says the politicians want fewer people to be affected by tax increases, so the small homeowner gets affected but not the tenants in the apartment buildings."
 
Decontrol as 'Safety Valve'
 The only real "safety valve" for rent control, said Dr. George Sternlieb, professor emeritus of city planning at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, is vacancy decontrol. In addition to allowing landlords to increase their rental income without raising the rents of existing tenants, he said, vacancy decontrol also acts as a catalyst for better building maintenance.
"It's in the owner's best interest to improve the building because he wants the new rent to be as good as possible," he said.
Mayor Whelan described how some landlords and tenants behave in towns with no vacancy decontrol when the disparity between the controlled rent and the market rent becomes great.
"They cheat; that's what they do," he said, referring to the practice of landlords' and tenants' entering into clandestine rental agreements for rents that exceed the rent-control limits.

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A:CAROLE BOBRUFF;
Radio Host Tries to Close a Generational Gap

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA

 BODY:
PEOPLE older than 50 now make up about 25 percent of the population of the United States, and those over 65 now outnumber teen-agers for the first time in American history. Carole Bobruff cites these statistics as she urges people to look harder at both the power and the needs of older Americans. She says it is time to forget myths, recognize markets, tap skills and stop ignoring problems.
 Since 1990, Ms. Bobruff has been the producer and host of "Senior Focus," a twice-weekly hourlong talk show, aimed at those 50 and older, on radio station WSUB in Groton. For the show, which she said was the only one of its kind in Connecticut, she writes scripts, schedules guests, takes calls from listeners, solicits advertising and operates the equipment. Recent guests have included a lawyer discussing tax laws and asset protection, pharmacists talking about drugs, and a lawmaker who urged area agencies for the elderly to work together. 
From 1984 to 1990, Ms. Bobruff was the executive director of the Retired Senior Volunteer Program of New London County, which placed hundreds of volunteers each year in nonprofit agencies.
 Now 57 years old, she earned her bachelor's degree in human services 10 years ago. She said her own experience demonstrated that it was never too late.
 Here are excerpts from a conversation with Ms. Bobruff at her home in Niantic.
Q. How do you rate older Americans as a political force?
 A. Seniors are living longer, more active lives. They are the demographic group that votes most. By their numbers and by the fact that they vote, they have the potential to influence every institution in this country.
 Q. What are some common myths about older people?
 A. The biggest myth is people think that seniors are different, that their interests are different. That's not true; seniors are interested in everything, perhaps with a slightly different twist, that's all.
 Q. If businesses do not recognize the importance of the elderly market, what are they missing?
 A. A lot. In our country today seniors control 50 percent of discretionary income. There are 63 million Americans over the age of 50, and they control 77 percent of our nation's assets.
 Q. What are older people looking for when they purchase goods and services?
 A. It's a myth that seniors are not interested in new products. They are interested in new products. They're interested not in something that's going to save them time, but in something that's going to enrich their life. What we call younger seniors are interested in convenience and price equally. As we get up to the old-old, in their 80's, they're definitely interested in convenience first.
 Q. You've mentioned instances where those targeting older people seem to miss the mark.
 A. Seniors want to be involved. I've heard from a lot of seniors that they really don't like the term retirement community because it seems to mean that one is retired from life.
 Of course, terms like that have been thought of not by seniors, but by other segments of our society.
 What companies really should do is ask groups of seniors how their products could be better. They'll find out if they ask.
 Q. What are some products or services that you think older people would buy if they were offered?
 A. When you get to an airport, you have to reclaim your luggage. It can be a difficult task, carrying bags. If you're going to rent a car, you could pay a little premium to get off the airplane, have the bags claimed by the rental company. The next time you'd see the bags, they would be in the car.
 I think that if the auto makers asked seniors what they might like in cars, they'd come up with a seat that completely swiveled around so you could get out of the car.
 I think that seniors would pay for some modifications, but I also think that a lot of things are being overlooked.
 Q. What led you to start your radio show?
 A. I worked as director of a program that involved senior citizens as volunteers. I saw how important it was for them to feel needed, involved. I also saw that they were a segment of our society that was compartmentalized -- at senior clubs, in senior housing. My aim was to bring people -- different parts of our society -- together.
 I also found there were so many different programs for seniors and so much legislation that it was very difficult to keep up. I felt that I could do a service if I could communicate with seniors over the radio and get out some of this information. We have a lot of legal shows, a lot of medical shows, because the issues are so complex.
 Q. What are the major concerns that you hear from your listeners?
 A. Health is the No. 1 issue for them as it is for other age groups in our country. Health costs are catastrophic.
 Connecticut, facing its financial crisis, has put into effect new laws that make it more difficult for people to go on Medicaid. People are wondering how they're going to pay their bills; they're afraid of losing their assets.
 Q. In these times, with budget cuts everywhere, it can seem as though generations are pitted against one another. Are there ways of alleviating this?
 A. I've heard of a plan that's being proposed for Connecticut -- it comes from Colorado -- called the Senior Tax Exchange Proposal. It provides relief of up to $500 of property tax for seniors who, in turn, devote 125 hours to the local schools. That is what I would like to see more of, the generations coming together.
 Q. What about people beyond traditional retirement age who need or want to be employed?
 A. Seniors are a wonderful pool for part-time employment, and as our country ages we're going to need to use this pool. Perhaps employers will have to develop some more flexible programs and hours.
 Q. Does Connecticut have any unusual programs for its older citizens?
 A. Connecticut is the only state that has a mandate for municipal agents. Each town has a municipal agent who provides service information for seniors on all kinds of programs, from Medicare to housing to legal services. It's a well-kept secret; people don't know how to find this municipal agent. All they have to do is call their town hall.
 Q. What issues relating to older people are being ignored?
 A. The things I see being ignored are things that people don't want to realize might be problems. Certainly depression is a problem. It's not acknowledged by seniors and it's not acknowledged by our society; seniors are supposed to be old enough and mature enough to handle all of life's problems. I believe that some depression results in suicide. That's not talked about as a cause of death.
 Another problem among seniors is alcohol and drug abuse. It's a hidden problem, but it certainly is there, and most of the groups that one sees for rehabilitation with this sort of problem are for young people. We haven't made it easy for older people; we haven't targeted them at all.
 Q. Are there special concerns about those past 80?
 A. The escalating costs of hospital care and nursing home care. The thrust now is to keep people at home, but to do that you need to give them lots of services. You also need to make them feel useful and needed, and that is going to be the challenge of the 90's. Perhaps nonprofit agencies need to bring mailing, knitting, telephoning projects to people at home.
 Q. Many groups now represent older Americans. Is that good?
 A. I see a problem with that. In these difficult economic times a lot of senior entitlement programs are going to be attacked. Seniors need to get organized; they tend to be fragmented among too many different organizations that are not used to being united. Only by being united will they have power.
 Q. You say you keep an ancient, but timely, quote over your desk?
 A. It's from Plato: "It gives me great pleasure to converse with the aged. They have been over the road that all of us must travel, and they know where itis rough and difficult, and where it is level and easy."

For a Watershed, a Cemetery Proposal

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
A PROPOSAL to construct a regional, nondenominational cemetery on 62 acres of a potential watershed on the Woodbridge-Orange border has been so vociferously opposed by both towns that the South Central Regional Water Authority in New Haven, owner of the land and author of the plan, has temporarily withdrawn it.
 The controversy has exposed some broad issues arising from problems of growing populations and shrinking open space: burial vs. cremation, vaults leaching embalming fluids into water supplies, pressure on legislatures to weaken clean-water statutes and threats to the value of homes that suddenly abut a new graveyard. 
Right now we are taking another look and consulting with the State Health Department," said Richard McHugh, chief executive officer of the utility, "before determining whether to resubmit a proposal. There is a strong possibility that we will."
 The utility's reason for getting involved in cemeteries is economic.
 "If we do nothing to generate additional income over the next decade," said Thomas C. Jackson, head of land management for the utility, "we will have to raise rates 5 to 7 percent a year." The average customer now pays $77 a quarter, and rates since 1983 have been increased by 37 percent.
 A cemetery was deemed by the utility to be the best solution for creating substantial revenue while maintaining parklike open space, based on a study by Grever & Ward, cemetery planners in Orchard Park, N.Y. The study also indicated that a regional burial facility was needed to supplement waning capacity in the area that would be depleted in about 38 years.
 While there is no record of the number of cemeteries in Connecticut, Paul Basch, a land-use analyst with the Hartford Parks Department, which oversees that region's public cemeteries, said:
 "Cemeteries that have space are 99 percent filled, and we believe that there are barely 50 of those statewide. We have two to three years left in Hartford, so we are encouraging cremation. We started to do double-depth burials a decade ago. In southern Connecticut there is no public space left to speak of."
 But Robert Hannigan, past president of the Connecticut Cemetery Association, said that "existing cemeteries can expand and are doing so" and that "a new cemetery would be uneccessary competition."
 A per-household saving of $6 a year, estimated by the water company if the cemetery is built, was derided as minuscule and unpredictable by townspeople. Dorothy L. Berger, First Selectman of Orange, said:
 "The water company should go back to its purpose of stewardship, to insure that we have an adequate supply of pure drinking water at reasonable cost. The world in general is finding itself short of water. Once that land is committed to this use, it's gone forever. We've heard no complaints about running out of burial ground."
 Alerted to the situation by local residents, Dr. Gerald Iwan, head of the water-supply section of the state's Department of Health Services in Hartford, said: "We are concerned that the land in question is located less than the half-mile required between a cemetery and any source of drinking water -- in this case the Race Brook Reservoir. And we must decide on the future need for it as a watershed."
 To proceed with its plans, the utility must have the approval of the Health Department. In addition, it would need a zoning change from the towns and a change in state law to permit any entity other than a religious institution, cemetery association or municipality to own and operate a public cemetery.
 But before any of those procedures could be followed, the plan would need the approval of the 17-member Representative Policy Board, made up of a citizen from each of the 12 towns the utility serves, plus four towns in which it owns property, and a 17th member appointed by the Governor.
 THE board had planned to vote after a public hearing scheduled by the utility for Nov. 19, but the water company canceled, saying that correspondence from the Health Department and from Alice S. Miskimin, Town Counsel of Woodbridge, had been received too late for the utility to prepare a suitable response.
 Had the meeting taken place and the board voted against the plan as anticipated, the utility would have been summarily defeated. Richard Krodel, head of a neighborhood group called Save Open Space, or S.O.S., and many other residents believe that by cancelling, the utility grasped the opportunity to regroup and try again.
 Mr. Krodel's home on one-plus acre backs up to the cemetery site, and almost two dozen other homes on Race Brook Road and Wedgewood Drive abut or face the site.
 "We think that the utility has a hidden agenda to get the legislation changed," said Mr. Krodel, "allowing it to do pretty much what it wants and giving other watershed property owners the opportunity to do irreversible things with their land."
 According to Mr. Jackson, the public is unduly concerned.
 "The terrain does not drain to the reservoir, therefore the half-mile limit is moot since there is no danger of contamination," he said. Drainage is to Long Island Sound via the Weppawaug River into Milford Harbor.
 Terry Becker, an environmental watchdog known throughout the region as the "Long Island Soundkeeper," said: "A lot of watershed land is held by water companies that want to develop it to make money. These lands should be set aside in perpetuity, left in their natural state."
 Moreover, he added, "cemeteries are no longer a viable way to dispose of bodies. We have too much need for land for the living."

HEADLINE: Silence of the Frogs

BYLINE: By Emily Yoffe; Emily Yoffe, a former senior editor at Texas Monthly, is a writer who lives in Los Angeles.

 BODY:
In the early 70's, a bizarre, inexplicable illness was sabotaging the academic career of Cynthia Carey. Then a young biologist, she was writing a dissertation on the physiology of coldblooded animals. Her creature of choice was Bufo boreas, named for the ancient Greek god of the north wind, an extravagant tag for a warty, blotchy, four-inch toad. It is more commonly and appropriately known as the western toad, its range encompassing the mountains of western North America. Twice a week, Carey went into the vast, pristine wilderness of Colorado to do her research. At times the toads were so plentiful she had to be careful when driving away not to crush them under her wheels.
In 1973, two years into her work, the illness struck. When she went into the field, Carey started coming upon an alarming sight: dozens of dying toads, toads barely able to move because their legs were puffy and red. She took one back to a veterinarian, who told her the toads were dying from an opportunistic infection because their immune systems had collapsed. But why?
Carey was in no position to unravel the mystery -- she had a dissertation to do. But by 1979, there were no western toads, healthy or sick, to be found at any of the previous sites, or anywhere else in Colorado she looked. "These are wilderness areas," she says today from her laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where she is an associate professor of biology. "There was no development, no housing, no habitat destruction. I was sad and mystified." 
 She was also in trouble. "I had to change my research. You can't tell your tenure committee, 'I haven't done my research because all my animals went extinct.' " Instead she switched to bird eggs, became an expert on them and for the next nine years thought little about where all the toads had gone.
Then in 1988, she read a scientific paper on how environmental disturbances suppress the immune systems of fish. "That's when all the lights went on," Carey says. She has since set out to discover what happened to Bufo boreas, now missing from at least 80 percent of its historic range.
Around that time the same light bulb was clicking on for herpetologists (scientists who study amphibians and reptiles) all over the world. And by 1989, the light was blinding. That year in Canterbury, England, the first World Congress of Herpetology was taking place. On the agenda were esoteric and, to the non-herpetologist, faintly ridiculous-sounding presentations like "Belly Pattern of Triturus Carnifex and Triturus Vulgaris in Two Ponds of Ligurian Apennines, Northern Italy." But to many of the 1,300 participants from around the world, it was as if there were another conference taking place in the hallways and over meals, during breaks and at talks late into the night. The subject of this impromptu conference could be summed up in one ominous question: Where have all the frogs gone?
"A bunch of us got together and started comparing notes," recalls Jay M. Savage, a professor of biology at the University of Miami. "People were struck by the fact it seemed to be occurring on a worldwide basis."
Savage has spent much of the last 40 years studying the evolution and ecology of amphibians, mostly in Central America. In 1964, he and a colleague discovered a species of toad native to Costa Rica, in what is now called the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve. The toad's Latin name is Bufo periglenes, but it is better known as the golden toad -- the male a Day-Glo orange. The golden toad lives underground, and emerges for an annual, explosive, breeding season. Since 1964, scientists have watched as thousands of these tiny, vivid animals gathered for their yearly ritual. That was until 1988. That year, at the primary breeding site, only one adult male was found. Two years later, there were none -- and none have been seen since.
The apparent disaster is being repeated among other Cloud Forest species. The exquisite glass frogs, small lime-green animals with see-through undersides and large quizzical eyes, were abundant until the late 80's; now they can hardly be found. "Jewels in the night we called them," Savage recalls. "You used to see hundreds."
The black, yellow and red patterned harlequin frog, an amorous creature that can spend days clamped in a breeding embrace, also virtually disappeared in the late 80's. "Human beings are great at rationalization," Savage says. "We said, it must be local damage; if we just went over the hill, we'd find them. Most herpetologists were trying to explain things that way. What was striking was we found it was happening on such a broad basis."
At the meeting, Michael J. Tyler, an associate professor of zoology at University of Adelaide in Australia who has an enviable record for identifying remarkable species, told of the disappearance of the gastric brooding frog named Rheobatrachus silus. In 1974, Tyler identified the reproductive strategy of this inhabitant of the rain forest in the Connondale Ranges in Australia. The strategy was so implausible that when Tyler wrote a paper describing it, the editors of Nature rejected it. (Science magazine, however, did publish the findings.) The Rheobatrachus female swallows her fertilized eggs, which then gestate in her stomach and are regurgitated as tiny froglets six weeks later. It was hoped the frog, who somehow turns off her gastric activity, could provide a breakthrough in treating human stomach ailments.
"We were looking at the frontiers of biological science," says Tyler. "We were rewriting concepts of how bloody magnificent some animals are." In 1980, the gastric-brooding frog disappeared, as usual, in the rocks for the winter. But then not one emerged that spring, nor has one been seen since. The species is now presumed extinct. To add to the puzzle, a number of the area's other frog species vanished as well, and remain missing.
In the United States, Bufo boreas is not the only amphibian disappearing from the West. Also in decline are the Yosemite toad, the mountain yellow-legged frog and the red-legged frog, which was likely the protagonist in Mark Twain's famous story "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County." These frogs are missing from sites where they have been abundant in naturalists' accounts going back 75 years.
In all, almost one-third of North America's 86 species of frogs and toads appear to be in trouble. (In general, frogs have a smoother, more moist skin and live more closely to water than toads, which are squatter and often covered with warty bumps.) Gary Fellers, a research biologist with the National Park Service, visited Lassen Volcanic National Park in Northern California last year looking for the once-common Cascades frog. He used as his guide historic research papers describing the frog as being present every few feet. "We visited 50 sites with decent habitats," he says. "We found two frogs at one site." This year there were none.
Until recently, one of the most common sounds in western Canada's national parks was the low, throaty grunt of the northern leopard frog, Rana pipiens, the green-spotted creature almost everyone dissected in high school. Then, in the 1980's, the frogs started dying and populations plunged. The government of Alberta has even put out a "wanted" poster. Above a photo of Rana pipiens are the words, "Have You Seen This Frog?"
PERHAPS THE NEED TO FIND overarching explanations is encoded in our genes. From the search for a unified field theory of physics, to deconstructing the big bang, to proving that it was a straying asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs, we like definitive theories to explain the phenomena that create and govern life.
What is killing the frogs? In many instances, the answer, as with much of the world's disappearing flora and fauna, is no mystery. Humans are destroying habitats with unprecedented frenzy. Researchers estimate that one-quarter to one-half of the earth's species could be extinct in the next 30 years. Cut down a forest, drain a wetland, build a shopping center, and the local frog species die. No one puzzles as to why Southern California is virtually barren of most of its native frogs.
There are other obvious human causes. For one thing, pesticides and herbicides that have been found safe for humans may be devastating to other animals at vulnerable points in their life cycles. For another, in national parks, the Government's fire-suppression policies have greatly accelerated the slow process of marshes becoming woods, thus robbing amphibians of habitat. Then there is the human impulse to rectify nature's oversights. The effect of this is seen in the Sierras. After the last Ice Age, fish did not colonize the high-elevation lakes; frogs did. These lakes have been stocked with nonnative game fish, which feed on tadpoles. This has left many frog populations isolated at higher headwaters, where they have become vulnerable to disease or harsh weather. And when the frogs are wiped out at a site, they can't recolonize it. Frogs themselves can also be the problem: when foreign species are introduced, they can overrun native populations.
But nothing explains it all. "I wish there were a death star to explain it," says David B. Wake, from his office at Berkeley, where he is the director of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California. "I don't see a single toxin, a single virus. My theory is that it's general environmental degradation. That's the worst thing. Frogs are telling us about the environment's overall health. They are the medium and the message."
Most herpetologists recognize that the world will never rally around their cosmetically challenged creatures. Their only hope is to portray frogs as four-legged, bug-eating Cassandras, and pray the prophecy is heard. "Frogs are in essence a messenger," Wake says. "This is about biodiversity and disintegration, the destruction of our total environment."
They aren't the only messenger. Visit any well-stocked zoo that identifies endangered animals, and you begin to feel you are walking the corridors of a hospice. Most of these endangered species, from migratory songbirds to rhinoceroses, are dying because of human actions -- from habitat destruction to outright slaughter. Some signals are more mysterious; coral is bleaching out in some of the world's oceans for yet-unknown reasons. But one of the most disturbing things about what's happening to amphibians is that species are disappearing from some of the most remote, pristine places left on the earth -- as if following some synchronized command.
Herpetologists, with perhaps not the greatest objectivity, say frogs are the ideal creature to reflect the health of the environment. In their view, frogs are living environmental assayers, moving over their life cycles from water to land, from plant-eater to insect-eater, covered only by a permeable skin that offers little shield from the outside world. Over and over, these scientists say amphibians represent the global equivalent of the proverbial canary in the coal mine. "They're very fragile organisms," says William Duellman, director of the Center for Neotropical Biological Diversity at the University of Kansas.
There is a paradox in portraying frogs as delicate creatures experiencing a collective case of the evolutionary vapors. After all, in the 200 million years since frogs first surfaced on the earth, they have survived whatever killed the dinosaurs, whatever did in the woolly mammoths and other huge animals that wandered this continent. They have withstood glaciers coming and glaciers going. They have been found everywhere from the Himalayas to the Sonoran desert. It is precisely because frog species have been so historically hardy that scientists now find themselves so baffled -- and alarmed. "Something is out of balance," says James Vial, professor of Wildlife Ecology at Oregon State University. "The changes in the environment may be more drastic than they appear."
Since Canterbury, David Wake has been a leader of a save-the-frogs movement among his colleagues. That conference three years ago was the first time, he says, "that a number of us herpetologists expressed our concerns openly to each other." And when the herpetologists started talking, they began to realize how much they had in common: for years many of them had been losing the subjects of their lifework. Before Canterbury, the scientists were reluctant to share their bad news with the rest of the world. "No one wanted to publish on it," Wake says. "It was sort of like a macho thing. 'I can't find frogs. I can't do the job anymore.' "
In 1990, Wake helped organize a symposium on the topic in Irvine, Calif., out of which came the Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force. The group, with headquarters in Corvallis, Ore., was conceived as a three-year project to determine the extent and possible causes of amphibian decline. Operating as a unit of the World Conservation Union in Switzerland, which provides part of the $250,000 budget, the task force now has more than a thousand researchers in 40 countries. The task force is set to expire at the end of next year, but already members are discussing making it a permanent organization. The Frog's Leap Winery in Napa Valley has donated the money for its bulletin: Froglog.
Like the species they study, herpetologists are solitary, even quirky creatures. Getting the task force organized, deciding how to accomplish its goals -- long-term monitoring or short-term assessment, field research or lab experiments -- took about a year. In the end, the members decided on all of the above.
One member of the task force's board, John Wright, the curator of herpetology at the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History, has been a vocal critic of the delays. But even if herpetologists were suddenly to adopt the cooperative social model of, say, ants, Wright would be pessimistic about the future. "In the real world and the scientific world, someone throws a dollar in the corner and everyone runs to it," he says. "Dollars are being thrown at other corners than biodiversity. If we can't do it with the warm fuzzies -- mammals and beautiful birds, we aren't going to do it with frogs." The answer to finding out what's going on with frogs, many herpetologists believe, would be a project documenting the world's species that is akin to the Human Genome Project.
An equally challenging problem is the need for herpetologists to move beyond alarming anecdote to absolute proof. Since almost no carefully controlled, long-term studies have been done on frog-population dynamics, can scientists even be sure they are seeing the disaster they think they're seeing?
"There is a lot of data on a number of populations taking nose dives over the last 20 years," says David Bradford, a wildlife ecologist with the Environmental Protection Agency. "It's a good record, but it's anecdotal."
Using frogs as their study species, scientists have focused on exotic subjects like the physiology of living at high altitudes or the genetics of skin coloration. Then their research yielded something unexpected: there were no more frogs to study. Like Cynthia Carey, Bradford watched in the 70's as his study population -- mountain yellow-legged frogs in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks in California -- sickened and died. Ten years later, in 1989, he returned to census 26 of his study sites. He found frogs at one.
But a few herpetologists -- a decided minority -- are deeply troubled about the lack of long-term data. After the Canterbury conference, a Rutgers University biologist, Peter J. Morin, recalls: "I and a number of other people were a little alarmed that the data weren't there to support the conclusions. We need more real data on populations to find out if they are increasing, decreasing or just fluctuating." To be conclusive, such studies take 10 to 20 years.
Some skeptics say the problem isn't too few frogs, but too many frog researchers. It could be called the baby-boom theory of frog decline. The idea is that about 20 years ago graduate schools were filling up with young scientists studying the new biological discipline of population dynamics. "When people go out to do research projects, they usually pick common organisms," says Stephen G. Tilley, professor of biological sciences at Smith College. "If populations fluctuate, there's a good chance when you go back to look they might not be as common as they were when you first studied them." He points out that many animals, like some rodents or insects, have large population swings.
Tilley does believe that some species of frogs, like those in the Sierra Nevada, are in trouble. But he has seen nothing to convince him disappearances around the globe are linked. "I'm concerned about the species that are documented to have undergone a radical decline," he says. "But I am not convinced they tie together."
Many of the most alarming population crashes, he points out, like those in Costa Rica or Australia, are among species that have been discovered only recently. "The problem is a lot of the species people are concerned with right now haven't been studied long-term. For all we know, they fluctuate. There's a paper in Science, and the bottom line is when people do long-term studies of amphibian populations, they find they fluctuate a lot."
At first glance, the Science article does look like a T.K.O. to those crying extinction. From 1978 to 1990, census information was collected for species of three salamanders and one frog at a well-protected two-and-a-half acre pond near the center of the 300-square-mile Savannah River Ecology Laboratory in South Carolina. At the end of those years, breeding populations increased in one species and showed no declines in the others. Nevertheless, during the 12 years themselves, population size fluctuated widely -- one salamander was virtually absent for the first two years of the study, but by 1990, almost 600 females of the species bred.
But to the worried herpetologists, the article is equivalent to proving there is no homelessness in Los Angeles by going on a tour of Beverly Hills. They claim to be seeing not fluctuations, but dead drops. David Wake, who wrote a commentary in Science to accompany the article, praises its research and agrees that more long-term data are needed. But he takes no comfort from it, because the Savannah River site is located in an area that is vast and wet and green. "It's an excellent breeding site," Wake says. "They could have total extinction of a local pond, and it would be recolonized the next year. There's no risk to those animals moving back and forth."
Joseph H. K. Pechmann, an author of the Science article on the Savannah River project, agrees with Wake that, in many ways, his site is unique. "We would be the first to say the results from one study should not be generalized to the next pond down the road, let alone to a pond halfway around the world," says Pechmann.
But he adds his own warning: conclusions about a global frog crisis should not be generalized from existing evidence. "It remains an open question whether declines and disappearances of some frog species in isolated, pristine environments represent a natural fluctuation or some subtle effect of human activities that we don't understand," Pechmann says. "My money is on the natural fluctuations, but I can't prove that. Only further research will say for sure."
NO herpetologist disputes the value of long-term studies. But many insist that to wait for the data to come in would be foolhardy. "These declines, in many cases, are so catastrophic and are occurring simultaneously in so many parts of the world that we cannot wait for monitoring studies before we express our concern," says James Vial of Oregon State University, who is the task force's international coordinator. "Because if we wait for a prolonged period, there may not be anything left to study."
Many researchers refuse to wait, and are now exploring the possible causes of the mysterious declines -- those not clearly linked to habitat destruction. At the top of the list is an increase in ultraviolet radiation. Among the hardest-hit amphibians are those that live at high altitudes, or near-the-ozone-hole southerly latitudes, from the Rockies and Sierras to the Andes to Australia. High-altitude frogs have already developed strategies to protect themselves from harmful radiation, while absorbing the heat so necessary to their survival. Many highland species lay black eggs and have a black peritoneum and, in the male, black testes. "This suggests they already live at the edge," says Wake. "How much more does it take to push them over?"
While there may be indications that those who wear sunblock will inherit the earth, right now it's difficult to prove that increased ultraviolet radiation is a major cause of the decline. The simple reason is that studies have yet to be done to show if UV radiation really is increasing, and there is little historical information. More than a century's worth of temperature and rainfall statistics leaves the very false impression that similar data exist on all other atmospheric phenomena. "I can't believe how little we know," says Wake. "One reason global climate change is a touchy field is we don't have the right records."
There is, of course, another species not protected by fur or shell or feathers that seems to be suffering from exposure to the sun's rays. Human skin-cancer rates are rising dramatically around the world. And Wake says we need to heed such warnings. "I say use biological indicators," he says. "The instruments won't do it. We need to measure effects."
Andrew R. Blaustein, professor of zoology at Oregon State, is using instruments and measuring effects. The National Science Foundation and the National Geographic Society are helping to pay for his three-year, $272,000 study of ultraviolet radiation on amphibians. Blaustein has discovered that in the past four years, there has been a large dying off of western-toad eggs. What is unusual about this is that while very few toads and frogs make it to adulthood, mortality does not normally occur until after the eggs have hatched. "This year there were about two-and-a-half million eggs," Blaustein says. "Ninety-five percent of them died." There have been experiments that show exposure to UV radiation will destroy the development of eggs, but these have been in the laboratory. Blaustein wants to find out what effect current UV radiation levels are having in the field.
As for other possible causes, acidification also has its partisans. But for every study that shows acid rain is damaging frogs, another one refutes it. "I have dismissed it as a factor in the Rocky Mountains," says Stephen Corn, a zoologist with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in Fort Collins, Colo., who has just completed an extensive survey of acid rain's effect on western amphibians. And Blaustein, too, can find no evidence of acid in the Cascade Mountain lakes he is studying. "The acid stuff doesn't fit at all," he says. "We've taken pH measurements for two years. It's totally normal. And in the three lakes we've studied these animals, there are no pollutants."
The mystery of the frog decline challenges the distinction between what is local and what is global. Because we as a species are so successful, so pervasive, the consequences of our local actions now ripple across the globe. No pristine place can protect a species from hazardous levels of, say, UV radiation. What is happening to frogs calls into question our belief that we can preserve the natural world in small, unsullied pockets. "You cannot lock up nature," Wake says. "There's no Noah's ark big enough."
"THEY HAVE BEAUTIFUL eyes. You can really fall in love with them."
Cynthia Carey is talking about the large, amber, if rather unexpressive, eyes of the specimen of marine toad now bloating up in the hands of her research assistant, Judy Bissonnette. The bloating, which makes this six-inch toad start to resemble a tiny dirigible, is a natural response to danger. In this case, the danger is being one of a dozen research animals in this small lab room at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
Almost 20 years after she first wondered why all the western toads she saw were dying, Carey, who wears a small, silver frog pendant around her neck, is trying to decipher the immune system of frogs. The sick toad she had autopsied many years ago died of a massive infection from the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila, which is ubiquitous in fresh water. In the final stages of infection, the circulation of a toad or frog will break down, causing hemorrhaging that brings blood to the skin -- thus the common name, red-leg disease. Red-leg, like AIDS, is a condition caused by the collapse of the immune system. A healthy frog should not succumb to massive Aeromonas hydrophila infection, just as a healthy human should be able to fight off the staph and strep infections that can be so devastating to AIDS patients. But unlike AIDS, no one knows what is triggering the toads' immune system breakdown; if it is a pathogen, it remains unidentified.
Departing from several of her colleagues who are looking to prove that a specific environmental factor kills frogs outright, Carey says she believes the problem is more complex. Her hypothesis is that a combination of several factors -- be it ultraviolet radiation, acid snow or something yet unknown -- creates a degree of sublethal stress sufficient to cause the cascading breakdown of the immune system.
With a $20,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, Carey is figuring out what a healthy toad's immune system looks like. Once she has this basic information, the next step will be to expose toads to acidified water, pesticides, ultraviolet light and rapid temperature change. The object is to try to find out which of these conditions, if any, will induce the collapse of toad immune systems. It's a large undertaking. "We don't really understand why when you and I get under a lot of stress, and then the stress is over, we immediately get sick. We don't understand that for us, let alone amphibians." She can't risk using the remaining western toads for her preliminary experiments -- their population is too fragile. Instead, she buys marine toads, natives of the Gulf Coast, from an animal supply house.
In a way, Carey's research is as metaphorical as molecular. What if she does find that what's killing frogs is some mix of global environmental changes? Aren't they really, then, a disturbing sign about the health of the planet's immune system? "Frogs aren't the only thing disappearing," she says. "The more biological diversity we destroy, the less flexibility we have to create new food sources that can tolerate the environment we are creating."
THERE WAS THAT unprecedented moment in amphibian history when a frog was America's sweetheart. But Kermit aside, frogs have never been much loved by people. Carolus Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist who developed the classification system of living things, once wrote, "These foul and loathsome animals are . . . abhorrent because of their cold bodies, pale color, cartilaginous skeletons, filthy skin, fierce aspect, calculating eye, offensive smell, harsh voice, squalid habitation and terrible venom."
Frogs lack the qualities that seem to arouse human passion toward other species -- the wild variety and soaring ability of birds; the cuddliness or majesty of mammals. They are not the subject of riveting nature specials or glossy coffee-table volumes. They are of little economic value. For most urbanites and suburbanites, they are creatures long ago encountered at summer camp, dismembered in high-school lab -- and little thought of again. This distant relationship with humans has made quantifying their disappearance more difficult. Amateur bird watchers, for example, keep records, so there is abundant long-term data showing the decline of migratory songbirds.
The first amphibians emerged around 350 million years ago. Depending on what you consider a frog, the first frogs appeared about 200 million years ago during the Triassic period or 180 million years ago during the Jurassic. Amphibians -- the word comes from the Greek "amphi" and "bios" (living a double life) -- are a bridge between the aquatic and the terrestrial, the link between fish and reptile. They include salamanders as well as frogs and toads.
Herpetologists have not done a very good public relations job for their creatures; Linnaeus's attitude toward frogs has been passed down through the centuries. "This popular concept that they are imperfectly adapted, lowly vertebrates is garbage rooted in an archaic vision of evolution," says Stephen Tilley of Smith College. "They are a highly adapted group in their own right. They have extremely complicated behaviors, anatomies, physiologies and reproductive patterns."
There are about 3,800 known species of frogs and toads that occur on every continent except Antarctica. As with much of life, frogs are more colorful, more diverse and more plentiful in the tropics. For example, the forests of Borneo are host to probably 200 species. Texas, which is of equivalent size, has only about 35. Paradoxically, during the 80's, when the great disappearances were first noticed, there was an explosion in species identification. Twenty percent of South America's frog species were named in that decade. "I'm just sitting here, looking at material I just brought back from Peru," says William Duellman, from his office at the University of Kansas. "They have apparently two new species of tree frogs that no one has ever collected before."
For the past 30 years, Duellman has concentrated his research on South and Central America. He has a particular fondness for documenting frogs' astounding breeding strategies -- from marsupial frogs, which carry fertilized eggs in a pouch on their back that develop into tadpoles or froglets, to Darwin's frog, whose males incubate newly hatched tadpoles in their vocal sacs until they emerge as frogs, to a type of dart-poison frog, which deposits her tadpoles in water pooled in bromeliad leaves and then feeds them during their development with her unfertilized eggs.
While Duellman says the frog situation in the environs of the Midwest seems "copacetic," he, too, has been perplexed as South American species he has studied for years appear to be dropping off the face of the earth. "About 1984 was when I started getting an inkling of declines in frog population in the Andes of Ecuador," he recalls. "You'd have frogs crawling all over one year, then the next year, none. That's pretty dramatic. What we're facing now are indications of a crisis. This is the first time in my tenure as a herpetologist we've seen anything of this type."
TREADING carefully in the muck, Stephen Corn of the Fish and Wildlife Service reaches down and picks up a small, mottled, olive-green and brown creature found nowhere else on earth. This unprepossessing animal is one of the last surviving members of its species, the Wyoming toad. Corn looks at its front foot. "It's a male," he says. In the males of many species the "thumb" is dark and calloused-looking, an "all the better to squeeze you with my dear" adaptation. During mating, called "amplexus," the male grabs the female and mounts her; from similar-looking orifices, they simultaneously spew either sperm or eggs, which are fertilized outside the female.
Unfortunately for the future of the Wyoming toad, there have been no breeding females to grab for the past year. Adding to the problem has been an outbreak the past two years of red-leg disease.
The toad's Latin name is Bufo hemiophyrs baxteri, after George Baxter, a retired professor of zoology at the University of Wyoming who first discovered the species -- actually a subspecies of the Dakota toad -- in 1946. Over the years, Baxter would take his classes to the dozens of sites of the animal's small range, 100 square miles around Laramie. Then, as the familiar story goes, in the mid-70's Baxter realized he was having a hard time finding his toads. By 1983, no one could find any; they were placed on the endangered species list, and presumed to be extinct.
But in 1987, a sharp-eyed fisherman spotted some at a small, stocked fishing lake about 10 miles west of Laramie -- a last, holdout population of about 100 toads. Introduced fish do not seem to be the cause of this toad's demise. These amphibians produce fairly toxic tadpoles, unlike many species whose yet-to-metamorphosize young are prime fish morsels. This year, the Fish and Wildlife Service bought the fishing lake, as well as three nearby lakes and 1,800 acres around them, for about $300,000 -- one of the few Government refuges established for amphibians.
The burly, bearded Corn is running an annual census of the toads. Three times last summer, he and a group of biologists came to the lake to capture every toad they could, photograph them and try to match their unique markings with previous toad mug shots. The population is considered too unstable for the more common identifying procedure of toe-clipping, or the new high-tech version being used on a population of western toads in which a transponder the size of a grain of rice is inserted below the skin.
Corn is pessimistic about the future of Bufo hemiophyrs baxteri. This fall's population was 162, but then his research team found that an estimated one-quarter of the total had been hit by red-leg disease. And in 1989, an unusually cold winter probably killed off many of that year's young. Researchers believe that the female of the species breeds only in the third year of its life, so the 1989 die-off has left a female population that is too young to breed. As Corn holds the toad, a male he estimates was born in 1990, it emits a small, alarmed cheep. "They cheep when a predator or another male grabs them," he explains. "The breeding call is a low-grade whine." The male has had plenty to whine about the last few years. "This is one that tried to breed this year," Corn says, "but he couldn't find any girls."
Such population fluctuations, as the Savannah River study shows, may have less serious consequences when there is a larger population of the species available to recolonize a site, but the Wyoming toad has no such backup. "I think realistically it's a matter of time," Corn says.
Adding to the mystery of the Wyoming toad is the thriving population of chorus frogs that are hopping along in the same muck. This frog, bright green and skinny with dark green stripes, has an intense chirp of a breeding call; in fact, some herpetologists joke that these creatures have caused them some loss of hearing. What is the secret of their success? One irony-rich theory is that chorus frogs have shorter individual life spans than Wyoming toads. That is, they reach maturity and reproduce so quickly that they don't live long enough to succumb to whatever is doing in the toads. But dying young isn't a foolproof method of survival: The chorus frogs of eastern Canada now appear imperiled.
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN if frogs died out? Understandably, that's a world few herpetologists care to imagine. One consequence, they say, may be a field day for insects; amphibians provide a far safer method for keeping insect populations in check than any chemical insecticide. Bangladesh, where native frogs have been nearly wiped out to appease the French appetite for their legs, appears to be reaping the consequences. "They now have increased numbers of mosquitoes and malaria," William Duellman says. And the indisputable importance of frogs to the food chain is not just a matter of what they eat, but who eats them; they are a major food source for many birds, fish, reptiles and mammals.
But herpetologists say that simply saving frogs is not the point. "We don't know how many species can be lost before the system ceases to function," says Richard L. Wyman, adjunct associate professor of biology at the State University of New York at Albany. "But eliminate enough species and sooner or later it will cease to function. In the past, life responded to change through evolution, and that process depends on genetic diversity. If everything's the same, evolution stops. It's as if we are killing evolution itself."
In his book on the history of earth's extinctions, "The Miner's Canary," the paleontologist Niles Eldredge writes, "Extinction resets the evolutionary clock." So far, six mass extinctions have reset the earth's evolutionary clock -- like the one that happened at the end of the Cretaceous period that took the dinosaurs with it. And some scientists, including Eldredge and celebrated biologist Edward O. Wilson of Harvard, insist we are in the midst of another cataclysm -- the first to be caused by man.
Life has never stopped completely, however. A few species have always managed to cross the valley of death, and those that made it to the other side were able to begin the evolutionary process again. In light of that, David Wake is more sanguine about the frogs' future than ours.
"They have been here hundreds of millions of years, humans less than five," Wake says. "I have no doubt there are survivors among them. I think they will do better than we will. I am totally convinced that frogs will be here when we are long gone."

A Village Proposed for a Pastoral Island

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C.

 BODY:
THE completion of the Mark Clark Expressway last June linking the pastoral Daniel Island with downtown Charleston just minutes away across the Cooper River has paved the way for a proposal to build a village over the next three decades to support as many as 17,000 residents.
Daniel Island is now home to two caretakers, deer, pigs, cattle and birds. 
 The proposal, put forth by the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation of New York City, which owns the island, must first win the approval of the Charleston City Council. As an initial step, the Planning and Zoning Commission is expected to begin reviewing the proposal in January.
Spreading across some 4,500 acres in the center of Charleston's busy waterways, the development would be one of the largest ever undertaken in South Carolina. The plan calls for 4,000 to 7,000 homes in several neighborhoods, a million square feet for light industry and three million square feet of office space. A town center reminiscent of Nantucket, Mass., would be built on 23 acres beside the Wando River.
Central to the plan is the foundation's desire to foster a livable yet lively urban environment while respecting the beauty of the island, said John H. Alschuler Jr., president of the Daniel Island Development Company.
The company was formed to develop the island, since under Internal Revenue Service regulations the nonprofit Guggenheim Foundation may not have a controlling interest in a profit-making enterprise.
The foundation hired the architects and planners and will sell the island -- except for 800 acres to be sold to a state agency -- to Daniel Island Development, in which it will retain a minority interest.
The plan is the work of New York architects Cooper, Robertson & Partners and planners Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk.
Mr. Duany and his wife, Ms. Plater-Zyberk, are best known for the plan for Seaside in Florida, a resort modeled after the traditions of America's small towns with homes of many styles clustered around a central business district that lies within easy walking distance.
The Daniel Island plan echoes that theme, but on a larger scale. There would be several large public parks, including a 337-acre one at the southern tip of the island, and some smaller waterfront parks at the ends of streets, with no residence more than a quarter mile from a park.
The roads, built on a grid pattern rather than the more common cul de sacs of modern subdivisions, would be narrower than now allowed by Charleston zoning law, so a zoning change or variance would be needed. The houses would range from low-income to very expensive. The island is 5.75 miles long and 2.25 miles broad at its widest point.
"The foundation brings to this task a sense of civic purpose," said Mr. Alschuler, largely because of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation's mission to address the problems of violence and aggression in society.
While the development is not intended as an experiment in urban development as it relates to the foundation's mission, the planners hope it will provide a model for how to make cities more desirable.
"DANIEL ISLAND is really a unique entity," Mr. Alschuler said. "I have never before seen 4,000 to 5,000 acres under single owners without a structure on it at the heart and center of a city."
The island is sandwiched between two densely populated land masses: downtown Charleston, with 68,000 people, to the west and Mount Pleasant, a suburb of about 18,000 people, to the east. It has remained undeveloped largely because it was difficult to get to.
A small, two-lane bridge provided the only access to the island until the Mark Clark Expressway was completed. The road, joining North Charleston and Mount Pleasant, bisects the island.
Harry Frank Guggenheim, the founder of Newsday and grandson of the mining magnate Meyer Guggenheim, bought the island in the 1940's for $70,000. He used it as a hunting preserve and cattle farm and maintained a plantation on a mainland peninsula just north of the island, said Henry Smythe, his Charleston attorney.
At the 10,000-acre Cain Hoy Plantation, Mr. Guggenheim raised race horses (one of his horses, Dark Star, won the 1953 Kentucky Derby). Cain Hoy remains in the hands of Mr. Guggenheim's heirs; Daniel Island was bequeathed to his foundation when he died in 1971.
The foundation agreed to Charleston's annexation of the island last year.
Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. of Charleston has said that he considers the island crucial to the future economic well-being of his city. Without it, he has said, Charleston has little hope for further growth.
"If Charleston became hemmed in, and home to the most affluent and the poor, there would be no way to expand its tax base or incorporate the growth of the middle class," Mr. Alschuler said.
In return for agreeing to the annexation of the island, the foundation won an agreement from the Commission of Public Works to provide water and sewer service to it, a $15 million project, and the city's pledge to build the island's parks, including the big southern one, which is to be built on material dredged from the Cooper River.
The foundation has also agreed to sell 800 acres on the Cooper River to the State Ports Authority for $7 million. The authority plans to build a $1 billion containerized shipping terminal, the largest public works project ever undertaken in South Carolina.
The terminal, which will take at least 20 years to build, will handle some 5,000 container-hauling rigs a day. A 15-foot-high landscaped soundwall costing as much as $4 million will separate the terminal from the rest of the island.
Unlike most other island developments off the coast, Daniel Island would be an open community, Mr. Alschuler said.
"There will be no locked gate and no hidden gates constructed by price barriers," he said. "We want to create new neighborhoods and truly have public open space."
Diversity in building will be encouraged and 10 percent of the proceeds from the development will go into a fund to build affordable housing. An area would be set aside for schools and other institutional buildings.
ALREADY, some criticism has been leveled by a local nonprofit environmental organization, the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League. Dana Beach, the organization's president, said that except for the grid street pattern and the preservation of trees, the plans looked like every other island development built on the coast in recent years. Under the plan, an 18-hole golf course would lie in the center of the island, surrounded by residential lots all the way to the waterfront.
Mr. Beach said he had hoped the plan would call for a denser concentration of housing to preserve natural walking paths along the Wando River and its tributaries and to make a mass-transit system feasible.
But Mr. Alschuler said the housing units were as dense as the market would bear and Daniel Island would have two and a half times the amount of public open space as required by law. He also said the foundation had no desire to be "cute" in the development.
"Daniel Island should look like it evolved from the historic tradition of the Carolina Lowcountry," Mr. Alschuler said. "We don't need some Disneyland recreation of downtown Charleston."
The first land transaction from the foundation should be made next year. At that time, the first neighborhood and a few of the buildings in the town center will be built.
"I think it's a great plan," said Mr. Guggenheim's lawyer, Mr. Smythe, who regularly hunts dove on Daniel Island. "In many ways, its going against the trend of the last generation to go back to the concept of a town rather than a subdivision."
Looking out across the dredge material that one day would be a city park, Mr. Smythe said: "Something like this, which produces virtually no income, has to be converted to produce income. The time has come."

A Downtown For the Future

BYLINE: By Kent Shaw

 BODY:
THE owners of a downtown shopping center here have agreed to undertake a $12 million renovation in the spring by replacing a 20,000-square-foot Price Chopper supermarket with a new 58,000-square-foot version.
The new store would be the largest in the state and anchor the Rutland Shopping Plaza, which in turn would be the centerpiece of almost $50 million in construction and renovation work expected over the next two years. 
 Each of the projects was targeted in a 1989 planning study commissioned by the city. Along with bringing new jobs to a weary downtown economy, planners want to capture a growing tourist market.
For a city of 18,200 built on railroads and industries like marble mining, the change is striking.
"We're redefining in very unequivocal terms what downtown is going to be," said Mayor Jeffrey Wennberg. "We're letting go of the past."
The agreement between Rutland officials and the owners, NET Properties, of Boston, comes after several years of planning and negotiations prompted in part by the possibility of a 450,000-square-foot shopping mall about two miles south of the city. That project, mired in the approval process, would be at least three years in the making.
Other downtown projects include a proposal by the Central Vermont Public Service Corporation, the state's biggest electric utility, for a $20 million, five-story headquarters within the plaza, at the end opposite the Price Chopper. The project should begin in 1994, according to Bruce Simons, a utility spokesman.
On Merchants Row, a central commercial artery that borders the plaza, a new complex of state offices will occupy a renovated four-story building owned by the Hulett Associates limited partnership. State Commissioner of Buildings John Zampieri said initial work on the phased $7.2 million project could begin in late December. The 1906 building would eventually house all state satellite offices now dispersed through Rutland County.
A final downtown component is to be an $8 million transit center and parking complex next to the state offices.
Taken together, the downtown projects would mean a strong infusion of real estate investment in a city core area sorely tested by outlying malls and commercial strip development extending 50 miles north to Burlington on Route 7.
Much of the negotiating has been handled by the Rutland Redevelopment Authority, formed in 1989, which has the power to levy special taxes on businesses in a downtown district.
The agency has raised about $180,000, most of which was spent on streetscape improvements and planning for downtown festivals and sales events.

KURT WEILL
Composer in a Divided World.
By Ronald Taylor.
Illustrated. 358 pp. Boston:
Northeastern University Press. $29.95. 
 THE ever courteous Kurt Weill tried to make things easy for his biographers. Born in 1900 and dead in 1950, he made his life span coincide with the first half of the century he epitomized -- a true mnemonic bonus. Furthermore, his composing career segments as neatly as an orange: the European Weill, from 1920 to 1935; the American Weill, from 1935 to 1950. Weill I composed classical music and wry operettas for European sophisticates; Weill II composed tuneful musicals for Broadway and American innocents everywhere. And, for ultimate symmetry, Weill married his wife, Lotte Lenya, once in Germany and, after she divorced him, once in America. Simple, isn't it?
Not really. Ronald Taylor's new biography, "Kurt Weill: Composer in a Divided World" (first published in England in 1991), implies that Weill's world was unusually antinomian. Actually, the world is never short on divisiveness and dissension. So, as Mr. Taylor, who has written books about other German composers, states right off, "People perceive a split in [Weill's] musical personality which fatally divides the European from the American, the former brilliant and sparklingly original, the latter a sad regression and capitulation to inferior values." Perhaps, then, the author is out to demolish the notion that one half of Weill is better than the other: "There is not one 'pure' and one 'applied' music," he writes, as if agreeing with Weill's contention.
For, eventually, Weill made the claim of "never [having] acknowledged the difference between 'serious' music and 'light' music. There is only good music and bad music." But Mr. Taylor disagrees: between "The Magic Flute" and "The Mikado," between "Fidelio" and "Die Fledermaus," there is a difference. Then what is his book's aim? It is to keep technical matters at a minimum, provide few musical examples and concentrate on telling the man's life story and assessing his achievements in historical perspective. A book, the author says, for the people who have been whistling Weill songs for years and want to know more about their composer. As a whistler's Weill, the biography comes off most satisfactorily; nonwhistlers, though, may have a few demurrers.
The book's chief merit is in its steering a middle course between extremes, between temptations to one excess or another. Because Curt Julian Weill (he soon streamlined his name) was indeed a complex person under his quiet, pipe-smokingly withdrawn exterior, it is easy to latch on to some deceptively simple surface aspects and ignore the rest. What Mr. Taylor has elected to do is judicious, considering how little material on Weill there is in English. Ronald Sanders's biography, "The Days Grow Short" (1980), is estimable, but hardly definitive; the works by Kim H. Kowalke and David Drew are chiefly for specialists. Mr. Taylor's attempt is at a brief but helpful overview. Nothing essential is overlooked, but initiates seeking detailed analyses, esoteric data or piquant revelations won't still their hunger here.
All the same, Mr. Taylor does retell this extraordinary life story with smiling fluency, a spry attention to thought-provoking details and an audacity refreshing in a popular biographer. He is very good at succinctly sketching in the lives of those who importantly impinged on Weill. We get a compelling account of that monster of genius Bertolt Brecht, with whom Weill wrote some of the epochal works of 20th-century music. We get a clear sense of Brecht's strengths and vices, the help and hindrance he was to his uneasy collaborator; neither man, we are told, ever addressed the other by the familiar German du. We relish, for instance, the account of the particularly frantic and acrimonious rehearsal period of "The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny," with the pair nearly coming to blows. The always magisterially calm Weill, able to work on additions and revisions while the rehearsal turbulence would have burst the Richter scale, finally left in a huff only to hear Brecht shout at his back, "I'll put on my war paint and throw that phony Richard Strauss down the stairs!"
Again, the portrait of Lotte Lenya that emerges here is full and clear. Mr. Taylor captures the "not beautiful, barely even pretty but attractively roguish-looking" Lenya, who left high school "at 13 and took to the world's oldest profession more or less full time" in all her capriciousness, vivacity and irrepressible candor. As a very young man, Weill inquired by mail whether his schoolteacher sister had among her students a girl who would make him "a decent wife." She would have to be "extremely pretty, extremely stupid, unmusical, with a dowry of a million marks." Instead, he got the opposite, Lenya, who, as he later told a Munich newspaper, was a foul housewife but fine actress; who couldn't read music ("any composer whose wife can read music has my sympathy") but, when she sang, was listened to like Caruso; who took no interest in his work ("which is one of her greatest assets") but demanded it for hers. Weill went on with some apt ironies about Lenya and her many other men.
Yet the secret of their getting on so well together was, as he wrote his parents (upset at his marrying a shiksa), that here were "two people with different, unconnected artistic interests, each helping the other along his own path." Another thing was the shared love of animals, particularly "large, shaggy dogs," a special favorite being named Harras. By one of history's ironies, Mr. Taylor might have told us, the sire of Hitler's favorite dog bore the same name. In the earlier years of the marriage, it was Lenya who cheated on Weill; later, especially in Hollywood, he managed to -- almost -- equal the score. But they put up with each other's infidelities mostly with grace, and in all other ways complemented and supported each other.
There are vivid sketches of Weill's other collaborators here: Georg Kaiser, the dramatist with whom Weill wrote three important German stage works; Caspar Neher, the great set designer and poor part-time librettist, whose wife embarrassingly yearned for Weill; Moss Hart; Ira Gershwin; Maxwell Anderson, whom Mr. Taylor overestimates ("a sense of poetic language unique in its place and its time" indeed!); and several others. There is even a sly bit about the artsy millionaire Edward James, whose passion for the alluring dancer Tilly Losch inspired him to propose the last, and in some ways greatest, Brecht-Weill collaboration, "The Seven Deadly Sins." Personally, I could have used more about Weill's rift with Franz Werfel, and something about Maurice Magre, that obscure but fascinating poete damne, to whose texts Weill wrote two of his most ravishing French chansons.
Mr. Taylor deals with the music at about the right length and level for the general reader; if he errs in his judgments, it is usually on the side of severity, a novel trait in a biographer. He seems greatly to favor the European Weill. Thus he maintains that in "Johnny Johnson," Weill's first American musical, in the passages dealing with war and history, "whether somber . . . or satirical, the Weill of old is at his striking and powerful best," but "the lyrical numbers . . . show how far the fuzzy hit-parade flaccidity of his new environment has encroached." I myself think that much of Weill's American music, though less sophisticated or sardonic, is just as good as the European, and I would certainly not say that "Weill's show tunes do not make the Big Five [Gershwin, Porter, Berlin, Kern and Rodgers] into the Big Six."
QUITE aside from his classical music, Weill as a theater composer and chansonnier has produced marvels that surpass the Big Five. To cite only a few: "Nanna's Song" (the 1939 setting of an earlier Brecht lyric, as a birthday gift for Lenya), the "Epitaph" for Rosa Luxemburg from "The Berlin Requiem," "Surabaya Johnny" from "Happy End," "Fennimore's Song" from "Silverlake," "Captain Valentine's Tango" from "Johnny Johnson," "Trouble Man" from "Lost in the Stars" -- these and many others strike me as out of the reach of the best popular composers. It is Weill's know-how as a classical composer, simplified (but without condescension) for the popular ear, that elevates such pieces, above Gershwin even, to the realms of Hugo Wolf and Henri Duparc. This is consistent with Weill's aim "to reach the real people, a more representative public than any opera house attracts."
Yet even though he conscientiously addresses Weill's classical music, Mr. Taylor, I believe, underestimates that, too. He does, to be sure, like the programmatic First Symphony, which I find showy and sprawling, but he is unenthusiastic about the Neo-Classical Violin Concerto and the visceral Second Symphony -- even the charming early Cello Sonata -- which I would squarely add to the standard repertory. He is, however, aware of the importance of Weill's many writings about music, and makes good, if not extensive, use of them.
Where Mr. Taylor is particularly helpful is in limning Weill against the background of the musicians of his time. Many composers regarded him with the kind of snideness that brings to mind Debussy's remark on "The Rite of Spring": "It's primitive music with all the modern conveniences." Especially condescending (and, I suspect, envious) were such men as Aaron Copland and Virgil Thomson -- and even Marc Blitzstein, whose only real success was a cuckoo's egg in Weill's nest; indeed, among Americans, only Elliott Carter showed fair-mindedness. In England, Constant Lambert recognized "The Seven Deadly Sins" as "the most important work in ballet form since 'Les Noces' and 'Parade,' " although Brecht's text takes it even beyond that. And the view from the top? Stravinsky greatly liked both Weill and his music, but Arnold Schoenberg declared: "Franz Lehar, yes; Weill, no. His is the only music in the world in which I find no quality at all." As Mr. Taylor aptly comments, "One feels sorrier for Schoenberg and the twelve-tone-row boys than for Weill."
Finally, though, the problem with "Kurt Weill: Composer in a Divided World" is the lack of a governing idea, a point of view. There are two important threads that run through the book, both of which Mr. Taylor could have done more with. He almost does justice by the first, Weill's amazing adaptability. Wherever he lived -- Berlin, Paris, New York -- Weill promptly gauged the tastes, needs and idiosyncrasies of his audience, and produced good work as if to order. The man fell on his feet, humanly and musically, wherever history swept him.
Thus, as Mr. Taylor tells us, even "the style of his letters to Ira Gershwin, written in idiomatic English, mimics that of Ira's letters to him with uncanny accuracy -- the same conversational, almost playful tone, the same lingering over matters of slight import. . . . To Brecht, on the other hand, he writes briskly and to the point -- sober, practical letters with a minimum of sentiment. It is as though he were assuming his partner's persona." The magnificent chameleon aspect -- but with a firm, solid backbone -- is there in the book.
Of the other red thread, Mr. Taylor seems only dimly aware: Weill's relationship to his Jewishness. The son of a cantor, with siblings who were Orthodox Jews, Kurt himself was a lifelong nonbeliever. He refused (as Durrenmatt once remarked about the writer Walter Mehring) "to seek his salvation in a world view, let alone in a political party"; still less in a religion. Yet he retained a distinctly dual attitude toward Judaism. "He was," Mr. Taylor writes, "a European composer who was a Jew, not a Jewish composer." Who or what is a "Jewish composer"? Darius Milhaud? Ernest Bloch? Leonard Bernstein? But Mr. Taylor may be right in contending that Weill's "experience of the Gesamtkunstwerk [total work of art] of the synagogue service, during the years he spent in his parents' home, played its own part in heightening his susceptibility to the power of drama."
As an impoverished music student during Berlin's horrendous inflation in the early 1920's, Weill supplemented his subsidy from a wealthy uncle by playing the organ in a synagogue by day, and the piano in a Bierkeller till late in the night. What could better emblematize the German Jewish experience? The only significant "Jewish" work Weill composed in Europe was the 1923 oratorio "Recordare: Lamentations of the Prophet Jeremiah," well characterized by Mr. Taylor as "a confusing, problematical" piece. In America, however, he wrote a number of works on Jewish subjects, ranging from the biblical drama "The Eternal Road," which brought him to the United States from France in 1935, through various propaganda pageants for a Jewish state in Palestine, all the way to an orchestral setting of "Hatikvah," the Israeli national anthem.
On the other hand, the young Weill told his brother Hanns, "Never will a Jew write a work like the 'Moonlight' Sonata." In 1924, he wrote his mother about his "profound contempt for these Jewish circles," whereas "the other Jews -- the assimilators and the Zionists -- are . . . totally impossible." When his opera "Die Burgschaft," written with Caspar Neher, failed in 1932, Weill said that it was not "only nationalist and anti-Semitic circles that stood in the way of . . . modern theater. . . . The blame lies at least as much with the wishy-washy, spineless attitude of the liberals," who, then as now, included a great many Jews. And even while collaborating with Ben Hecht on rabble-rousingly Zionist superspectacles in the 40's, Weill deplored to Maxwell Anderson "Hecht's silly one-man campaign against the English [sic] empire."
Mr. Taylor might have given this dichotomy more than cursory attention; it may be that the "divided world" of his subtitle was not so much around as inside Kurt Weill. But, then, Mr. Taylor has a tendency not to think things through. Thus he observes, to its supposed advantage, that John Gay's "Beggar's Opera" helped topple a government, whereas its derivative, "The Threepenny Opera," for all its splashy popularity, changed nothing. Yet later on, as he well knows, the songs from "The Threepenny Opera" and "Mahagonny," outlawed by the Nazis, became clandestine hymns of hope and resistance, just as one of Weill's French songs, "J'Attends un Navire," became an anthem of the underground. Surely those are political achievements, though nothing to measure artistic worth by.
Mr. Taylor's insufficiency, however, is at its most glaring in grammar, spelling, usage and style. I can give only a few examples of his numerous offenses: "disinterest" for lack of interest, "parameters" for perimeters, "anxious" for eager, "Germanies" for Germanys, "Louis B. Meyer" for Mayer, "Adele Astaire" for Adele, the subjunctive "were" in a statement not contrary to fact, "psychotic" for neurotic (about the heroine of "Lady in the Dark"), the nonexistent "self-reproachment," the gross redundancy "general consensus," and so on. Stylistically, things get even worse, what with frequent overwriting, or a sentence containing a fourfold "which," topped off with a jingling "pitched." I checked the galleys I read against the finished book, but found only one error corrected: a reference to the Neil Simon Theater as the "John Simon Theater." That one I would have kept.
Ferruccio Busoni, Weill's illustrious teacher, once scornfully asked his pupil, "What do you want to become, the poor man's Verdi?" Weill retorted, "Is that so bad?" A biography, even flawed, that helps him to his rightful place should be welcomed with at least guarded approval.
 
 
 
KURT'S BAD DREAMS
 That sensitivity to the feelings of others which so endeared Weill to those around him was affectionately recalled by Maxwell Anderson in a little story from the time of the tryouts of "One Touch of Venus":
"Once when Kurt was in Boston with the tryout of a musical he came downstairs to have breakfast with the producers, the lyric writer and the man who wrote the book for the show. He found them all sitting about the table over black coffee discussing the problems of the play and the sleepless night they had spent. Each one described the sleeping pills or prescription which he had tried and which had failed, and then turned to Kurt and asked wearily how he slept.
" 'Oh, fine,' Kurt said, because he had slept well and always did. Then he realized that they all hated him for that answer, and he added gloomily: 'But I had bad dreams.' " -- From "Kurt Weill."

HEADLINE: THE VIEW FROM: STAFFORD;
Old Mill Town Revived By Foreign Investment

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
AT one time Connecticut's textile industry was world renowned, employing tens of thousands of people and accounting for much of the state's manufacturing base.
Today, textile employment in Connecticut has shrunk to 2,600 jobs -- representing less than 0.2 percent of all employment in the state -- with a loss of more than 100 jobs in the last year alone. It would seem like a dying industry for Connecticut. 
 But not in the northeast part of the state. The Warren of Stafford textile mill has undergone a $30 million renovation, and over the next few years $21 million more will be spent on further expansion and improvements. In three years, employment is expected to exceed its original level of 300 employees, up from the current 200 employees now working there.
No one seems bothered that it took an Italian company to save the mills. Loro Piana, headquartered in Quarona, about a half-hour drive northeast of Milan, bought the struggling Warren Woolen Company and Cyril Johnson Woolen Company in 1988. It abandoned the upholstery business the Johnson company had pursued, and focused on the fine camel hair and cashmere fabric Warren has produced since 1883. Loro Piana brought in the latest in textile manufacturing equipment and technicians to train people here how to use it.
The plant manager, Robert V. Modica, a vice president with Loro Piana, said American textile manufacturers had tried to continue the strategies that made them successful in the first half of the century, but fell behind the rest of the world.
"They did not invest, they did not modernize," Mr. Modica observed. "Some of the equipment here when we came in dated to the 1940's and 1950's. How are you going to compete with the Germans and the Italians who have equipment of the 1990's?"
 
Specializing in Quality Fabric
 Mr. Modica's message is perhaps less unsettling since he is not a foreigner bashing the United States. He was born in Dayton, Ohio, 30 years ago, and although he spent some of his younger years in Italy, he graduated from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, and worked at the New York-based Benetton before he was hired to manage Warren of Stafford in 1988.
Mr. Modica said Warren could never compete with cheaper fabrics produced with low-wage labor in Southeast Asia, but it had already carved out a niche in the high-end fabric market, and there is tremendous room for growth.
"I see it as an example of what American industry should be trying to accomplish -- investing heavily in capital equipment, and looking at the business really long term," Mr. Modica said. "I see it as the most modern textile producing facility in the United States."
Stafford is the stereotypical New England mill town. The railroad station in the heart of downtown still has the sign out front, "Stafford, population 12,000, elevation 479 feet," and benches that are not even bolted down. An ailing President John Adams came to Stafford in the late 1700's for the mineral springs that made the town famous. The water power of several rivers made it one of the leaders of the Industrial Revolution, with iron mills in the 18th century and textile mills replacing them in the 19th century.
 
Mainstays Have Disappeared
 But things have changed. Riverside Woolen Company went out the business in the 1950's. Swift River, Glenville Worsted, and Stafford Worsted, once the town's business mainstays, have since gone under. Today, under the American flag in front of the Warren company store flies the flag of Italy. Inside, there are $200 suit jackets and even more expensive women's wear, not exactly standard fare for thrifty Yankees.
Still, employees approve of Loro Piana's tactics. Under Mr. Modica, there has been extensive repainting and new ventilation. Bare hanging incandescent bulbs, common in old mills, have given way to energy efficient, brighter fluorescent fixtures.
From the mill's reception area, there is a view of a room where banks of powerful computers hum, keeping track of production and warning of possible problems. Instead of low-paid laborers, the company employs people who have to know how to run the terminals scattered throughout the building.
Wendy Batz was recently trimming fabric in the finishing area of the plant, stopping occasionally to check orders on her screen. She has worked at the plant since 1979, and said that the technology was probably the most remarkable change. "There was one computer, maybe, before," Ms. Batz said. "It was in accounting. I never had one, and now I don't know what we'd do without them. When the system shuts down you're in trouble, you've come to depend on them so much."
 
Improvements Allay Shutdown Fears
 Town officials, too, approve of the changes at Warren, where the brick and stone facades have been cleaned and sandblasted, where hedges and trees have been planted and flower boxes installed.
"I worked in woolen mills when I was young, and I tell you, you can't believe how immaculate this is," said Stafford First Selectman Benjamin Muzio. "They've brought some pride to our community. They're going to prove textiles can survive in New England."
In many towns the purchase of a big mill by a foreign competitor was the prelude to a shutdown. Mr. Muzio said, however, that Loro Piana's investments quickly allayed any fears. "They're putting big money into the town," Mr. Muzio said. "They wouldn't be doing that if they weren't going to stay."
Mr. Modica said the biggest problem renovating the mills had been modernizing the equipment. There were 12 carding machines when he arrived, for instance, but only four of the units that convert raw wool into yarn could be upgraded sufficiently to meet his needs. In Italy the warehouse operation is computerized, and the inventory is retrieved by robots, but Mr. Modica's staff still hauls hand-labeled boxes out from beneath tables by hand. Mr. Modica is in the process of refurbishing the finishing department, from machines where someone watches the entire process and gauges how much soap is needed in the washing machinery, to automated equipment that does all that itself.
"The operator's role has changed, Mr. Modica said. "He's basically monitoring the machine today, as opposed to dumping in a bucket of soapy water."
Mr. Modica said if Loro Piana wanted to continue to compete in world markets its modernization would never be finished. "Believing as we do in the product, we've got to continually to invest in modern equipment, reorganization of the plant, training of the personnel, and so on," he said.
So far, the strategy seems to be working. Warren gets much of its raw material from overseas -- cashmere and camel hair from China and Mongolia, wool from merino sheep in Australia and New Zealand -- but Warren now exports about 15 percent of its product, and the amount is growing every year. Mr. Modica said his long-term plan was to have the mill begin producing the finer worsted yarns, which are even more in demand abroad.
The state Department of Economic Development is enthusiastic about what Warren is accomplishing, said a spokesman, Joseph Cohen, and it has given the company an $800,000 grant toward its expansion program, and the promise of at least $200,000 in tax relief.
"Connecticut is not going to return to the days when textiles were a significant part of its industrial base, but it shows international manufacturers can thrive here," Mr. Cohen said.
Mr. Cohen said Warren's exports to Europe and other places where there was intense competition in quality fabrics showed that Connecticut, in particular, was a place where manufacturers should come when they want quality.
"It's a reflection of the quality of Connecticut workers and, to some extent, the tradition of quality manufacturing, including textiles, that made Connecticut a very wealthy state," Mr. Cohen said. "People really work hard here, and they do a good job."
The transition has been bumpy in a few spots. Because of the more sophisticated manufacturing equipment, more than 120 workers were laid off when Loro Piana took over. In addition, the work rules changed, to the chagrin of at least one local entrepreneur.
Kirsten A. Morascini, who with her husband, David, owns the Springs House bar and grill across the street from the textile mill, said the company no longer permitted employees to go there for lunch, a century-old tradition, because they are not allowed to leave the grounds.
 
Liability Problems
 "This was a very popular place with the workers until 1988," Mrs. Morascini said. "They used to meet here, have a beer and a sandwich, play some pool, and go back to work."
She was also a bit disgruntled by the state assistance Loro Piana received.
"So the mill gets a million dollars to expand their business, and meanwhile all the small businesses that have grown up around it are losing their trade," Mrs. Morascini said.
Mr. Morascini, however, said he could understand the liability problems of allowing employees to have even a single beer at lunch, then returning to operate sophisticated yet dangerous machinery. He said that in Mr. Modica's place he would do the same.
"He's got to do what he's got to do," Mr. Morascini said. "It's a great place, and he's doing good things for the town."

Seasoned Hands Take On New Restaurant Ventures

BYLINE: By RICHARD JAY SCHOLEM

 BODY:
DESPITE the recession and softness in restaurant business, the big are growing bigger on Long Island. The expansions, evident in recent months, are far from over. These are some changes in the last few weeks:
*The owners of Navona in Great Neck and Il Tulipano in Huntington opened Stresa in Manhasset. 
 *Pomodoro of Port Washington and Huntington expanded to Great Neck.
*Jerry Della Femina, whose restaurant in East Hampton opened at the end of the East End summer season, joined with some partners and purchased Wings Point on Three Mile Harbor.
*La Viola of Cedarhurst and Fort Myers, Fla., branched out to Syosset.
*Jholla, an Indian restaurant in Smithtown, opened a carryout in Huntington.
 
Fourth Site Sought
 The owners of La Viola are looking for a fourth site, in the Great Neck-Manhasset region, and Jholla plans to open restaurants in Syosset-Woodbury, Stony Brook-Port Jefferson and Westbury.
Pomodoro is considering an outlet in Syosset, and Rothmann's of East Norwich, which has been empty since the American Bistro failed to renew its lease on its property a year ago, will reopen in the spring. The 200-seat restaurant has been leased by the owners of the Empress Diner in East Meadow.
Although the owners of Navona and Il Tulipano recently opened Stresa, they have already given some thought to a fourth restaurant after their newest venture is solidly established.
Gino Gianuzzi, the sole or part owner of La Caravella in Hicksville, Caffe Donatello in Plainview, Villa Parma in Syosset and La Pizzetta in East Norwich, is looking into establishing a fifth restaurant.
Jholla and the new restaurant at Rothmann's, which will probably be called the East Norwich Restaurant and Lounge, have begun expanding.
Construction has started at the Rothmann's site, where the sagging front porch has been removed. An American restaurant featuring steaks, chops, seafood and pasta is planned. Mike Panagatos, who formerly owned and managed Paddy's Clam House in Manhattan, plans to open the restaurant in the spring in collaboration with other members of his family.
Sewa Arora, who in early October opened Jholla, an Indian takeout in Huntington Village that he hopes to expand into a sit-down restaurant, has detailed plans for three additional sites.
Mr. Arora believes that the lack of volume at Indian restaurants on the Island has made Indian food more expensive than it should be. He intends to introduce modestly priced family-style Indian dining to the Island. "I think I can offer complete Indian dinners for under $10," he said. "Children will be able to eat for less than $5."
All three of Mr. Arora's new restaurants will also feature carryout food. He hopes to open the first such restaurant in the Syosset-Woodbury area in February or March.
Until recently, Danford's Inn of Port Jefferson was known more for its lovely harborside setting and view than for its food. Three months ago, things began to change.
Stephen J. Meade was hired as the chef. Mr. Meade, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, earned kudos for his innovative dishes as executive chef at the Garden City Hotel. Before that, he cooked at La Cote Basque, Le Perigord Park and the Helmsley Palace in Manhattan.
The menu, kitchen and philosophy at Danford's are undergoing major changes. The conservative pedestrian menu of old-fashioned seafood, steaks and chops has been modernized.
The new contemporary bill of fare includes sauteed almond-crusted chicken breast with a honey glaze and wild rice ($17.50), Atlantic salmon grilled over mesquite wood and thyme and served with a green lentil salad ($19.50) and bouillabaise a la Marsaillaise ($21.95). These dishes are being created in a completely new kitchen.
Danford's Inn is also featuring a series of food-and-wine dinners. The six-course meals, accompanied by five wines, cost $65, including tax and tip.
Menus for the January and February dinners are not available. Two dishes served at the wine dinner last month were smoked chicken rissoto cake with arugula and julienne vegetables and roast loin of New Zealand venison en croute, with dried-cherry cumberland sauce and spaghetti squash.
OPENINGS: The Afghan Samovar, 4994 Sunrise Highway, Massapequa Park (798-9000), is the most recent of a number of Afghan restaurants to open on Long Island.
The 50-seat storefront, which was once a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet, is owned by three partners -- Hakim Ghiasi, Assad Reuspa and Abdul Khalil -- who operate 18 Mama's Fried Chicken fast-food restaurants in New York City.
Afghan Samovar is housed in a building filled with Afghan carpets, antiques and pictures. A modestly priced restaurant, it features kebab dishes. Entrees are $7.95 to $14, soups and salads cost $2 and $2.50 and most appetizers are priced at $2.50 and $3.
The venison dishes being offered over the holidays at Cafe Max, 85 Montauk Highway, East Hampton (324-2004), are a last-minute entry on the restaurant's menu.
The chef, Morris Weintraub, has never been satisfied with the quality of the venison available from regular commercial sources. But when a hunter friend of his offered a freshly killed, 150-pound deer to the restaurant, Mr. Weintraub accepted.
Cafe Max is serving a $35, four-course, roast leg of venison dinner that includes chateau potatoes, mixed vegetables, apple cake and beverage, plus a half-carafe per person of Gristina or Santa Marina merlot or Undurraga Chilean cabernet sauvignon. The roast leg of venison served a la carte with poivrad and a mixed salad is also available for $20.
A dish of saddle of venison for $22 is going to be on the menu on Christmas Eve. The restaurant also plans to serve a five-course roast-quail New Year's Eve dinner for $55.
The Pindar Winery on Main Street in Peconic is serving free hot mulled wine and cornbread to all who visit its tasting room for the holiday season.

HEADLINE: Action Urged on L.I. Sound Cleanup

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
AFTER seven years and $15 million, a long-awaited and controversial plan to clean up Long Island Sound is about to be released, even though a specially commissioned computer model -- due two years ago and essential for developing certain proposals for the ailing estuary -- is still not finished.
While members of the Long Island Sound Study policy committee say they are frustrated by the delays in the computer model, they have taken a long-range approach to solving the estuary's problems. They are confident that in the years to come their plan, which has been financed by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, will reverse at least some of the environmental damage suffered by the 1,300-square-mile waterway. 
 And although they also cite steps that have already been taken to mitigate pollution in the Sound, their plan has generated much criticism, especially since Nov. 27, when a draft of the final proposal was released.
 
Results Being Sought, Not Promises
 Environmentalists, elected officials and representatives of the construction industry who have grown impatient with promises of long-range cures and intermediary steps, are clamoring for stronger action. They say any further delays are unacceptable, and they want a firmer plan to clean up the Sound.
Environmentalists say that proposals contained in the draft are too weak to be effective. They also say that the public, tired of repeated beach closings and fish kills during the summer months, wants results that can be seen right away and not promises of solutions.
The environmentalists, moreover, are quick to point out the political ramifications of further delays. With the advent next month of the Clinton Administration, which appears sympathetic to their causes, the Long Island Sound Study must act now to develop project proposals or be overlooked when funds for other projects are allocated, they claim.
"We've got to get our ducks in line," said Jeffrey M. Kane, program coordinator for the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, an advocacy group representing 85,000 members in New York and Connecticut.
"I'm aghast at the lack of forward movement on this plan," Mr. Kane said from his office in White Plains. "It's a disservice to the public."
In Connecticut, Lawrence A. Bock, outreach coordinator for the Long Island Sound Task Force, a Stamford-based education and advocacy organization representing 1,200 members, criticized the plan as "vague and nonspecific" and lacking firm deadlines for getting projects off the ground.
"We're pushing for programs now, because the Sound can't wait any longer, and the fish can't wait," Mr. Bock said. "The Clinton Administration presents an unprecedented opportunity to get things done."
But Gordon C. Colvin, Director of Marine Resources for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, challenged the environmentalists' claims that remediation must begin at once.
Mr. Colvin said: "Are we in immediate danger of seeing marine life wiped out? No."
The Long Island Sound Study -- which has involved Federal, state, interstate and local agencies, universities, environmental groups, industry and the general public -- recently recommended a no-net-gain policy for the amount of nitrogen entering the Sound from sewage-treatment plants. Scientists say the nitrogen contributes to reduced levels of dissolved oxygen in the Sound, and when there are severely depleted levels, a condition known as hypoxia, free-swimming organisms flee in search of more aerated waters, and slower-moving marine life, like lobsters and other crustaceans, sometimes die off.
 
A Middle Ground Proposed
 "Clearly, if hypoxia gets worse, there is the potential for a long-lasting impact," Mr. Colvin said. "It is difficult to estimate exactly the dangers of waiting, but in the short run, I don't believe there will be a problem."
He added that it will take "many, many years, at least a decade and maybe more," to solve the Sound's problems.
And while many environmentalists were critical of the long-range approach and said they had hoped for more than just a no-net-gain policy now, the Long Island Soundkeeper, Terry E. Backer, who patrols the Sound and investigates pollution problems, suggested a middle ground.
"We should be careful not to throw out the baby with the bath water," Mr. Backer said from the offices of the Long Island Soundkeeper Fund in Norwalk. "I agree that the plan is vague and not stringent enough, but it is a lot better than what we had before."
"Clearly, we all agree that we can't just sprinkle fairy dust over the Sound and make the problems go away," he said.
A serious point of contention for Mr. Backer and other environmentalists is the minimum goals set in the plan for dissolved oxygen levels in the Sound. The draft plan says that oxygen concentrations should never fall below 1.5 parts per million to avoid lethal effects to marine life. Environmentalists, on the other hand, say the minimum oxygen level must be set higher.
Both sides, though, have come together in their anger over the delay in the three-dimensional computer model, which scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the Department of Commerce were supposed to complete in 1989.
The $3 million computer model will be able to simulate different remediation plans for the Sound to see which will be most effective, said Mark Tedesco, director of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency's Long Island Sound office in Stamford.
For example, a computer model that shows how water mixes in the estuary could pinpoint how individual waste-water-treatment plants that discharge nitrogen into the Sound are affecting overall water quality, Mr. Tedesco said. It would also reinforce the Long Island Sound Study's recommendations for future plant upgrading and provide detailed information for grant applications.
"We share the environmentalists' concerns on the delay," said Robert L. Bendick, deputy commissioner for Natural Resources in the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the state's representative to the Long Island Sound Study policy committee. "It's more than concern. We're very, very frustrated."
Mr. Bendick also expressed the fear that proposed Environmental Protection Agency budgetary cuts for next year may hamper some of the work of the Long Island Sound Study.
But he disagreed with much of the criticism and said the study did include specific goals and that changes were being made to treatment plants to hold the line on nitrogen entering the Sound.
To speed release of the computer model, Congressional representatives from New York and Connecticut recently backed legislation that would put the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency's "feet to the fire," as Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat from the 18th Congressional District in New York, described it. The legislation withholds financing for the agency's other projects until it completes the Sound model.
"First things first," Ms. Lowey said. "We want a firm commitment from them that this work will be done."
Ms. Lowey and Rosa L. DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut's Third Congressional District, introduced the DeLauro-Lowey Water Pollution Control and Estuary Restoration Financing Act during the last Congressional session. The proposed bill, scheduled to be reintroduced early next year, links job projects with cleanup of the Sound and other estuaries.
A new coalition of environmentalists and representatives of the construction industry is also pushing for strong action on the Sound. Last winter, labor union workers, building trades leaders and environmentalists in Westchester formed the Clean Water Jobs Coalition to lobby for capital improvement projects -- like upgrading waste-water-treatment plants -- that would not only improve water quality in the Sound but would also create jobs in the construction industry.
"The politics is now," said David J. Miller, Northeast regional vice president for the National Audubon Society and a founder of the Clean Water Jobs Coalition. "If this conservation and management plan lacks courage, the Long Island Sound will miss the train to Washington, and that would be a tragedy."
The coalition that began in White Plains has since expanded to include environmentalists and union representatives nationwide, and it is lobbying for financing to improve estuary sites, the Great Lakes and other American waterways.
Ross J. Pepe, president of the Construction Industry Council of Westchester and Hudson Valley and a member of the coalition, said money for plant and sewer system upgrades would "provide a much-needed shot in the arm" for construction workers.
Modifications and upgrading of sewage-treatment systems on Long Island and in New York City, Westchester and Connecticut will cost about $6 billion, officials have estimated.
"The environmentalists, the building trades, we're in this together," said Mr. Pepe, whose trade organization represents about 500 businesses. "We're coming out of a recession, and a setback now would be devastating."
The no-net-gain policy for the amount of nitrogen going into the Sound could mean a moratorium on new construction, Mr. Pepe said. Specific recommendations for plant upgrades, on the other hand, will mean new jobs and allow for construction of new homes and buildings.
On Thursday in Stamford, the proposals in the Sound Study's management report will be reviewed and possibly modified to include some of the recent recommendations made by environmentalists, Mr. Tedesco said. Once the study's policy committee authorizes release of the plan, probably later this month, it will be open to public comment at a series of meetings.

SOUL TO SOUL
A Black Russian American Family 1865-1992.
By Yelena Khanga with Susan Jacoby.
Illustrated. 318 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $22.95. 
 AMONG its other consequences, the demise of the Soviet Union has released an emigration of foreign-born leftists and their descendants. Along with Spanish Loyalists and exiled third-world socialists now returning to their countries of origin, this little-noticed diaspora includes Yelena Khanga, the granddaughter of a black American who had moved to the Soviet Union in 1931, along with his Polish-Jewish-American wife. "Soul to Soul: A Black Russian American Family 1865-1992" tells the remarkable story of Ms. Khanga's family, shedding light into unfamiliar corners of both the Soviet and American pasts. Its title derives from a Russian expression for close friendship. In an American context, it also suggests encounters among blacks, and the book's most interesting chapters recount the story of the black side of Ms. Khanga's family tree.
Her great-grandfather, Hilliard Golden, born a slave, served on the board of supervisors in Yazoo County, Miss., during Reconstruction, and managed to become one of the areas's largest black landowners (Ms. Khanga is not sure how). The restoration of white supremacy abruptly ended his political career, but Golden clung tenaciously to his property until 1909, when, like many other farmers in the New South, he succumbed to debt and lost his land.
Golden's son Oliver, the author's grandfather, studied agronomy at Tuskegee Institute, and served in the Army during World War I. Disillusioned by his experience in the military (like most black soldiers, he was kept far from the front lines, working as a cook), and by the fact that the only job he could find in postwar America was as a railway waiter, he gravitated to the Communist Party. Defying the powerful social stigma attached to interracial relationships, Oliver Golden entered a common-law marriage with Bertha Bialek, a young garment worker who had emigrated from Poland and had become a Communist while working in the sweatshops of New York's garment center in the 1920's.
In 1931, with 15 other Americans -- black agricultural specialists and their families -- Ms. Khanga's grandparents sailed for the Soviet Union to help develop cotton cultivation in Uzbekistan. The poverty and backwardness of the region, where polygamy still flourished, reinforced the Goldens' sense of socialist mission. When their daughter, Lily, was born, they decided to remain in the Soviet Union "because they did not want to raise a racially mixed child in America." The agricultural experiments succeeded, and Stalin then decreed that Uzbekistan should concentrate exclusively on cotton, transforming the area, ironically, into a one-crop economy bearing some resemblance to the South of Golden's youth.
Oliver Golden died in 1940. Bertha survived to 1985, supporting herself by teaching English, and never abandoning her Communist convictions. Lily Golden, the author's mother, became a scholar at the African Institute in Moscow, and married Abdullah Khanga, a political leader from Zanzibar studying in the Soviet Union. Their marriage was ill starred, for Khanga expected his wife to behave like an African Muslim woman of the most traditional sort -- for example, she was forbidden to speak when other men were present.
Yelena Khanga was born in Moscow in 1962. Her father was bitterly disappointed that she was not a son, and did not even pick up his wife and daughter at the hospital. When he returned to Africa a few months later, Lily declined to follow. Like her own parents, although for different reasons, Lily Khanga did not want her daughter to be raised in a land that could not accord her a semblance of equality. In 1965, Abdullah Khanga was murdered by political opponents.
Thus Ms. Khanga grew up in a three-generation female household, a situation not uncommon, she notes, either in black America or in Russia, where divorce is prevalent and child raising a female duty. She was brought up to take pride in her black heritage and to rely on her own talents. She studied journalism at Moscow State University and worked for a time as a singer at the Cosmos Hotel (where she was billed as "Lolita from America"). In 1984 she landed a job at Moscow News, shortly before glasnost transformed it from a dull party organ into a muckraking journal exposing the underside of Soviet life.
Ms. Khanga is a bit older than the students I encountered in 1990, when I taught American history at Moscow State, but her book reflects many attitudes of the generation that came of age in the 1980's. Like my students, she was shocked by the revelations about Soviet society that glasnost made possible (as a reporter, she discovered grinding rural poverty on the outskirts of Moscow and found entrenched corruption in institutions like Intourist). Like them, she is fascinated by history, but prone to nostalgia for the prerevolutionary past, as if Stalin had invented Russian poverty, and neither prison camps nor stifling bureaucracy had existed under the czars.
In one respect, however, Ms. Khanga's outlook differs from that of the young people I encountered, who, along with Moscow News itself during glasnost's heyday, adopted the United States as a substitute utopia. Her friends, she notes, were unable to understand how anyone could leave the American paradise for the Soviet Union, even during the Depression. Ms. Khanga's background allowed her to appreciate that the Communist Party was then virtually the only predominantly white organization actively recruiting black members, and to empathize with her grandparents' exhilaration at living in a land where blacks could order a meal in any restaurant and enter a hotel through the front door.
Unlike many young Russians today, even those who have visited the United States, Ms. Khanga is fully aware of the less attractive features of American life. Seeing firsthand the black poverty in the Mississippi Delta in 1991 while searching for her family on a Rockefeller Foundation grant was, in a way, as disillusioning as her first glimpse of living conditions in rural Russia. She was pained to discover that the Jewish side of her family had rejected her grandmother for marrying a black man. (When Lily was born, Bertha Bialek sent a snapshot to her mother. "Is the child a shvartse?" Ms. Khanga's great-grandmother asked. When the answer was positive, she tore up the photo without looking at it.)
Ms. Khanga is careful to distinguish racism from the prejudices she encountered while growing up in the Soviet Union. Although sometimes treated as an exotic, she says she did not suffer overt discrimination. Her family's problems stemmed from the system's repressiveness (like many scholars before glasnost, her mother was unable to travel abroad) and from a general suspicion of foreigners, which led many Russians to distrust her family. Indeed, one of Ms. Khanga's more original observations is that racism, which she rarely encountered as a child, is now growing in Russia not only because of conflicts among the former Soviet Union's many nationalities, but also as a byproduct of increased contacts with the United States.
Such unexpected reflections, however, are not typical of "Soul to Soul." Too often, where thoughtful insights are called for, she falls back on familiar cliches ("individual initiative comes hard when it has always been discouraged") or meaningless bromides ("Africa isn't Eden, it's a vast, complicated continent"). Then too, the book's breezy style (presumably the contribution of the co-author, Susan Jacoby) tends to trivialize the events Ms. Khanga recounts.
IN the end, despite her family's unusual and fascinating odyssey, "Soul to Soul" somehow adds up to less than the sum of its component parts. Perhaps the problem lies in the genre itself. As in many family histories, the story seems to lose energy when it reaches the present generation. Ms. Khanga has witnessed momentous changes in the past few years, but the lives of her ancestors -- slaves seizing freedom, immigrants crossing the Atlantic, men and women moved by injustice and hoping to build a new society -- seem to have occupied a larger stage than her own. The problems of finding an understanding hairdresser in Moscow, or dealing with various Soviet lovers, pale before the challenges surmounted by her forebears.
In the course of her research, Ms. Khanga unexpectedly discovered that her mother had already been born when her grandparents renounced their American citizenship during the Stalin purges in 1936. As a result, while reared in the Soviet Union, both Lily Golden Khanga and her daughter Yelena, the author, retained a claim to American citizenship. However Yelena Khanga reconciles the complex strands of her ancestry in the future, she has, in "Soul to Soul," already made a contribution to retrieving a piece of the Soviet Union's unknown history.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
Hollywood's Tree Gets the Spartan Look

BYLINE: By Anne Thompson; Anne Thompson is a Los Angeles-based writer.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
"THOSE were the days," laments Russell Schwartz, an independent film distributor with fond memories of Hollywood Christmases past. During the 1980's boom, he recalls, "we used to get 10-cup coffee makers, big thick argyle sweaters and big boxes of frozen steaks."
Not so now. The trend in the recession-hit entertainment industry -- once the epitome of holiday largesse -- is toward cheaper gifts, or none at all, or, for the politically correct, a card announcing a contribution to charity. 
 One Hollywood press agent says she's so poor, she won't be sending out any Christmas presents this season. Nancy Nigrosh, a literary agent, says: "It's going to be a lean year. Everybody has already spent their money."
Last year, Universal Pictures made one of its production vice presidents fork over $1,500, or half the cost of the 150 or so presents he was sending out to business friends. Also starting last year, Sony Entertainment requested that its divisions not send out holiday gifts at all -- unless to charity.
Much of Hollywood, in fact, now prefers to share with the less fortunate. Rather than ordering gift baskets full of Mrs. Beaseley's muffins, Trader Joe's wine or Godiva chocolates, they send season's greetings -- preferably on recycled paper -- with a gift to charity.
"Somewhere in the Reagan era, Hollywood OD'd on the arcane ritual exchange of needless foodstuffs," says Sean Daniel, the producer ("American Me"). "There's been an ever-increasing and welcome change to charitable donations and worthy causes, thanks to a combination of conscience, belt-tightening and some shred of decency." Among the industry's favorite charities: AIDS Project L.A., the Pediatric AIDS Foundation and the Hunger Project.
When serious spending goes on -- and some still does -- it is at the top of the Hollywood pyramid. "People give gifts to thank someone for something," says Marvin Antonowsky, executive vice president at Columbia Pictures, "or to build up future favors."
One director recalls a December visit in the late 80's to the office of Mark Canton, Warner Brothers production president at the time: "It was wall-to-wall gifts, hundreds of gifts people sent him and stuff going out the door."
"Mark is in a powerful position," explains one TriStar production executive. "He can make movies. He's likable. People want him to like them. Isn't that why you give people presents?"
"It's obeisance," says Jack Brodsky, the producer ("King Ralph"). "It's like what they do to the sultans."
Now chairman of Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony, Mr. Canton "receives but doesn't send," a Columbia spokesman said. "He gives to charity."
In the "thank you" vein, when the Oscar-winning "Rain Man" was on its way to grossing $180 million, the director Barry Levinson's Baltimore Pictures sent out fresh seafood dinners -- lobster, crab, clams and potatoes -- on dry ice from Baltimore to those included on a lucky gift list.
Martin Ransohoff, the producer ("Jagged Edge"), recalls his favorite Christmas surprise: a nicely framed photograph of the actor Peter Sellers impersonating Adolf Hitler, signed "To Marty, with deep regards, Adolf Sellers." A bemused Mr. Ransohoff called Mr. Sellers and asked if he had done something to offend him. "I thought it would amuse you," came the reply.
Last Christmas, the director Richard Donner ("Lethal Weapon") gave his producer, Joel Silver, a custom-designed pinball machine featuring sounds and images from Mr. Silver's career. One year, Mr. Silver gave pairs of Frank Lloyd Wright candlesticks to key personnel on his HBO series "Tales from the Crypt."
The producers of television shows often make up a special Christmas gift for crew members. Allan Arkush, the director, said he still prizes his "St. Elsewhere" hospital bathrobe and "Shannon's Deal" key-chain. Because Mr. Arkush is in a position to hire people, he also receives gifts and cards from sound labs and production and costume designers and the like. "Companies tend to send the Fruit-of-the-Month club," he says. "It's all about the food chain."
Besides his best friends, Mr. Arkush, a music maven, sends gifts to the executive producers of his TV shows, his assistant directors and both his agents. "I don't buy a generic gift, like a case of wine," he says. "Buying laser-discs and CD's is the easiest way to personalize gifts. Thank Godfor boxed sets. But you can't go out and buy CD's for everyone; you'd go broke. This year I ordered some neat-looking unique cards with the covers of trashy novels on them, which may end up on some office coffee tables."
One independent film producer has a more strictly tiered gift-giving strategy, and so wants to remain anonymous: "For the 25 to 30 top people, I pick out something special," he says. "I send Mrs. Grace's cakes to a wider group. And the rest get Christmas cards. My assistant has become very proficient at gift-wrapping."
Many executives agree that gift-giving probably has very little real impact. Agents gave gifts every Christmas, one development executive said, so that they would "be remembered favorably and we'd pay more attention to their scripts." But it's not very effective, he said: "People forget instantly as soon as the season is over."
The owner of one top entertainment public relations firm admits that while its staff once dedicated much time and money toward putting together gifts each holiday season, "it didn't make people pay their bills any faster."
"I'm Scrooge," he says, when it comes to widespread giving. "What's important is to take care of our own: we give our staff a bonus. We sent out cards last year."

HEADLINE: INVESTMENT NEEDS FOR A NEW RUSSIA ARE MOSTLY UNMET

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
Large-scale foreign economic and financial aid to Russia, which many economists still believe is essential for a transformation to a market economy, has been pushed off the international agenda by political uncertainties here and by a global recession that affects potential donors.
The political struggle in Russia between pro-market forces, led by President Boris N. Yeltsin, and legislators who resist the painful aspects of change leaves many Western investors and diplomats skeptical about investing large amounts. 
 Crucially, Western governments also say that they have run out of money to give Mr. Yeltsin, and that private investment will have to do the job.
 
German Cupboard Is Bare
 Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, whose country has provided nearly $50 billion in aid, loans and credit guarantees to Russia since 1989, will have little to offer other than export guarantees when he arrives Monday night, according to German officials, who say Mr. Kohl is coming mainly to show moral support for Mr. Yeltsin.
"Let other countries make a contribution now," said one German diplomat, echoing statements Mr. Kohl himself has made about Germany's having done more than its share.
Germany has also provided $11 billion in aid to the formerly Communist countries of Eastern Europe, more than a quarter of the assistance there.
 
Major Western Goal
 No goal of Western foreign policy is more important, in the view of many policymakers, than assuring the success of political and economic freedom in the former Soviet bloc. The Germans in particular say failure would be a disaster, and they fear mass social disorder and migration on a scale that would dwarf anything seen in the Balkans so far.
But the Germans' European partners have so far not answered the calls for more aid. Japanese aid and private investment have been held up by a political dispute with Moscow over sovereignty in the four southernmost Kurile Islands, in the Sea of Japan.
As with the Marshall Plan that led to the economic recovery of Europe after World War II, only the United States seems capable of leading an effective effort to put Russia back on its feet.
The Marshall Plan involved about $10 billion in 1948-1949 dollars, which at the time amounted to more than 2.5 percent of the United States gross national product. But the United States made the investment unhesitatingly because it had full confidence that the Europeans knew how to put the money to good use.
There is no such confidence about the Russians. And though some studies estimate that far less money, proportionately, would be required for a successful Marshall Plan for Russia in the 1990's, there appears little prospect that the United States, Europe or Japan is thinking about starting a comparable effort.
 
Private Investors Cautious
 Private investors from abroad appear to be waiting cautiously for the wrangling between Mr. Yeltsin and the Russian Parliament to end, and for the Russian state to create the clear legal basis they need to sink large amounts of capital into private ventures here.
"There are scores of letters of intent, protocols of intent and draft contracts, but nothing ever happens," said Suzana Matyushkina, an interpreter who has tried to help a group of American real estate investors get started here. They finally found more fruitful fields in Turkmenistan, where, she said, the bureaucratic obstacles were more tractable than in Moscow.
In Russia, as Dr. Lorenz Schomerus, an official of the German Economics Ministry said in Bonn recently, "a lot of business people plunged in enthusiastically, but there's more caution now."
[On Thursday, Mr. Yeltsin denounced his opponents in the legislature for attempting a "creeping coup" after the Congress of People's Deputies refused to confirm his Acting Prime Minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, in office. A compromise between Mr. Yeltsin was announced two days later, reopening the issue of choosing a Prime Minister and calling for a referendum in April on constitutional questions.]
 
A Stunned Population
 The "shock therapy" for economic change that has been pushed vigorously by the Acting Prime Minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, is widely feared and little understood among Russians.
For most, Mr. Gaidar's program has meant a surge in prices of 25 percent a month and the loss of most of their savings. It has also brought forth a class of shady black-market speculators, loan sharks and petty thieves.
Bureaucratic and political arguments about property, investment and bankruptcy laws have been going on since mid-1991. Some foreign investors have taken the plunge anyway, but the amount of capital they have brought is far below the estimated needs for outside investment: at least $40 billion to $50 billion a year.
While the Soviet Union still stood, many Russians depended on the Germans, who provided huge amounts of money to secure Moscow's assent to German reunification two years ago.
 
Estimating the Needs
 But now Germany's hands are full rebuilding the economy of its eastern states, which have about 16.5 million people. A leading German economic institute recently suggested that rebuilding eastern Germany would require nearly $85 billion in investment in 1993 alone, 20 percent more than this year, plus almost as much in Government subsidies.
So far, because of the uncertainties, very few foreign companies have invested much in Russia. German net direct investment in Russia and the other former Soviet republics ammounted to under $10 million last year, while German companies made a net transfer of $300 million to Hungary, the German Economics Ministry in Bonn said.
In the first quarter of this year, according to East European Investment Magazine, United States companies invested $131.5 million in Russia, compared to $485.2 million in Poland.
"Eastern European countries have 40 years more experience with capitalism than the Russians have," said one United States official, attempting to explain the greater attractiveness.
"Net German private investment in Russia has not been very great," a German diplomat here said, "because there isn't a sound legal basis for anything. There's a decree by Yeltsin that says that if you build a factory, the land under it belongs to you, but there's also a law from the Parliament that says it can be taken away from you."
And much of the foreign investment has gone to service industries, not to the manufacturing base the Russians need. Some investors who have put money into production have been surprised by unexpected obstacles.
Phibro Energy, a United States company that put $116 million into a Siberian oil-producing venture, was later informed of an export tax of $6 on every barrel of oil shipped abroad, adding more than 25 percent to the market price and making the venture economically unfeasible. Phibro has appealed, but the matter is still unresolved.
"New taxes are imposed out of the blue, making nonsense of economic plans and forecasts by the investor," Brian Lavers, chairman of the company, said in London recently.
"Foreign direct investment has been the neglected child of Russian economic reform so far," said Alexander Papachristou, a lawyer with White & Case, which has been advising the Government on how to privatize industry. "If the reforms continue, there will be real opportunities for foreign investment. These things have to start small."
 
Russians Get Their Shares
 In the first broad step toward privatization, Russians are being issued vouchers with a face value of 10,000 rubles (worth about $25 at the current rate of exchange), which they can invest in companies that are being put up for sale. Privatization started with retail shops and small businesses, but in the next year, 60 to 70 percent of Russian medium and large factories are to become joint stock companies.
Mr. Yeltsin cannot be surprised by the lack of investor interest in Russia. Last summer he went to a meeting of the leading Western economic democracies in Munich hoping for help, but he left with little more than confirmation of previously agreed aid programs that the donors say amounted to $24 billion, some of which is conditional on further change here.
The International Monetary Fund also provided a $1 billion credit to Russia last summer, but another $3 billion has been delayed because of the lack of an agreement on monetary and budget policies. A planned $6 billion fund to stabilize the ruble is not feasible now, I.M.F. officials here said, as long as the value of the ruble continues to fluctuate wildly.

HEADLINE: Europe's 2 Faces: Economic Skill, Political Inertia

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EDINBURGH, Dec. 13

 BODY:
After this weekend's meeting of European leaders here in the Scottish capital, the 12-nation European Community seems more than ever fated to remain a political dwarf, even as it becomes an economic giant.
At the turn of the year, the Europeans will establish and begin expanding a free-trade single market now with 340 million people. But when it comes to making decisions on common foreign and military policy, many of the Europeans still profess helplessness and look to the United Nations and to the United States, notably to the soon-to-be Clinton administration. 
 The European leaders saved an ambitious treaty on political and monetary union this weekend by granting concessions that they hope will enable Denmark and Britain to ratify it next year.
 
When to Become European?
 But many of them concede that some of the treaty's most important provisions may remain dead letters. Economic strains have effectively pushed the goal of a common European currency past the turn of the century, and an effective European foreign policy to deal with the growing threat of widening disorder in the Balkans and other areas of the east is nowhere in reach.
Warning that Serbian aggression against former Yugoslav republics had created "a serious threat to peace and stability in the region," the European leaders blustered but stopped short of threatening military intervention to stop it.
They sent a team headed by Dame Anne Warburton, a former British United Nations representative, to Bosnia to investigate reports of systematic detention and rape of Muslim women by the Serbs. They also condemned what they called "acts of unspeakable brutality" that were part of the strategy of "ethnic cleansing" in the substantially Muslim republic.
"It is true that the statements we have made in the past about Yugoslavia have only been of marginal significance," the German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, said after the meeting ended late Saturday night. "We acknowledged that unfortunately, up to now, we have not been able to bring the situation under control."
Mr. Kinkel and other European colleagues warned, as some American officials have done, against the dangers of sending Western troops into a Balkan quagmire that could take years, and thousands of lives, to clear out.
This attitude could change. President Bush's decision to dispatch Americans to Somalia as part of a United Nations force to save a starving people from feuding warlords has made European officials acutely conscious of their impotence.
"I just think it's scandalous that we can do it in Somalia and not in Yugoslavia," Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers of the Netherlands said a few days ago, reflecting sentiments that would be heard from others at the talks here.
 
Another Look at the Balkans
 A series of meetings in Europe this coming week may shed further light on whether a turning point has been reached.
Foreign ministers from more than 50 countries, including Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, will discuss violence in the Balkans and in ethnically disputed regions of the former Soviet Union at a meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in Stockholm on Monday and Tuesday.
On Wednesday, many of them, along with leaders from some Muslim countries, will meet in Geneva with Serbian, Bosnian and other officials from the former Yugoslavia to see what, if anything, they can do about the failure of this summer's London conference to stop the Yugoslav war.
And on Thursday and Friday, Mr. Eagleburger will meet with NATO ministers in Brussels to see whether the alliance, which helped prevent war with the Soviet Union for 40 years but has been powerless against the threat of communal violence in the formerly Communist countries, can play a more effective role.
Prime Minister John Major of Britain, who holds the rotating presidency of the European Community, will also meet in that capacity in Washington this week with President Bush, though President-elect Bill Clinton said he would be unable to receive him.
"We thought this was going to be the time when the Europeans took over dealing with these problems," said a senior American diplomat who will be involved this week. "It hasn't turned out that way. But we aren't going to replace one set of U.S.-dominated institutions with another set."
The difficulty is that none of the European institutions effective during the cold war have yet found an effective political or strategic way to deal with resurgent ethnic nationalism.
The European Community, for example, would like to prevent the spread of fighting to the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, which most community members would like to recognize formally. Greece, which fears for its province of the same name, successfully prevented that here again this weekend, but did not block a plan to provide $124 million in relief and technical aid in the meantime.
Most of this weekend's wrangling was about trying to make Western European countries richer, not about helping to prevent social and economic misery in the east from spilling over into war and disorder that could affect them, too.
Spain led a fight, partly successful, to get richer countries like Germany and France to increase their contributions to the community's budget so that more development aid could be given to poorer members like Ireland, Portugal and Greece.
The main problem before all 12 European Community nations, the spreading recession, seems to stymie them. They were able to agree to establish a $2.5 billion European Investment Fund, and a temporary $6.25 billion line of credit to finance investments in bridges, roads, gas pipelines and electricity networks.
They also decided to start negotiating next month with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway about joining the community in 1995. All are relatively well-off countries that are expected to be net contributors.
As for Eastern Europe, Poland, the Czech republic and Hungary may have hope of joining after the turn of the century, but, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said, it was "absurd" to even think of including Russia in the new Europe in the foreseeable future.
Some Europeans may still think of themselves as members of a rich club with protection provided mainly by a trans-Atlantic security force. This, the meetings this week may make clear, is no longer a realistic view.

HEADLINE: SALVADOR REBELS DELAY DISARMING

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Just before the ceremony to bring a formal end to the civil war here, the toughest fighting sector of the Salvadoran guerrilla movement is resisting demobilization and has turned to the United States to resolve concerns about its safety and economic security.
After a meeting on Friday of leaders of one guerrilla movement with an official of the United States Embassy, it was not clear whether the ceremony would take place as planned on Tuesday, or would be further delayed. 
 Officials and legislators were working throughout the weekend to push forward many of the uncompleted items of the broad, complicated peace package, and President Alfredo Cristiani was holding meetings with ex-guerrilla leaders to assess progress.
 
Last Major Hurdle
 However, the question of the demobilization of the People's Revolutionary Army appeared to be the most difficult roadblock to overcome.
More than 35 field commanders from the , group, one of five represented in the guerrilla front, held an unannounced meeting in the capital on Friday with Peter Romero, the charge d'affaires of the United States Embassy, to discuss their fears and frustrations.
Mr. Romero said today that the field commanders had returned to their rural zones to discuss possible next steps with their followers. The group is led by Joaquin Villalobos, the master guerrilla tactician who fought the army to a draw.
Mr. Romero said none of the participants in the meeting gave any indication that they intended to return to war, but he said they expressed "a lot of apprehensions" about some of the Government promises.
 
Worry Over Committments
 Mr. Romero said the commanders were worried that, once the formal peace is declared, promises to reduce the size of the army and continue a land distribution program might be broken. They also said they feared the army might be sent into former conflict zones after the peace is made formal.
"I found that they were not very well informed about what has been happening during these months," Mr. Romero said. "I can't say that there has been bad faith on either side, but they seemed to have little understanding of the details.
"They were concerned about whether the United States would be here to guarantee implementation," he added, "and seemed surprised when I told them that our aid is linked to compliance with the peace accords by both sides."
"I told them that we realize we are the major aid giver and that we are here to provide guarantees," he said, adding that he had told the commanders the incoming Clinton Administration would continue to give El Salvador "high priority."
 
Transition Period
 The Government and the rebels in the Salvadoran civil war signed a United Nations-mediated peace agreement on Jan. 16, and on Feb. 1 began a cease-fire, or period of "armed peace," during which they committed themselves to carry out a series of steps leading to formal peace, originally scheduled for Oct. 31.
Delays in fulfilling the agreement led to a renegotiation of the timetable and establishment of the new date of Dec. 15 for the ceremony. Vice President Dan Quayle, United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and other foreign leaders are scheduled to attend.
Under the agreement, the members of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front were to demobilize and disarm so the front could be reorganized as a political party. Also stipulated was a reduction of the army and a purge of officers accountable for the most serious crimes against civilians. The agreement also called for the adoption of legislation dealing with electoral and judicial reform, and the provision of land and other benefits for former combatants on both sides and to guerrilla followers.
 
Demobilization in Phases
 The entire guerrilla front has been carrying out a phased demobilization of its 8,000 combatants since the end of June, with 20 per cent disarming in each step, handing in their weapons to United Nations peacekeepers. The fourth phase of the demobilization occurred at the beginning of this month, which was supposed to leave just the final 20 per cent to disarm immediately before Tuesday's ceremony.
However, diplomats and peacekeepers made known in recent days that the People's Revolutionary Army did not take part in the fourth phase and wanted to delay full demobilization for a couple of months.
Since most of those demobilized in the earlier stages were support personnel and part-time fighters, the heart of the group's fighting force remains intact at various points around the country.
The group's leaders said that since the cease-fire began, their rank and file members had not had contact with aid officials from the United States and the Salvadoran Government, and that this had contributed to the unrest, Mr. Romero said.
By contrast, he said, other guerrilla factions had allowed aid workers easy access to discuss benefits available to fighters for demobilizing.

The Economy
A politically explosive proposal lies at the heart of a plan for health care reform that is gaining momentum: taxing the health benefits that employers give workers. Under some proposals, workers would pay taxes on part of the money employers spend on health care benefits -- anything over what it costs to buy the least expensive plan. Or employers may lose tax deductions on what they pay. Supporters say the idea makes economic sense, since it would force consumers to choose more carefully. [Page A1.]
Manufacturers were elated during the Presidential campaign by the prospect of an additional $80 billion for public works projects. Now, with Bill Clinton shifting from campaign oratory to policy-making, many manufacturing executives express doubts about how much of the money will materialize and how much such a program will increase employment.

HEADLINE: Doubts On Funds For Roads

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The additional $80 billion that Bill Clinton promised to spend during the next four years on public works elated many manufacturers during the Presidential race. Now, as campaign oratory shifts to policy-making, many executives of manufacturing companies say they have doubts about how much of the money will actually materialize and how much such a program will increase employment.
The President-elect's plan is straightforward: Stepped-up spending on refurbishing the nation's highways and bridges will swell companies' workloads, quickly creating tens of thousands of jobs and giving a jolt to the economy. But many executives of manufacturing companies -- even those whose core business centers on products essential to any program to rebuild the infrastructure -- say that the money will come slowly, at best, and that the impact on their companies will probably be modest. 
 "I think Mr. Clinton will come up with a real program for infrastructure spending," said James A. Todd Jr., chairman and chief executive of the Birmingham Steel Corporation, a leading maker of the reinforcing bar steel, often called rebar, used in highways and light construction. "But I doubt it will make an impact on our business, or the steel business for that matter, for the near future."
 
 
Reaction of States
 Many executives of companies that produce products ranging from steel to asphalt and concrete said their doubts were based on the fact that few state transportation departments were ready to begin major construction projects. Moreover, they explained, far too much time would be needed to put such projects in place to result in large-scale hiring within the next year.
"Even if Mr. Clinton raises the amount of spending that will be available under the Surface Transportation Act -- that was $26 billion for fiscal 1992 -- the impact on our company will be slight to moderate," Mr. Todd said.
But that level of infrastructure spending would help to raise Birmingham Steel's earnings, he added, since even a slight increase in demand for its products would cause prices to climb. "We do expect that rebar consumption will be up about 10 percent in 1993 over 1992, but we expect it will hold to that level for much of the next five years," he said.
 For many companies, there is mostly uncertainty, not only about how much public works spending will increase, but how their businesses will be affected. "There is no way to predict with any amount of accuracy how much equipment will be sold over the next few years as a result of the action by the new Administration," Gordon D. Tjelmeland, a spokesman for Deere & Company, a maker of construction equipment, said.
Mr. Tjelmeland said Deere would probably sell more of its smaller construction equipment, based on Mr. Clinton's emphasis on highway repair and renovation. But he added that "much depends" on the weight that states give to programs involving mass transit versus highway and road construction.
F. Kenneth Iverson, the chairman and chief executive of the Nucor Corporation, the nation's leading mini-mill steel company, said Mr. Clinton's plans for infrastructure spending would probably "affect our company modestly in that it will increase steel demand." Nucor is a leading maker of bar and structural steel, which is used in bridges and heavy construction. Mr. Iverson added that an increase was not likely to lead to higher employment at Nucor.
Some manufacturers do anticipate a need for more hiring. Edward L. Flom, chairman of the Florida Steel Corporation, said a modest increase in infrastructure spending could well lead to an employment increase of as much as 8 percent in the next few years. "If this increase in spending occurs, employment will increase here," Mr. Flom said. "It's hard to say, but it could increase our employment between 5 and 8 percent."
 
 
A Skeptical Executive
 But Mr. Flom, whose company is a leading maker of bar steel products, said he remained unconvinced that significantly higher public works spending would necessarily materialize. "I don't take anything any elected official says as the truth until it happens," he said. "But something has got to happen, because our infrastructure is either obsolete or deteriorating."
John E. Jacobson, president of Jacobson & Associates, a steel industry consulting firm, said the impact of higher spending on steel companies' hiring would depend on whether the spending was sustained.
"If it's something that steel companies can depend on for a number of years, they will do more hiring," Mr. Jacobson said. "But steel companies, like most other manufacturing companies, have learned hard lessons in the last few years on having to do more with fewer people. It will take sustained spending by the government to break them of that habit."
Although executives of steel companies have doubts about the impact of a public works program, officials of concrete and asphalt companies are somewhat more optimistic about how the Clinton plans will affect their hiring.
 
 
'Not So Confident'
 Jon I. Mullarky, vice president of the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association, said higher spending on roads and bridges would increase employment in the industry.
"It will obviously have an impact on the hiring in our business, although I'm not so confident that the pace is going to be anything near quick," he said. "We should not look for any big highway program to begin in January, that's for sure."
Mr. Mullarky said his doubts over the pace of the Clinton Administration's infrastructure spending were based on the fact that in many cases, Federal funds must be matched by state and local money. Many states and municipalities do not have money to spend on such projects, he noted, adding that environmental reviews "can take a considerable amount of time on any construction project."
Environmental issues are at the heart of the concerns of several executives, including Gary B. Sauer, president of the Commercial Asphalt Company, a large asphalt producer in Minneapolis. "The highway bill last year had so many regulations that resulted in so much environmental impact study," Mr. Sauer said. "It's not easy to get things started, to get them going. If Mr. Clinton gets the dollars out of Congress, it will create jobs. But I have my doubts as to whether he can do that."

HEADLINE: U.S. Finds Energy Industry Subsidies Are Small

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
An Energy Department study of Government subsidies to the energy industry has concluded that the amounts involved are small and do not affect consumption much. But an evaluation by a prominent electricity analyst finds enormous subsidies for the nuclear industry, along with enormous costs incurred directly by the utilities.
The question of which energy forms the Government should support is drawing increased attention with the change of administrations. President Jimmy Carter won huge increases in Federal support for renewable energy resources and plans to replace oil with fuels derived from coal and other sources. As Presidents, Ronald Reagan and George Bush vigorously backed nuclear power. President-elect Bill Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore have talked about returning to renewable fuels and promoting natural gas and conservation.
 
A Contrarian View
 The Government study, released Wednesday, contradicts some conventional thinking about Washington's role in energy prices. It found, for example, that the oil industry, thought of as pampered with Government support, paid more in taxes than it got in benefits. 
 The study says a shift to conservation and use of renewable sources of energy, which the Clinton team advocates, has to a large extent already occurred.
The study, ordered by Congress last year, concludes that Government subsidies to the energy industry are equal to 1 to 3 percent of the value of all energy consumed, or $5 billion to $13 billion a year, depending on how a subsidy is defined.
The nation's total yearly energy bill is $475 billion, the study found.
"Contrary to what might be the popular impression, energy is not heavily subsidized," said Calvin A. Kent, administrator of the Energy Information Administration, an independent statistical agency within the Energy Department.
But the study did find that some energy sources, like gasohol and natural gas recovery from coal seams, existed only because of subsidies.
In contrast, a separate study to be released in a few days by Greenpeace, the environmental group, concludes that taxpayers have spent nearly $100 billion to promote nuclear power. The total, stated in 1990 dollars to account for inflation since the first expenditures in the early 1950's, said the subsidy amounted to 1.6 cents for every kilowatt-hour of electricity produced with nuclear power from 1968, when the first large plants began operating, until 1990.
 
'An Official Technology'
 The Greenpeace study was written by Charles Komanoff, a New York-based electricity analyst who has been comparing the costs of competing sources for 20 years, and an associate, Cora Roelofs. It excludes benefits received from Washington by the nuclear industry like "the ideological support which crowned nuclear power an 'official technology' and won investor confidence."
The study puts the total cost of a nuclear kilowatt-hour at just over 10 cents. The figure includes $347 billion spent to build, fuel and operate reactors and to begin programs to tear them down when they retire. The utilities have spent $48 billion on indirect costs, including waste disposal and investments in plants that were canceled. Both numbers were stated in 1990 dollars.
In contrast to the 10-cent figure, which is a wholesale figure, the average cost of a kilowatt hour to all customers in the first eight months of this year was 6.6 cents, according to the Energy Department.
Mr. Komanoff said the investments in nuclear power had not been worthwhile, adding that they were a warning "to be more tolerant of teething costs for renewables and energy efficiency."
"I don't mean that I or anyone else wants to spend half a trillion dollars on solar energy or wind," he said. "But when you see eyebrows being raised because a couple of hundred million is going to photovoltaic solar cells or a wind farm, you have to put it in perspective."
The Government study also found a heavy subsidy for nuclear power but did not compare the figure with the cost per kilowatt hour. It found that for fiscal 1992, direct appropriations for nuclear power were $890 million for research and development and $9 million in regulatory costs borne by taxpayers.
But nuclear power also has benefits separate from Congressional appropriations: it enjoys a partial exemption from liability for reactor accidents, which the study valued at $3 billion a year in reduced insurance costs.
The sector getting the most help, through subsidized loans and Government sales at below-market prices, is electricity, at $1.8 billion, the study found. In contrast, it said the oil industry lost nearly $2.2 billion to the Government, when comparing the value of its tax breaks with the Federal excise taxes on fuel.
Dr. Kent said the study did not rank sectors of the energy industry by size of subsidy because many different assumptions went into the counting. But if subsidies were counted on the basis of quantity of energy produced compared with subsidies received, renewable sources, which include solar power, hydroelectricity, wood, wind and other technologies that do not consume fossil fuels, would get $847 million in the current fiscal year. This includes $244 million in research and development funds plus $540 million in tax exemptions and $63 million for help to low-income people.
The coal industry is subsidized with $1.1 billion, the study said, with the largest item being $551 million for research into cleaner ways to burn the fuel.
Taxpayers will spend $635 million this year to subsidize conservation, the department said. The natural gas industry gets $1.7 billion.

HEADLINE: Health-Care Planners Urge A Tax on Workers' Benefits

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
A plan for health care reform that is gathering momentum around the country has at its heart a little-known but politically explosive proposal: taxing the health benefits employers give their workers.
Under current rules, workers do not pay taxes on health insurance provided by employers. And the employer can write off the cost, often thousands of dollars, from the company's taxable income. 
 But in what is emerging as the most likely model for national health care reform next year, an approach called "managed competition," much of that could change.
 
Tax on Workers
 Under some proposals, workers would pay taxes on part of the money employers now spend to provide health care benefits -- anything over what it costs to buy the least expensive basic health plan, like membership in a health maintenance organization. Or employers might lose their tax deductions on what they pay. Or possibly both.
Supporters say the idea makes perfect economic sense: it would force the 150 million Americans who enjoy such benefits to choose more carefully among health plans, by making them pay for more expensive plans out of their pockets. And that selective shopping, in theory, would drive down medical costs by rewarding the most efficient companies. As a bonus, the new taxes would provide billions of dollars that could buy insurance for the 37 million people currently without insurance.
 
Will Voters Approve?
 "The idea is to get businesses to cut prices to attract customers," said Alain Enthoven, a professor at Stanford University and a principal architect of managed competition. "With health plans competing to provide you more for your money, in the long run you are going to save a great deal."
But even the most ardent supporters of managed competition cringe at the prospect of breaking the news to American voters. The last thing voters expect when they say they favor health care reform, Democratic strategists say, is to be forced to pay taxes on something they never even regarded as income.
"It is one of those ideas that goes over great with the policy wonks," said a top Democratic strategist who insisted on anonymity. "But people in the middle class believe they are being done in by big insurance companies and the medical bureaucracy. It's going to be pretty hard to tell them the solution is to tax them."
Opponents of managed competition say greater Government intervention, not just competition, is needed to make health insurance available to all Americans. Organized labor, in particular, is likely to oppose steadfastly any plan to tax or limit health care benefits.
Nonetheless, in recent months managed competition in various forms has gained extraordinary political momentum, picking up support from groups as diverse as the insurance industry, the Business Roundtable and the National Governors' Conference. Policy experts from the conservative Heritage Foundation to California's Insurance Commissioner, John Garamendi, a liberal Democrat, have embraced it. So did Bill Clinton, in broad terms, on the campaign trail.
 
 
A New Intermediary
 Under managed competition, consumers would be represented in buying their health insurance by large "sponsors," which might represent thousands, even hundreds of thousands of customers. A sponsor, for example, might represent all the residents of a county. The sponsors are often referred to as health insurance purchasing corporations.
The sponsor would negotiate with insurance companies for high-quality and cost-effective health plans, then would give its members a choice of plans, from relatively inexpensive ones, those provided by health maintenance organizations, to more lavish coverage that costs more. Any insurance company signing up with a sponsor would have to take the business of anyone represented by that sponsor, whether sick or healthy.
Professor Enthoven suggested that under current rules insurers are rewarded not for keeping prices low but for raising them. He is one of the group of health care experts known as the Jackson Hole Group, whose influential writings on managed competition come from meetings in Jackson Hole, Wyo. As long as employers pay most of consumers' premiums and the employers get to deduct the costs from their taxes, they say, neither consumers nor employers have enough of a motivation to shop around for the least expensive health insurers.
"Changing the tax status of health benefits is the glue that holds managed competition together, said Dr. Paul Ellwood, another leading expert with the Jackson Hole Group. "This is the principal lever that government has, short of price controls, over the private sector."
 
 
Encouraging Cheaper Options
 Under the Jackson Hole plan, for example, consumers who choose more expensive health coverage -- any coverage more expensive than the least expensive plan offered by the sponsor -- would have to pay for it from after-tax dollars. That would encourage many workers to choose cheaper plans.
Employers would be required to pay for some health care coverage by making a contribution to the sponsor. Employers would not be allowed to contribute more than the cost of the cheapest basic standard health care package.
Professor Enthoven estimates that the cost to the Government of tax breaks for employees and employers now totals more than $66 billion.
Proponents argue that changing those tax breaks would hit the rich more than the poor; tax deductions are worth twice as much to families in the 31 percent bracket as they are to families in the 15 percent bracket. By closing such exemptions and exclusions, they say, the Government could find the money to pay for insurance coverage for those who are now uninsured, including the poor.
A more modest proposal for managed competition introduced in Congress this session by Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, and Senator David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, would limit only the tax deduction of employers. Employers under that bill would be taxed whenever they chose to pay for more than the basic lowest cost health plan in their area.
"You are just telling them that the deduction is a limited privilege," Mr. Cooper said. "Everybody gets to deduct a Ford or Chevrolet. But if you want a Ferrari or a Mercedes, you have to pay for the difference."
 
 
No Comment From Clinton
 President-elect Clinton so far has not commented on proposals to cap or tax benefits for health care.
But Representative Cooper acknowledged that any such attempt is likely to draw heavy fire. Repeated proposals by the Reagan Administration to cap health benefits brought a vehement and fatal response from the Democratic majority in Congress, labor and business groups. The Bush Administration considered, then rejected, the idea as part of the health care reform plan it proposed last January.
Democratic leaders also recall what is considered the watershed campaign in 1991 of Harris Wofford, the Democrat who upset former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. The Wofford campaign used Mr. Thornburgh's apparent support of a health benefits tax as an opportunity to pummel him on the airwaves.
"Tax health care benefits?" ran one television commercial. "Thornburgh. He's been in Washington too long."
A poll of 1,445 manufacturers released last week by the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington found that 54 percent of the companies said they were opposed to ending the tax deduction, compared with 27 percent who said they would favor such a proposal if it would expand access to health care for the uninsured. Four percent said they favored the proposal regardless of how the money was used.
 
 
Strong Opposition Arises
 Opposition is also strong among health care experts who say that greater Government intervention is necessary to bring health costs under control.
"They are right that the tax issue is pretty central to their managed competition proposals," said Dr. David Himmelstein, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and advocate of a Government-run health insurance system like Canada's. "If you don't have strong penalties to drive people into cut-rate plans, they don't have incentives to go to what is lower-quality care. And the bottom tier of this system could be very poor."
Even more passionate opposition may come from organized labor, which has devoted much of its energy since World War II to fighting for liberal health benefits. While some economists argue that expensive health benefits have reduced the salaries workers receive, labor leaders have described recent proposals as a new tax on those who can afford it least.
"There is no rhyme or reason to tax health care benefits," said Robert M. McGlotten, the director of legislation for the A.F.L.-C.I.O in Washington. "The fact of the matter is that I have a health care program that my employer pays for. We essentially realized as a nation long ago that it was important for employers to help employees."


GRAPHIC: At the heart of most proposals for managed competition in health care are changes in the way health insurance is treated under the tax code. Proponents argue that current law encourages excessive spending, but they differ on remedies. Here are two prominent proposals and their different approaches, compared to current law.
 
Tax situation for employer
 
Current Law
Table/Chart: "Managed Competition and Tax Benefits"
 Unlimited amounts spent on employee health benefits can be excluded as a cost of doing business.
 
Academic Proposal by Jackson Hole Group
 Same as current law.
 
House Proposal (H.R. 5936)
 Exclusion is capped at the cost of a minimum standard package of insurance determined by the Government.
 
Tax situation for employee
 
Current Law
 Benefits are not counted as income, and so are not taxed. Individuals can deduct out-of-pocket costs if they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income.
 
Academic Proposal by Jackson Hole Group
 Any benefits above a minimum standard package are taxed as income.
 
House Proposal (H.R. 5936)
 Employee contributions toward the cost of a minimum standard package are deductible; any employer-provided benefits above the minimum are taxed as income.

 That in essence has become the position taken by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in an intriguing new battle with lawmakers over transportation financing. And it has set off a lively, if somewhat incongruous, debate within the Legislature about high-minded principles like integrity, trust and credibility.
What has instigated the dispute is Mr. Cuomo's proposal to seize $516 million from a fund that just last year was dedicated to transportation needs so that the money can be used instead to balance the 1993-94 budget.
For two weeks, legislators have been arguing that it would violate a sacred trust with the public to divert the money. After all, they say, Mr. Cuomo joined them in approving legislation in 1991 stipulating that all of the money generated by that year's increase in the petroleum business tax would be spent solely to improve roads, bridges and mass transit.
 
A 'Locked Box'
 The dedicated fund was supposed to be so secure from budgetary predators that it was labeled the "locked box." That was then, says Mr. Cuomo. This is now.
With a tone that many legislators say is cavalier at best and cynical at worst, Mr. Cuomo is campaigning for his plan by asserting that the state's commitments, even when enshrined in legislation, become meaningless when financial conditions change.
He has argued that this year's broken promise would be no different from those broken in the past, including laws to cut personal income-tax rates and to provide education aid to the poor in the form of Liberty Scholarships.
When asked at a news conference last week what assurance the public has that the locked box will ever be used for transportation, Mr. Cuomo responded: "None, unless it's in the Constitution. The public at large doesn't have any assurance of any bill not being repealed or changed next year. They never did. For over 200 years, they haven't had any such assurance. Never, ever."
Legalistically, of course, Mr. Cuomo is right. And the state's recent fiscal record is replete with cases of programs not financed, tax cuts not granted, trust funds raided and temporary taxes made permanent.
But for the time being, both Democratic and Republican lawmakers are drawing a distinction when it comes to the transportation fund.
Some, like Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, distinguish between a broken promise that would delay an expected benefit, like a tax cut, and one that would undercut the rationale for a new burden, like a tax increase.
Others, like State Senator John B. Daly, a Niagara County Republican, believe that unlocking the locked box would set a terrible precedent at a time when voters are cynical enough about government. "You live by your credibility up here," he said.
 
'Offending People'
 And then there are those who simply resent Mr. Cuomo's attitude.
"This is the guy that's moralized about government for 20 years," said one Democratic lawmaker, who insisted on anonymity lest he draw the wrath of Mr. Cuomo. "Now that he gets in a bind, he says promises don't matter. That's the heart and soul of what's offending people."
Mr. Cuomo argues, without using so many words, that the legislators are hypocrites. They are happy to break promises when the abrogation helps their political standing, he has suggested, but they become indignant when a broken pledge would mean less pork for their districts.
"You can't have it both ways," he said. "They want what they can get for themselves, not the state."
 
Bottom Line Is Last Word
 As the debate rolls along, most likely into next year, fiscal reality will weigh increasingly on Mr. Cuomo's side.
Administration and legislative budget analysts believe the state will have to close a gap of up to $4 billion, and possibly more, in the budget that begins on April 1. Because a precise number may not be made public by Mr. Cuomo until mid-January, legislators are reluctant to agree on a painful solution before knowing the depth of the problem.
But if most of the money in the locked box remains dedicated to transportation, legislators will have to look elsewhere to balance the budget. There are few alternatives: education aid, which is sacrosanct to the Republican majority in the Senate; social-service programs, which have already suffered deep cuts and are protected by the Democratic majority in the Assembly, and broad-based tax increases, which are abhorred by the Governor, the Republicans and many Democrats.
Close observers of state government said the debate reflected a larger problem: the continuing inability of the Governor and the Legislature to make the difficult choices needed to address the state's structural financial problems.
The state's patchwork fiscal practices, they say, are vividly illustrated by the measure that created the locked box in the first place: the 1991 increase in the petroleum business tax, which is levied on petroleum importers and which cost consumers about 12 cents a gallon at the pump.
As the tax law was designed, the revenue generated by the increase was to flow directly to the state's general fund in the 1991-92 fiscal year, when the budget gap was $6.5 billion, and in fiscal 1992-93, with the gap at $4.8 billion. But the political price of winning approval from the Senate Republicans was an agreement to devote the revenues to transportation starting in 1993-94.
It was assumed -- incorrectly as it turned out -- that the state's economy would have recovered enough by then to compensate for the lost revenue to the general fund. Now, the Governor is making a similar assumption about the next two years by proposing to divert $516 million from the $701 million in the locked box next year, but only $200 million in 1994-95, and nothing in 1995-96.
"All these things are bets on the future being better economically," said Eric Lane, a Hofstra law professor and former aide to the Senate Democrats. "And they pay a political price for it because when it doesn't work out, they do look cynical and they do look stupid."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
The Mixed Outlook on Municipals

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
There are a lot of reasons to be positive about the outlook for tax-exempt municipal bonds, including the prospect of a decline next year in new issues, which reduces supply, and a jump in Federal tax rates, which makes tax-exempt securities even more attractive. But analysts warn that there is also an issue to worry about: credit quality.
"The quality of municipal risk has been deteriorating because of the deteriorating condition of state and local governments," said Peter B. Coffin, a senior vice president and municipal bond portfolio manager at Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston. "You simply cannot take it for granted that because it is a municipal bond you are going to get paid." 
 William T. Reynolds, director of the municipal bond division at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, said the yield spread between bonds with top credit ratings and those with medium ratings was narrow "and can only widen in the next few years."
The credit problem has several facets. One is seen in Brevard County, Fla., the home not only of Cape Canaveral but also of a taxpayer revolt that could lead the county to refuse to pay the interest and principal on bonds, called certificates of participation, that it used to finance a county office building.
 
Possibly Widespread Impact
 The impact of such a refusal could be felt well beyond Brevard County because this is not a case of being unable to pay; the county has the money, but may refuse to pay because it is caught in a political battle.
Another site of concern is California, where the state's fiscal problems, which led to a prolonged budget crisis this year, are expected to continue, resulting in a further downgrading of the state's credit ratings.
A third area is hospital bonds, especially for big city hospitals, whose credit quality could be damaged by cost-containment programs that will accompany President-elect Bill Clinton's effort to revamp the American health-care system.
In Brevard County, the Board of Commissioners plans to vote this week on a referendum that would let voters decide if the county should continue paying what it owes on the $23.9 million it borrowed for the new government center in Viera.
 
Payments Derive From Income
 These certificates of participation, or lease-obligation bonds, are different from general-obligation bonds in that they are not backed by the full faith and credit and taxing authority of the local government. Instead, payments of interest and principal come from income earned by the project built with the bonds, and the payments must be appropriated by the government every year. In this case, the income comes from rent the county pays for the office building.
The reason the bonds are popular with local governments cuts to the heart of the issue in Brevard County. Because the interest and principal payments have to be appropriated each year, courts have ruled that unlike a general-obligation bond, a certificate of participation is not long-term debt and does not have to be approved by voters before it is sold.
The government operations center in Viera has become a big political issue since the certificates were sold in 1989, in part because there was no vote on the bond issue first. The move for a referendum on whether to continue appropriating the payments of interest and principal has gained such momentum that in November two new commissioners, who promised to support a public vote, were elected to the board, giving it a 4-to-1 margin in favor of a referendum.
Robert J. Froelich, director of municipal research and investment strategy at Van Kampen Merritt in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., said the ramifications of a vote against honoring the certificates of participation "could be absolutely overwhelming." The bondholders would not be hurt, because the issue is insured.
 
Higher Rates Held Likely
 Mr. Froelich said Brevard County could be denied access for some time to the municipal market for general- obligation or other bonds. And when it could borrow again, it would be at a much higher interest rate than it now pays.
In addition, he argued, all other certificates of participation and lease-obligation bonds around the country would be affected, with their prices falling as investors wondered if another community would take the same route.
The Public Securities Association says about $65 billion of certificates of participation and lease-obligation bonds are outstanding, accounting for about 5.8 percent of the $1.1 trillion municipal bond market. About $10 billion were issued in 1991, and $8 billion have been sold so far this year.
Neil Budnick, a senior vice president of the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation, the company that has insured the Brevard issue, is less worried about the consequences. He said that the impact would fall mostly on Brevard County and that he would expect investors to judge other issues on their own merits.
As for California, Mr. Reynolds of T. Rowe Price noted that the economy there was still being hammered by cuts in military spending and was having trouble creating jobs. These and other factors, he said, will mean the state's budget crisis will continue, making the credit of the nation's largest single issuer of municipal bonds riskier and not very attractive.
In general, Mr. Reynolds said he thinks that although the national economy is beginning to grow again, there are still signs that fiscal strains in states and local governments will continue, especially as the Federal Government pushes costs on to states and the states push them to the local level.
Mr. Reynolds said hospitals had enjoyed a stable period for several years, adding that interest rates on hospital bonds are not "dramatically higher" than on other sectors of the municipal bond market. But he says this situation will probably change as the Federal Government seeks to cut the costs of medical care, resulting in revenue declines at hospitals.
"You will see the weaker hospitals show the strain and become greater credit risks than they are today," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Haute Couture Is Set Aside For an Entire Issue of Vogue

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
With a toss of its imperial head and a clear-eyed look at where fashion is headed, Vogue will devote its entire April issue to clothes and other items that cost less than $500. The magazine, which is better known for showcasing designer clothes with price tags in the high four figures, says it is making a major fashion statement.
"This is about style," said Anne Sutherland Fuchs, the publisher. "There has never been this much fashion at this price. We will make it chic by doing this." 
 But it is also about business. The magazine will have a major tie-in with Neiman Marcus in April. The Dallas-based chain will take as many as 12 ad pages in the April Vogue, as well as running in-store promotions, videos and window displays in its 27 stores across the country touting Vogue's message.
This is also about maintaining the No. 1 position in the fashion-magazine field. Although Vogue is comfortably ahead of its competitors in circulation and advertising, Harper's Bazaar threw down the gauntlet this fall when it named Elizabeth Tilberis editor in chief and said it would take on Vogue coiffed head to coiffed head.
"This is a very good counterpunch to Harper's proclaiming "The Return of Elegance,' " said Theodore V. Kruckel 3d, vice president of Mc,inc., a magazine consulting firm, and former group marketing director of the Elle Publishing Company. "It's less that Vogue has set the agenda; it's that they have taken back the agenda."
Advertisers love to appear in what they perceive as a hot issue. The April 1992 Vogue, for instance, was the 100th anniversary issue. It was highly promoted by Vogue and its 379 ad pages represented a 64 percent increase from the 1991 issue. Similarly, in the September 1992 Harper's Bazaar, introduced in a blitz of publicity as Ms. Tilberis's first issue, ad pages nearly doubled, to 251, from 131 in September 1991 and newsstand sales jumped to an estimated 450,000 from 250,000.
"I think it's very smart of Vogue to do this," said Kalman Ruttenstein, senior vice president in charge of fashion at Bloomingdale's. Anna Wintour, Vogue's editor in chief, "really has her hand on the pulse of America, and it's exciting that she is doing it."
Although advertisers have not yet been approached, the fact that Vogue has rarely, if ever, devoted a whole issue to a single topic and that it normally positions itself as a high-end fashion publication should give this issue the kind of buzz that advertisers love. Nonetheless, Vogue is toeing a delicate line. It cannot afford to offend the designers whose couture and high-priced clothes are essentially the magazine's bread and butter.
"The true luxury advertisers are always going to be very hesitant about an issue with a dollar cap, so it is going to have to be positioned very, very carefully to the Escadas and the Chanels of the world," Mr. Kruckel said.
Ms. Fuchs would say only that "some of them are not going to make the issue."
 
'Dress for Less' Section
 The idea for the one-topic issue came from Ms. Wintour, who regularly runs a "dress for less" section in Vogue. Many of the other high-end fashion magazines also include this kind of dash-instead-of-cash fashion.
"It has to do with the whole change in the marketplace," Ms. Wintour said. "The economic realities being what they really are, this is timely. It will include bathing suits, what to wear to work, a lot of accessories. It's less about a total look, less top to toe; it's everything thrown together, mixed up, more fluid and personal. The issue will also include fitness at a price, theater tickets at a price, beauty at a price."
Vogue is not backing away from designer clothes. March is the traditional Paris couture issue. And the designers are expected back, full force, in May to retake their place. In fact, many women who buy designer clothes like to mix them with less expensive clothing -- the Chanel jacket worn with a pair of jeans from the Gap.
Less expensive stylish clothing has been gaining on the designers in the $60-billion-a-year fashion market since Donna Karan exploded onto the scene with her DKNY line in 1989 and, in a sense, changed fashion. A DKNY jacket now averages about $450, while one in the Donna Karan collection costs $1,100 or $1,200.
"We did $63 million the first year DKNY opened," said Christy Hood, a spokeswoman for the Donna Karan Company. "In 1992, our sales will be $185 million."
 
Bridge Lines of Clothing
 An increasing number of designers now have these so-called bridge lines. These include Anne Klein II, who in the early 1980's became the first to introduce a bridge line; CK Sport by Calvin Klein; KORS from Michael Kors and Giorgio Armani's A/X Armani Exchange. Mr. Ruttenstein said bridge lines were a major thrust in Bloomingdale's stores nationwide. An entire floor devoted to this fashion opened at Bloomingdale's flagship store on Lexington Avenue in September.
"Bridge will be roughly $350 to $500 retail for spring clothes," Mr. Ruttenstein said. "It's no longer fashionable to spend a lot of money on clothes. We thought it might be a passing fancy, but we think now that this is the 90's."
If devoting an issue to this kind of fashion is a departure for Vogue, promoting it is even more of a departure for Neiman Marcus, whose 27 stores are known for their high-end fashion and have a retail volume exceeding $1.3 billion.
The store's marketing strategy has been largely limited to direct mail, but Terry Lundgren, president and chief executive, said it was time to reach out to a broader audience. The Neiman Marcus bridge clothes that appear in the April Vogue may well also appear later in the Neiman catalogue.
"We are embarking on a new long-term strategy for Neiman," Mr. Lundgren said. "We are going to make a big deal out of this. We want to get full credit from our existing Neiman Marcus customer as well as the new audience that we are speaking to through Vogue magazine."

HEADLINE: Review/Television;
Debating What to Do About the Deficit

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
With President-elect Bill Clinton's television special on the economy beginning today, tonight's two-hour "Firing Line" debate at 9 on PBS could not be smacker on the news. Viewers who stay with it -- not as arduous an obligation as it might seem from the proposition "Resolved: Reducing the Federal Deficit in the Next Four Years Is a Top Priority" -- should come out better equipped to assess the new Administration's approach to the overriding issue of the campaign.
As talk-show fans must know by now, the problem facing Mr. Clinton is whether to give priority to reducing the $4 trillion Federal debt, which could mean prolonging the recession, or promptly trying to stimulate the economy, which would mean a continuing increase in the deficit for a while at least. 
 Tonight's cadre of deficit fighters, led by William F. Buckley Jr., the "Firing Line" proprietor, argue that the debt is already costing too much (half of all income taxes must go to pay the interest), is scaring off investors and is threatening to be an intolerable burden to future generations.
The stimulators, led by Lester Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who dismisses the evening's subject as "an irrelevancy," respond that reducing the deficit precipitously will make things worse; they want new investment right away. The exchanges are spirited, with all parties tossing around enormous figures that defy most people's imaginations.
The program's punch-counter-punch format, which compels the participants to answer opponents' points directly, is entertaining as well as illuminating. The panelists -- white males, every one! -- expound their positions with the sort of confidence that nothing in the dismal history of economists' predictions can shake. In true academic spirit, on some points, like tax increases, there is disagreement among allies and agreement between opponents.
Mr. Buckley is abetted by Clive Crook, of The Economist; James D. Davidson, the chairman of the National Taxpayers Union, and Senator Warren B. Rudman, the New Hampshire Republican who has announced his retirement but still seems to be campaigning and is chided by the evening's amiable host, Michael Kinsley, for feeding "applause lines" to the audience at Bard College, in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.
Joining Mr. Thurow are three other economists, Robert Eisner, David Levy and Robert Kuttner. All welcome the new Administration, and not even Mr. Buckley goes out of his way to defend the Reagan-Bush era, for which he is sometimes given some responsibility. Referring to his vote for Ronald Reagan, he quotes a French witticism: "If there are no alternatives, you've got to sleep with your wife." The new political age is upon us.

(Channel 13 in New York)
"Brainstorm: The Truth About Your Brain on Drugs" is an easy-to-understand explanation for youngsters of why they should just say no. Tonight's offering from the Children's Television Workshop uses graphics, cartoons, models, quizzes, interviews with doctors, testimonials from sometime addicts and pictures of a brain operation (not for the squeamish) to show how the workings of the brain are disrupted by drugs.
The agreeable young hosts of "3-2-1 Contact," Stephanie Yu and Z Wright, though clearly straight arrows, avoid moralizing as they explain how drugs can take control of the nervous system. The images are strong and clear: at first the kick of crack or LSD may provide the thrill of a theme-park ride, but after a while, you can't get off the roller coaster. Alcohol is not neglected, and the zippy anti-smoking commercial that ends the lesson pointedly uses romantic pictures of movie stars lighting up to a rock song called "A Pack of Lies."

A Big Grant for Russian Science

 BODY:
One good way to curb the proliferation of nuclear arms is to keep talented Russian scientists at home in Russia doing research rather than selling their knowledge and their services to renegade states bent on acquiring nuclear arsenals.
With Russia's economy tottering and its research budgets cut to the bone, the only hope is for the West to provide research grants to keep the scientists gainfully employed on civilian projects. That would help Russia through a difficult time and make the world a bit safer for everyone. 
 Efforts to persuade Washington to come up with the needed money seem destined to take longer than the half-life of plutonium. So a few Western foundations have offered small-scale funding as a stopgap measure.
Now George Soros, who made a fortune on Wall Street, will put a hefty $100 million to work supporting basic research in Russia over the next two years.
The reaction of Washington's chief diplomat in Moscow says it all: "I certainly think he has given the U.S. Government a standard to live by."

HEADLINE: It's Rough, but It's Democracy

 BODY:
To Westerners, the news out of Moscow in the last few days has sounded ominous. The Russian Congress rebuffed President Boris Yeltsin and economic reform by refusing to confirm his choice for Prime Minister. Angrily, he resolved to appeal directly to the Russian people. The two sides then compromised because neither was certain of winning a national vote or prepared to face a complete collapse of government.
It's politics of the coarsest kind, and it may retard the development of a market economy. But for all the rough and tumble, Russia is evolving into a crude parliamentary democracy. 
 Production is still slipping, and so is the living standard of most Russians. Many wrongly blame economic reforms, rather than the collapse of the Communist command economy. And political responsibility remains murky. The Congress, like Mr. Yeltsin, was elected before the August 1991 coup. It won't adopt a new constitution, separating executive and legislative powers, until April.
Under these trying circumstances it is remarkable that Russia's political system functions at all. America's overriding interest lies in assuring that it continues to function. A modicum of political stability will keep Russian chauvinists out of power and nuclear proliferation under control. That is worthy of America's engagement and support.
Intolerance and paranoia still cloud the climate, impeding the compromises needed to make democracy work. And many deputies would rather denounce the Government's reform policies than propose their own. To avoid responsibility, they even voted by secret ballot to deny Yegor Gaidar the Prime Minister's post.
But Mr. Yeltsin has reached a compromise with the centrist coalition in Congress that would give the legislature a say in the choice of prime minister and cabinet. That's one of the foundations of parliamentary democracy. But the Congress has balked at a second -- giving the president the power to dissolve Congress and call elections.
That's why Mr. Yeltsin tried over the Congress's objections to do the next best thing. He called for a national vote of confidence. If voters had supported him, he intended to call parliamentary elections in March. That threat worked.
Mr. Gaidar can soldier on for now as Acting Prime Minister. And President Yeltsin can try to enact important reforms by executive decree. But after the events of last week, those decrees will carry less force than ever. The Government's popular mandate urgently needs renewal.
Last week's events are a sign of the tortuous path that probably lies ahead for Russia. The democratic possibility there challenges the West: How should America and other countries sustain engagement with Russia over the long haul?
The task for President-elect Clinton will be to mobilize sagging support, at home and abroad, for aid to Russia -- financing to reschedule its foreign debt, to provide a safety net for pensioners and the unemployed, technical assistance, a Democracy Corps. Democracy in Russia won't advance without setbacks, or take hold overnight. The task for America is to do what it can to help nurture it.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Working the Room

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
"These occasions have value," said Katharine Graham of The Washington Post Company, in a toast at her dinner party for the Clintons and Gores last week. "They create relationships beyond the office."
Because she was generous enough to invite some of the journalistic competition to the party for 100 at her Georgetown home, I set about creating relationships. Transition time is a very sensitive moment for pundits; you cannot appear eager to make contact, lest you be accused of sucking up, but neither should you allow your precious independence to be construed as aloofness or hostility, lest you miss out on a news-rich phone call from the highest authority. 
 The first trick is to position yourself along a cocktail reception's corridor of power. Never work the room; let the room-worker work you. I stood in the center of the tent outside the dining room, where it would require a conscious dodge by the President-elect and his wife (who has eclipsed Mrs. Graham as "the most powerful woman in America") to avoid me. To appear short and unimposing, I positioned myself between Paul Volcker and Senator John Rockefeller, together more than 13 feet of the Washington Establishment.
Kay brought the guest of honor past other experienced reception-positioners like Tom Johnson of CNN, Eric Breindel of The New York Post, and Judy Woodruff of PBS and her attractive husband, all of whom pretended to be talking to connected Clintonites Ron Brown, Warren Christopher and Vernon Jordan.
Sure enough, Bill Clinton, working the room, came my way. I knew him only by telephone; Kay introduced us, and the President-elect promptly said what goes over well with Republicans who reluctantly voted for him: "I hope you won't be disappointed."
Nice line, humble but not obsequious, followed by: "I hope to get good advice in the papers. You write it, I'll read it."
Rooted to the spot that had proved so well situated, I awaited Hillary Clinton. Along came Tmpwa herself, who quickly took up the Clintonian theme of appreciation for counseling: "You gave me some good advice early in the campaign. I took it."
That was a reference to a column after a couple of her gaffes, suggesting she stop defining herself by what she was not -- not a man-bystander, not a cookie pusher -- and start defining herself by what she was. Here she was saying she could take constructive criticism and remembered its source, the mark of a good politician.
So far so good; deferential in the first flush of power, they showed they know how to work a high-powered room. But could he -- the blowhard of a thousand stumps -- deliver a suitably brief toast? Would he have to work from notes? Would he act like a rube on a roll or say the graceful thing? At such an occasion, taste will tell; if you can do it at Kay Graham's, you can do it anywhere.
His hostess recalled having met Calvin Coolidge in her childhood and quipped: "When people say how nice it is to have children in the White House again, I have to remind myself they're talking about Chelsea."
He rose without notes (whew!), said a few standard things about generational change leading to generational reconciliation, and then, head on, addressed the secret fear of the guests: that he would keep running against Washington, Carter-style.
"Washington is a better place than most Americans think it is," its new leader said, softening up the set that hopes to take him into camp, and added deftly: "I hope to bring more of the country to the capital and more of the capital to the country." That Kennedyesque sugar-coating of rhetorical antithesis helped his centralist medicine go down: enough outsiders would be coming inside to make the Federal presence felt more on the outside.
Governor Clinton recalled how capitals have been places of intrigue, with plots and secret calculations, and then hoped that this capital's residents would ask for the space "to calculate less what is best for us here, and more what is best for all those who sent us here." Such gentle reproof of power-brokerage -- as he was preparing to appoint a set of seasoned economic power brokers -- rated high in the Establishment's calculation.
It was only a high-tension dinner party, not a great test of inner strength or judgment. But such occasions do have value: it was instructive to watch the young pros work a roomful of old pros.

HEADLINE: Rioting Threatens India's Secular Foundation;
Economic Frustration

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Pulling Down India's Temple" (editorial, Dec. 8) and your front-page news article of the same day fail to recognize the economic frustration of quotas and other mechanisms developed by political leaders to woo minorities in India. You overlook the influence of invisible political manipulations of "divide-and-rule" that have governed this other major democracy for five decades. 
 In pre- and post-British India, Hindus and Muslims have cohabited peacefully for centuries, except when incited by politicians who have exploited the masses for their own glorification.
In the 1940's, despite promises of secularism, the British partitioned and created a Muslim state of Pakistan as a result of nurturing this rift. Since India's independence in 1947, the Congress party has ruled by wooing and favoring the minorities with preferential treatment and quotas for the society's historically disadvantaged segments.
But such quotas have a strange way of becoming permanent and escalating, a fear some Americans share in the United States. The sad result is that India's regions receiving preferential status and maximum state support or subsidies seek further insurgence from the state.
A lasting solution lies in preventing politicians from exploiting religious differences by emulating an American-style separation of church and state. Mere inclusion in the state's constitution does not suffice; this secularism must become a legislated, mandatory practice in day-to-day decision making in areas of public life: public schools, higher education, jobs and so on.
The current Hindu outburst is not based just on religious differences. It was born in the average majority citizen's mounting economic frustration. This is the frustration of a Hindu parent whose young son or daughter cannot gain admission to an engineering or medical school because there is a cumulative quota for minorities.
If a reserved job is not taken by a minority in a particular year, it is added to the quota for the next year. As a result, in many walks of public life, more than 90 percent of jobs are reserved for the 10 percent minority in a given year. What we see now is the frustration of young, unemployed graduates who cannot get a decent job in government because these jobs have been reserved for minorities.
Beneath the surface, the riots in India are the people's mammoth economic frustration; the religious differences are merely the visible tip of the iceberg.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Experts Gather For Conference On the Economy

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 13

 BODY:
Business leaders, economists, public interest advocates and labor organizers began to gather here today for an economic conference that is shaping up as a nationally televised gabfest about just how bad the economy is and what to do about it.
At last count close to 400 people had been invited by President-elect Bill Clinton to the two-day conference, which starts Monday. But no one is sure of the number because Mr. Clinton keeps wanting to add more people. 
 The President-elect will be the moderator, and the audience, for the economic diagnoses and the cures that are expected to be discussed during 12 hours of meetings here at the neoclassical Robinson Auditorium, the city's largest hall.
Clinton advisers make clear, though, that they have at least three other audiences in mind besides Mr. Clinton. They are the Congress, business leaders and the public, who will watching the conference, and Mr. Clinton, on television.
 
Expect No Miracles
 In a way the conferees will be the props for Mr. Clinton's first real exchange with the American people since being elected -- a discussion intended to convince the the public of Mr. Clinton's contention that the economy is in a structural decline and needs painful medicine. The Clinton team also seems to be seeking to tell voters that no one should expect the President-elect to work miracles.
"It is important for the American people to know that their next President is rolling up his sleeves and getting to work on the economy," said his communications director, George Stephanopoulos. "But it is also important that we understand where the economy is now."
In that vein, the Clinton team continued today to dismiss recent reports of improvement in the unemployment rate and the gross domestic product as misleading. Aides fear that favorable short-term data could slow momentum for Mr. Clinton's proposals.
As Vice President-elect Al Gore contended today in an interview on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," "None of the figures released thus far give any reason to believe that there's been a turnaround."
 
Don't Worry, Be Chatty
 The second audience is American business, which Mr. Clinton is seeking to reassure that there is nothing to fear from a Democratic President. Indeed, the President-elect's intention to listen to business leaders for 12 hours over two days is meant to demonstrate that he will pay attention to their concerns.
The third audience is Congress. While the conference will include some Republicans, participants as a whole tend to be in favor of Mr. Clinton's economic agenda, a way for the Clinton team to signal Congress that the economic experts support the President-elect's programs and share his sense of urgency.
This conference will also showcase Mr. Clinton's intent generally to operate his Presidency as a nonstop campaign for his agenda. As moderator, Mr. Clinton will be able to step into Americans' living rooms.
"Bill Clinton loves the discussion," said Vernon E. Jordan, Mr. Clinton's transition board chairman. "If there is one result to look for, it is that the American people should feel tuned in and part of the process of dealing with the economy."
There will be seven discussion sessions over the two days. Thirty-two conferees will take part in each session and the rest will be the audience.
The opening session on Monday, for instance, will be devoted to an "Assessment of the Domestic Economy," and will include presentations by the economist Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate; John Sculley, chairman and chief executive of Apple Computers, and Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, of which Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary, was once chairwoman.
The afternoon session will be an "Assessment of the International Economy," with presenters including Glen Fukushima, director of A.T.&T. Japan; Larry Summers, chief economist of the World Bank, and Paula Stern, a trade lawyer.
These will be followed by working sessions on "Lifetime Learning," "Investment for Short-Term and Long-Term Growth," "Deficit Reduction," "Environment" and "Government Reform." There will be a closing news conference Tuesday afternoon.

HEADLINE: Tax Breaks Ahead, But How Big and for Whom?

SERIES: Tax Politics; Third of four articles.

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
For the makers of corporate jets, President-elect Bill Clinton's promise to restore an investment tax credit could not come at a better time.
As corporate America suffered in the recession, its jet makers suffered even more. They are just winding up their worst year in memory and are pining for investment credits, which they say increased their annual orders by up to 50 percent in some years. 
 But the way the Clinton plan is shaping up, a tax break for businesses investing in new equipment may not be as generous as in the past. And the structuring of the investment credit, which allows companies to subtract part of the cost of equipment from their tax bills, will determine not only whether it helps one industry or another but whether it increases the Federal deficit -- or makes any difference to the economy at all.
 
Saving an Industry
 The corporate jet builders say they expect the credit, a linchpin of the economic stimulus package Mr. Clinton is weighing, to salvage their industry. Companies like Gulfstream Aerospace of Savannah, Ga., and Beech Aircraft and Learjet Inc., both of Wichita, Kan., would probably respond by hiring thousands of workers to fill the orders they expect to receive, their chief executives told Mr. Clinton in a letter recently.
They are not alone. The National Association of Manufacturers and similar groups are generally in favor of an investment tax credit, and although opinions are not unanimous, many corporate leaders are likely to say so at Mr. Clinton's economic conference that opens Monday in Little Rock, Ark.
The widespread drumbeat of corporate enthusiasm is backed by a chorus of economists.
"I think the investment tax credit has a good history of being an effective economic stimulus," said Joseph W. Duncan, chief economist for the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, who urged the Clinton Administration to formulate it "to give a special benefit to smaller companies" -- those with fewer than 50 employees.
But skeptics abound. They say nobody can prove any benefit to economic growth from investment credits, which have been granted, altered and repealed again and again in the last 30 years.
 
Rules Not Known
 And of course nobody can yet say just what rules will apply this time.
"It is not clear that it will have all that much of an effect," said Jane G. Gravelle, a senior specialist in economic policy at the Congressional Research Service.
Robert S. McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice, which is financed largely by labor unions, said the credit would be acceptable only if paid for by raising other corporate taxes, just as corporate income tax rates were lowered when the investment credit was abandoned in 1986.
The Clinton economic program does in fact call for a range of tax increases on businesses as well as a range of tax breaks. The increases, by some estimates, could bring in nearly $60 billion, although other estimates cast doubt on that figure, saying Mr. Clinton's ideas would not raise as much revenue as he projects.
Still, some economists present the investment credit as a miracle cure, a tonic with no deficit hangover.
In a widely circulated simulation of the Clinton economic program that was published just after the election, the economic consultants Lawrence H. Meyer & Associates said that even though a credit might cost the Treasury billions in subsidies for corporate jets, machine tools, bulldozers and the like, the builders of all that equipment would end up paying back billions in payroll, excise and corporate taxes.
The Meyers model assumed that corporations would be given a 10 percent credit for all equipment purchases above 80 percent of the 1992 level. That would prevent a windfall for many companies that would have invested in new equipment anyway.
For at least the first two years, the model showed, the economic boost would funnel enough revenues into Federal tax coffers to offset almost completely the costs of the credit.
Without the "incremental" feature, many economists figure that the investment credit would be far too expensive to justify. The WEFA Group of Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said an unconditional 10 percent credit on equipment, like the one favored by jet builders, would drive the nation's production up $60 billion by 1996, with about 500,000 jobs added. But the cumulative budget deficit would be about $55 billion higher than without the credit, or $110,000 per job, the report said.
And Allen Sinai of the Boston Company Economic Advisers Inc. said his projections showed that even a limited investment credit would substantially drive up the deficit. "There is no free ride on tax subsidies," he said.
Many other uncertainties remain.
For example, it is impossible to predict what types of equipment would qualify for the equipment credit. Computers might be excluded, for example, especially if they were used, say, for bookkeeping and word processing rather than for factory-line production. A publisher's presses might qualify, but not its telephones; corporate jets but not fleet automobiles, and so on. Without question there will be tough lobbying to get the credit structured to benefit individual industries.
 
Would Be Retroactive
 To counter fears that industry would defer capital spending while waiting for the tax credit to take hold, Congressional leaders, including Mr. Clinton's Treasury Secretary-designate, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, have said that whatever formula they approve will be retroactively effective to Dec. 3.
Another question is whether companies subject to the alternative minimum tax, which limits their deductions and credits, should be able to take advantage of an investment tax credit.
By one estimate, as many as 60 percent of major corporations are alternative minimum taxpayers; if they cannot use the credit, its utility would be considerably limited. But if they can, some of their tax bills might disappear, defeating the purpose of the minimum tax.
And it is not clear whether the tax credit would be refundable -- that is, whether companies that lose money, and therefore have no tax bills, could receive a refund check from the I.R.S. These might be the very companies that need to invest most to stay competitive.
The stimulative effects of the tax credit, its main justification, come not from its benefits to those who buy equipment and claim the credit, but from those who sell the equipment and hire new workers.
But a rarely mentioned feature of the investment tax is that it helps stimulate foreign suppliers as much as domestic ones. Probably more than a third of the capital equipment purchased by American industry comes from abroad, and it would be very difficult to exclude foreign suppliers from the program. Tight rules that discriminate against foreign companies would put the United States in conflict with world trade agreements.
 
Questions Abound
 There are also thorny administrative difficulties inherent in the most likely approach for an investment tax credit, an incremental tax credit that would reward only investments above a certain base.
Ms. Gravelle of the Congressional Research Service, one of the credit's critics, gives several examples:
*What about newly formed companies? If all their investments qualify for the credit, they would be at a huge advantage over established competitors.
*What about foreign-owned companies, whose capital spending is growing faster than well-established domestic-owned companies?
*How should companies that have been divested from parent corporations be treated? How about companies that merge?
*How should leasing companies be treated? If they qualify for the investment credit, would companies that do not qualify because their investments are declining simply decide to lease equipment instead? If they do not qualify, how would that affect, for example, the airlines, which typically lease about half of their fleets?
*What happens when companies sell old equipment and buy new? Could sharp managers take advantage of the credit by selling like equipment to each other?
*When partnerships apply for the tax credit, are past investments calculated for the partnership as a whole or for individual partners? It would make a big difference, and it would be hard to devise a system that prevented partnerships from reorganizing to get around any restrictions.
"These are only the problems that I can think of," Ms. Gravelle said. "I'm sure the lawyers will be able to think of others."
Unfortunately for both boosters and detractors of the investment credit, its chaotic history provides no solid lesson.
First put into effect in 1962, during the Kennedy Administration, the credit was switched off and on sporadically for decades, then was abandoned in the Reagan Administration's sweeping tax changes of 1986.
When first enacted, the credit was worth 7 percent (but just 3 percent for electric utilities). In October 1966, in an attempt to restrain inflation, the tax credit was temporarily suspended. After second thoughts, it was restored early in 1967. The credit was then repealed in 1969, once again to fight inflation.
In 1971, it once more was restored in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, and in 1975 it was increased to 10 percent. It was extended in 1976 and again in 1977, and Congress made it permanent in 1978.
 
Credit Somewhat Diluted
 The record is further clouded because the size of the credit was open to tinkering. When first enacted its effect was somewhat diluted by a provision that prevented companies from taking any depreciation on the portion of an investment that was refunded by the credit. That provision was repealed in 1964. From 1982 to 1986, depreciation was forbidden on half the credit's value.
The incremental tax the Clinton team is considering is also somewhat diluted in value. If a company that invested $100 million in 1992 raised investments to $120 million in 1993, a 10 percent credit on the increment above 80 percent of the previous year would be worth $4 million. That is just 3.3 percent of the company's total investment for the year. And if spending went up to $140 million the next year, the relative worth of the tax credit would be even less.
To economists, that is not much, especially if the stimulative effects of a tax credit and other fiscal policies drive inflation up sharply.
"Getting 4 points off the inflation rate is roughly 70 percent of the bang of a 5 percent investment tax credit," said Lawrence Lindsey, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board. "That's quite significant."

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day yesterday with an article about proposals to change the tax treatment of health benefits misstated the provisions of the plan in the House of Representatives. It would limit a tax deduction for employers to the cost of a minimum standard package of benefits. For employees, all employer-provided benefits would remain tax-free.

Businesses' capital investments generally grow in good times and shrink in bad times, regardless of whether an investment tax credit is offered in the tax code or what the rate is, at least judging by the last 20 years. The chart shows the percentage change from the prior quarter in total capital expenditures by business, using constant dollars at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. Shaded areas indicate recessions.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Pragmatism Seen in Survey

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO

 BODY:
An overwhelming majority of the Hispanic population in the United States says there is too much immigration, according to a nationwide public opinion survey being made public today in Washington.
And in another response that poll takers said was likely to confound expectations in an era when ethnic identity has been emphasized, a large proportion of Hispanic citizens and residents say people who live in this country should learn to speak English. 
 The Latino National Political Survey, the most extensive effort to measure Hispanic attitudes to date, concludes that on these issues, as well as on other social and political questions, economic self-interest and a driving commitment to be part of American society shape attitudes among Hispanic groups more than a sense of ethnic identity.
And members of a team of scholars who directed the survey, of people of Mexican, Puerto Rican and Cuban origin, said that the results should dispel any notions that their political attitudes separate them from the majority of the American population or define them as a monolithic interest group.
"Overall, these groups do not constitute a political community," the report on the survey said.
Referring to the survey's respondents, the authors of the report, "Latino Voices," added, "Their positive views on their experiences with government and their optimism about their future suggest that the relationship between these groups and mainstream society is not so harsh as to isolate the 'Hispanic' community and make it easily mobilized around narrow ethnic appeals."
The survey was directed by a team of academic experts and consisted of face-to-face interviews with 2,817 people in 40 metropolitan areas from August 1989 to April 1990.
 
Detailed Questions Asked
 Unlike previous polls, the survey asked detailed questions touching on many issues, including discrimination, language and ethnic identity, and separated the responses by national group and citizenship status. The researchers said the survey was meant to fill a major void in the knowledge of attitudes among Hispanic residents and citizens.
Only a minority of the people surveyed said they had personally experienced bias based on their national origins. But clear majorities said they believed some discrimination existed against their national groups.
The survey, which assessed the language abilities of respondents to determine which language to use in interviews, found that a large majority of Hispanic people born in the United States speak English better than Spanish, and it said there were high levels of English literacy even among foreign-born immigrants who prefer to speak Spanish.
But though the poll's authors said there was strong support for bilingual education among all Hispanic groups, an overwhelming majority of those who said they were American citizens indicated that its goal should be to teach English or both languages rather than to preserve the Spanish language and culture.
"The results of this survey will prove surprising to people who have generalized from the most distinctive and visible part of the Latino population, which tends to be poor and Spanish-speaking," said Rodolfo O. de la Garza, a professor of government at the University of Texas who was the survey's principal researcher. "Even among those on the margins of society we found a desire to gain access to mainstream America. And there is a large population, especially among the native born, who are much less visible because they have already incorporated themselves."
Majorities as high as 80 percent among some Hispanic groups said there was too much immigration. And further, among Hispanic citizens in all groups, clear majorities disagreed with the notion that special preferences should be given to prospective immigrants from Latin American countries over those from other regions. "The explanation for this is simply that Latinos are the people who feel the greatest economic competition from immigrants," Professor de la Garza said.
F. Chris Garcia, a co-researcher on the survey who is a professor of political science at the University of New Mexico, said: "Latinos are much more pragmatic than we give them credit for in academic and activist circles. They are, after all, subject to the same pressures for accommodation as any other groups in the same socioeconomic conditions, and regardless of their national origins they have the same concerns as other similarly situated Americans."
In fact, clearly rejecting labels like "Hispanic" or "Latino," which tend to lump all national groups together, members of each group said in overwhelmingly large numbers that they believed they had little in common with the others.
The survey also found some deep social bonds within each national group, but it exposed a surprising lack of interest among respondents for most Hispanic groups, leaders or causes.
Angelo Falcon, another co-researcher on the study and the president of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy in New York, noted that a majority of respondents in each national group described themselves as moderate to conservative ideologically. In other surveys, Mexican-American and Puerto Rican political leaders describe themselves as primarily liberal.
"The implication is that there is a growing gulf between the Latino leadership and the community," said Mr. Falcon. "The degree of assimilation illustrates that for many years, even as the leadership has identified itself ethnically, there has been no real Latino political movement that might have encouraged distinctively Latino views."
Hispanic citizens in the survey readily identified themselves by their national groups and said they were most likely to socialize with other members of their group. But responses were nearly evenly split when people were asked whether or not public officials from their own national groups were more helpful than others.
More than 90 percent of the respondents in each group said they did not belong to any ethnic organizations, and less than 13 percent said they had participated in any political activities organized around their national groups.
 
Some Contrasting Attitudes
 Several contrasting attitudes and values among the various Hispanic groups emerged in the survey.
Puerto Ricans, who are United States citizens by birth, nonetheless expressed greater concern with events in their ethnic homeland. And Puerto Ricans were the only group in which a clear majority said the history of their ethnic homeland should be taught in schools along with American history.
American citizens of Mexican origin showed the least concern of any group with the politics of their ethnic homeland, and were the least likely to support increased government spending on programs for refugees and immigrants.
The three national Hispanic groups surveyed represent almost 80 percent of the total Hispanic population of the United States. The survey sample is representative of 90 percent of the members of those groups. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Conducted with financing from the Ford, Rockefeller, Spencer and Tinker Foundations, the survey asked as many as 200 questions of individual respondents, who were given the choice of being interviewed in English or Spanish. About 60 percent of the respondents chose Spanish.

HEADLINE: Clinton Picks Arkansas Official To Be New U.S. Surgeon General

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 14

 BODY:
The top Arkansas health official, Dr. Joycelyn Elders, has been asked by President-elect Bill Clinton to be the new surgeon general, a transition official said today.
Dr. Elders, a 59-year-old pediatrician here and the director of the State Health Department, was offered the position over the weekend and accepted it immediately, the official said. She would become the second black and fifth woman to be named to a top post in the Clinton Administration. 
 The transition team had not expected to announce Dr. Elders's appointment before Wednesday, but now may announce it on Tuesday because of the disclosure tonight, first reported by The Associated Press.
 
'Conscience of Health Care'
 Dr. Harry Ward, chancellor for medical sciences at the University of Arkansas, said tonight of Dr. Elders, "She has become the conscience of health care in our state, speaking out in a very candid way on every major health-care issue from teen-age pregnancy to poverty to violence."
If confirmed, Dr. Elders would replace Dr. Antonia Novello as head of the Government's Public Health Service.
Dr. Elders has battled with conservative groups in Arkansas for her advocacy of distributing contraceptives at school health clinics to combat AIDS and pregnancy.
She has said when confronted on the issue, "I really feel we must put our children first and I'm willing to do whatever we have to do to save the children."
Dr. Elders is the first black and first women to head the Arkansas Health Department. She came to the job in 1987 after a 26-year career in pediatrics at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.
She is a 1952 honors graduate of Philander Smith College, a mostly black college in Little Rock. She earned a master's degree in biochemistry and her medical degree from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and did pediatric training at the University of Minnesota.
Dr. Elders and her husband, Oliver, a high school basketball coach, have two sons, Eric, 29, and Kevin, 27.
According to an article in The New York Times Magazine in 1989, Dr. Elders is the author or co-author of 138 published monographs, many of them dealing with growth problems and diabetes, the treatment of which first brought her to the attention of the state's medical community. Her level of expertise was such that doctors around the state routinely began to refer their juvenile patients with insulin-dependent diabetes to her.
On Saturday, Mr. Clinton named another black, Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic Party chairman, as his Commerce Secretary. The other women Mr. Clinton has named so far are Carol M. Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; Alice M. Rivlin, deputy budget director; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Gore Bringing Environmental Policy to Fore

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
With a month to go before the Clinton Administration takes office, Vice President-elect Al Gore has already had unusual influence on a broad range of appointments and is supervising the development of new policies on the environment, natural resources, technology and the economy, transition aides say.
The most immediate example of Mr. Gore's influence with Mr. Clinton occurred last Friday when a former senior Senate aide was chosen by Mr. Clinton to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 Another example will come Tuesday, the second day of the economic conference in Little Rock, Ark., when Mr. Gore is to lead a panel he organized on the connection between economic growth, environmental safeguards and new technology.
But such visible signs of Mr. Gore's authority are viewed by transition aides as merely the prelude to a much larger vision that Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton have for the Government: how to make environmental and economic goals equal in virtually every decision the new Administration makes.
 
Counterweight to Quayle
 "A heavy majority of the American people understand that our future depends on maintaining a sustainable environment, on conserving our resources, on solving our problems and that in doing that we can create economic opportunity," Mr. Clinton said at a news conference on Friday.
Indeed, scholars of the American Presidency say that Mr. Gore's influence will apparently exceed the considerable power wielded by Vice President Walter F. Mondale early in President Jimmy Carter's Administration.
Some said the only comparable example is the commanding role that Vice President Dan Quayle has played on environmental and economic issues in the last two years of President Bush's Administration. Mr. Quayle and a group of aides, through his Council on Competitiveness, developed the White House program for stalling regulations deemed unfriendly to business and speeding those considered helpful.
Aides to the Clinton transition said the process of gaining economic benefits from environmental safeguards begins by dismantling the barriers that have long existed between the agencies that regulate the environment, natural resources, research and economy.
 
Traditional Bureau Battles
 For example, the head of the United States Forest Service historically battled the Environmental Protection Agency over decisions on barring defoliants. Nor was the Department of the Interior often in contact with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on offshore drilling.
Transition aides said the new Administration goal is to have concern for environmental protection permeate the entire range of public policy, an idea Mr. Gore has long advocated.
In one indication of such goals, Mr. Clinton named his boyhood friend, Thomas F. McLarty 3d to be chief of staff. Mr. McLarty is a member of the Business Council for a Sustainable Energy Future, which has called for creating thousands of jobs and reducing environmental damage by sharply increasing the use of natural gas and renewable energy sources.
Mr. Gore declined to be interviewed. But on Sunday on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," Mr. Gore said he did not have any "line responsibilities for the environment." He added, though, that Mr. Clinton had "been very generous in asking for my advice on the decisions that he faces."
Some evidence for Mr. Gore's clout has been highly public. On Friday, Carol M. Browner, the Secretary of Environmental Regulation in Florida and a former senior aide to Senator Gore, was chosen to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
A week ago, Mr. Gore announced he would block the opening of the nation's newest hazardous-waste incinerator in Ohio pending the outcome of a Congressional investigation into its safety and how its permits had been issued.
Other examples of Mr. Gore's authority have been less public. Mr. Gore helped scuttle the nomination of Lawrence H. Summers, the chief economist at the World Bank, as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers after environmentalists criticized his views on protecting natural resources.

Excerpts From Clinton's Conference on State of the Economy

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 14

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the economic conference called by President-elect Bill Clinton and held at the Robinson Center in Little Rock, as transcribed by Reuters:
PRESIDENT-ELECT BILL CLINTON I've called this economic conference for three reasons. First, so that all of us can hear and give an assessment of where our economy is today and what has been happening to it over the last two decades. 
 Second, so that we could bring together a diverse and talented group of Americans who make this economy work, and get your ideas and your input on how we should implement our economic plan.
Third, to begin through this very public process to reconnect the American people to their government, and to ask for their help, too, in making economic progress.
Over the past month we've seen a number of encouraging signs about the economy's short-term health. But it's far too early to assume that the change in these short-term measures really indicates that we're out of the woods even in this prolonged business cycle recession.
I do have a plan which I have pushed all across America for economic revitalization. And I intend to do my best to put it into action. The slightly improved short-term picture does not change the core elements of what we have to do over the long run.
First, we must invest in our people, their education, their training and their skills. . . .
Second, we must increase investment, both public and private, to create jobs -- investment in technology, investment in infrastructure, investment in plant and equipment, investment in research and development.
Third, we must stop the cycle of borrow- and-spend economics.
Fourth, we need a new approach to energy and to the environment. Senator Gore and I have never accepted the idea that there is a long-term conflict between economic growth and environmental responsibility.
Finally, we must each make a personal commitment to our government. . . . I mean a very personal commitment to change, an investment of time and spirit, a willingness to give something back to the country and to challenge the way the government does its business so that we are not wasting so much money and not wasting so much of our future.
I'd like to begin by introducing our first speaker, who will give us a macroeconomic overview of the American economy.
 
Overview of Problems In the Economy
 ROBERT SOLOW (professor of economics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology) The two basic long-run problems of our economy are weak productivity growth, which means that the average family's life can improve only slowly, and increasing inequality, which means that for many families life gets worse, not better.
The only solution to the productivity problem is investment in modern industrial equipment, in research and development, in transportation and communication infrastructure, and in educating and training. . . .
The education and training part is doubly important. It serves two purposes because it is the only realistic chance we have to improve the earning power of the poor, so that they can share fully in rising incomes.
Finally, the immediate task is to create a strong recovery. That's essential, not only because it's the only thing we can do that will show results in the next three or four years, but also because without a strong recovery we will not get the investment we need, and the long-run problems will be harder and harder to fix.
JOHN SCULLEY (chief executive, Apple Computer) I believe that we're at a turning point in the world economy today, not unlike transformation from the agricultural economy in the 19th century to the industrial economy that we've had for most of this century.
The biggest change in this decade is going to be the reorganization of work itself. In this new economy, the strategic resources are no longer ones just the ones that come out of the ground, like oil and wheat and coal, but they are ideas and information that come out of our mind.
We need an education system that will educate all of our students, not just the top 15 or 20 percent. So it's America's choice. Do we want high skills or do we want low wages?
ALAN BLINDER (professor of economics, Princeton University) Inadequate investment in our people, in the quality of our work force, has been a big part of the problem we've been hearing about; and that correcting that should be a big part of the solution.
Now America's first response to the productivity slow-down problem actually worsened the inequality problem. And I refer, of course, to supply-side economics or trickle-down economics or whatever you'd like to call it. . . .
Fortunately there's an alternative strategy to trickle down and I call it percolate up. That is, if you work to raise the quality of the work force, and if you succeed, then the productivity of capital in our economy will be higher, the returns earned by the owners of capital will be higher, and there is nothing that will boost investment more than higher returns to capital.
MARIAN WRIGHT EDELMAN (president, Children's Defense Fund) Let me suggest two things that I know this great country can do in 1993 under your leadership. The first thing we can do is to make sure that every one of our children is born healthy and is immunized against preventable diseases. We know that every dollar we invest in immunization saves $10 on the other end.
The other thing that I know that this country can do is to see that every child gets ready for school. And a down payment on that is to see that every one of our children gets a head start by fully funding Head Start, making it full day, full year, taking it down to earlier ages. Every dollar we invest will save almost $3 on other ends.
ALICIA HAYDOCK MUNNELL (economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston) Investment in the nation's infrastructure has moved to the forefront of the policy agenda. First, for the past two decades, we have not been investing enough. Second, as Bob Solow indicated, infrastructure investment, like private investment, can make our economy stronger. Third, we know profitable places to put the money.
It is time to reverse that decline. Recent research clearly indicates that appropriate infrastructure investment can increase productivity and growth and future levels of family income. We should recall that America's great public works -- the Erie Canal, the transcontinental railway, the interstate highway system and the dams and water systems of the West -- required great cooperation and sometimes a leap of faith.
 
How to Handle The Deficit
 CLINTON In government accounting terms, the deficit is the deficit is the deficit. Should we draw a distinction between borrowing money for investment in our future and borrowing money to pay for today's health care costs?
MUNNELL In my opinion, if you're going to undertake a major capital investment initiative and you're also going to undertake a major deficit reduction initiative, it's very important to start thinking about having a capital budget at the Federal level. Basically, economists believe that you should pay for things that you use today today, and you should pay for things that you're going to use over a long period of time over a long period of time.
MICHAEL PORTER (professor, Harvard Business School) The paradigm that's governing international competition and competitiveness has shifted dramatically in the last three decades, and American companies are struggling with keeping up.
The old paradigm was one where success was based on access to natural resources, pools of labor, scientific knowledge. The old paradigm was one where companies that could enjoy a large home market gained economies of scale and prospered.
There's a new paradigm of international competition and that paradigm is based on dynamism, on the capacity of firms to innovate and to upgrade the sophistication of how they compete. Now success depends on relentless investment by companies. . . .
What's the problem? We invested a significantly lower rate in plant and equipment than our major international rivals. We simply don't have a large enough pool of investment capital. We're not saving enough, either in households or in government.
In addition to this inadequate pool of capital, our policies are too erratic. We keep changing the tax code. We keep changing the rules. And this instability causes companies to waver, to hold back from investment.
JOHN WHITE (Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University) We're heard a lot this morning about investment, productivity and economic growth. I want to spend a few minutes now to put them in the context of the Federal deficit because the huge Federal deficit, in fact, is a drag on our ability to have the kind of growth that we all desire. . . .
Things are not improving. In my view, the deficit problem is growing worse and must be dealt with through a multiyear specific deficit reduction program with real targets -- one that is published now and shows significant progress in this decade.

 	 	 		. . .	 	STUART ALTMANN (Heller Graduate School, Brandeis University) Increasingly what is happening is that we've created a gigantic Ponzi game in this country. Everybody's trying to figure out how not to pay the bill. And increasingly, these dollars are being shifted from public programs and the uninsured on to the private sector. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Dealing With Costs Of Health Care
 CLINTON I just want to reinforce one point he made so that you get some sense of what an incredible downward spiral we're in: Because more costs keep being shifted to the private sector, more private sector people stop insuring their employees. . . .
HAROLD POLING (chairman, Ford Motor Company) Ford spends as much on health care as it does on steel. Health care providers are our largest supplier.
To accomplish effective reform, we must address the following five principles, shown on the next chart:
*Universal coverage. I'm sure everyone here today agrees that health care coverage should be afforded to every American.
*Quality assurance. Studies have indicated that unnecessary operations and procedures are running as high as 30 percent.
*Administrative simplicity. There are more than 1,000 insurance companies with 1,000 different claim forms. Can you believe that over four billion insurance claims were processed last year?
*Cost containment. With health care costs in the United States approaching $3,000 for every man, woman and child, neither large nor small companies nor individuals can afford to continue their health care. Purchasers, providers and government must cooperate to develop a plan to contain these growing costs.
*Inequitable financing. Costs should be spread fairly among all participants in the health care system and cost shifting must be eliminated.

 	 	 		. . .	 	HUGH McCOLL (chairman, (Nationsbank Corporation) First, what I would say is that what we have seen as a drying up of credit has quite clearly happened. I believe it's been an overreaction on the part of the examiners and subsequently by the bankers themselves to the S.& L. crisis. That is that the S.& L. debacle caused a response by Congress, putting on a lot of regulation. The examiners are carrying it out to a fault and the bankers, seeing no reward for reaching out on the risk curve, have pulled back. I think that's very serious. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	What we need is a lifting of so many regulations that are trying to micromanage the banks and let them go back to serving their communities and working with a borrower that is in trouble or the borrower who has a good idea but who can't possibly provide the information that is now being required. . . .

Making Cuts
In Military Spending
 ANNE MARKUSEN (Rutgers University) With the end of the cold war, we really have an unprecedented opportunity to lower the defense budget and to use those funds to invest in America.
Now it's difficult to make these cuts. So that's why we have to have a strong, coherent conversion strategy in this country. And I think there are two really important elements to that. One is that on the demand side we need to set out some new missions in the economy that will do what the cold war did for us over 40 years, that is, be the organizing principle for the economy.
And I was so glad to hear you talk about energy and environment earlier. I think in addition to those, transportation, housing and education, infrastructure could be added -- we need to make these commitments not only to research and development in these new areas but also to some market creation for some initial period of time. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	We need to encourage firms to do advance planning. We need some capital for firms to retool, something like an Enterprise Development Bank. And we need worker retraining and education programs that are linked up to job creation, perhaps in these new mission areas.
Let me just close by saying that I think this is an issue not just for the defense industries but for manufacturing generally.

 	 	 		.. .	 	ROBERT E. ALLEN (chairman, A.T.&T.) A focus on infrastructure including information networks, commercial networks which are interconnected, inter-operable, national and global, needs to be encouraged. I have some points to make about who should do what in that respect. I think the government should not build and/or operate such networks. I believe that the private sector can be and will be incented to build these networks, to enhance them and make it possible for people to connect with people and people with information any place in the world.
I do think, however, that the government role can be strong in the sense of first, increasing investment in civilian research and precompetitive technologies. Secondly, supporting the effective transfer of that technology to the private sector. Thirdly, establishing and promulgating technical standards, which are so important to be sure that networks and devices play together, work together, so that we have the most efficient system in the world. And incentives for investment and research development, job training. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT AL GORE I fully agree when it comes to conventional networks and the new networks that your industry is now in the process of building. But with the advanced high-capacity network like the national research and education network, it does seem to me that government ought to play a role in putting in place that backbone. Just as no private investor was willing to build the interstate highway system but once it was built, then a lot of other roads connected to it, this new very broad band high capacity network, most people think ought to be built by the Federal Government and then transitioned into private industry. You didn't mean to disagree with that view when you said government shouldn't play a role, did you?
ALLEN Yes, I may disagree.
CLINTON I was hoping we'd have one disagreement. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Problems Of World Economy
 CLINTON Having focused on our own economy this morning, and I think at least reaching a general consensus about what the major problems are and the need to take a long-term approach, we're going to talk about the international economy.
RUDIGER DORNBUSCH (economics professor, M.I.T.) You have asked for abject candor, and I'll try and give some of the bad news.
Europe certainly is going to have zero growth, and maybe a recession. A European recession really doesn't help, because Eastern Europe needs markets. . . .
Japan is just as bad. . . . Very little growth for the coming year; perhaps zero growth or even a recession is a possibility in Japan.
If Europe and Japan are bad news, the same is true of Latin America. . . .
Finally, the former Soviet Union is very bad news indeed. All of that means that there is less certainty in the world economy, and as a result, less stable world economy.
There is very little we could do. So coordination then I think does not carry a strong message for the next administration.
But there is one area where we have to be very cautious. We have to carefully avoid the problems of '80-'85, when an enormous dollar rally grew in U.S. manufacturing with lasting import penetration. 

 	 	 		. ..	 	REPRESENTATIVE LEON E. PANETTA (Democrat of California) On the deficit issue, again, how fast will [other countries] be looking for us to bring down the deficit over the next 5-10 years?
DORNBUSCH I think that what John White showed this morning will be an extraordinary shock to financial markets worldwide.
Essentially he showed that the deficit tops $150 billion worth per year, as far as the eye can see, something that was not known very publicly. The rest of the world will want a very substantial answer to a medium term, 5, 6, 7 year budget reduction.
SENATOR LLOYD BENTSEN (Democrat of Texas) What do you think the possibilities are of getting the Japanese to open up their markets, at a time when they're in serious trouble themselves?
DORNBUSCH The Japanese problem is a problem of the ministry of finance that ought to be a little bit more Keynesian. When you have a problem as Japan has, and you have a big budget surplus, and you have no public debt, it's time to cut taxes, do some spending, and get your prosperity very quickly.
I am delighted with the appointment of the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. Surely that is a first message to Japan that we will pursue serious trade policy. And we have not in the past.

HEADLINE: Embargo Is Eased After Hanoi's Help on M.I.A.'s

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Significantly easing the 17-year-old trade embargo against Vietnam, the Bush Administration said today that it would permit American companies to sign contracts to do business there.
The move is a response to what the Administration sees as greater Vietnamese cooperation in the search for the 2,264 American servicemen still listed as missing from the Vietnam War and makes renewed diplomatic ties increasingly likely. 
 "I don't think there is any question that we are moving towards normalization of relations," said Larry Rivers, executive director of the Washington office of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. "It's now only a question of when that occurs."
 
May Be Just a First Step
 So far, the Bush Administration has not said whether it would end the trade embargo or normalize relations before it leaves office on Jan. 20, though some experts who would like to see increased trade believe further steps in that direction are possible.
Like Mr. Bush, President-elect Bill Clinton has said he would not establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam as long as he believes Hanoi is withholding information on missing Americans. Aides to Mr. Clinton said they were not informed of Mr. Bush's announcement in advance.
The Administration's announcement does not mean a complete rapprochement. American companies can only sign contracts, open offices and hire staff in preparation for conducting business in Vietnam if the embargo is removed. At present, the broad prohibition against most trade with Vietnam remains.
 
A Strong Signal
 Still, today's action signals a clear warming toward Vietnam after decades of bitterness and distrust.
"This is a clear indication that the United States Government is sincere about economic and diplomatic normalization," said Virginia Foote, director of the United States-Vietnam Trade Council, which has lobbied for an easing of policy. "We are beginning to let the war pass and build a new relationship with Vietnam."
Pressure on the Bush Administration has mounted in recent months as Hanoi has become more cooperative in investigations into the fate of the missing servicemen.
 
Welcomed by Key Senator
 A number of people involved in the issue, including Senator John F. Kerry, chairman of the Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, have urged the Administration to reciprocate.
Senator Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, issued a statement saying he hoped the announcement "leads to further progress in obtaining additional answers about the fate of Americans still listed as missing."
Senator Kerry and Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican and the committee's vice chairman, are to leave Tuesday for another trip to press Hanoi for more information.
 
Worried About the Competition
 Last month Japan extended a $380 million development loan to Hanoi; Japan and France have offered to repay Vietnam's loans from the International Monetary Fund. United States companies are concerned that increased economic ties between Tokyo and Hanoi might mean that they will lose out to Japanese companies in the Vietnam market.
"A lot of people believe that there is more money to be made in Vietnam in the next 10 years" than in China because of Vietnam's "affinity with the West, the country's crushing needs and its highly educated populace," said Gerald Warburg, spokesman for the Multinational Business Development Coalition, a group of corporations that, like many business and trade organizations has lobbied for a relaxation in Washington's policy.
Veterans' organizations are split, however: the V.F.W. supports the move; the American Legion says Hanoi has not done enough to warrant easing the embargo.
"I first went to Vietnam in July of 1991," said Mr. Rivers, of the V.F.W. "I went back last month, and what was going on in '91 compared to what is going on in '92 is light-years away. The Vietnamese have a new sense of urgency. They have made a conscious decision to try to get this issue resolved."
But John Sommer, executive director of the American Legion, said he was not impressed.
"We're just totally disappointed and outraged at the President's announcement," he said. "We don't believe that Vietnam's cooperation on the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue has been as substantive as it has been cracked up to be."

HEADLINE: Key Serbian Official Backs Moderate Yugoslav Leader

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Dec. 14

 BODY:
President Dobrica Cosic endorsed Prime Minister Milan Panic today in his election bid to oust the nationalist president of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia's main news agency reported. The elections are scheduled for Sunday.
Opponents of Mr. Milosevic, who has been branded internationally as most responsible for the violent breakup of Yugoslavia, have said Mr. Cosic's endorsement is absolutely necessary if Mr. Panic is to unseat Mr. Milosevic and fulfill his promise to bring peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 
Serb's Peace Proposal
 In Belgrade today, the leader of the Serbs who are striving to dismember Bosnia proposed that Serbian forces unilaterally stop fighting in an effort to end the eight-month war. The leader, Radovan Karadzic, said at a news conference that he would propose that the Serbs agree Thursday to stop shooting. 
 The proposal seemed at best dubious because Mr. Karadzic made no mention of withdrawing troops from any part of the 70 percent of Bosnia that Serbian forces have captured, or of allowing the return of the hundreds of thousands of Muslims whom the Serbs have forced from their homes.
[Diplomats at the United Nations said Mr. Karadzic's call for a halt in the shooting was aimed merely at helping Mr. Milosovic at the polls.]
In his speech today, Mr. Cosic criticized Mr. Milosevic and the ruling Serbian Socialist Party, which used to be the Communist Party, for failing to support his program for reconciliation and economic revitalization in Yugoslavia, which now includes only Serbia and Montenegro.
In a news conference today, Mr. Panic said emphatically, "I have seen Cosic's program and accept it as my own."
The latest polls show Mr. Panic neck-and-neck with Mr. Milosevic in the race for president of the Serbian Republic, but the polls are flawed because a significant number of people do not have telephones.
Yugoslavia is feeling the threats of force to bring an end to the fighting in Bosnia. Heavy shelling has continued in the capital, Sarajevo, and a half dozen towns despite a cease-fire signed over the weekend by Serbian, Croatian and Muslim military leaders.
Western diplomats said they saw a direct link between Mr. Karadzic's peace offer and the international meeting this week in Geneva to discuss Bosnia. Several countries, including the United States, have suggested that a flight-restriction zone over Bosnia should be maintained by force and that a United Nations arms embargo be lifted in order to allow Bosnia's badly out-gunned forces to obtain weapons.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Hard Line From France
 UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 14 (Special to The New York Times) -- France, saying it was ready to support military enforcement of the ban on military flights over Bosnia, opened talks here today with other Security Council members on a resolution that would allow firing on aircraft that violate the restriction.
The United States, however, wants a resolution that would also permit bombing Serbian airfields in retaliation for violations of the flight ban.
The debate comes amid signs of growing public impatience in the Islamic world and Western Europe with the United Nations' inability to end the conflict in Bosnia, coupled with pressure for tougher military action against the Serbs.
France and Britain had hitherto opposed enforcing the ban on military flights over Bosnia, which has been repeatedly violated by military helicopters, fearing that to do so would only encourage Serbian forces to attack peacekeeping forces escorting relief convoys to Muslim villages.
But at their Edinburgh meeting last weekend, the twelve European Community leaders adopted a tough statement on Bosnia, saying Serbs bore "primary responsibility for the conflict and its brutality."
And after Secretary of States Laurence S. Eagleburger said Saturday that the Bush Administration now favored enforcement, President Francois Mitterand went further, announcing that France will take the lead in introducing a new Security Council resolution enforcing the flight ban.

HEADLINE: After Stall, Koreans See Need For Economic Reforms, Too

SERIES: Uncertain Strides: Change in South Korea -- Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KIHEUNG, South Korea

 BODY:
To see the hope of South Korea's economy, one must put on a special pair of pants, a jump suit, a hood, facial mask, booties and two pairs of gloves, pass through three separate air showers and walk over three sticky floor mats.
Only then, completely free of dust and other particles, can one enter the space-age super-clean factory in which dozens of young women are making screens for notebook computers using a technology that is so advanced that only the Japanese have mastered it. 
 But if the Samsung Electronics factory here, set amid the rice paddies south of Seoul, is a symbol of the country's industrial aspirations, it also shows how far it has to go. While Japan is already mass-producing such screens, Samsung is just starting out, and is several years behind.
 
Economy the Campaign Issue
 And South Korea, which only five years ago was being looked upon as the next Japan, is coming to grips with the notion that it might not be so easy to get there after all.
Indeed, as South Koreans prepare to vote on Dec. 18 to elect a new president, the economy has become the major campaign issue. There is a sense of foreboding that the rapid progress has stalled, and there is a growing consensus that the economic system that has carried South Korea so far so fast can carry it no further, indeed, that it must change in as fundamental a way as the political system has.
South Korea in fact remains one of the great economic success stories. Some companies in businesses like computer memory chips and steel lead the world. Gross national product per capita, a measure of the standard of living, has more than doubled in five years, to $6,340 in 1991, from about $3,000 in 1987. With rising wealth has come greater political influence, as exemplified by the visit last month to Seoul by President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, hat in hand.
Still, in the last two years or so, economic growth has slowed, a trade surplus has turned into a deficit, and the country has been losing competitiveness in some industries. Even after the strong earlier growth, G.N.P. per capita in 1991 was only roughly equal to that of Greece, and far below that of Japan ($26,920), the United States ($22,560) and Britain ($16,750), according to the World Bank.
Now, said Bae Soon Hoon, president of Daewoo Electronics, "the gap between Japan and Korea is even greater than before."
To keep progressing, many business executives and economists say, South Korea must navigate two major transitions.
Instead of the economic system developed during the years of dictatorship, which gave the Government strict economic control and concentrated business in a few huge conglomerates, South Korea must now move toward freer markets and smaller, entrepreneurial companies.
Second, the nation must shift more toward innovation and advanced technology. Industries that have propelled South Korea's growth so far, like shoes, clothing and simple consumer electronics products, are now migrating to developing nations with far lower wages like Indonesia and China.
 
Workers Gain a Voice
 A move away from low-tech, labor-intensive industries is probably inevitable as any nation modernizes, but in South Korea's case the change has been hastened by democratic reforms that gave a voice to formerly suppressed workers.
Strikes in the late 1980's, some of them violent, helped lead to a tripling of wages in some cases, and more than 300 labor-intensive footwear companies, for instance, have shut down in the last two years as Nike, Reebok and other big buyers have taken their business elsewhere.
Even in electronics, American and Japanese companies have moved manufacturing to Southeast Asia because South Korea has lost its cost advantage. Exports of personal computers from South Korea plunged more than 57 percent in the first half of this year from the comparable period a year earlier.
To move toward higher technology, the Government wants to raise spending on research and development from a paltry 2 percent of G.N.P. to between 3 and 5 percent, more in line with other advanced nations. It has begun a variety of national technology projects in areas like semiconductors.
 
Dependent for Technology
 For now, however, South Korean companies remain dependent on technology from abroad. Goldstar Electron is making chips using technology from Hitachi, and the Daewoo Motor Company recently linked up with Honda. The more products these companies sell, the more components and manufacturing equipment they import from Japan.
That is why attempts like those by Samsung to catch up to the Japanese are considered so important.
Five years ago, when South Koreans voted in their first democratic presidential election in nearly two decades, the economy was barely an issue.
The economy was growing at a breakneck 12 percent a year and racking up large trade surpluses. Samsung television sets were taking their place on store shelves alongside Japan's Sonys, and Hyundai Motor Company, with its low-priced Excel, seemed well on its way to following the track into the United States market that was cleared by the Japanese Toyota and Honda.
But growth this year is expected to be only 6 percent and in the latest quarter it was only 3.1 percent, its lowest level in 11 years. The nation will record its third consecutive annual trade deficit this year. And Hyundai is selling only 40 percent as many cars in the United States as it did at its peak.
South Koreans might have "opened the champagne bottles a little early," said Park Ungsuh, president of Samsung Petrochemical Company, who maintains that it was never realistic to think South Korea could become the next Japan.
"So far, we have been driving in first gear to escape the vicious circle of poverty," he said. "We have done that so successfully that people wondered if we would go all the way to advanced country status."
But that, he said, will take time.
Many foreign analysts are not as pessimistic. They say the current slowdown stems from the worldwide recession and from efforts by the Government to rein in inflation.
 
Trade Deficit Dropping
 Already, they say, there are signs of improvement. The trade deficit, which reached $7 billion in 1991, is expected to drop to $5 billion this year, and there was a surplus in the most recent quarter for which data are available. Inflation, which was close to 10 percent, is now half that.
Further, foreign analysts say, while newly developing nations are competitors, they also represent potential markets.
"It's sort of like the old Korea and the new Korea are passing each other and going in opposite directions," said Sean Goldrick, chief representative for James Capel & Company, a stock brokerage. South Korean shipbuilders, for instance, are losing cargo ship contracts to China but are building more sophisticated liquified-gas tankers, he said.
Despite a sense of gloom among Koreans, things on the surface appear good. Unemployment is only about 2 percent, and the wage increases that followed democratization allowed many people to buy their first cars and VCR's. The number of cars here has increased more than fourfold since 1985, causing unbelievable traffic jams and one of the world's highest accident rates.
"The cars you see here, five years ago they would have been those of the office workers," said a metalworker, pointing to rows of small Daewoos and Hyundais parked outside the Seoul factory where he works. "Now they are the cars of the factory workers."
 
A Korean Rodeo Drive
 The Apkujung-Dong neighborhood in Seoul has become what residents call South Korea's Rodeo Drive. High- priced shops with names like Gucci, Godiva and Givenchy are interspersed with trendy espresso cafes frequented by newly affluent young people.
But the rising consumption only fuels the concern of economists, who say the country is now spending too freely and losing a willingness to work hard.
South Korea's growth has been modeled to some extent on Japan's, with the Government subsidizing favored industries and protecting them from imports.
Much of the assistance has gone to a few huge conglomerates known as chaebol.
 
Hyundai Founder Running
 The largest one, Hyundai, was founded in 1947 by one of the current presidential candidates, Chung Ju Yung, a garage owner who started by repairing United States Army vehicles and expanded into construction.
With 1991 revenues of $51 billion, Hyundai now encompasses more than 20 companies with operations in cars, computer chips, ships, furniture, insurance and securities, to name a few. Hyundai and the three other large chaebol -- Samsung, Lucky-Goldstar and Daewoo -- have combined revenues of about $150 billion, a figure equal to more than half the nation's G.N.P.
But there are increasing signs that centralized control is breaking down.
"As the economy expands, it's hard for a single entity to make all the decisions," said Kim Jin Sun, an economist with Jardine Fleming Securities in Seoul. "That's why the Soviet Union collapsed."
Business executives complain of too much government interference, saying that in Japan, the model of government-directed capitalism, the government acts more by guidance than by fiat, giving business more of a role in setting directions.
 
Need for Financial Reform
 One thing almost everyone agrees needs reform is the financial system. Interest rates on loans and deposits have been strictly controlled, and financial markets have been basically closed to outsiders, earning Korea the nickname Hermit Kingdom.
One result has been that South Korea has extremely high interest rates on loans, which ranged as high as 20 percent earlier this year before dropping to 13 percent, still twice as high as in the United States and Japan. That makes it difficult for Korean companies to raise investment capital.
The Government has embarked on a plan to deregulate interest rates over several years.
All three major candidates in the presidential election favor development of technology, promotion of smaller businesses and deregulation of loan and savings rates, though with some differences.
Kim Young Sam, the candidate of the governing Democratic Liberal Party, is trying to distance himself from the economic record of President Roh Tae Woo by saying he will cure an economic malaise he calls the Korea disease. But he favors only gradual financial deregulation.
Kim Dae Jung, of the opposition Democratic Party, has said he might speed up financial deregulation. He wants to restrict the activities of the chaebol to leave more room for smaller companies.
Interestingly, Mr. Chung, the founder of Hyundai, goes further and favors breaking up the chaebol.
But business executives here say that all the candidates are making somewhat vague promises and that their platforms are pretty similar to one another and to government policies. It seems that whoever wins, the economy, like the political system before it, is about to go through its own democratization.
NEXT: The security outlook for the Korean Peninsula.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Clinton Team to Tackle Drug Pricing

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton's transition team has put the drug industry on notice that Mr. Clinton intends to limit increases in prescription drug prices as part of any plan to revamp the nation's health-care system.
Aides to Mr. Clinton met recently with drug company executives, described his ideas and invited their reaction. Details of the meeting were provided today by Clinton aides and company executives. 
 One of Mr. Clinton's ideas is to make prescription drugs available to all Americans as part of a standard package of health benefits, which employers must provide to employees. Another idea, part of the same plan, is to set guidelines for drug prices, in an effort to insure that they do not rise faster than other consumer prices.
 
Warning on 'Gouging'
 In the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton said he wanted to impose a national limit on all health-care spending, public and private. He said he would "stop drug price gouging" by eliminating certain tax breaks for drugcompanies that raised prices more than the increase in the overall Consumer Price Index. Mr. Clinton endorsed a bill sponsored by Senator David Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, that would limit tax breaks for such companies.
Judith Feder, coordinator of health policy for the transition team, said today that Mr. Clinton "most definitely" intended to carry out his campaign vow to slow the rise in drug prices.
In the last few days, Clinton aides have met with officers of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, the trade group for the prescription drug industry, and asked for their help in controlling drug prices. Mr. Clinton's staff gave the executives a memorandum with descriptions of ideas for insuring that all Americans have access to affordable prescription drugs.
The proposals set off debate within the drug industry, with some companies eager to work with Mr. Clinton and others alarmed at his proposals.
In an interview today, Paul E. Freiman, chairman of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said he had sought the meeting with the team.
"We told the incoming administration that we want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem," said Mr. Freiman, chairman of the Syntex Corporation, in Palo Alto, Calif.
Mr. Freiman said that prescription drugs should be part of any standard package of health-care benefits. But he voiced concern about Mr. Clinton's proposal for an overall limit on health-care spending. "Overly tight constraints on our industry will have a negative impact on innovation, on the discovery of drugs for Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and cancer," he said.
In the last decade, drug prices rose more than twice as fast as the Consumer Price Index, a result, the industry says, of the high cost of bringing new drugs to market. A group of prescription drugs that cost $10 in November 1982 cost $23 last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The rise in drug prices has slowed this year, but Government data show that prices for drugs are still rising twice as fast as for other products.
The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association estimates that prescription drugs account for 7.2 percent of total spending on health care in the United States. That suggests that Americans will spend $59 billion on prescription drugs this year, since the Government estimates that total health spending will be $820 billion. But consumers are keenly aware of drug costs because they pay a much larger share of such costs than of doctor or hospital charges under many insurance plans.
Dr. Feder, the health policy coordinator for the transition team, met last week with Mr. Freiman and Richard J. Kogan, president of the Schering-Plough Corporation and a former chairman of the industry group.
Here are some of the questions and issues raised by the Clinton team, as described in a memorandum to the drug industry:
*Will the drug industry support incentives for greater use of generic drugs in Medicare and Medicaid, the programs for the elderly and the poor? Generic drugs are low-cost copies of brand-name drugs whose patents have expired.
*Will manufacturers agree to limit drug price increases to the overall rate of inflation? How can such limits be enforced?
*How can consumers and the Government be sure new drugs are priced fairly when they come onto the market? Should the Government adopt guidelines for drug pricing?
*Should there be a ceiling on the total amount of money spent on prescription drugs in the United States each year? Should each state have its own limit? How can such limits be updated and enforced?
 
The Industry View
 In September, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association adopted a statement on health-care policy. It opposed Mr. Clinton's recommendation that the Government require employers to provide health benefits to employees. It also opposed his call for a national limit on health-care spending.
Industry executives said today that the association was reviewing its statement. Some companies have already told the transition team that they want to cooperate with Mr. Clinton, regardless of what the association does.
Mr. Clinton's proposals are likely to divide the drug industry. Stock analysts say that companies like Merck, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb, which have promising new drugs in the pipeline, will be less affected than companies that depend more heavily on sales of older drugs with many competitors.
The questions from Mr. Clinton's transition team seem to assume that developers of breakthrough drugs are entitled to higher prices than companies that simply duplicate existing treatments.

Unpaid for 3 Years, a Somali Still Directs Traffic

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Idriss Hassan received his last paycheck three years ago. Still, every day from 7 A.M. until 3 P.M., he works as a traffic policeman, guiding cars, camels, trucks and people through one of Mogadishu's trickiest intersections.
It is not only a difficult task but, in a city without any form of government, tap water, electricity or phones, it is an unusual touch of normalcy. 
 The traffic light has been dead for over a year, and the intersection, on a main avenue about a mile from the United States Embassy compound, is more like a bumper-car arena. Dented mini-vans, their headlights, windshields, windows and doors missing, aggressively inch their way in between pickup trucks so loaded with passengers that some ride sitting on the hood and the roof. Adding to the mix are the newly arrived Humvees and other American military vehicles commuting between the airport and the United States Embassy compound.
More often than not, the din of car horns drowns Mr. Hassan's shrill whistle. But it is a job that he does with pride.
"I do it for my country and because I love being a policeman," he said.
There were once more than 200 traffic police officers in Mogadishu. Now there are only a handful, said Mr. Hassan, a slim 55-year-old who has spent 30 years in the traffic police and works at the intersection with four of his friends.
Other former policemen want to come back to work, but they do not have uniforms. All that is left of Mr. Hassan's original uniform is the blue beret, the epaulettes and his whistle. He had to make himself new khaki trousers, and he sewed his own white shirt.
Tears welled in Mr. Hassan's eyes when he recounted what he once had.
"I had beautiful white gloves which I used to direct the traffic," he said in fluent Italian learned during colonial rule of this part of Somalia. "I had a shoulder holster and a gun and shiny black boots, and everyone respected me."
 
Cheaper Weapons
 Weapons may have mostly disappeared along the main avenues of Mogadishu, but they are highly visible at the Bakara market.
Patched together under rusty corrugated tin roofs and burlap-topped huts, the market stretches out along narrow, muddy lanes in the western part of the capital.
It is one of busiest places in the city, and one of the roughest. Hundreds of Somalis meander through the chaotic, pickpocket-infested jostle accompanied by bodyguards toting M-16's and AK-47's. Armed men guarding the stalls and stores threatened to shoot loiterers, including Western ones. There is much distrust of foreigners here, and the Somalis who were the most talkative with a Western visitor were the few people who hissed: "Be careful! Watch out!"
At a wheat store, the counter is used to prop up the owner's recoilless rifles and shiny coils of ammunition. Much of the wheat, rice and flour in the stores has made its way to the market after being looted from the warehouses and convoys of foreign relief agencies trying to alleviate the suffering in the famine-stricken interior of the country.
The looting may have kept the Somali economy afloat, allowing the citizens of Mogadishu access to affordable food. But in the last couple of weeks, prices for basics have skyrocketed because supplies have dwindled.
Dates imported from Saudi Arabia cost the equivalent of $1.80 a pound, sugar from China has tripled in price in the last week to $3.60 a pound, and rice has doubled to 70 cents a pound.
Conversely, the price of weapons has plummeted since the Americans arrived and began fitful efforts to collect arms from Somalis. An AK-47, the most popular assault rifle here, now fetches $50, down from $150 a week ago.
One of the biggest businesses is in Somali passports. For $50, anyone can choose from stacks of green passports, complete with stamps and an empty plasticized square for a photograph.
Money-changers worked the alleyways, calculators in one hand, thick wads of $100 bills in the other, calling out "Dollars! Dollars!" But aside from the armed men who guarded them, neither the money-changers nor the other merchants who aggressively hawked their wares would have attracted unusual attention had they been placed in a bazaar anywhere else in the Islamic world.
The market also reflects another return to normalcy -- the first successful Somali harvest in two years. Vendors serve fresh lemonade, grapefruit and watermelon juice. Rickety wooden carts stacked with green mangoes slide through the thick mud of the alleys.
 
A Woman Dragged Away
 Since American troops arrived in Mogadishu last week, thousands of Somalis have gathered on the streets or perched in trees to stare at the passing soldiers. For the most part, they have been friendly and curious. But in this unpredictable city, this too can change in an instant.
When a Somali woman got out of a jeep full of French soldiers today outside a hotel where more than 100 foreign journalists are staying, the crowd of mostly men, angry at her for being with foreigners, reacted like wildfire. Shouting, they quickly surrounded her and threw her to the ground. Some men stomped and kicked her, while others tore off her clothes and hit her in the head with sticks.
She pulled out a knife and managed to stab one of her attackers before the weapon was wrestled away from her. Then the men dragged her by her hair into a nearby compound as they threw stones at passing photographers.
The attack was witnessed by journalists on the roof of the hotel, and French Foreign Legionnaires watched from the roof of another building. But neither the French troops nor passing American marines intervened.
People in the crowd later said the woman was attacked because she was accused of being a prostitute. No one knew what had happened to her after she was dragged out of sight.
It was all over in 10 minutes, and then the crowd returned to soldier-watching.

HEADLINE: Must U.S. Strip a Land of Guns?

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia, Dec. 14

 BODY:
The question of disarmament has become a touchy subject in the American-led military intervention in Somalia, where an abundance of weaponry creates a risky environment for the soldiers and casts doubt on a peaceful future for Somalia.
It is the guns that largely caused the famine, stalled the United Nations relief efforts and thus brought the Americans ashore in what many Somalis hope will be a rescue not only from their hunger but from the weapons many of them traditionally carry. 
 But how far are Americans prepared to go in disarming Somalis? Do Somalis want to be disarmed? And if the Americans do not disarm them, will the mission to help Somalis become self-sufficient have been worth it?
The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, suggested over the weekend that the operation would fail if Somalia was not disarmed and said the Bush Administration had promised to do so, even though such language was not in the Security Council resolution authorizing this operation.
[In Washington, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, denied that the United States promised disarmament. "Our mission has always been that we would collect arms as they became available and as we encountered them," he said. "But disarmament was not a stated part of our mission and that has not changed."]
[ At the United Nations, Mr. Boutros-Ghali also held his ground. "Disarmament is very important to provide the security which will allow us to replace the unified command with a peacekeeping operation," he said. "The point of view of the United Nations, the point of view of the Security Council is that disarmament is a prerequisite."]
American officials here stood behind the Administration. "Disarming is a massive undertaking," Lieut. Gen. Robert B. Johnston, the commander here said. "Someone has to change my mission before we tackle that one."
American officials say they are concerned that the troops might be endangered if they began large-scale confiscation of weapons.
Military officials here said they are operating under a policy that calls for disarming Somalis when they present a threat to American military personnel. Beyond that, the Americans appear to be encouraging disarmament rather than enforcing it.
 
A Practical Impossibility
 The risk to American troops and the practical impossibility of disarming an entire nation of 4.5 to 6 million people are only some of the considerations, American officials said. Just as importantly, they said, many Somalis would object.
The Americans are here on a mission to alleviate suffering and are doing everything they can to present themselves as a friendly, not hostile, force. Thus, the Americans suggest, they are being sensitive to the Somalis' right to bear arms.
"There are three things important to a Somali -- his wife, his camel and his weapon," said President Bush's special envoy to Somalia, Robert B. Oakley. "In the Somali soul there is the right to have a weapon. So when they hear foreigners are taking weapons by force, they say, 'No, never.' "
House-to-house searches, Mr. Oakley said, would be "absurd." He said, "the Somalis would see it as rank colonialism."
 
A War of Persuasion
 Mr. Oakley, who was Ambassador here from 1982 to 1984, said that the Americans were concentrating on finding a way to get most of the heavy weapons off the streets and into compounds.
The biggest challenge is to persuade the leaders of the clan-based Somali factions to put their armed vehicles -- souped-up jeeps with mounted anti-aircraft guns or recoilless rifles -- into walled compounds.
Last Friday, Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid and Mohammed Ali Mahdi, the leaders of the two strongest clan factions, promised to corral their armed vehicles within 48 hours. But that was an ambitious timetable, one that failed to account for the unemployed young boys from the bush who have manned the vehicles.
Other ideas being discussed are "incentive programs" or the exchange of guns for food. But with so much looted food available to people with guns it seemed unlikely that food would be an attractive lure, aid officials said.
 
Weary of Weapons
 Somalis, however, suggested a tougher approach. Ahmed Jama, a former national police commissioner, has called for a nationwide disarmament program conducted by the Americans in conjunction with the Somali leaders over a period of four to six months.
"Disarmament is not easy but it should be done," Mr. Jama said. "It should be done with the factional leaders and should be total across the country. If you try to disarm in Mogadishu, you are disarming one faction only."
Such an effort was feasible, Mr. Jama said, because "Somalis are sick and tired of these firearms."
The Americans, he said, were the only outside force with the authority and goodwill to accomplish such a task.
On the streets of Mogadishu, the troops' approaches to weaponry have varied. An American helicopter destroyed three vehicles on the ground after it was hit by machine-gun fire. In another case, the Americans avoided confrontation with Osman Ato, the major financier and weapons supplier to General Aidid, leaving a weapons cache they discovered untouched.
This appeared to be in line with mr. Oakley's description of the policy. "We could come in with force and scurf up a lot of weapons," he said. "But it would generate a lot of hostility. We want something that is accepted and will work."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: Political Memo;
Professor-Elect on TV: More Than a Talk Show

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 14

 BODY:
Watching Bill Clinton moderate the first nationally televised economics talk show, Larry King sounded both envious and a little proprietary.
"Bill Clinton is a natural," Mr. King said. "He's just got to learn to move through the call-ins faster. I feel personally responsible for his growth and success. He's promised to appear on my show twice a year. Maybe I won't even have to be there now. Don't forget, he's a young man. He'll be looking for work in eight years, and I can see us going head to head: 'Larry King Live' and 'Bill Clinton Live.' " 
 Actually, the future is now. After an election year dominated by talk-show politics, Mr. Clinton took the medium one step further today. The first day of his televised economic conference here was more than just another campaign town hall meeting to gin up support for the Clinton agenda.
 
Experiment in Education
 Mr. Clinton used the talk-show format in the service of something larger than the partisan political sound bite. His program was an experiment in political education, a President-elect as seminar leader, employing not just the bully pulpit, but the bully blackboard.
"I am used to teaching large classes but this is ridiculous," said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, as he was introduced by Mr. Clinton to kick off what amounted to a national session of Economics 101, broadcast over C-Span and National Public Radio, and from time to time by the Cable News Network.
It was impossible to imagine George Bush -- or even Ronald Reagan -- playing the same role of moderator, questioner and teacher as Mr. Clinton did today. Seemingly off the top of his head, he discussed variations in immunization rates for children in different states, and in another breath, the contrasts in hospital costs between Harlem and the rest of Manhattan.
 
'Teleprompter in His Head'
 "You watch Bill Clinton and you think he has a Teleprompter in his head and he's just reading from it," said Vernon E. Jordan, chairman of Mr. Clinton's transition board.
But while this conference showcased Mr. Clinton's professorial talents it is not clear how much the American viewing audience actually learned. At its worst, the discussion bounced from subject to subject, much like a graduate seminar in which each student tries to make a pet point, with no one putting it all together or paying attention to what the last person said.
None of it seemed to bother Mr. Clinton, probably because this conference for him was not just a discussion of economics. It also was a matter of politics. What Mr. Clinton wanted most out of it, aides said, was not a report on the state of the economy, not an agreement on a specific economic recovery plan. He basically knows what he is going to do already.
He was trying to create a political mood -- a nationwide consensus that the economy is in a structural decline. He also seemed to be trying to persuade Americans that their President-elect is working on it, but that no one should expect a quick fix, and that Congress should roll over and pass whatever economic recovery program Mr. Clinton proposes.
 
Word-of-Mouth Economics
 "Just think of the ripple effect," said his communications director, George Stephanopoulos. "Even people just scanning channels will see their President-elect working on the problem they care most about, let alone the people watching all day. And the people here will go back and talk about the issues we're talking about."
At its best -- and that was only in spurts -- the first day of the conference was educational. At one point, Mr. Clinton, his reading glasses perched on the end of his nose like an Oxford don, evocatively translated a detailed presentation on health care costs by Stuart Altman, a professor at Brandeis University, in a few brief sentences.
"I just want to reinforce the point he made," said Mr. Clinton, "so that you get some sense of what an incredible downward spiral we're in. Because more costs keep being shifted to the private sector, more private sector people stop insuring their employees.
"We are literally now up to 100,000 Americans a month losing their health insurance. An enormous percentage of them then qualify for state Medicaid benefits. Then, as soon as they trigger that in, that aggravates the Federal deficit. And since states can't run a deficit, they all go out and either underfund education, or underfund childrens's investment programs, or raise taxes, and that takes money way from other kinds of investments."
 
Fluffing the Plumage
 The first day of the conference also was a nationally televised job audition for the sub-Cabinet posts that Mr. Clinton still has not filled. Like peacocks on audition, several speakers fluffed their intellectual plumage for Mr. Clinton. Others were not shy about endorsing Mr. Clinton's views.
"You were so right," said Michael Porter, a professor at Harvard Business School, after Mr. Clinton discussed his ideas about increasing private investment.
In just a few weeks, Mr. Clinton will have to stop educating the public about problems and start selling some concrete solutions to Congress. But for today, as one aide said, "he was in policy wonk heaven" and clearly relished breaking new ground as a Presidential professor.
As the morning ended, Mr. Clinton told the assemblage, "I wish I could cancel lunch and just keep doing this, but you'd never forgive me."

Romania's Monuments Make Strange Bedfellows

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SIBIU, Romania

 BODY:
Like mushrooms in the surrounding forests, monuments to those who were killed in the anti-Communist revolution of December 1989 have sprung up all over this Transylvanian city.
On the Great Market Square, two plaques, incongruously attached to a statue of a 19th-century Romanian educator, recall the names of 64 men and women who were shot by the military and the police in the rising that ousted President Nicolae Ceausescu. 
 Not far away, a massive construction of black and white marble and a large cross pay tribute to 25 police officers who died in a battle between the two uniformed forces of the old Communist Government. The army, too, has put up a monument to honor six of its men who fell in this city, which Germans founded in the 12th century and still call Hermannstadt.
Each memorial describes the dead -- those who rose against the Ceausescu Government and those who died in its defense -- as "heroes" of the revolution in Sibiu, which was a center of the rebellion perhaps because Nicu Ceausescu, the dictator's son, headed the regional Communist Party.
 
Uprising's Origins Questioned
 Here and elsewhere in Romania, opponents of President Ion Iliescu say this attitude of indiscriminate elevation to heroic status of all who died here is indicative of the Government's unwillingness to give a clear account of Mr. Ceausescu's overthrow and its origins.
Since Mr. Iliescu was a top Communist official until he fell afoul of Mr. Ceausescu, many opponents regard the dictator's overthrow as an internal Communist struggle.
"Nobody told us yet who were the ones who did it," said Marius Gheorghiu, who writes for 21 Radical, an opposition daily. "As long as justice doesn't want to find out, I believe it was a coup d'etat."
Thomas Nagler, a history professor at Sibiu University, said the situation recalled the attitude of Nazis in Germany after World War II. "Hitler alone was guilty," he said. "All the others were good."
 
Iliescu Urges Reconciliation
 In an interview in Bucharest, the capital, Mr. Iliescu said it was hard to shed light on "so many bloody and violent events at a time when danger of total chaos and total anarchy" prevailed. "Look how hard the United States finds it even today to say who killed Kennedy," he said.
"For the life of the country it is wisest to proclaim a general reconciliation and to consider all as victims," Mr. Iliescu said.
The overthrow of Mr. Ceausescu has brought free speech for citizens and free markets for peddlers in this city of 170,000, but it has not eradicated the blight of widespread poverty.
Eight thousand are unemployed, Mayor Sorin Serbu said, and the 15,000 who live on pensions receive an average of 6,000 to 7,000 lei a month, about $14 to $16 at the official rate. The Mayor said about 10,000 lei, or $23, was needed for basic necessities.
Perhaps because of the economy, in the presidential runoff elections last October, Sibiu reversed the national trend by giving about 60 percent of its votes to Mr. Iliescu's opponent, Emil Constantinescu.
The Dumbrava department store, the city's main shopping center, is a dispiriting place of closed-off sections, half-empty clothes racks and barren shelves and display cases.
There are few goods, said Ramona Mesesan, a 24-year-old sales clerk, because suppliers insist on immediate cash payment, and Dumbrava has no cash. "I have not had my full pay for three months," she said. "Instead of 14,000 lei, I got 6,000."
 
Ethnic Germans Emigrate
 Miss Mesesan lives with her parents, both of whom still work. But as factory after factory reduces production, and agriculture, back in private hands, limps along at a fraction of its former output, fear of unemployment grips Sibiu and most Romanian cities.
The small staff at 21 Radical, named after the day in December on which the revolution broke out, has reduced its wages to 12,000 lei a month to keep the paper alive, Mr. Gheorghiu said. "The spirit keeps us alive," he said, "but sometimes you have to eat, too."
Asked whether any one actually went hungry in Sibiu, the journalist lowered his head, hesitated and then said softly, "I do."
Paradoxically, one of the most favored groups, because of substantial aid from Germany, is the most melancholy. They are the ethnic Germans. In 1938, 40,000 of Sibiu's population of 48,000 was German. In 1968, before West Germany negotiated their right to emigrate, in return for payments to the Ceausescu Government, 20,000 lived here. At the time of the revolution, 15,000 remained.
Today, there are only 2,000, said Professor Nagler, who is director of the Institute for Social Sciences of the Romanian Academy here. "There is no more confidence in Romania," Professor Nagler said. "When is the next dictatorship coming?"
Here and in many of the surrounding villages, the houses the Germans left behind are occupied by ethnic Romanians and Gypsies. "The new settlers no longer identify with the town," the professor said, offering homemade plum brandy in the comfortable living room of a house in the nearby village of Cisnadioara, which he keeps for a friend who has emigrated. "It is falling apart."
"I feel very alien in my hometown," the historian said.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Clinton Leads Experts in Discussion on Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 14

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton led an elaborate daylong seminar today in which some of the nation's most prominent economists and business executives presented the case that the American economy is badly crippled and in danger of becoming much worse.
Before more than 300 invited guests and a national television audience, Mr. Clinton showed himself once again to have mastered some of the most arcane aspects of Government policy and to be conversant with the kinds of complicated economic issues often confined to graduate-school classrooms. 
 For nearly 10 hours, he sat in a swivel chair at the head of a large oval arrangement of tables at the downtown convention center here, taking notes, asking questions and offering his views about topics ranging from the declining military industry to rising health costs, from public works projects at home to international trade policy. [Excerpts, page B10.]
When the discussion began to drift, the President-elect brought it back to the point he seemed most determined to drive home: recent encouraging statistics indicating that the economy is beginning to rebound should not blind the country to the need for fundamental changes intended to create prosperity over the long haul.
"As we address short-term business cycle issues, we must never forget that the most profound problems of our economy are longer-term and structural," Mr. Clinton said. "Many of the problems did not develop overnight. We cannot expect to solve them overnight."
No new substantive ground was broken either in terms of the problems or of Mr. Clinton's positions. The grim statistics the economists provided about the slow rate of economic growth, the staggering deficit, rising health costs and other problems are familiar to economists and politicians and were staples of this year's election campaign.
 
Focusing on the Problems
 And Mr. Clinton did not go beyond the stands he took during the campaign, giving no clue, for instance, whether he would continue to advocate a tax cut for the middle class or how his health-care program would work or how much he would be willing to adopt trade restrictions to help specific American industries. Today's session, which began at 9 A.M. and ended well past dinner time, with Mr. Clinton moderating the discussion to the end, focused almost entirely on economic problems. Tuesday's session will focus on solutions.
But the setting today was intended to present to the American public Mr. Clinton's position that 12 years of Republican rule have left the economy in a mess and that the situation demands changes in basic structures, not just tinkering. And most of all it gave Mr. Clinton an opportunity about midway between the election and Inauguration Day to remind Americans that he is completely engaged in dealing with the economy.
Mr. Clinton was periodically joined in questioning some of the economists and executives by Vice President-elect Al Gore and the top members of the economic team Mr. Clinton announced last week, Treasury Secretary-designate Lloyd Bentsen and Representative Leon E. Panetta, who is to be budget director. Hillary Clinton sat through the sessions but did not participate.
Today Mr. Clinton asked the Arkansas Health Director, Dr. Joycelyn Elders, to become United States Surgeon General, and she accepted, a transition official said. His aides said he was close to naming Secretaries of State and Defense. Warren M. Christopher, the transition director, remained the leading candidate for Secretary of State and Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin was said to head the field for the Pentagon post.
Mr. Clinton is also considering naming a younger and more politically experienced Deputy Secretary of State, his advisers said, to balance the 67-year-old Mr. Christopher, a corporate lawyer who himself was Deputy Secretary of State in the Carter Administration. One person in contention is former Representative Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn, who lost his race for re-election this year.
 
Carefully Staged Conference
 The two-day economic conference that opened today was carefully staged. The economists who spoke were limited to those who supported Mr. Clinton in the campaign or at least adopted his basic stands. Not only was there not a supply-sider in the lot, there was not even one advocating the basic Republican precept of low taxes and small government.
The business executives, representing giant corporations and family businesses, were almost uniformly from prosperous, growing companies. Those like the General Motors Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation that are laying off workers by the thousands were not represented.
The sessions were carried live on C-Span, CNN and National Public Radio, and the radio network provided its equipment so that viewers and listeners around the country could call in and question Mr. Clinton. A team from Apple Computer designed elaborate charts and graphs that were used by the panelists and shown on television.
The overall cost of the conference, like the rental of the convention center, was picked up by the Democratic National Committee, and almost all the participants paid their own way.
 
Summary of the Economy
 The morning began with a detailed presentation by Robert M. Solow, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1987. He showed how the current recovery is much slower than most previous ones, how private employment has hardly grown in the last four years, how the rate of productivity in the United States has slowed markedly, how family income has been rising at a slow pace and how the gap between the rich and the poor in America has widened.
"This is not just a short-term glitch," Mr. Solow said.
Although a variety of perspectives was offered, particularly on international trade, Mr. Clinton and his panelists seemed determined not to challenge one another or raise sore points.
One example was the response to Harold A. Poling, chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, who gave a detailed presentation about how much rising medical costs are hampering his company. Rattling off facts and figures, Mr. Poling said that Ford spends 20 percent of its payroll on health care, more money than is spent on steel, putting his company at a serious disadvantage with its Japanese competitors who spend $500 less on health costs for every car built.
Mr. Clinton, as he did with all the participants, listened intently and then asked a perceptive question about the fraction of Ford's health costs that are spent on retired workers. But the President-elect did not point out, what he doubtless knows, that Ford gives its executives even more generous health benefits than the rank-and-file workers get.
 
Sophisticated Questions
 Still, Mr. Clinton's questions for the most part were sophisticated. He asked John Sculley, the chairman and chief executive of Apple Computers, whether the high rate of growth and increase in productivity in Japan and Germany resulted from the fact that their markets are more closed than America's. In part, Mr. Sculley said, but the United States should stick with free trade.
He discussed with Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, the most cost-effective means of immunizing poor children against disease.
He asked Glen S. Fukushima, director of market development for A.T.& T. in Japan, whether Japan had trade surpluses with any other Asian countries. Yes, in some, but only because of raw materials.
And at one point, in a grasp of minutiae that left jaws agape, he told a call-in questioner that civilian aviation technology was one of the seven or eight areas that would provide the largest increase in jobs in the decades ahead.
Mr. Clinton was clearly enthusiastic about some policy proposals. For example, Alicia Haydock Munnell, senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, suggested that the Federal budget be divided between a capital budget and an operating budget. The former would include items to be used over a long period like mass transit projects and sewer systems, and borrowing would be permitted. The operating budget would cover items like payrolls and Medicare payments and would run on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Mr. Clinton's eyes widened. "This is a matter of no small moment," he declared. "This is a major issue in the politics and Government of your country."
